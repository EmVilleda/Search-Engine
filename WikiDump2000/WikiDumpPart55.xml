Note that ''quitter'' must be followed by a direct object, usually a room or building.

== {{French/Section|Usage notes|To reside|Habiter}} ==

{{fr|Habiter|IPA=/a.bi.te/|audio=Fr-habiter.ogg}}, meaning ''to inhabit'', ''to dwell'', or ''to reside'', is used to say in what city or area you live:
: {{fr|Où habitez-vous ? J'habite à Paris.|en=Where do you live? I live in Paris.}}
: {{fr|Ils habitent à la ville, mais nous habitons à la campagne.|en=They live in the city, but we live in the country.}}
: {{fr|Ils habitent en ville, mais nous habitons en banlieue.|en=They live downtown, but we live in the suburb.}}

''Habiter'' is also used more specifically:
: {{fr|L’homme habite un appartement crasseux et sombre.|en=The man lives in a dirty, dark apartment.}}
: {{fr|Elle habite dans une maison neuve.|en=She lives in a new house.}}

''Habiter rue …'' is used to state on what street a person lives:
: {{fr|J'habite Rue Lecourbe.|en=I live on Lecourbe Street.}}
: {{fr|Il habite Rue de Rennes.|en=He lives on Rennes Street.}}

''Habiter'' refers to occupying a location, and does not mean ''to live'' more generally. (The irregular ''vivre'' is used instead.)

== {{French/Section|Grammar|To do|Faire}} ==

The verb ''faire'' is translated to ''to do'' or ''to make''. It is irregularly conjugated (it does not count as a regular ''-re'' verb).

== {{French/Section|Grammar|Object pronouns ''me'', ''te'', ''nous'', and ''vous''}} ==

The direct object pronouns ''me'', ''te'', ''nous'', and ''vous'' mean ''me'', ''you'', and ''us'':
: {{fr|Il te donne un livre.|en=He's giving you a book.}}

''Me'', ''te'', ''nous'', and ''vous'' are also indirect object pronouns, and mean ''to me'', ''to you'', and ''to us'':
: {{fr|Ils nous parlent.|en=They're speaking to us.}}

These pronouns come before the verb they modify:
: {{fr|Il vous aime.|en=He likes you.}}
: {{fr|Il aime vous parler.|en=He likes to talk to you.}}

''Me'' becomes ''m&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' and ''te'' becomes ''t&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' before a vowel:
: {{fr|Il t'aime.|en=He likes you.}}
: {{fr|Il aime t'écouter.|en=He likes to listen to you.}}

=== Summary ===
{| {{French/Translations table|audio=French/Grammar/Me, te, nous, and vous.ogg}}
| ''me'' || {{fr/IPA|/mə/ (''muh'')|audio=Fr-me.ogg}} || me, to me || 
|-
| ''te'' || {{fr/IPA|/tə/ (''tuh'')|audio=Fr-te.ogg}} || you, to you || singular and informal
|-
| ''nous'' || {{fr/IPA|/nu/ (''noo'')|audio=Fr-nous.ogg}} || us, to us || 
|-
| ''vous'' || {{fr/IPA|/vu/ (''voo'')|audio=Fr-vous.ogg}} || you, to you || plural or formal
|}

=== Examples ===

{| {{French/Translations table|audio=French/Grammar/Examples with me, te, nous, and vous.ogg}}
| Il te cite souvent. ||  || He often quotes you.
|-
| Je t’envie. ||  || I envy you.

== {{French/Section|Usage notes|In|Dans|supplementary-id=french-dans-usage-notes}} ==
&lt;div id='french-dans-usage-notes'&gt;
The preposition {{fr|dans|IPA=/dɑ̃/|audio=Fr-dans.ogg}} means ''in'' or ''into'', in the sense of ''inside'', ''from outside'', or ''to inside'':
: {{fr|Il habite dans le quartier le plus riche de Paris.|en=He lives in (inside) the richest district of Paris.}}

{{fr|Dans}} also means ''in'' in the sense of ''within a period of time'':
: {{fr|Il fait deux fois plus d’ouvrage que son frère dans le même temps.|en=He does two times more work than his brother in the same time.}}

As in English, {{fr|dans}} describes abstract situations and state:
: {{fr|Il est dans les larmes.|en=He is in tears.}}

{{fr|Dans}} can also mean ''out of'' or ''from'':
: {{fr|Il prend le beurre dans le réfrigérateur.|en=He takes the butter out of the refrigerator.}}

The preposition {{fr|en}} is used instead to indicate ''in'' in other senses.

The lesson says about the preterite: &quot;...note that the nosotros form is the same as in the present tense...&quot;. Then it gives the example verb &quot;comer&quot;. the preterite for &quot;nosotros&quot; is &quot;comimos&quot;, but the present tense is &quot;comemos&quot;, with ''E''.

Thanks for pointing that out OASO. I've qualified the statement so that it refers to '''-ar''' and '''-ir''' verbs only. [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas Strohmann]]</text>

'''Romanian''' is a Romance language spoken mainly in [[w:Romania|Romania]] and [[w:Moldova|Moldova]], as well as in some parts of [[w:Hungary|Hungary]], [[w:Serbia|Serbia]], [[w:Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and [[w:Ukraine|Ukraine]]. It is part of the '''Romance''' group of the [[w:Indoeuropean|Indoeuropean]] family of languages. It is easiest to learn if someone already knows a related language such as Spanish, Catalan, French, Galician, Portuguese or Italian.

The most closely related are the other Romance languages, [[w:Italian language|Italian]] being the closest, but any knowledge of Spanish, French, Galician or Portuguese might be very useful, especially because of the lexical and vocabulary similarities and the grammatical structure. A bit of knowledge of the Latin grammar might be useful as well.

Even more distant Indo-European languages have many similarities in both grammar and even common words, as many languages, like English have borrowed extensively words from Latin.

It is useful to know the language if travelling in Romania, especially in rural areas.  Many people who know English and Romanian will understand any of its relatives, especially Spanish, French or Italian. 

Note that in Romanian, there is a formal and informal form when addressing people. The informal is '''tu''' (you - singular) and '''voi''' (also you - plural). Use '''tu''' when addressing friends or people you know well. When addressing strangers, use '''Dumneavoastr&amp;#259;''' or '''v&amp;#259;'''. Dumneavoastr&amp;#259; is used for stressed pronouns, which are optional, ''v&amp;#259;'' is used for non-stressed pronouns, which are mandatory for direct and indirect objects.  For instance, '''V&amp;#259; multumesc''' means &quot;Thank you&quot; (accusative case, direct object), and '''V&amp;#259; dau un telefon''' means &quot;I telephone (to) you&quot; (dative case, indirect object) The formal form of address requires the second person plural form of the verb at all times, even when addressing a single person. (This is similar to the French construction, and, to an extent, German.) Using the singular form can be considered rude or even insulting.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hey Oaso, glad to have you on board. I had a buddy from Guatemala .. sounds like you guys had it pretty rough with some of your presidents. 

Do you have capability to record stuff in the OGG file format ? Its a bit obscure but would be ideal for the site because we try to use all open source solutions, and the OGG format is the open source sound file format. By the way, your English sounds very good. 

:Of course I can record in OGG. I can record in Speex too, as I have experimented with them a lot.

Hi Oaso. I've just look over your comments page and I'd like to make a suggestion. Firstly I know nothing of Spanish so I can't agree of disagree with your comments but I would advise you to just go ahead and make the changes to the lessons. I know it's a bit daunting to just change other peoples work, but really that's the whole point of this site! Just go ahead and improve the lessons directly. That is a much more constructive use of your time than writing out comments. Don't worry about others not agreeing with you. They can very easily revert any changes you make with a couple of clicks, so you won't ruin anything, and nobody will hate you :-)   [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 14:36, 12 Nov 2003 (UTC)

:Thanks for the advise. The problem is that I don't have enough on-line time to do all the changes. I use a dial-up connection and the telephone service is not a cheap thing in Guatemala. That's why I downloaded all the lessons, saved them in my hard disk, then I review them, write the comments and upload the whole thing so someone else do the changes. Also there are some things that are meant for discussion.

[[User:Oaso|Oaso]] 21:26, 12 Nov 2003 (UTC)

::The phone costs are quite understanable Oaso, I'm really glad for all your suggestions and I'll put them into the pages as good as I can. One option that might work also is that you click on an edit-page of a text and copy all the plain text to your hard disk. Then you can go off-line and make all the changes to the plain text. When you are done you can go online again and simply paste your editted version in (I use that strategy often, not so much because of phone costs but because sometimes the wiki server is down and all the edits will be gone if they are not saved on my harddisk). But in any case, if you want to keep writing comment pages that's fine for me, I appreciate all your feedback for the Spanish book. Thanks! [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]</text>

==Confusion==

Actually, after the initial confusion I realized that it was a good idea for people who don't look at other wikis very often. [[User:Perl|Perl]] 02:01, 20 Apr 2004 (UTC)

==Russian Wikibooks==
Hello, Angela. Thank you for responding so quickly to my request for 'crat'ship. I have some questions:
# How can I edit the MediaWiki namespace (or whatever you call it)? E.g. if I want to change &quot;''Wikibooks:Help''&quot; to &quot;''Викиучебник:Help''&quot;.
# Would it be better (I heard it works faster) to edit LanguageRu.php instead of the namespace?
#* If yes, how can I do that?&lt;br /&gt;[[:ru:Участник:Ramir]]. (someone has changed the ''User:'' namespace name!)

== Wikiversity ==

Sincere apologies if I've caused a problem, but hopefully the repercussions should be minimal.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are '''six''' different types of syllables in the English language.

#'''Closed:''' ends in a consonant, has a '''short''' vowel sound
#'''Open:''' does '''not''' end in a '''consonant''', has a '''long''' vowel sound  
#'''Vowel-consonant-&quot;E&quot;:''' This syllable is only found at the end of a word. The final &quot;e&quot; is silent and makes next vowel before it long. 
#'''Diphthong:''' two vowels next to each other that together create a new sound and '''Vowel team:''' two pronounced vowels next to each other
#'''Consonant-&quot;LE&quot;:''' 
#''' Power-&quot;R&quot;:''' a syllable where a vowel is followed by the letter &quot;r&quot;. The &quot;r&quot; takes control of the vowel and changes the way that it is pronounced. 

'''Schwa:''' This can end in a consonant or not, and is an unemphasized syllable whose vowel is somewhat swallowed and pronounced like &quot;uh&quot;. Other syllable types can be reclassified as a schwa based on experience of how a word is regionally pronounced. 

In a dictionary, the schwa sound is written like an upside-down, lower case &quot;e&quot;.

==Long and short vowels==
Long vowels are the same sound as the name of the vowel, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, and &quot;u&quot;. 

Short vowels are the hardest vowel sounds to pronounce in English. &quot;ah&quot; as in cat, &quot;eh&quot; as in pet, &quot;ih&quot; as in sit, &quot;oo&quot; as in not, &quot;uh&quot; as in nut.

So far we have looked at the effect of putting a current in a magnetic field and seeing that there is a force on the wire that carries the current. On this page we will look at a related effect known as ''induction''.

The best way to learn about induction is to consider the results of a simple experiment. In fact if your school has a spot galvanometer, you should really take a look at these results ''in the flesh''. Otherwise you'll just have to take my word for it.

==Experimental set up to demonstrate induction==


Look at the diagram below. A coil of wire (solenoid) is attached to the inputs of a spot galvanometer. The solenoid can be made by winding a piece of plastic coated wire a round a paper tube. 

A spot galvanometer (also known as a mirror galvanometer) looks like a fancy piece of kit, and it is pretty fancy, delicate and expensive, but it does a very simple job. It's really just a very sensitive ammeter. It measures current just like any other ammeter but is much more sensitive than the normal sort you usually see. It can detect ''tiny'' currents.

The only other thing that is needed is an ordinary bar magnet.





[[Image:Induction_shown_on_a_spot_galvanometer.png]]

===Experimental results===

So, once the apparatus has been set up as in the diagram above, we can look and see what happens.



{| align=&quot;center&quot; bgcolor=&quot;ededff&quot; border=&quot;1&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot; | '''&lt;font face=&quot;arial&quot;&gt; What was done&lt;/font&gt;'''
| style=&quot;background:#efefef;&quot; | '''&lt;font face=&quot;arial&quot;&gt;What was observed to happen &lt;/font&gt;'''
|-
| The magnet is moved ''into'' the coil.
| The spot deflects to the left indicating that a small current is flowing.
|-
|-
| The magnet is left inside the coil.
| The spot comes back to the middle showing the that no current is flowing.
|-
| The magnet is pulled out of the coil.
| The spot deflects to the right indicating that there is a current flowing again but this time in the opposite direction.
|-
| The experiment is repeated except this time the magnet is inserted into the coil very slowly.
| There is still a deflection but this time it's much less than before indicating a smaller current is flowing.
|-
| The magnet is turned around.
| The results are the same as above except the deflections are reversed.
|-
| The magnet is kept still but the coil is moved.
| The results are as above.
|}

===Conclusions===
#If there is relative ''movement'' between a coil of wire and a magnet, there will be a current induced in the coil.
#The faster the movement the bigger the current.
#Reversing the magnet, or the direction of movement reverses the direction of the induced current.

'''Q1)''' What effect will reversing the magnet '''and''' the direction of movement have on any induced current ?

==Theoretic explanation of what's going on (Advanced)==
So now we know what happens we have to come up with an explanation. Look at the diagram below.


[[Image:Induction_in_a_wire_crossing_a_magnetic_field.png]]

In this diagram the green line represents a wire that is going into the screen or page. It is at right angles to the magnetic field between the two bar magnets. The is moved downwards so that it &quot;cuts&quot; the field lines. This induces an e.m.f. (voltage) across the length of wire. It is this e.m.f. that causes a current to flow if a complete circuit is made. So now we know why you get a current. It's caused by the induced voltage, but why do you get a voltage?

Look at the diagram below. 


[[Image:Induction_in_a_wire_magnified_view.png]]

This is a close up of the wire seen end on. The blue circles represent where the magnetic field lines stick out of the screen or page. They are coming straight out of the screen. 

The wire is made of a metal and so has many free electrons. As the wire moves downwards each individual electron travels downwards too. They effectively form loads of little current flowing down. From the motor effect we know that if a current flows in a magnetic field there will be a force. in this case the force pushes the electrons to the right. It is the electrons all moving up to the right end of the wire that causes the voltage difference.

So you see, Induction is really the motor effect.

'''Q2)''' A student uses a stronger magnet. What effect do you think this will have on any induced current?

'''Q3)''' Imagine more than one loop of wire cutting through the magnetic field.Each loop of wire has its own e.m.f. induced on it. If the wires are joined up, it's as if they are little cells in series. Fill in the blanks &quot;&lt;font color=aa22aa&quot;&gt; '''As the number of windings on the solenoid ''increases'' the value of the induced voltage ______________.'''&lt;/font&gt;

'''Q4)''' An engineer want's to uses the induction to create electrcity. He gets a couple of students to push an enormous magnet into and out of a huge coil (he uses a whip to make 'em go fast). In what way will the electricity that this set up produces be different to a the electricity produced by a battery?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Transformers are devices that use induction to transform a high a.c. voltage to a low one or vice versa. They are incredibly important devices, and (even more importantly) they are examiners' favourites. On this page you will be looking at how a transformer works and how they are used. You will also be given some practice in using some simple equations that let you work out what the output voltage and current must be.

==How a transformer works== 

There is nothing new to learn in this section. You've already covered [[GCSE Science/Magnetic effects of a current]] and [[GCSE Science/Induction]]. This section used ideas from those two pages to understand a transformer.

The simplest transformer consists of a soft iron core with two coils of wire independently wrapped around it. The first coil called the ''primary coil'' is connected to an a.c. power supply. The other coil, called the ''secondary coil'' is connected to the output.

The current in the primary coil causes a magnetic field. It's just an electromagnet but because the current is a.c. the magnetic field is constantly changing. If we consider one end of the soft iron core, it's first a north pole, then the field gets weaker and weaker until it becomes zero, then it starts to build up and the end becomes a south pole. The process repeats and the end becomes a north pole again.

Now let's think about what is going on in the secondary coil. The magnetic field of the first coil passes right through the secondary coil, what's more the field is constantly changing. This changing field induces a current in the secondary coil. So even though the coils are not physically connected, the current in one, causes the current through the other.

If you imagine the lines of field they appear to pulse as the field grows stronger and weaker. When the field grows weak they sweep inwards cutting the secondary coil.

'''Q1)''' What would the current in the secondary coil be like if you used d.c. in the primary coil? - d.c. in the primary coil will not create any current in the secondary coil.

Transformers are used to change the voltage.  If the number of turns in the secondary coil is greater than the number of turns in the primary coil, then the voltage in the secondary coil will be higher than that in the primary coil.  This is called a ''step-up transformer''.  Conversely, if the secondary coil has fewer turns than the primary coil, then the voltage will be lower, and it is called a ''step-down transformer''.

==A simple demonstration transformer==

Your teacher may show you a demonstration of a transformer. (see [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Making_a_transformer here] for details on how to set up a simple transformer). Look at the diagram below.


The second coil is on a separate soft iron core. This core can be brought up to the primary coil. At large distances the bulb is off, but as the coils are brought closer together they suddenly attract one another (the primary coil is a powerful electromagnet). Once the two cores are stuck together the bulb in the secondary coil starts to glow. The brighness of the bulb depends on the number of turns on the secondary coil. The more windings there are, the brighter the bulb.

==Important equations==
There are two things you need to remember about transformers.

* The '''voltage''' in the secondary coil depends on the voltage in the primary coil ''and'' the ratio of the number of turns in the secondary and primary coils.
: If we call:
** the voltage in and number of turns in the primary V&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub\&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;
** the voltage in and number of turns in the secondary V&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub\&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;
: then 
:::::: V&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;/V&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;= N&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;

: or, rearranging:
:::::: V&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;= V&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; * N&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;

* Similarly, the '''current''' in the secondary coil depends on the current in the primary coil ''and'' the ratio of the number of turns in the secondary and primary coils.  However, the current is inversely related to the number of turns.
: If we call:
** the current in and number of turns in the primary I&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub\&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;
** the current in and number of turns in the secondary I&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub\&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;
: then 
:::::: I&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;/I&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;= N&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;

: or, rearranging:
:::::: I&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;= I&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; * N&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;/N&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;

* The power in the primary is equal to the power in the secondary (assuming a '''perfect''' transformer). This is because energy is never created or destroyed.
:::::: I&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = I&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;V&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;

==Step up and Step down transformers==
Because the voltage in the secondary coil depends on the number of turns, we can use a transformer to ''transform'' one voltage to another. For example let's assume that the primary coil has 300 turns of wire and the secondary coil has 900 turns. This transformer will step up the voltage by a factor of 3. So if the primary coil has 2V applied to it, the secondary coil will have 6V across it.

A step down transformer is the opposite of a step up transformer. Let's say the primary has 900 turns and the secondary has 450 turns. This time the voltage will be half on the secondary as it is on the primary. So if the primary has 2V applied, the secondary will have only 1V across it.

===Strategy for answering questions===
Questions on transformers will often be of the form &quot;A coil has 3000 turns of wire on a soft iron. Another coil of 12000 turns is brought into contact with the first coil. This second coil has a 12V bulb attached to it completing a circuit.What voltage should applied to the first coil?&quot;

to answer a question like this:

# '''Decide which is the primary coil and which is the secondary'''-in this case the 3000 turn coil is the primary and the 12000 turn coil is the secondary
# '''Decide if it is a step up or a step down transformer''' in this case it is a step up transformer because the secondary coil has more turns on it than the primary.
# '''Work out a multiplication factor''' in this case 12000/3000 = 4
# '''Use this multiplication factor to work out the required voltage''' - the secondary coil has to supply 12V so the primary has to be 12V/4 = 3V

==Uses of transformers==

The most important use of transformers is in the routing of mains electricity. The power disspated by a cable = I&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;R, where I is the current and R is the resistance. There is little that can be done to lower the resistance, so in order to lose as little energy as possible in heating up the cable, the current needs to be kept as low as possible. This is done using a step up transformer which increases the voltage to many thousands of volts. Because power is voltage times current, a high voltage means a low current for a given power value.(Notice that transormers do not obey Ohm's law). At the other end of the distribution network, the voltage is stepped down using another transformer so that the voltage going into homes and factories is not excessively high.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I just checked the lessons and I have a couple of suggestions, tips, comments, and whatnot, well, a lot of them. I hope they to help you to improve the quality of this wikibook and your knowledge of the Spanish language. Here they are:

Introduction:

*&lt;b&gt;DONE&lt;/b&gt; &quot;requirement&quot; is misspelled. It has '''G''' instead of '''Q'''.
*&lt;b&gt;DONE&lt;/b&gt; (at least started: [[Pronouncing Spanish words]] --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]) Before the currently available lessons, I think the reader should receive an introduction of the Spanish phonetics and pronunciation (there's a lot to be explained here: the right pronunciation of the consonants G, H, J, L, LL, Q, R, RR, Ñ), as well as the Spanish alphabet and writing system, and of course, the use of the accent.
*After a few lessons there should be another lesson about the syllabic separation of the words, as it's very important for the correct spelling and pronunciation. Until this lesson, every polisyllabic word in Spanish that doesn't have accent should be written like &quot;'''es'''to está en espa'''ñol'''&quot; to let the reader know where to stress the word.
*After some more lessons, or as an appendix, there could be a section where the reader becomes a listener and hears the different accents of Spanish in the world: The Spanish, The Mexican, The Argentinian, etc.
*I notice that only lesson 1 has dialogs. Why? The other lessons should have dialogs too. Everybody loves them! Now, seriously, I think dialogs are at least as useful as all the grammatic descriptions, as they put everything in practice.
*A spanish translation of ALL the english text could be an interesting thing to do, but it might make the pages too overloaded.
*Also I see some mix of Spanish-styled Spanish and American-styled Spanish. This is noticeable in the use of the second person pronouns. I propose to define a standard, so the book looks more homogeneous. If I'm not wrong, here are three main Spanish styles: The Mexican-like (''tú'', ''ustedes''), the Argentinian-like (''vos'', ''ustedes''), and the Spanish-like (''tú'', ''vosotros''). I propose the Mexican-like one, as it's probably the most used (from the USA Latino communities to somewhere by Bolivia, I think). This is only for the dialogs and the examples. The verb conjugation for all styles should be described, even if that means a headache for the reader. An alternative  could be to include all the examples in the three styles, so European people can get used to the Spanish Spanish, and Argentinian don't feel despised.

Lesson 1:

*&lt;b&gt;DONE&lt;/b&gt; I'm not sure about the name ''Gonzales''. In Spanish there is freedom when it comes to names, and there's probably some people called ''Gonzales'', and I'm doubtful about the correctness of the word. I think a better word is ''González'', which is also the name of a place in México.
*&lt;b&gt;DONE&lt;/b&gt; I'm more sure about this one: The last name ''Pérez'' has accent in the first ''E''.
*&lt;b&gt;DONE&lt;/b&gt; I think it's a good idea to give also literal translations, so the reader knows what is he/she really saying. For example, the expression ''Encantado'' actually means ''(I'm) Charmed'', and ''Me llamo...'' means ''I'm called...''.
*In the personal pronouns section, you could add the pronoun ''vos''. It's for the 2 person singular, and it's used in 2 ways:
**the informal one: It's used a lot in Argentina, Chile, etc. I think it's used much more than ''tú'' or ''usted'' there. The conjugation is the same as with ''vosotros'' but removing the ''I'' before the last ''S'', and, if it has more than one syllable, add an accent to the last vowel. Example: &quot;Who are you&quot; -&gt; ''¿Quién sos vos?'' This pronoun is also used a lot here in Guatemala, but it's used only among boys, young men, and between them and their close relatives (a boy and his mother, etc.). It's almost never used by girls, or when a boy talks to a girl, unless she's his sister or if they're really, really close (grew together, etc.). I use it with my mother, father and sisters, but not with my grandparents. It's not used in Spain.
**The formal one: The conjugation is exactly the same as ''vosotros''. Example: &quot;Who are you?&quot; -&gt; ''¿Quién sois vos?'', with &quot;I&quot;. This one is never used in America, unless someone's doing a play of old, old times, and it probably sounds as old as &quot;thou&quot; and &quot;thee&quot; sound at least in American English. I don't know about its usage in Spain.
*&lt;b&gt;DONE&lt;/b&gt; Also in the personal pronouns section: You could explain about the difference between the article ''el'' and the pronoun ''él'', so readers don't confuse the two words.
*One more thing: ''ustedes'' is probably formal only in Spain. The pronouns ''vosotros(as)'' aren't used at all here in Guatemala, and very probably, in all of America.
*&lt;b&gt;DONE&lt;/b&gt; In the grammar section, the verb ''to be'' translates to '''3''' different verbs(!): &quot;''ser''&quot;, &quot;''estar''&quot;, &quot;''haber''&quot;. The last one is used where in English you say ''there is/are'', in Spanish you say &quot;''hay''&quot;. Example: ''There's a fly in my soup!'' -&gt; ''¡Hay una mosca en mi sopa!''.

Lesson 2:

*Gender of nouns: I think it's a good idea to explain that genders belong to the nouns, not to the objects. A common mistake is that people think that because a noun has a masculine article, the object denoted by the noun has some kind of masculine properties, which is false, of course. Then they don't get why both ''el camino'' and ''la vereda'' mean &quot;the way&quot; and have different articles.
*Also I see the word &quot;''caballo''&quot; in the examples, but the pronunciation guide is after the lessons in the index, and it doesn't mention that ''LL'' in Spanish sounds similar to the consonant ''Y'' in English. I've heard more than one people from the USA pronouncing ''llama'' (flame) as ''lah mah'' where it should be more like ''yah mah''.
*The definite article: please don't forget the article &quot;''lo''&quot;, which is used to &quot;convert&quot; adjectives into nouns.
*&lt;b&gt;DONE&lt;/b&gt; The indefinite article: the title has a wrong formating. It has 3 &quot;=&quot; before and 4 after it, so it can't be wikified.
*In the examples, ''Son unos boletos caros'': In the real world one usually omits the word ''unos'', however, it's fine as an example.
*Nationalities: The nationalities are both, adjectives and nouns. So in the examples, ''el hombre mexicano'' = ''el mexicano'', etc. However, when using a nationality as noun, you only mean people, not animals or objects. Also often when people say ''el hombre mexicano'' or any other nationality, they mean all the people of the country.
*&lt;b&gt;DONE&lt;/b&gt; Also, in Spanish the word ''americano'' means from the continent of America, not the USA. This is because in Spanish USA is abbreviated as ''Estados Unidos'' (United States), so the nationality is ''estadounidense'', and it applies to masculine and feminine nouns without changing: ''el hombre estadounidense'', ''la mujer estadounidense''.
Vocabulary-Colors: the adjective ''naranja'', ''gris'', ''marrón'', ''púrpura'', ''verde'' also don't change when describing a noun (''anaranjado'' and ''morado'' do). I think that it can be explained in the section &quot;Grammar III - Matching Adjectives&quot;. Also ''la naranja'' means &quot;the orange&quot; and ''la mora'' means &quot;the blackberry&quot;, so literally ''anaranjado'' = &quot;orange-like&quot; and ''morado'' = &quot;blackberry like&quot;.

Lesson 3:

*''¿Qué hacéis por la noche?'' sounds like a Spanish speaker. An American speaker would say: ''¿Qué hacen por la noche?'', or since he's talking about the future, ''¿Qué harán por la noche?'' for American, and ''¿Qué haréis por la noche?'' for Spanish.
*&lt;b&gt;DONE&lt;/b&gt; ''Mañana practico el tenis.'' - The article ''el'' is usually dropped in this case, just like in English.
*In the vocabulary, the article is missing in the English part, ''la noche'' means ''the night'', not just ''night'' alone. Same goes for next lessons.
*The verb ''hacer'' and the weather: the verb ''haber'' can be used the same way (''hace buen tiempo'' = ''hay buen tiempo''). The expression ''Hace fresco'' doesn't sound right. This is because the words ''tiempo'', ''frío'', ''calor'', ''sol'', ''viento'' are nouns, but ''fresco'' is an adjetive that means &quot;at a lower temperature than usual&quot;. It's also a noun in America (''el fresco'' or ''el refresco''), but then it means &quot;a cold drink&quot;. The phrases literally mean &quot;It's making...&quot; or ''It makes'' and are similar to when one says &quot;It's raining&quot; (nobody rains, or &quot;makes the wind&quot;, but it's only an expression).

Lesson 4:

*&lt;b&gt;DONE&lt;/b&gt; ''seguir'' also means &quot;to continue&quot;. ''volver'' also means &quot;to turn&quot;.

Lesson 5:

*''Tú eres de México.'' -&gt; ''Eres de México.'' It's unusual to mention the pronoun here, as ''eres'' implies ''tú''.
*''¿Eres tú de México? '' -&gt; ''¿Eres de México?'' It's even more unusual here.
*''¿Cómo...?'' = How...?; ''¿Qué...?' = What...? This explains ''¿Por qué...?'': For what (reason)...?
*''¿Cómo te llamas?'' can also mean &quot;How are you called?&quot;
*''Alberto estudia tanto como Felicitas.'' - ¿Felicitas? Now that's a really, really weird name!
*Superlatives: Spanish uses ''el X más Y'' for &quot;the most Y X&quot; and ''el X menos Y'' for &quot;the least Y X&quot;, not only ''más'' and ''menos''. ''más'' literally means &quot;more&quot;, and ''menos'' means &quot;less&quot;.
*''Plutón es el planeta menos grande del sistema solar'' literally means &quot;Pluto is the least big planet in the solar system&quot;.
*In Guatemala, ''el colegio'' and ''el instituto'' both mean &quot;school&quot; (primary or secondary). The difference is that mostly all the ''colegios'' are private and ''institutos'' are public, even though is possible nowadays to find ''institutos privados'', that is &quot;private schools&quot;.
*''la mar'' is often used in poems, but in a conversation, ''el mar'' is used.
*''pesado'' sounds like a localism. The international meaning of the word is ''heavy''.
*I don't know if the adjectives that describe persons with learning difficulties are constructive in this book (''estúpido'' [stupid], ''tonto'' [dumb]).

Lesson 6

*I think it will be necessary to remember here that even though the word ''me'' in Spanish is written just like &quot;me&quot; in English, and both mean the same, they sound very different.
*The tables of pronouns should have the pronouns in Spanish, at least to disambiguate the pronouns &quot;you&quot;.
*The example ''Te compro una bicicleta, te la compro.'' is, in particular, somewhat ambiguous. It can mean ''I buy you a bike, I buy it for you'' but it can also mean ''I buy it to/from you''.
*''el desayuno'' literally means &quot;to put an end to the fast (and start eating)&quot;. It comes from the noun ''el ayuno'', that means &quot;the fast&quot; (not to eat).
*&lt;b&gt;DONE&lt;/b&gt; ''comer'' means internationally ''to eat''.
*&lt;b&gt;DONE&lt;/b&gt; Another word for &quot;banana&quot; is ''el banano''.
*It may be time to remember the correct pronunciation of the word ''zanahoria'' too.

Lesson 7

*There are a lot of words in Spanish that are very similar to their English counterparts. By including them in the vocabulary list, it will be easier to the reader to learn more words. So...
*There's another word for &quot;the closet&quot; and it is... ''el closet''! :)
*Another word for &quot;the refrigerator&quot; is ''el refrigerador''.
*''el plato'' also means &quot;the dish&quot;, so lavaplatos = ''lavar'' (to wash) + ''plato'' (dish).
*That's right, ''sartén'' is feminine. Some other tricky words are ''el agua'' (the water) and ''el arma'' (the weapon).

Lesson 8

*Here's the command conjugation for the formal (Spanish Spanish) ''vos'' pronoun, as well as for ''vosotros'' and ''vosotras'':
**''hablar: hablad''
**''comer: comed''
**''pedir: pedid''
**''dar: dad''
**''estar: estad''
**''ir: id''
**''saber: sabed''
**''ser: sed'' (not to be mistaken with ''sed'' (thirst))
*And for the informal (American Spanish) ''vos'' pronoun; it's similar to the Spanish Spanish form, but you drop the last &quot;D&quot; and put an accent in the last vocal. Remember that this is only for America:
**''hablar: hablá''
**''comer: comé''
**''pedir: pedí''
**''decir: decí''
**''hacer: hacé''
**ir: (Does not exist as far as I know, or is not used (What could it be?''í''?). The verb used is ''andar'' (to go, walk, to ride, to function [a machine]), and conjugates ''andá'')
**''poner: poné''
**''salir: salí''
**''ser: sé''
**''tener: tené''
**''venir: vení''
*Now some corrections:
**decir, negative: ''no digas''
**hacer, negative: ''no hagas''
**poner, negative: ''no pongas''
**salir, negative: ''no salgas''
**ser, negative: ''no seas''
**tener, negative: ''no tengas''
**venir, negative: ''no vengas''
*In the medical attention: &quot;the doctor&quot; = ''el doctor''.
*The end of the vocabulary can be:
**''el pie = the foot''
**''los pies = the feet''
**''el dedo = the finger''
**''los dedos = the fingers''
**''los dedos de los pies = the toes''
*so the reader makes the asociation :).

Lesson 9

*It's better if you include:
**''la radio'' = the radio station
**''el radio'' = the radio receiver/the radius (geometry, chemistry)

----
Wow OASO! Thanks a lot for the huge amount of suggestions - I guess it will take me a while to go through all this :), but once it is all included the Wikibook will definitely be of a much higher quality. Again, feel free and encouraged to make changes right away this is more efficient (but I am very glad for your writeup here since I'll be able to learn a lot from it). Thanks! [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas Strohmann]]

*''el desayuno'' literally means &quot;to put an end to the fast (and start eating)&quot;. It comes from the noun ''el ayuno'', that means &quot;the fast&quot; (not to eat).
:I though the english word breakfast had exaclty the same etymology, so to have breakfast would mean to break the fast. All the other comments are great, when I have some time i'll try to make the corrections listed here that are not yet done. [[User:200.89.153.204|200.89.153.204]] 6 July 2005 13:46 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>More commonly spelt with the 'a', see: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diaeresis_(diacritic)</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Pronouncing Spanish based on the written word is much simpler than pronouncing English based on written English.  This is because, with few exceptions, each letter in the Spanish alphabet represents a single sound, and even when there are several possible sounds, simple rules tell us which is the correct one. In contrast, many letters and letter combinations in English represent multiple sounds (such as the ''ou'' and ''gh'' in words like ''cough'', ''rough'', ''through'', ''though'', ''plough'', etc.).  


==Letter-sound correspondences in Spanish==
The table below presents letter-sound correspondences in the order of the traditional Spanish alphabet.  (Refer to the article [[w:Writing system of Spanish|Writing system of Spanish]] in Wikipedia for details on the Spanish alphabet and alphabetization.)

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Letter
! Name of&lt;br/&gt;the letter
! IPA
! Pronunciation of the letter (English approximation)
|-
|A a
|a
|{{IPA|a}}
|Like ''a'' in ''father''
|-
|rowspan=&quot;2&quot;|B b
|rowspan=&quot;2&quot;|be, be larga, be alta
|{{IPA|b}}
|Like ''b'' in ''bad''.
|-
|{{IPA|&amp;beta;}}
|'''Between vowels''', the lips should not be fully closed when pronouncing the sound (somewhat similar to the ''v'' in ''value'', but much softer).
|-
|rowspan=&quot;2&quot;|C c
|rowspan=&quot;2&quot;|ce
|{{IPA|&amp;theta;/s}}
|'''Before the vowels ''e'' and ''i''''', like ''th'' in ''thin'' (most of Spain) or like ''c'' in ''center'' (Parts of Andalucía, Canary Islands and Americas).
|-
|{{IPA|k}}
|'''Everywhere else'''; like ''c'' in ''coffee''
|-
|Ch ch
|che
|{{IPA|tʃ}}
|Like ''ch'' in ''church''.
|-
|rowspan=&quot;2&quot;|D d
|rowspan=&quot;2&quot;|de
|{{IPA|d}}
|Does not have an exact English equivalent. Sounds similar to the ''d'' in ''day'', but instead of the tongue touching the roof of the mouth behind the teeth, it should touch the teeth themselves.
|-
|{{IPA|ð}}
|Between vowels, the tongue should be lowered so as to not touch the teeth (somewhat similar to the ''th'' in ''the'').
|-
|E e
|e
|{{IPA|e}}
|Like ''e'' in ''ten'', and the ''ay'' in ''say''.
|-
|F f
|efe
|{{IPA|f}}
|Like ''f'' in ''four''.
|-
|rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|G g
|rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|ge
|{{IPA|g}}
|Like ''g'' in ''get''.
|-
|{{IPA|ɰ}}
|Between vowels (where the second vowel is ''a'', ''o'' or ''u''), the tongue should not touch the soft palate (no similar sound in English, but it's somewhat like Arabic ''ghain'').
|-
|{{IPA|x}}
|'''Before the vowels ''e'' and ''i''''', like a Spanish ''j'' (see below).
|-
|H h
|hache
|{{IPA|}}
|'''Silent''', unless combined with ''c'' (see above). Hu- or hi- followed by another vowel at the start of the word stand for {{IPA|/w/}} (English ''w'') and {{IPA|/j/}} (English ''y''). Also used in foreign words like '''h&amp;aacute;mster''', where it is pronounced like a Spanish ''j'' (see below).
|-
|I i
|i
|{{IPA|i}}
|Like ''e'' in ''he''. Before other vowels, it approaches ''y'' in ''you''.
|-
|J j
|jota
|{{IPA|x}}
|Like the ''ch'' in ''loch'', although in many dialects it may sound like English ''h''.
|-
|K k
|ka
|{{IPA|k}}
|Like the ''k'' in ''ask''. Only used in words of foreign origin - Spanish prefers ''c'' and ''qu'' (see above and below, respectively).
|-
|L l
|ele
|{{IPA|l}}
|Does not have an exact English equivalent. It is similar to the English &quot;l&quot; in ''line'', but shorter, or &quot;clipped.&quot; Instead of the tongue touching the roof of the mouth behind the teeth, it should touch the tip of the teeth themselves.
|-
|Ll ll
|doble ele, elle
|{{IPA|ʎ/ʝ}}
| Pronounced, mostly in Northern Spain, like ''gl'' in the Italian word ''gli''. Does not have an English equivalent, but it's somewhat similar to ''li'' in ''million''. In other parts of Spain and in Latin America, ''ll'' is commonly pronounced as {{IPA|/ʝ/}} (somewhat similar to English ''y'', but more vibrating). In Argentina and Uruguay it can be like ''sh'' in &quot;flash&quot; or like the ''s'' in the English &quot;vision&quot;.
|-
|M m
|eme
|{{IPA|m}}
|Like ''m'' in ''more''.
|-
|N n
|ene
|{{IPA|n}}
|Like ''n'' in ''no''. Before '''p''', '''b''', '''f''' and '''v''' (and in some regions '''m''') sounds as ''m'' in ''important''. For example '''un paso''' sounds '''umpaso'''. Before '''g''', '''j''', '''k''' sound (c, k , q), '''w''' and '''hu''' sounds like ''n'' in ''anchor'': un gato, un juego, un cubo, un kilo, un queso, un whisky, un hueso. Before '''y''' sound (''y'' or ''ll''), it sounds like ''ñ'', see below.
|-
|Ñ ñ
|eñe
|{{IPA|ɲ}}
|Like ''gn'' in the Italian word ''lasagna''. As it's always followed by a vowel, the most similar sound in English is {{IPA|/nj/}} (''ny'') + ''vowel'', as in ''canyon'', where the ''y'' is very short. For example, when pronouncing &quot;años&quot;, think of it as &quot;anyos&quot;, or an-yos. To practice, repeat the onomatopoeia of chewing: &quot;ñam, ñam, ñam&quot;.
|-
|O o
|o
|{{IPA|o}}
|Like ''o'' in ''more'', without the following ''r'' sound.
|-
|P p
|pe
|{{IPA|p}}
|Like ''p'' in ''port''.
|-
|Q q
|cu
|{{IPA|k}}
|Like ''q'' in ''quit''. As in English, it is always followed by a ''u'', but before ''e'' or ''i'', the ''u'' is silent (''l&amp;iacute;quido'' is pronounced {{IPA|/'li.ki.ðo/}}). The English {{IPA|/kw/}} sound is normally written ''cu'' in Spanish (''cuanto''), although ''qu'' can be used for this sound in front of ''a'' or ''o'' (''qu&amp;aacute;sar'', ''qu&amp;oacute;rum'').
|-
|rowspan=&quot;2&quot;|R r
|rowspan=&quot;2&quot;|ere, erre
|{{IPA|ɾ}}
|This has two pronunciations, neither of which exist in English. The 'soft' pronunciation [ɾ] sounds like American relaxed pronunciation of ''tt'' in &quot;butter&quot;, and is written ''r'' (always written ''r'').
|-
|{{IPA|r}}
|The 'hard' pronunciation [r] is a multiply vibrating sound, similar to Scottish rolled r (generally written ''rr''). 'Hard' ''r'' is also the sound of [r] at the start of a word or after ''l'', ''n'' or ''s''.
|-
|S s
|ese
|{{IPA|s}}
|Like ''s'' in ''six''. In many places it's aspirated in final position, although in Andalusia it is not itself pronounced, but changes the sound of the preceding vowel. (See regional variations). In most parts of Spain, it's pronounced as a sound between [s] and [ʃ].
|-
|T t
|te
|{{IPA|t}}
|Does not have an exact English equivalent. Like to the ''t'' in ''ten'', but instead of the tongue touching the roof of the mouth behind the teeth, it should touch the teeth themselves.
|-
|rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|U u
|rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|u
|{{IPA|w}}
|'''before another vowel''' (especially after ''c''), like ''w'' in ''twig''.
|-
|
|'''In the combinations ''gue'',''gui'' and ''qu'', it is silent unless it has a diaresis (''g&amp;uuml;e'', ''g&amp;uuml;i''), in which case it is as above: ''w'' (only in the combinations ''g&amp;uuml;e'' and ''g&amp;uuml;i'' and not in the combination ''q&amp;uuml;'').
|-
|{{IPA|u}}
|'''Everywhere else''', like ''oo'' in ''pool'', but shorter.
|-
|V v
|uve, ve, ve corta, ve baja
|{{IPA|b, &amp;beta;}}
|Identical to Spanish ''b'' (see above). The pronunciation &quot;v&quot; is regarded as an over-cultism{{Citation needed}}.

|W w
|uve doble, doble ve, doble u
|{{IPA|b, &amp;beta;, w}}
|Used only in words of foreign origin (Spanish prefers ''u''). Pronunciation varies from word to word: ''watt'' is pronounced like ''bat'' or ''huat'', but ''kiwi'' is always pronounced like ''quihui''.
|-
|rowspan=&quot;3&quot;|X x

|In words of Amerindian origin, like ''sh'' in ''she''.
|-
|{{IPA|x}}
|Note that ''x'' used to represent the sound of ''sh'', which then evolved into the sound now written with ''j''. A few words have retained the old spelling, but have modern pronunciation /x/. Most notably, ''M&amp;eacute;xico'' and its derivatives are pronounced like ''M&amp;eacute;jico''.

|{{IPA|i}}
|It sounds as a vowel [i]: a. when it is a word itself (''y'' /i/, meaning &quot;and&quot; in English), b. at the end of a word like in ''rey'' /rei/ (&quot;king&quot;), c. in the middle of a compound word like in ''Solymar'' (''sol y mar'' /so.li'mar/, meaning &quot;sun and sea&quot;), d. at the beginning of a word followed by a consonant in words or names that have retained an old spelling (''Yfrán'' /i'fɾan/).
|-
|{{IPA|ʝ}}
|It sounds as a consonant [ʝ] in any other position: ''reyes'' /'re.ʝes/, ''yeso'' /'ʝe.so/. This standard pronunciation for ''y'' as a consonant does not have a perfect English equivalent, but it is somewhat similar to English ''y'' (just more vibrating).

==One letter, one sound==

Pronouncing Spanish based on the written word is much simpler than pronouncing English based on written English.  Each vowel represents only one sound. With some exceptions (such as ''w'' and ''x''), each consonant also represents one sound. Many consonants sound very similar to their English counterparts. 

As the table indicates, the pronunciation of some consonants (such as ''b'') does vary with the position of the consonant in the word, whether it is between vowels or not, etc.  This is entirely predictable, so it doesn't really represent a breaking of the &quot;one letter, one sound&quot; rule. 

The University of Iowa has a very visual and [http://www.uiowa.edu/%7Eacadtech/phonetics/ detailed explanation] of the Spanish pronunciation.

Here is another pages with links to the [http://www.spanishspanish.com/alfabeto_ipower.html audio files of the letters].

==Local pronunciation differences==

==Word stress==

In Spanish there are two levels of stress when pronouncing a syllable: stressed and unstressed. To illustrate: in the English word &quot;''thinking''&quot;, &quot;''think''&quot; is pronounced with stronger stress than &quot;''ing''&quot;. If both syllables are pronounced with the same stress, it sounds like &quot;''thin king''&quot;. 

With one category of exceptions (''-mente'' adverbs), all Spanish words have one stressed syllable.  If a word has an accent mark (´; explicit accent), the syllable with the accent mark is stressed and the other syllables are unstressed.  If a word has no accent mark (implicit accent), the stressed syllable is predictable by rule (see below).  If you don't put the stress on the correct syllable, the other person may have trouble understanding you.  For example: ''esta'', which has an implicit accent in the letter ''e'', means &quot;this (feminine)&quot;; and ''está'', which has an explicit accent in the letter ''a'', means &quot;is.&quot; ''Inglés'' means &quot;English,&quot; but ''ingles'' means &quot;groins.&quot; 

Adverbs ending in ''-mente'' are stressed in two places: on the syllable where the accent falls in the adjectival root and on the ''men'' of ''-mente''.  For example: ''estúpido'' → ''estúpida'''men'''te''.

The vowel of an unstressed syllable should be pronounced with its true value, as shown in the table above.  Don't reduce unstressed vowels to neutral schwa sounds, as occurs in English.

===Rules for pronouncing the implicit accent===

There are only the following rules for pronouncing the implicit accent. The stressed syllable is in bold letters:

*If a word ends with a vowel or with ''n'' or ''s '', the next-to-last syllable is stressed.&lt;br/&gt;'''Examples''':
**''cara'' ('''ca'''-ra) (face)
**''mano'' ('''ma'''-no) (hand)
**''amarillo'' (a-ma-'''ri'''-llo) (yellow)
**''hablan'' ('''ha'''-blan) (they speak)
**''martes'' ('''mar'''-tes) (Tuesday)

*If a word ends with a consonant other than ''n ''or ''s'', the last syllable is stressed.&lt;br/&gt;'''Examples''':
**''farol'' (fa-'''rol''') (street lamp)
**''azul'' (a-'''sul''') (blue)
**''español'' (es-pa-'''ñol''') (Spanish)
**''salvador'' (sal-va-'''dor''') (savior).

*A syllable usually contains exactly one vowel. If there are two adjacent vowels, they count as two distinct syllables if both are one of ''a'',''e'' and ''o''. If, however, at least one of them is ''i'' or ''u'', they count as only one syllable. If, according to the two rules above, that syllable is stressed, the first of the two vowels is stressed if it is one of ''a'',''e'' and ''o'', while the second vowel is stressed if the first one is one of ''i'' and ''u''.&lt;br/&gt;'''Examples''':
**''correo'' (co-'''rre'''-o) (mail)
**''hacia'' ('''ha'''-cia) (in the direction of)
**''fui'' (fu-'''i''') (I was) (Note that this word has only one syllable.)

Any exception to these rules is marked by writing an acute accent (''máximo'', ''paréntesis'', ''útil'', ''acción''). In those exceptions, the stressed sylable is the one where the acute accent (called ''tilde'' in Spanish) appears.

==The diaeresis ( ¨ )==

In the clusters ''gue'' and ''gui'', the ''u'' is not pronounced; it serves simply to give the ''g'' a hard-''g'' sound, like in the English word ''gut'' (''gue'' → [ge]; ''gui'' → [gi]).

However, if the ''u'' has a the diaeresis mark (¨), it is pronounced like an English ''w'' (''güe'' → [gwe]; ''güi'' → [gwi]).  This mark is rather rare.

Examples:
*''pedigüeño'' = beggar
*''agüéis'' (2nd person plural, present subjunctive of the verb ''aguar''). Here, the diaeresis preserves the ''u'' (or [w]) sound in all the verb tenses of ''aguar''.
*''argüir'' (to deduce)
*''pingüino'' = penguin

== Relation with wiktionary ==

I'm thinking about the relations of this to [[w:Wiktionary|Wiktionary]]. A good bilingual would be a great language resource.  feel we can do more than make wiki textbooks.



I'm trying to focus a few ideas around that on [[meta:Wiki Language School]]. It would be something in a more dictionary / encyclopedia format - very browseable, but with focus on teachign rather than definitions. So the actual contents may actually look more like what's in a textbook.

Comments welcome - oh, and is there a page on wikibooks that talks about this kind of things ? [[User:Flammifer|Flammifer]] 19:20, 11 Oct 2004 (UTC)

== Language families unhelpful? ==

Anybody else feel that language categories for this bookshelf are unhelpful? I found them much easier to scan and find the language I was looking for before they were categorized into groups like ''ROMANCE'', ''Q-CELTIC'' or ''OTHER INDO-EUROPEAN''. If I would make one division, it would be between natural languages and constructed languages, but other than that the divisions make things harder to find. 

Think about our users here and what they would reasonably expect to see. Most people know less than half of those language families, so grouping would be an encumbrance to them.  --[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 18:27, 18 November 2005 (UTC)

:Agree. --[[User:Singkong2005|Singkong2005]] 04:08, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

:Agree. I also find the ''level'' of categorisation by &quot;family&quot; employed (i.e. how do you define family?) very arbitrary, e.g. &quot;Q-Celtic&quot; is not a language family, it is a subranch of a branch (Celtic) of a family (Indo-European): why choose to categorise at that particular level? Maybe someone will disagree with me there, but that is precisely my point: the decisions ''are'' debatable, hence (at least potentially) arbitrary, providing one more argument for getting rid of the categorisation. --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 08:14, 17 January 2007 (UTC)

:Disagree. I accept anyone without specialist knowledge would perhaps not be familiar with all the family/branch etc. hierarchies, but I think a simple alphabetical list completely removes the possibility for people to learn about these distinctions and possibly lead them in directions which are intellectually stimulating. I read often in User talk pages about how people follow random link after random link and become interested in subjects they were previously unaware of. To take away the categorisation is to restrict access to knowledge, not increase it. I accept the division between Q-celtic and P-celtic could come across as an excessive concentration on differences that in world terms are relatively small, but I think the main point is this: To be simply looking at the languages bookshelf means you have some interest in languages and so it is only natural to find out the answers to curiosities that jump out at them. To name but a few: Why are Welsh and Irish in different &quot;branches&quot;? Why is Basque not in any group? Arbitary maybe, but none the less interesting to anyone with an interest in languages. [[User:Kijog|Kijog]] 21:43, 23 January 2007 (UTC)

::To be clear, I only meant to argue for the removal of categorizations in the little &lt;nowiki&gt;{{bookshelf|Languages bookshelf}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; box up top. The family/branch grouping is a ''very'' good thing for the organization of the Languages Bookshelf page, but not for a small box. 

::It shows up on [[Special:Whatlinkshere/Template:Languages_bookshelf|many pages]] and should be just a quick reference with organization that is easily understood by someone wishing to browse popular or developed language texts. I do not think it should be the job of a bookshelf to serve as a primer on etymology. Think of the user here and their likely expectations and search strategies. Alphabetical order is quick to recognize, but the family groupings make most languages harder to find (just try finding Arabic, Finnish or Irish without having to read through half the box first). As a bonus, we'd also free up another line so that more books could be featured. --[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 19:12, 24 January 2007 (UTC)

[http://german.for-selfstudy.info/GermanBites/2.htm this lesson on my personal website] and I plan to transfer the German lessons there to Wikibooks so that more people can contribute and benefit from them.

== Concerning Miskito: featured book ==

Hi everyone. I have a few things to say, but I'll do it under two headings to facilitate separate discussion of them (if there is any). First of all, I'd like to say that the [[Miskito]] language course I've been working on (as time permits; not much lately) has been made a featured book. I'm still not sure what the whole process leading to that is, but I'd like to thank whoever supported that decision, and also take the opportunity to invite anybody who's interested in such things to give their feedback on what they think of the (unfinished) course's design and content, since I think it's a bit innovative in the Wikibooks context. I'd be glad to discuss matters anybody might like to bring up, time permitting. Cheers, Alan --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 06:42, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

== A few things about the bookshelf ==

There are serious problems with the way languages are ordered/classified in the bookshelf - both in the smaller template at the top and in the main list. The points I will raise have already been touched on higher up on this page (but not resolved, I think, and certainly not satisfactorily in my opinion), and I think they do need attention.

I'll start with a practical point. In the template at the top, as it is presently organised, there is NO PLACE to put Miskito (or any other American Indian language): they simply haven't been alotted a place. Perhaps this is simply because until now there were no American Indian language courses considered worth including in the template, so it wasn't necessary to have a category. In principle, therefore, the problem could easily be solved by adding a new category.

That, however, leads to my second point, which is that the choice of currently existing categories is somewhat inconsistent because it mixes two different ways of classifying languages: by language family and by geographical area.

Most of the template goes by the former: thus we have various branches of Indo-European (taking up more than half of the entire list), followed by some other families (e.g. Finno-Ugric, Turkic) or sub-families (e.g. Semitic, Chinese). That's okay in principle, as long as we realise that the (sub)-families present do not cover all the world's languages and will therefore have to be repeatedly revised to make room for new additions not accommodated by the present categories. For example: (1) as I mentioned, there is presently no category for (any) American Indian languages; (2) if we wanted to incorporate, for example, Somali or Hausa, which belong to the Afro-Asiatic language family, we'd have to add Afro-Asiatic, but also remove the Semitic category since Semitic is also a branch or subfamily of Afro-Asiatic. (Actually, you could do it in at least two ways:
*List all of Arabic, Hausa, Hebrew and Somali under Afro-Asiatic.
*List Arabic and Hebrew under Semitic (as at present) and Hausa and Somali under &quot;Other Afro-Asiatic&quot; in imitation of the present category &quot;Other Indo-European&quot;.)
If we continue in this way, the more languages are incorporated the more complicated this is going to get, and we're going to need to revise (and discuss?) the classification over and over again.

However, near the end of the template (just before &quot;Constructed&quot; languages, which obviously should stand on their own as they now do), we now have the category &quot;East Asian/Polynesian&quot;, which has several things &quot;wrong&quot; with it in relation to the preceding categories namely:
*East Asian and Polynesian have nothing to do with each other, so why have they been lumped together?
*None of the languages listed is Polynesian anyway. (The Polynesian languages include Tongan, Samoan, Maori, Tahitian, Hawaiian..., none of which appear there.)
*Some languages listed (as a matter of fact, all of them except Japanese and Korean) are ''neither'' East Asian ''nor'' Polynesian.

All the above points could be &quot;fixed&quot; by simply correcting the categories without questioning the whole system of classification, but the next problem raises a whole new issue:

*As far as linguistic classifications go, &quot;East Asian&quot; is not a family at all, it is simply a geographical location. So if the classification is by families, you cannot suddenly say &quot;East Asian&quot; without disrupting the classification and making it internally inconsistent.

Before talking about how to solve this, let's take a glance at the main listing of all the language courses. (So far I've been talking about the shorter template that is seen at the top of the page and shows up elsewhere in Wikibooks.) 

The Contents box at the top of the page shows how this is structured at present, and it is immediately obvious that it is badly organised, the top-level divisions being:

*General topics
*Constructed
*Indo-European (over 60 books listed, classified into 4 branches plus &quot;Other Indo-European languages&quot;, listing 6 further branches covering 9 books)
*Sino-Tibetan (6 items: five Chinese &quot;dialects&quot; plus Nepal-Bhasa)
*Other languages (35 books, divided by language family - 16 top-level divisions plus &quot;Miscellaneous languages&quot;, containing three)
*Other language books

This is partly internally consistent, but not altogether (why should Sino-Tibetan have a different status from other non-Indo-European families?). I would also object to Constructed languages being placed ''before'' natural human languages rather than at the end of the list. Notice that this system does not mix geographical and &quot;genealogical&quot; categories. Potentially, it could be cleaned up, made more consistent, and mechanisms could be determined to open up new families and branches as needed to accommodate new books (I put Miskito in the Other languages/Miscellaneous languages sub-category simply because there was nowhere else to put it on the existing list).

But, I would ask, do we want to do that? Do we want the bookshelf to be ordered following a strict classification into families (and sub-families)? Is that useful for most users, and does it best serve the bookshelf's main purpose? These questions have already been raised on this page but I think they remain unresolved. Some people feel it is ''not'' a useful, practical system, and I tend to agree. One argument in its favour that has been given is that it encourages people to learn about the &quot;etymological&quot; (I quote; the word is used incorrectly here, but we understand the point) relationships between languages and facilitates random browsing. I myself feel there is much to be said in favour of the rejoinder that the principal function of this bookshelf is ''not'' to teach people about the relationships between languages - for that there are other sources; try reading Wikipedia, for example; and that as for random browsing, why not let people randomly browse through an alphabetical language list for that matter?

For many practical reasons, which I won't spell out further as I've already gone on for too long (I tend to do that, I apologise), I think there are two options either of which would be more useful to most Wikibooks readers than the present one, and which each have points in their favour (and against, obviously):

*a simple alphabetical listing by language
*a simple, broad geographical listing, e.g. by continent (and alphabetical within each major geographical category)

Perhaps the second of these (by continent) would be good for the smaller template and the first (alphabetical by language) for the main, complete list.

At least with either of these solutions I'd know where to put Miskito! --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 07:56, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

:Thank-you! I've never been able to formulate this, but I've always had that nagging feeling that (well-meaning) attempts to classify languages into linguistic families are not going to help anybody trying to find a language book.  If you're just a guy trying to learn enough Korean for a business trip, you're probably not going to know that it is an Altaic (maybe) language or even care for that matter.  I'd say we go with the geographical listings.  Continental seems a little large, but anything smaller is probably going to be too arbitrary. -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 08:33, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

::Actually, we might be able to use this [http://unstats.un.org/unsd/methods/m49/m49regin.htm UN classification] -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 08:37, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

=== Kowey jumps the gun ===

Hi Kowey. I would have liked an opportunity to discuss this here before going ahead and implementing your suggestion. (I was waiting to see if there was input from anyone else.) I suspect there will be practical problems with parts of the classification you've put there - cases where it is hard to decide which subdivision a language belongs to and hard to avoid arbitrary decisions on that. Remember that whatever makes it more difficult for a reader to guess which division to look in, or less probable that she will get it right the first time, goes against our present purpose. While I agree that in some cases it may be convenient to get slightly narrower than just continents, I wouldn't advocate going too far in that direction because it will create new problems, for sure. One other thing: I oppose any proposal to classify the languages according to official political units. Any division proposed by the UN is likely to reflect such units because the members of the UN are political entities (i.e. states). Sorry to be a spoilsport, but I think you jumped the gun a bit. Can we go back a step and discuss the matter properly first, and act afterwards? Cheers, --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 11:21, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

:Hi again, Sure! Despite appearances, I am actually in no particular hurry and was just laying down a concrete proposal.  Never sure how to navigate the mixed cultures of wikiboldness and consensus-based decision making.  For what it's worth, I personally agree that we should eschew the use of national/political boundaries as a basis of classifying languages (no need to see wikibooks descending into a mass of useless politico-linguistic flamewars).  I had simply assumed that the continents would be impractical as a basis for organising the shelf, and that broad, commonly accepted (?) geographical regions would be &quot;safe&quot;.  Note however, that we could always classify things in more than one place... perhaps an option to consider if things are looking too fine-grained. -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 13:57, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

::Another thought.  If we went with a coarse-grained continental classification, we could use something very neutral as a sub classification, like 'African languages from A-M' -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 14:04, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

::Also, rereading your comment, I realise that you are saying that the adoption of UN-style region implies the acceptance of the political boundaries (i.e. nations within those boundaries).  Not sure what to do about that.  I went with the classification as I had expected it to be uncontroversial.  Oops.  :-) -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 14:08, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

My 2 cents: when I am trying to find a language, I do use the language family tree. I feel it is the most efficient classifiation, since some languages are spoken accross continents. Also, If I am looking for a language and I do not know its familly, I simply use CTRL-F and find it by its name, no need for a near-impossible regional classification (I may not know the region anyway). So I am fine with the genealogical classification and don't need any other. I beleive any competent user of the internet should also be able to do a search on a web page and find what they need. If not, well what they need is a &quot;computer for dummies&quot; book, first, and then they can move on to learning a foreign language using web resources after that. [[User:Lgriot|Lgriot]] 12:15, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

:Hi, well, it's true that one could always search, but (i) that's asking just a tiny little bit more computer literacy than I think reasonable (very tiny bit) and (ii) part of the issue is not so much finding a particular book you are looking for -- admittedly that is what I had used as an example -- but even knowing that certain books exist.  In any case, I'm not suggesting that we do away with the linguistic genealogy altogether, just that it play a secondary role to a classification that is more obvious to the layperson.  In any case, let me stress that I have no strong feelings on the matter and would be happy to see what the community come up with -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 13:57, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

=== A R King's proposal (expanded) ===

I share Kowey's attitude of &quot;no strong feelings on the matter and would be happy to see what the community come up with&quot;, as far as practicality is concerned, but as far as my own feelings there (even if not &quot;strong&quot;) are concerned, I tend to side with Kowey rather than Lgriot on the point that the latter has just raised, and for both of the reasons Kowey has given under (i) and (ii). Where my feelings might get a wee little bit stronger would be if the proposed solution were one that tended to exacerbate rather than correct what the Wikipedians call systemic bias, such as with a system that tended to favour European or Indo-European languages and marginalise African, American Indian (etc.) ones. And with that we come full circle, in a way, back to the original problem I had with the present system - which, by the way, Lgriot's comments do not address. I also agree that it would be great to have some more input from the community here; I hope we do. 

As far as specific proposals go, I fail to see what major problems there are with a &quot;flat&quot; (no sub-categories) classification such as the following:

*African
*American
*Asian
*Australian
*European
*Pacific
*Constructed
*Other books (not actual language courses)

Here they're given in alphabetical order except for Constructed and Other, for less bias, but another interesting (and practical) option would be to follow the analogy of the listing of languages on the Wikipedia project generic homepages, in descending order of representation: thus European would be placed first because there are more language books for European languages, and so on.

These categories refer to area of ORIGIN of languages; thus English is classified as European, not American (but Cherokee is American). I think there are very few languages for which it is at all debatable (and not easily resolvable) which of these areas they come from. I also think it does not take a great deal of linguistic sophistication from users to figure out where things are going to be. And Lgriot's argument about using Ctrl-F in the last resort is equally applicable here if there are doubts. The fact that there are only a few categories means that it's easier and quicker to browse through the whole lot and see what is there whether or not you know what you're looking for (i.e. in both cases in which Kowey envisages people browsing: to find something, or just to see what there is). Within each category alphabetical order would normally be followed, perhaps to be waived in certain cases such as placing different kinds of &quot;Chinese&quot; together, so you could perhaps have Mandarin Chinese under C, not M, for example.

In this list, I propose for American to include North, Central and South America, and Pacific refers to islands (not the coasts of America, Asia or whatever) whatever their size, from the biggest (Australia) to the smallest (Micronesia etc.), unless it is desired to treat Australia as a separate category, either way would do. &quot;Oceanic&quot; is not a good term for this because linguists recognise a certain group of languages as Oceanic languages which wouldn't coincide in range with what we mean here, hence I propose Pacific.

I do foresee a fairly small number of possible doubts here, but not enough or insurmountable enough to invalidate the proposal. Speaking of Pacific, I guess Japanese would be an exception because although it actually is the language of islands in the Pacific Ocean, we should follow tradition by classifying it as Asian (because that is where everybody will look for it). Secondly, languages of the Middle East might be awkward (is Hebrew to be classified as European, Asian or African?); here we might want to decide to add a Middle Eastern category which would, I guess, include Arabic, Aramaic, Assyrian, Hebrew, Sumerian and Ugaritic? I don't think Pidgins and Creoles are a problem because they pretty clearly pertain to the areas where they are spoken (not the place of origin of the lexifier language), so for example Tok Pisin would be Pacific, not European! Unless it is felt desirable to keep Pidgins and Creoles as a separate category of its own, which might be okay as long as it is clear enough which languages constitute Pidgins or Creoles for the purpose. Other issues? Romani and Yiddish are both European languages, I think that's clear enough, so no problem there...

I would be in favour of only using one classification on the bookshelf page, not providing more than one alternative classifications, as I think it's unnecessary (this is essentially an inventory, not a categorisation) and could only make things less clear. I would also recommend using that same, single classification system in the template and the full listing on the page, keeping them parallel to help users to find their way around. The difference is that the template would not contain all the titles; ideally, only those having reached a certain level of completion should probably be there.

Well, that's my contribution to the discussion for now. --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 15:07, 7 June 2007 (UTC)

=== A R King try 1 ===
This is what the implementation of my proposal would look like applied to the template part of the bookshelf page:


{{Languages bookshelf (proposal)}}



I have gone for the option of ordering the categories (European...) by size, so the more books there are in a category, the higher that category gets placed on the overall list. The content of the template needed updating anyway, so rather than copy the present content I have taken the information from the full list on the page, only including books that are claimed to be at least 25% completed. Needless to say I have done nothing to check out that information, and some of it may need revising, but that wasn't the purpose of the present exercise. At present this template is only in my private user space; I haven't touched the &quot;real&quot; template yet. What do you say? --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 07:07, 8 June 2007 (UTC)

:We could perhaps limit ourselves to the top N% completed books in each category.  This is what we do for programming languages, anyway -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 07:18, 8 June 2007 (UTC)

Certainly. I just didn't want to be too restrictive, and besides, since this is an illustration of how the books can be classified, including more books for the exercise allowed me to give a more complete illustration. If this classification is adopted, I would recommend applying it in the full list too, so there's still more work to be done. --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 07:40, 8 June 2007 (UTC)

=== A R King #2 ===
Here's what happens when you only include books 50% or more completed. Kind of shows you why I opted for 25%.


{{Languages bookshelf (proposal 2)}}



However, I repeat that some of the progress thingies may need updating. --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 07:55, 8 June 2007 (UTC)

:Ouch :-) We could also have a minimum (say) 3 books per category (number of books permitting) -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 08:01, 8 June 2007 (UTC)
::Featured books should also go in -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 08:02, 8 June 2007 (UTC)

I've been doing some checking and found a number of discrepancies between the (original) template list and the full list, such as: (1) books listed in the template and not in the full list, and (2) books listed in both but with a higher level of completion registered in the template than in the full list. Taking into consideration that information, and assuming that if two indications differ the more &quot;optimistic&quot; one is more recent information and therefore to be preferred, I have updated the first proposed template above to reflect the fuller information. At the same time, where necessary, I have revised the full book list on the present bookshelf page following the same assumptions, so that this information is not lost if we should decide to replace the old bookshelf template. I only hope that in doing so I haven't introduced new human errors; of course it is theoretically up to the editors of each book, I suppose, to take some interest in ensuring that &quot;their&quot; informtion is accurate and updating as necessary. In any case, all the information provided is still that given by editors (presumably of the books concerned), meaning that I still haven't checked into how true a picture this gives of the real situation of those books. --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 08:42, 8 June 2007 (UTC)

: Dev markers on all our bookshelves are horribly out of date. Would there be enough 50%+ books if they are updated? Many new books are also added only to the templates, probably because the templates feature an &quot;edit&quot; link and are on pages like [[Wikibooks:All bookshelves]]. All bookshelves should eventually be checked and updated. Great job with the proposals, have you considered sorting and updating the other bookshelves that you are knowledgeable about?. --[[User:Hagindaz|hagindaz]] 13:46, 8 June 2007 (UTC)

=== A R King #3 ===
Kowey: I feel that three books per category makes little sense (sorry). Do you realise that would mean (according to my classification proposal) listing only three European languages? Hardly practical for many users, I think (since some of the most widely studied languages are European ones), and besides, how to choose which three to list?! On the other hand it would also be inappropriate, arbitrary and unhelpful, in my opinion, to apply such a principle to languages of other continents. Is it really a big problem to have a list of the length of the above template? Does it make sense to limit the list of language books if they really exist? (IF they exist! I repeat that so far we are taking the word of editors on that, which I think is the usual procedure here...) If you want to shorten it a little bit, though, one suggestion is that we limit it to one book per language (the most generic one, e.g. German but not German In Bit-Sized Lessons? the most completed one? some other formula?) --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 08:54, 8 June 2007 (UTC)

The one-book-per-language principle, if implemented, would look like this:

:::That said, your third proposal looks very reasonable -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 09:47, 8 June 2007 (UTC)

Okay, sorry, I guess it was me jumping the gun that time! ;-) Yes, I think the third proposal looks pretty good myself. And we could certainly incorporate your 3-minimum suggestion there too. I was thinking that some people (I might even be one of them) might think it a not-so-good idea to only list one book per language in the template if that means people are likely to go straight to that book and not even see other books (possibly even better ones for all we know) on the same language; that might be thought unfair, and I was wondering how to solve that problem (if it is one). And one idea I had for that is that when there is more than one book on any language, when the user clicks on the language's link, rather than being sent straight to one of the books, she gets sent to a disambiguation page (like the ones used on Wikipedia), with a list of the available books to choose from. That way nobody would be left out. What do you think? --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 09:56, 8 June 2007 (UTC)

=== A R King #4 ===

Here you are, I've implemented the minimum-3-languaged-per-category rule, by including Zulu for African and Sumerian for Middle Eastern. The only other candidate was Swahili, but it really is too unsubstantial to justify listing in the template.


{{Languages bookshelf (proposal 4)}}



Looking better all the time, isn't it? --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 10:07, 8 June 2007 (UTC)

:Yep! That looks very nice.  As for the languages with more than one book, we might consider having a small, for example, [[Wikibooks:German bookshelf]] which the German link would point to.  Perhaps a way to implement disambiguation pages. -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 12:50, 8 June 2007 (UTC)

Since we appear to have agreed on that (with the dissenting voice of Lgriot, which I respect, but I think it's fair to say there is a majority consensus - though it's a shame more people didn't get involved), I've now moved the list to the bookshelf and omitted it from here for reasons of space. I've read Junesun's comments and will respond to them below. --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 07:45, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

:How about the new template?  Are you waiting on that because you think it needs more discussion? -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 07:48, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

Yesterday I placed a request on [[Template talk:Languages bookshelf|the template's talk page]] with intructions for the change. There has not been any response yet. If we decide to implement my and Kowey's proposal for disambiguation pages/templates (for languages with multiple textbooks), the bookshelf template will subsequently need to be updated to reflect that; or if Junesun's alternative proposal of leaving multiple books in the bookshelf template itself is opted for, again that will entail modifications. In this respect, what I have requested (#4) can be considered as &quot;provisional&quot;, but I think it's a step in the right direction. Kowey's disambiguation strategy sounds good to me but it does require &quot;technical&quot; implementation (i.e. somebody still has to make those pages or templates). Kowey, could you yourself either: (1) create them and incorporate them, or (2) failing that, at least create ONE of them for me to see exactly what your proposal looks like, and I can try to do the others following that model if you prefer it that way?

:Hi, please see my response below -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 12:22, 10 June 2007 (UTC)

== Re: Language Shelf Reorganisation ==

I'm glad that finally things are moving. I found the old classification very correct (going as far as Q-Celtic and so on), but not usable by the average guy on the street. I believe a classification by continent is much preferable, though some people may look for Spanish under 'American'... By the way, I don't really see why we can't list all languages for which there are books that are at least 25% complete in the template, at least for the Languages Bookshelf page (and maybe limit them for the main page, though a lot of subjects have more books listed there). 

Unfortunately most of the language books can't actually be used as textbooks for any kind of study, even if they have received the &quot;Book of the Month&quot; award. I mean for example the main German textbook, which is why I started creating the &quot;Bite-sized&quot; method for German. I believe the main problem is a lot of good will paired with zero knowledge of pedagogics. The help page on how to create a good language-teaching Wikibook should be a must read for anybody wanting to create a new book in this shelf. Since that's not going to happen and since I now got a well-paying job creating multimedia lessons, I am no longer actively creating lessons here. I do believe that a wiki could be a good way of having people collaborate to create courses, but only under the condition that they get together at the start and then work as a team (single contributors work well too, as you show, Alan, but it's too frustrating) and that they first discuss the goals, methodology and lesson plan of their course. Otherwise there will be too many cooks in the kitchen and the result will be something like the Chinese Wikibook. I'm currently testing this concept (having a small team develop a course using a wiki) creating a basic English course for people in developing countries.

[[User:Junesun|Junesun]] 21:49, 8 June 2007 (UTC)

:First of all, Junesun, I'd like to let you know that as far as I'm concerned, at least, your work and attempts to improve things here did ''not'' go unnoticed. I am a relative newcomer to these parts and it looks like all that happened before I got here. I sympathise with your efforts, agree with your evaluation of the situation, approve of your intentions, and can understand perfectly well your frustration too. I have hopes of continuing to work in the direction you have begun by (a) producing some quality materials that may be useful (at least to some of the more serious potential editors here) as models (the [[Miskito]] material represents a first, somewhat experimental step towards that), and (b) in the future, if I can manage it, also writing some instructional materials here teaching the whole process of language textbook production - material that might be of practical use both for future wikibook writers and for writers of such materials in any medium. That's a very ambitious project, and not all ambitions get fulfilled, so I won't shout too loudly about that yet, but I have thought about doing this. Support would be helpful regarding all that, and while I understand you may decide you have better things to do now (and perhaps you're right), if you change your mind or would like to at least discuss these plans, I hope you will do so - your contributions could be most valuable.

:Coming to your comments and suggestions on the bookshelf and template:

* ''some people may look for Spanish under 'American'...''

:I've inserted a note at the beginning of the &quot;American&quot; section to warn people.

* ''By the way, I don't really see why we can't list all languages for which there are books that are at least 25% complete in the template...''

:As in my 1st proposal? We could. I don't have strong feelings on the matter. Perhaps we should go on discussing that point.

* ''Unfortunately most of the language books can't actually be used as textbooks for any kind of study...''

:Yes, I noticed. In that sense, this whole list could be seen as a bit of a farse - the titles look very impressive, but when you start to look at the contents, most of it is very disappointing indeed. While that can be seen as a criticism of the list, it is a matter that exceeds the purpose of the present exercise as I understand it, which was to decide how to organise the list. Another matter for future discussion?

* ''I do believe that a wiki could be a good way of having people collaborate to create courses, but only under the condition that they get together at the start and then work as a team...''

:And, I would add, have the minimally necessary know-how to do so (which you said too). It comes down to a matter of education, doesn't it: education so that people understand what it takes to create a course, and education for those really interested in making the necessary effort to teach how to do the things that need to be done. I have also worked in this area in the &quot;real world&quot; - by producing language textbooks (including a small-scale collaborative effort which WAS a success); by teaching language teachers to teach (and working as a language teacher myself, of course); by working with teams producing language-teaching-related materials (e.g. learning objectives); and more recently, by working in a third-world country (El Salvador) in a project (designed by me) to support recovery of a dying indigenous language (Pipil or Nawat) in which a team was formed and worked together on the production of language-teaching materials. My experiences reinforce my belief that education is the first stop - people can't do things if they don't know how (or don't even know what they're supposed to be doing, never mind how). Some people aren't really interested in learning and will just plod along blindly for a while, and perhaps it's the best policy just to let them do that. The important thing is to help the other people who do want to improve and learn and produce good work. That good work, when it's done, will speak for itself, as results usually do. I find arguing with people enormously tiring, while working can be tiring at times too, but can be exhilarating too and is ultimately far more productive. Now, how to make that work in the Wikibook environment? Cheers, Alan --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 08:24, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

===Important ideas for improving the language books (EVERYBODY PLEASE READ!)===

:: Thank you for your reply. Working on Wikibooks is very frustrating and I believe this is actually part of the problem: somebody starts a Wikibook, gets frustrated with the lack of encouragement or participation by others, abandons it, then somebody else comes, adds something and leaves, a serious contributor may arrive long after the fact and add to the course or start to re-write lessons according to his ideas, leaving again... This explains some of the mess. That's why I believe it's essential to start with a team who have the same ideas and can see the project through together. Maybe it could also work if there's one initiator with a background in teaching who leaves clear instructions for people who want to join in later, but for [[BLL German|my German course]] that didn't work out.

:: The problem is even bigger than I initially thought because on the Wikibooks sites in other languages people often just translate existing courses from the English Wikibooks site, also translating all the poor pedagogy. This really is a pity, because the people there are really ambitious and work hard to do all those translations and then it's all for naught since nobody can use the books. I almost feel like putting big warning templates on every bad Wikibook so that people don't translate it or use it as exam preparation, but that would probably discredit the site entirely. Already language lovers advise each other not to come here to study...

:: Here are some ideas for a solution. I already suggested some of these at the Wikimania Conference 2006:
* suggesting to everybody signing up to Wikibooks or creating a page to read the help page on creating a good Wikibook; 
* heavily promoting a model language Wikibook or at least creating a language course template that includes sections like &quot;Dialogue&quot;, &quot;Vocabulary&quot;, &quot;Grammar&quot; and &quot;Exercises&quot; so that people won't leave them out;
* having somebody answer a short quiz on elementary pedagogy (drawing from that page) before giving him the privilege of starting a new book (he would still be able to edit existing ones);
* requiring the publication of a lesson plan for every course, so that new contributors will have a guideline;
* promoting a special page where people can look for other contributors to form a development team or post their ideas and lesson plans for new courses if they don't have the time to write them themselves. This would have to be advertised with a big link on the front page or on the page creation page, so that newbies actually find it;
* prominently displaying author names for every book in an effort to make authors feel it is &quot;their&quot; book that they should take care of rather than leaving it to an anonymous wiki community;
* displaying page views for every book in an effort to show authors that their work is being noticed and used even if nobody comments;
* providing a user-based rating system (0-5 stars) as an additional way to give quick feedback to the book authors and also so that potential translators and users quickly see if the book is any good;
* making it easier to upload audio files and add interactive exercises (template?)

:: As for improving the &quot;learning to teach&quot; resources, I believe the existing help page is already very good but goes unnoticed by those who would need it the most. I mentioned it on several Wikibook talk pages to try to draw attention to it. What would maybe work even better than that page would be a step-by-step guide towards creating a new language course and a lesson, mentioning all the things to consider at the right place. I would help create this, but only if it will be prominently mentioned at least on the language shelf template, so that it stands a chance of being seen by those who are about to create a new language Wikibook.

:Hi, I'm new here and just wanted to give some comments:
:* I'm very thankful that I may start a wikibook on learning a language even without having a clue or a plan about it! 
:* I don't think that guidelines for contributers are very important if there really is only one or two contributers at a time. I guess the active contributers can always rewrite the guidelines if they wish to.
:* The de-facto model language wikibook is the Miskitu wikibook. Maybe this should be emphasized in more places.
:* In my opinion, hoping for contributers is bascially futile. Authors should be prepared to write a first version of the whole book on their own. 
:* How to display contributing authors on the cover page of each book should be decided by the authors of each book. I don't think it makes sense for the categories to include authors as the categories are already cluttered with failed book projects.
:* Audio files should probably be uploaded to Wikimedia Commons; thus, I'm not sure what can be done about this within the WikiBooks project.
:* Displaying page views and a rating system are great suggestions.
:One question: I was looking for a place to discuss the design of exercises for the course I'm working on and finally put my thoughts on the discussion page of the Miskitu wikibook as A R King has written some interesting things about this. Is there a better place to discuss the design of wikibooks for language learning?

Resuming the discussion in progress above: (1) I understand that only certain people have permission to edit the template. So if and when we're ready to modify the template, who does that and how do we go about getting them to do it?

(2) Kowey, please see Junesun's question about whether we really want to only list one book per language in the template, or include all books that are over 25%, and tell me what you think because I'm pretty easy either way. Alan --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 08:34, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

:Re (1): we could always post something on the discussion page of that template and maybe one of the Staff Lounge areas to get an administrator's attention.  As for (2), I'm afraid of having the template be too cluttered, but I suppose if we allowed for 25%s and used the disambiguation page method, it would be fine.  I tend to see the template as being our first foot forward, so whilst (a) we want to show that we cover a broad range of subjects (b) we also want to highlight the best of our work...  Although one thought is that the progress bars tend not to be updated frequently enough to be informative, so maybe we shouldn't rely too much on them anyway.  As usual, no real resistance to offer.  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 11:22, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

Re (2): Kowey, when you say &quot;but I suppose if we allowed for 25%s and used the disambiguation page method, it would be fine&quot;, are you just suggesting that we stick to my fourth proposal (the most recent one) for the template and do the disambiguation thing, i.e. 25%s but no multiple-books-per-language on the template? I guess so. What I think this means is that the link for (for example) &quot;German&quot; on the template will not lead directly to the book titled &quot;German&quot; (which would in a sense be overriding other German textbooks on the bookshelf which could, for all we know, be even better than that one, or at least different), but rather to some sort of disambiguation page where the German-related textbooks are all listed and the user chooses which one(s) to look at. Extra work, but it may work and would keep the template list less cluttered, as you say. Someone's going to have to created the necessary disambiguation pages and maintain them (as new books emerge, requiring new disambig pages or updating of existing ones), and I don't see much evidence of there being a large, busy, active community here to do those sorts of things (as one gets on Wikipedia); do you think we have the human resources for it? Otherwise, it sounds fine to me.

As for the progress &quot;bars&quot;, we do need some sort of index of progress for some such decisions, and I think it should be (and is?) the responsibility of people working on books to keep them updated, and in their interest to do so if they want their work to have the visibility it deserves. But if somebody wanted to look at individual books and evaluate whether they deserve to have a higher progress indication (and so, perhaps, get onto the template list), I guess that would be okay too; but again, who is going to do it? --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 11:48, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

:Right, so I guess we're stuck with the progress bars, then.  Anyway, I guess I was advocating example #4 without remembering it.  Also, I suspect that creating the disambiguation pages requires a pretty small initial effort (I would make them bookshelves, like this one) will likely be maintained by the respective language book authors.  To avoid duplicating effort, we might use the transclusion mechanism to automatically merge the individual subbookshelves into this one.  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 12:06, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

{{Languages bookshelf (proposal 5)}}




How's this? I've made some prototype subshelves for English and Chinese, with the links appropriately replaced.  Also, I have noticed that the template was only locked so that registered users (i.e. not anonymous) could edit it, and have thus replaced it with your proposal #4 (perhaps somebody heard our pleas and downgraded the locking, or there was a misunderstanding) (and thanks for your note) -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 12:20, 10 June 2007 (UTC)

::It looks good to me, Kowey. If you would like to go ahead and fully implement the same idea throughout, you have my blessing. By the way, in the case of Chinese and Cantonese, my suggestion would be to keep it the way you have it now, with Cantonese ''both'' listed as a separate language ''and'' included in the Chinese bookshelf. I think it's the most practical way in that particular case. Well done! --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 13:48, 10 June 2007 (UTC)

== Language books quality ==

If I recall correctly, there was a wikibook: page that tried to suggest some best practices for writing language books; however, those practices seem to have the mix of good intentions + poor pedagogy that Junesun was talking about.  We might do well to hunt that page down and make it better! -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 11:22, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

:For what it's worth, I don't think [[Help:How_To_Build_An_Excellent_Wikibook_Teaching_Any_Language]] was the culprit.  If memory serves me right, the book I had in mind was quite painful (sorry... I am pretty clueless about pedagogy myself, so what do I know?) and all the language books except for [[Miskito]] and some others seemed to follow it like a template -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 11:25, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

Well, I've thought about this before, as apparently a number of us have, and it seems to me that if we can't actually stop people from writing books (or so-called &quot;books&quot;, in some cases) of dubious quality and usefulness, then that leaves us with the options of (1) creating other books, hoping that setting an example will eventually have some effect, or (2) offering advice, and hoping that it will at least sometimes be followed. I plan to try doing both at some point. It would be good if there were cooperation between some people on such projects. Such people would effectively self-select themselves (those who are not interested will probably remain uninterested) and my theory as that by being more active, our voice will eventually prevail. That seems to be, grosso modo, what happens on Wikipedia on the whole, don't you think.

Another thing I notice is that (predictably, I guess) there are plenty of moves to start new Wikibooks and much less work done to develop them. As Junesun says, most of the titles are actually pretty much useless as they stand. Not sure what can be done about that though, within the philosophy of Wikibooks. --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 11:57, 9 June 2007 (UTC)

:I'm writing a kind of &quot;wikibooklet&quot; for an audio course: [[Spanish by Choice]].

== Questionable links added ==

I see new links have been added to the bookshelf page, linking to [[LIL Esperanto 1]], [[LIL French 1]] and [[LIL German 1]]. After having a brief look at the target pages, I have my doubts about whether these are wikibooks at all, in which case as I understand it the links should not have been put here. But perhaps I'm mistaken; would someone else like to have a look and see what you think, please? Would the author of the pages and the new links like to explain here whether or not these are wikibooks? Thanks. No offence intended, but I think we need to be a bit coherent... --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 21:35, 10 June 2007 (UTC)

: I would hope that they are Wikibooks.  They are no different to other books on the site (except for being longer than two pages, perhaps).  Same GFDL license; same spirit of community authorship.  I sincerely hope that someone will one day be able to improve everything I have written.  I'm quite aware that if I simply write some lesson plans and wait for everyone to fill them in, I'll still be waiting twenty years from now.  After I have presented a completed text, the Wikibooks community can make any changes they please.

: You can download the &quot;mainstream&quot; French and German books as PDF files.  You will also be able to download my books directly from Wikibooks as PDF files as soon as I have finished making my own corrections to them.  (I made the assumption that it would not be acceptable to upload a 300-page rich-text file to Wikibook's servers.)

: My VR software doesn't understand PDF or Wikicode, but it is quite comfortable with rich-text.  That is why I want to finish making corrections to the text itself before I format the books as polished PDF documents.

:I hope that answers your question. --[[User:Lutonia|Lutonia]] 06:34, 11 June 2007 (UTC)

::Hi Lutonia, I appreciate your commitment to the spirit of community authorship and the GFDL.  That said, the purpose of the wikibooks and wikimedia sites is also partly technical, in that it allows people to edit the same document immediately (impulsively!) without any overhead, i.e. downloading the RTF source, learning about version control software (for instance) or about diffing and patching.  So unless you are willing to translate your books to wikicode and have them be edited with the (admittedly less than ideal) wiki software, wikibooks is really not the appropriate place for your books.  I'm sure the staff lounge would be a fine place to advertise your project and to attract collaborators.  But creating links like [[LIL French 1]], which do little than point to a PDF is not wiki-appropriate.  Also, I would understand your reluctance to switch to wikicode if you were working with a typesetting language [[LaTeX]], but since you're dealing with RTF anyway, it seems that you won't be losing much by switching to wikicode.  How about getting somebody technical to help you make the conversion?  We can figure out how to a PDF out of it later; it has been done before many times over -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 07:14, 11 June 2007 (UTC)

::Also, in case you were worried about convenience, there are tools which will let you edit the wikibooks content directly from a text editor.  There is a piece of software called MVS, which allows you to 'check out' pages from any mediawiki hosted site as if it were a CVS repository (if you're not sure what I'm going on about, it's no big deal).  These pages can then be edited in any editor, such as Emacs and 'committed'.  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 07:17, 11 June 2007 (UTC)

:::I am very keen to have the books converted into wikicode, and as soon as possible.  There are obvious benefits to a course which can be read online, a page at a time, and that contains clickablable hypertext.

:::However, I cannot make the conversion myself.  I cannot use a keyboard and my voice recognition software knows nothing about LaTeX or MVS.  I cannot use these editors.

:::As far as I can see, it makes a lot of sense for me to finish my editing, convert the document into a polished PDF file, upload it to Wikibooks, and then ask for the community's help in converting it to other formats.  It would be a waste of time to do the conversion right now, only to have to do another conversion a month later.

:::While someone is doing the conversion (it's not a five-minute task), it's not such a bad thing to have a  completed PDF file available for download, which people can read right away.

I've seen full text of [[Lithuanian]] in the requested books after I inserted Lithuanian. Why this very old indoeuropean language is not presented in common list?

[[User:78.62.22.250|78.62.22.250]] 09:28, 22 June 2007 (UTC)

::Inclusion of languages in the template (the &quot;common list&quot; as you call it) is no reflection of how &quot;important&quot; they are. It was agreed in recent discussion (see a little higher up on this page) to try to include languages that at least have the 25% progress bar. My own position is that all languages are important; this restriction is aimed at providing a manageable list and indicating to users the books that are likely to be most &quot;useful&quot; - simply because those books are minimally developed. Develop the books (or revise the progress bars if they are out of date - this should preferaby be done by books' authors, and taken on good faith) and the books can then be included in the template.

== High quality Public Domain courses online with audio ==

Some organisation have created [http://www.fsi-language-courses.net/ a page with PDFs and MP3s] of courses from the US Foreign Service Institute.  This is high quality material (although it dates from the 60s and 70s).  I say this mostly because it's often extensive: lots and lots of MP3s and course books of 150 pages or more.  Languages include Arabic, Cantonese, Mandarin,  Greek, French, Yoruba and more.  The organisation claims that they are public domain (which would make sense, these being govt produced).  We should definitely think about raiding these for our respective books.  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 11:24, 26 October 2007 (UTC)

==Language groupings==
Turkish is a European language but Azerbaijani (a dialect of Turkish) is an Asian language?
I know for political reasons Turkey is European, but it doesn't make sense linguistically.  (In that case Hungarian, Estonian and Finnish would be &quot;Asian&quot; too).  Maybe Azerbaijani should be European too, since Azerbaijan is partially in Europe.

:Or perhaps we should not divide languages by continent. Maybe doing so by language family (Indo-European, Afro-Asiatic, etc) would be less ambiguous.

::There has been a long discussion about this issue (see above) and the consensus was that a linguistically correct categorization is less useful for typical Wikibook readers, who are usually unaware of the linguistically correct language family they are looking for. Therefore, whenever there is a serious ambiguity, links should be added to point to the correct category.

== Learning through songs ==

Learning through songs is valuable, so I thought I'd mention that some songs on Youtube have the lyrics in subtitles, e.g. the Indonesian pop song [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GVxnyE8-7wU&amp;NR=1 Jadikan aku yang kedua]. 

On the one hand, I've read that it's harder to absorb information when it's in both spoken and written form (this was talking about Powerpoint presentations with text). On the other hand, it probably helps in language learning where the sound alone is not enough to pick up the words - and where the focus is less on the understanding the specific content, and more on making the connection between the sounds and the words. 

If we want to promote the use of this method, is it acceptable to link videos from the lesson pages? I'm guessing not, as they very likely will have copyright issues. If that is the case, I'll just add the idea to [[How to Learn a Language]].  --[[User:Chriswaterguy|Chriswaterguy]] ([[User talk:Chriswaterguy|talk]]) 20:18, 28 June 2008 (UTC)

:My experience with learning from songs is that you always run into copyright issues. Neither can you publish the lyrics nor a translation of the lyrics without a permission by the copyright holders. I'm not sure what can be done about this. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 14:09, 29 September 2008 (UTC)

== Church Latin ==

After reviewing the section for Latin, I feel that an entirely different section should be allowed to be created for Latin in the form that is in current use within the Catholic Church.  This is not to diminish the good work that has been done for the study of Republic Latin, but let us say the truth, it is not what is used or taught by Catholic clerics. This is not to say that people should not study the classics by any means, just to point out that someone wishing to study the form of Latin used in Vatican Documents, and in Catholic rituals would be better served by a different section with a different scope.  

It is still the same language to be sure, but there are lots of issues of Idiom and Vocabulary that would be very different.  Certainly you can understand what feelings of repression someone may feel if they are forced to learn Catholic Latin before they may move on to Caesar.  In the same way, many Catholics feels a sense of being misunderstood when we have to study Caesar first and read about pagan gods before we get to what we think is the good stuff, like the vulgate and the breviary.  

Also, the end goal is different.  In Classical studies, students are taught to decode the sentence (translate) and understand the final English result.  The focus is on translation, changing the Latin into English.  For some Catholics, that may be the case but many Catholics do not want to translate, they want to learn the various prayers, passages from the Bible, hymns, and Papal quoted in the original Latin and keep it in the Latin and understand it in the Latin.  

I would be more than happy to get to doing much of the work myself, and indeed it would not be that much work.  I am simply asking for you to allow the pages to be created and to be here and not to go behind taking out the &quot;j&quot;s or turning the &quot;u&quot;s back into &quot;v&quot;s.

:Hello there and welcome to the languages bookshelf! First of all: please sign your comments with &lt;nowiki&gt;--~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;. Even if you have no username, this will at least show the time when you wrote a comment. Second: Just go ahead and start a new wikibook. You'll find more information about how to start a new book here: [[Help:Starting_a_new_page_or_book]]. The most important issue is probably the name. Since &quot;Latin&quot; is already the title of the wikibook about Republic Latin, you should choose something different such as &quot;Church Latin&quot;. (It's more difficult to change the name of the book &quot;Latin&quot;, but I think you really shouldn't worry about that.) As you will see there are really not a lot of people working on language books right now. If someone takes out &quot;j&quot;s and turn &quot;u&quot;s to &quot;v&quot;s, just undo the changes and discuss the issue with the user. I'm sure everyone will understand and won't bother you again. And really: this is a very peaceful place. Welcome! :) --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 10:00, 20 November 2008 (UTC)

:::Great, I've added the book to the bookshelf. It is certainly OK if you want to proceed without a user name; however, I would recommend that you create a user account just to make it possible to attribute your contributions to a specific user. Imagine this scenario: you finish this book anonymously. One year later another user comes along and decides to rewrite the book in a totally inacceptable manner. If you then want to discuss these changes, you will have a ''much stronger'' position if you can be identified as the original author of the book. I think it is always ''in the interest of books and their readers'' that the main contributions can be attributed to specific users.

      <comment>/* Vowels */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Even though Romanian spelling is very phonetic, a lot of foreigners find the language difficult. The accent and sounds are very similar to Italian (with slight Slavic influences), so remember to sound every letter clearly. Also, sounds very rarely differ between words (i.e. the letter '''s''' is always pronounced the same, everytime, unlike in English).

In the pronunciation guide, X-SAMPA will be used to help those people who are familiar with it, or the IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet), in pronouncing Romanian. For those unfamiliar with it, the IPA is a phonetic alphabet designed to help in the description of foreign sounds, and is used extensively by linguists. A good place to start learning the IPA is [http://www.ling.hf.ntnu.no/ipa/full/ here].

X-SAMPA is an ASCII method of transcribing the IPA. A guide to it can be found [http://www.diku.dk/hjemmesider/studerende/thorinn/xsamchart.gif here].

; i (i) : in most cases, like the 'ee' in &quot;beet,&quot; X-SAMPA /i/. At the end of a word when following a consonant, however, it palatizes the preceeding consonant, X-SAMPA /_j/.&lt;br&gt;{{audio|Near-close near-front unrounded vowel.ogg|Hear the sound for ''i''}}

Many states have developed '''curriculum standards''' for their public schools. These standards give an '''age-appropriate outline''' and '''structure''' that can be used to develop textbooks and supporting materials for all schoolgoing ages. 

The standards are in fact ''quite useful''. They are painstaking and exhaustive organizations of material with regard to the appropriate level of the curriculum. Teams of trained professionals have already done a big chunk of the work in developing high-quality textbooks. It falls to the contributors at Wikibooks to flesh out this work and deliver it in a way that will be useful and pertinent.

Note that standards neither dictate how the material should be ''presented'', nor how students should be ''treated'' based on their progress regarding established learning goals. Rather, the standards are an outline of essential concepts to be included, as well as a suggestion to how to structure them. Standards are often credited with improving educational attainment in schools.  Another way to look at standards is the state telling students, parents and teachers what not to teach.

==Why use standards?==
*In order to be '''used by a class in a real school''' the book must adhere to set standards 
*Standards compliance gives the books an '''authority''' equal to other textbooks
*Once we have one or two top-quality, standards-compliant books on the site, they will serve as a '''sales tool''' and bring '''attention''' and '''credibility''', which opens us up both to 
**more '''people using our books''' and therefore served by our labor
**more '''donations''' from institutional givers, which could translate to less site down time and new software features

==Standards in Australia==

This list gives an accessible resource for Australians who want to write textbooks for the Australian curriculum. These will vary by State, though certain things will be covered on a federal level. The standards are usually decided by the Department for Education and Training (in Victoria) and affect all primary school, secondary school, TAFE (technical and further education) and university students studying an accredited Australian course in an Australian educational institution (or an international institution offering Australian curriculum as part of its offering).

==Standards in New Zealand==
The [http://www.nzqa.govt.nz New Zealand Qualifications Authority] has produced a wide range (thousands) of modular &quot;unit&quot; standards that set out the learning objectives and assessment criteria for almost all topics taught in New Zealand schools and tertiary institutions.  Many of these are competency based standard at a topic level within a subject.  

Text book authors may find this approach useful for segmenting their books into pages or topics and pitching the topic to an appropriate audience.

Note: Level 1 standards are taught in Year 11 (14-16 year olds) while level 7 standards are at a tertiary institution graduate level.  (Qualifications are attained by achieving the required unit standards.)

==Standards in the United Kingdom==

The [http://www.nc.uk.net/index.html National Curriculum Online] from the [http://www.qca.org.uk/ Qualifications and Curriculum Authority] seems specific to England but also has links to sites that are specific to Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales.

==Standards in the United States of America==
Alaska, Calfornia, Florida, Virginia and Ohio are states that utilize K-12 standards for public schooling. Mid-Continent Research for Education and Learning (McREL) has an excellent database of U.S. standards that are aligned for comparison.

===Advanced Placement===
The Advanced Placement® program, run by the College Entrance Examination Board, allows high school students to receive college/university level credit in various subjects. Since these standards must reflect to some level both high-school level and university standards, they may be of some help in creating standards-based textbooks.

==Standards in Canada==
Curriculum standards in Canada are established for each province/territory in all K-12 subjects.  Each province/territory tends to suggest that their curriculum standards are high and this contribution to learning as significant.  There are some efforts to find common ground on standards between jurisdictions, but these are not maintained or communicated in such a way that allow portability or interoperability across various systems.  A Pan-Canadian Science Curriculum [http://www.cmec.ca/science/framework/] was created in 1990's, but is not utilized.

== Lernen 7-2 ~ Tour de France ==

(aus Wikipedia, der freien Enzyklopädie)&lt;br&gt;
Die ''Tour de France'' ist eines der berühmtesten und wichtigsten sportlichen Großereignisse überhaupt.  Seit 1903 wird die Tour alljährlich - mit Ausnahme der Zeit des Ersten und Zweiten Weltkriegs - drei Wochen lang im Juli ausgetragen und führt dabei in wechselnder Streckenführung quer durch Frankreich und das nahe Ausland. 

Eine Tour de France der Frauen (''grande boucle féminine'') mit deutlich kürzeren Etappen wird seit 1984 gefahren. Sie steht medial völlig im Schatten ihres männlichen Pendants.
