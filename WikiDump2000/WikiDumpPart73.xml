''Ale, Mustard and Winter Vegetable Pie'' is a [[Cookbook:Vegan cuisine|vegan]] [[Cookbook:Pie|pie]].

==Ingredients==
*1 [[Cookbook:Tablespoon|tablespoon]] [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|olive oil]]
*2 cloves [[Cookbook:Garlic|garlic]], crushed
*1 [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrot]], finely [[Cookbook:Dice|diced]]
*½ [[Cookbook:Parsnip|parsnip]], diced
*1 [[Cookbook:Leek|leek]], cut into fine rings
*5 [[Cookbook:Mushroom|mushroom]]s, sliced
*¼ - ½ cup dried TVP ([[Cookbook:Textured Vegetable Protein|textured vegetable protein]])
*½ tablespoon [[Cookbook:Marmite|Marmite]] or [[Cookbook:Vegemite|Vegemite]]
*200 ml (3/4 cup) boiling water
*2 heaped tablespoon [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*2 heaped tablespoon wholegrain [[Cookbook:Mustard|mustard]] (try a green peppercorn mustard, if available)
*200 ml (3/4 cup) rich, dark ale (try a nice Porter)
*black [[Cookbook:Pepper|pepper]] to taste

For the mash topping:
*1 [[Cookbook:Potato|potato]], [[Cookbook:Chop|chopped]]
*½ parsnip, chopped
*½ small [[Cookbook:Turnip|turnip]] or [[Cookbook:Rutabaga|rutabaga]], chopped
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Soy|Soy]] [[Cookbook:Margarine|margarine]]

==Procedure==

#Reconstitute the TVP: in a bowl, mix TVP, the 200 ml boiling water and Marmite, and let sit.
#Prepare the mash topping:  drop the potato, turnip or rutabaga, and ½ parsnip in a [[Cookbook:Saucepan|saucepan]] of rapidly boiling water (this quickly destroys the enzymes that would otherwise have a detrimental effect on the vitamin content).  Bring back to the boil and simmer until potato is soft (about 20 minutes). When cooked, drain off the water, add the margarine and mash until creamy smooth. Set aside.
#Put olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat and add the leek, garlic and carrot and ½ parsnip and [[Cookbook:Sautéing|sauté]] until the carrot is soft.  Then add the mushrooms and cook a minute or two more.
#Add the flour and stir like mad for a solid 30 seconds. Still stirring, add the TVP and its soaking broth to soak up the flour and thicken. Then add the mustard, ale and some black pepper. Stir to mix all very well. Simmer for about 10 minutes to thicken the sauce.
#Pour into a [[Cookbook:Casserole|casserole]] dish, top with the potato/rutabaga/parsnip mash, smooth over, and bake at 180°C (350°F) for 20 to 30 minutes or until top is beginning to brown. Remove from oven, let rest a minute, then serve.

This is excellent hearty autumn and winter fare and very tasty.

{{High_School_Mathematics_Extensions/Solutions/TOC}}

=== Question 1 ===
Is there a rule to determine whether a 3-digit number is divisible by 11? If yes, derive that rule.

''' Solution '''

Let ''x'' be a 3-digit number We have 
:&lt;math&gt;x = 100a + 10b + c \!&lt;/math&gt;
now
:&lt;math&gt;x \equiv a + 10b + c \equiv a - b + c \pmod{11} \!&lt;/math&gt;
We can conclude a 3-digit number is divisible by 11 if and only if the sum of first and last digit minus the second is divisible by 11.

=== Question 2 ===
Show that ''p'', ''p'' + 2 and ''p'' + 4 cannot all be primes. (''p'' a positive integer and is great than 3)

'''Solution '''

We look at the arithmetic mod 3, then ''p'' slotted into one of three categories
:1st category
::&lt;math&gt;p \equiv 0 \pmod{3} \!&lt;/math&gt;
::we deduce ''p'' is not prime, as it's a multiple of 3
:2nd category
::&lt;math&gt;p \equiv 1 \pmod{3} \!&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;p + 2\equiv 0 \pmod{3} \!&lt;/math&gt;
::so p + 2 is not prime
:3rd category
::&lt;math&gt;p \equiv 2 \pmod{3} \!&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt;p + 4\equiv 0 \pmod{3} \!&lt;/math&gt;
::therefore ''p'' + 4 is not prime
Therefore ''p'', ''p'' + 2 and ''p'' + 4 cannot all be primes.

=== Question 3 ===
Find ''x''
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
x \equiv 1^7 + 2^7 + 3^7 + 4^7 + 5^7 + 6^7 + 7^7 \ \pmod{7}\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

''' Solution '''

Notice that
:&lt;math&gt;-a \equiv 7-a \pmod 7 \!&lt;/math&gt;.
Then
:&lt;math&gt;1^7 \equiv (7-6)^7 \equiv (-6)^7 \equiv -(6^7) \pmod 7 \!&lt;/math&gt;.
Likewise,
:&lt;math&gt;2^7 \equiv -5^7 \pmod 7 \!&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;3^7 \equiv -4^7 \pmod 7 \!&lt;/math&gt;.
Then
:{|-
|&lt;math&gt;x \!&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;\equiv 1^7 + 2^7 + 3^7 + 4^7 + 5^7 + 6^7 + 7^7  \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\equiv 1^7 + 2^7 + 3^7 - 3^7 - 2^7 -1^7 + 7^7  \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|-
|
|&lt;math&gt;\equiv 0 \pmod{7}  \!&lt;/math&gt;
|}

=== Question 4 ===
9. Show that there are no integers ''x'' and ''y'' such that
:&lt;math&gt;x^2 - 5y^2 = 3  \!&lt;/math&gt;

'''Solution '''

Look at the equation mod 5, we have
:&lt;math&gt;x^2 = 3 \pmod{ 5} \!&lt;/math&gt;
but
:{|-
|&lt;math&gt;1^2 \equiv 1 \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;2^2 \equiv 4 \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;3^2 \equiv 4 \!&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&lt;math&gt;4^2 \equiv 1 \!&lt;/math&gt;
|}
therefore there does not exist ''a'' x such that
:&lt;math&gt;x^2 \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \!&lt;/math&gt;

=== Question 5 ===
Let ''p'' be a prime number. Show that

'''(a)'''
:&lt;math&gt;
(p-1)! \equiv -1\ \pmod{p}
&lt;/math&gt;
where 
:&lt;math&gt;
n! = 1 \cdot 2 \cdot 3 \cdots (n-1) \cdot n 
&lt;/math&gt;
E.g. 3! = 1&amp;times;2&amp;times;3 = 6

'''(b)'''
Hence, show that
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1} \equiv \frac{p - 1}{2}! \pmod{p}&lt;/math&gt;
for ''p'' &amp;equiv; 1 (mod 4)

''' Solution '''

'''a)''' If ''p'' = 2, then it's obvious. So we suppose ''p'' is an odd prime. Since ''p'' is prime, some deep thought will reveal that every distinct element multiplied by some other element will give 1. Since
:&lt;math&gt;(p - 1)! = (p - 1)(p - 2)(p - 3) \cdots 2  \!&lt;/math&gt;
we can pair up the inverses (two numbers that multiply to give one), and (p - 1) has itself as an inverse, therefore it's the only element not &quot;eliminated&quot;
:{|-
|&lt;math&gt;(p - 1)! \equiv (p - 1) \equiv - 1 \!&lt;/math&gt;
|}
as required.

'''b)''' From part a)
:&lt;math&gt;-1 \equiv (p - 1)! \!&lt;/math&gt;
since ''p'' = 4''k'' + 1 for some positive integer ''k'', (p - 1)! has 4''k'' terms
:&lt;math&gt;-1 = 1\times2 \times 3 \times \cdots 2k \times (-2k) \cdots \times(- 3) \times (- 2) \times (- 1) &lt;/math&gt;
there are an even number of minuses on the right hand side, so
:&lt;math&gt;-1 = (1\times2 \times 3 \times \cdots 2k)^2&lt;/math&gt;
it follows
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1} = 1\times 2\times 3\times ... 2k&lt;/math&gt;
and finally we note that p = 4k + 1, we can conclude
:&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1} = \frac{p - 1}{2}!&lt;/math&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The romance category of plays contains four plays. They were all written late in Shakespeare's career.

[[/The Tempest/]] is set on an island. There is a powerful opening scene with a ship, where some Italian noblemen are taken to the island. All this is designed by Prospero who is a Milanese duke. The other people who live on the island are Miranda, Ariel and Caliban. Caliban is a monster and Ariel is a spirit. Miranda is Prospero's daughter. In the course of the play she falls in love for the first time, with Fernindad. There are other interesting pairings in the play, and Caliban and Ariel shake up the action as well, especially Ariel, who is tired of being Prospero's loyal servant. In the end he is left free. Meanwhile Caliban is tempted to drink by two less reputable members of the nobility.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Those extra steps===
I cannot agree with putting in those extra steps, they are omitted for a purpose. It is to force the reader to think actively about the intermediate steps, so that he/she is more involved in the learning process. This book is never meant to be a passive experience, those steps must be removed. The reader must struggle with how we arrive at a result inorder to learn. [[User:Xiaodai|Zhuo]] 15:09, 24 Dec 2003 (UTC)
:Second thought, those extra steps are not harmful.[[User:Xiaodai|Zhuo]] 15:14, 24 Dec 2003 (UTC)

===an error?===
at 2.3.1 Simplification it is written:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix} 
(x + y)(x' + y') &amp;=&amp; x(x' + y') + y(x' + y')\\
&amp;=&amp; xx' + x'y' + yx' + yy'\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

but shouldn't it be

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix} 
(x + y)(x' + y') &amp;=&amp; x(x' + y') + y(x' + y')\\
&amp;=&amp; xx' + xy' + yx' + yy'\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

=== I consider this chapter to be done ===
I deleted some material and now i consider this chapter to be done.[[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 04:29, 5 Jul 2004 (UTC)

== My Kudos... ==

Thanks! very interesting and informative...

==Reasons for Particular Interest==

In &quot;Laws of Boolean Algebra, Simplification&quot;, you mention, quote: &quot;From those two examples we can see that complex-looking expressions can be reduced very significantly. Of particular interest are expressions of the form of a sum-of-product [...]&quot;

I think it would be of interest (no pun intented *g*) to mention ''where'' (as in what field) SOP terms are of particular interest, e.g. to reduce the often lengthy expressions as obtained by solving ''Karnaugh Maps'' (maybe other fields do distract a beginner less, though). Probably also a few more words on the ''why'' would be of interest, e.g.: in practical calculations, each AND, OR and NOT comes at certain costs (which may differ in hardware and software design); thus the goal must me to reduce the overall cost. (This also would introduce the notion ''cost'' in a pretty elegant way, which could be elaborated some more, e.g.: circuit design with NAND logic vs. implementation cost in software requiring NOT and AND etc.)

Just a few thoughts on an overall really nice article.

== mistake? ==

In section 2.3.1 (Laws of Boolean Algebra/Simplification), after the message saying &quot;If the next step is unclear, try constructing truth tables [...],&quot; the statement '''xy + z + x'y'''' is simplified to 1. I don't understand why; the statement is false if x=0, y=1, and z=0. Could someone please clarify this?

[[Special:Contributions/24.6.101.190|24.6.101.190]] 02:35, 18 November 2007 (UTC)

: Now that you point it out, I see you are right.
: I deleted that last erroneous line in the &quot;proof&quot;.
: Should we leave it like that, ending at '''xy + z + x'y'''' with no further simplification possible?
: Or should we modify the starting point and all the intermediate statements so that it actually does reduce down to 1?

== AND - an Operator a function ? ==

I'm referring to the Table where x an y assume different states i.e - T or F. The heading is given as &quot;AND Function&quot;. &quot;AND&quot; is a logical operator, it's never a function.

== More introduction? ==

The name of this section is &quot;logic&quot;.  There was a very short intro to logic in general, then you jumped into Boolean logic.  To make this page more self-contained, it seems that the basics of logic themselves should be explained at the beginning.  Perhaps there is another page that you could refer the reader to?  In the middle of the page, you explain &quot;proposition&quot;.  This part could be moved up to the first section.  Then, you could explain &quot;AND&quot; and &quot;OR&quot;.  Then, your tables in Section 2 would make more sense to an uninformed reader.  I'm keeping in mind that the beauty of such pages is that students who have not learned this material before can teach themselves from this.[[User:Lizmaemom|Lizmaemom]] ([[User talk:Lizmaemom|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Lizmaemom|contribs]]) 23:49, 3 July 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Points and lines are two of the most fundamental concepts in Geometry, but they are also the most difficult to define. We can describe intuitively their characteristics, but there is no set definition for them: they, along with the plane, are the undefined terms of geometry. All other geometric definitions and concepts are built on the undefined ideas of the point, line and plane. Nevertheless, we shall try to define them.

==Point==

A point is an exact location in space.
A point is denoted by a dot.
A point has no size.
A point is always has a capital letter.

==Line==
As for a line segment, we specify a line with two points.  Starting with the corresponding line segment, we find other line segments that share at least two points with the original line segment.  In this way we extend the original line segment indefinitely.  The set of all possible line segments findable in this way constitutes a line.  A line extends indefinitely in a single dimension.  Its length, having no limit, is infinite.  Like the line segments that constitute it, it has no width or height.  You may specify a line by specifying any two points within the line.  For any two points, only one line passes through both points.  On the other hand, an unlimited number of lines pass through any single point.

==Ray==
We construct a ray similarly to the way we constructed a line, but we extend the line segment beyond only one of the original two points.  A ray extends indefinitely in one direction, but ends at a single point in the other direction.  That point is called the end-point of the ray.  Note that a line segment has two end-points, a ray one, and a line.
An angle Can be formed when two rays meet at a common point. The rays are the sides of the angle. The point of the end of two rays is called the vertex.

==Plane==
A point exists in zero dimensions.  A line exists in one dimension, and we specify a line with two points.  A plane exists in two dimensions.  We specify a plane with three points.  Any two of the points specify a line.  All possible lines that pass through the third point and '''any''' point in the line make up a plane.  In more obvious language, a plane is a flat surface that extends indefinitely in its two dimensions, length and width.  A plane has no height.

==Space==
Space exists in three dimensions.  Space is made up of all possible planes, lines, and points.  It extends indefinitely in all directions.

==N-dimensional Space==
Mathematics can extend space beyond the three dimensions of length, width, and height.  We then refer to &quot;normal&quot; space as 3-dimensional space.  A 4-dimensional space consists of an infinite number of 3-dimensional spaces. Etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{English in Use}}
Here are some hints on '''how to express the date and time in [[English]]''':

==Date==

*  The day of the month, the month, and the year:
** Use ''on'' + ordinal of the day. ''On the 1st of June''.
** Use ''in + only'' and the month. ''In June''.
** Use ''about the'' + date (for approximate dates). ''About the 25th of December''.
* Day of the week: precedes ''on''. Example: ''open on Sundays''.
* Ask the date: ''what's the date'' and ''what day is it (or today)?''.
* Answer a date asking: ''today's the'' + ordinal.  ''Today's the 16th.''
* Century: ''in the'' + the ordinal of the century. Example: ''in the 20th century''.
* Decade:
** Precedes ''in'' with the number in plural: ''in the 1990s''.
** Follows ''something'' for undetermined year of the decade, in other words: ''in 1980 something''.
* Era:
** A.D. = ''Anno Domini'', [[Latin]] for ''in the year of the Lord'', in other words the Christian Era.
** B.C. = ''Before Christ'', in other words ''before Christian Era''.

==Time==
*Ask the time: ''What time is it?'' and ''What is the time?''
*Answer: ''It is'' and the part of the hour or the minutes, seconds: ''It is five o'clock''.
*Parts of the day:
**[[wiktionary:morning|morning]]: ''in the morning''
**[[wiktionary:afternoon|afternoon]]: ''in the afternoon''
**[[wiktionary:evening|evening]]: ''in the evening''
**[[wiktionary:night|night]]: ''at night''
**Halves:
***[[wiktionary:AM|AM]]
***[[wiktionary:PM|PM]]
*Parts of the hour:
** [[wiktionary:O'clock|O'clock]], for example: ''It is one o'clock'' (1:00).
** [[wiktionary:Past|Past]] and [[wiktionary:to|to]]:
*** ''It is 4 minutes past 5 (5:04)'' (or ''4 minutes after 5'' in USA).
*** ''It is 20 to 5 (4:40)'' (or ''20 before 5'' in USA).
** [[wiktionary:Quarter|Quarter]]:
*** A quarter past, for example: ''It is a quarter past 9 (9:15)'' (or ''a quarter after 9'' in USA).
*** A quarter to, for example: ''It is a quarter to 12 (11:45)'' (or ''a quarter before 12'' in USA).
** [[wiktionary:Half|Half]] past, for example: ''It is half past 9 (9:30)''.
*Answer to ''when?'':
**Certain time: ''At'', for example: ''At 5 p.m.''.
**Proximity:
***Nearly, about : ''It is about 10 o'clock''.
***Just after: ''It is just after 10'' (a few minutes past 10).
* Synonyms for times:
** ''Noon'', ''Midday'': 12:00 in the 24 hour clock. ''It is 5 past noon'' (12:05).
** ''Midnight'': 0:00 in the 24 hour clock. ''Half past midnight'' (00:30).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The sound that ''ng'' and ''ngh'' make in Vietnamese is by far the hardest sound for Westerners to make. ''Ng'' and ''ngh'' simply make the last sound in &quot;[[Wiktionary:king|king]]&quot; or &quot;[[Wiktionary:running|running]]&quot; (as long as you don't make the hard /g/ sound at the end). The problem arises when ''ng'' or ''ngh'' come at the beginning of a word, as the common family name ''Nguyễn'' clearly demonstrates. Here, the speaker has to isolate the /ŋ/ sound, which even many Western dictionaries don't recognize in their pronunciation guides. (Those that do tend to represent it as /ng/.) This lesson will help you to at least pronounce the /ŋ/ sound well enough for a [[Vietnamese/Native speaker|native listener]].

In Vietnamese, the common family name ''Nguyễn'' is occasionally abbreviated ''Ng̃'' – that is, an &quot;N&quot; and a &quot;g&quot; with a tilde (&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;~&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;) over it.
|}

=== Oral exercise 1: Sing-along ===

For this exercise, follow the directions below. It may be a good idea to repeat each step until you've mastered it:

# Say the English word &quot;sing-along&quot; the way you normally would.
# Take the /s/ sound away from the beginning.
# Replace &quot;along&quot; with the &quot;eah&quot; in &quot;yeah.&quot;
# If you can, take the /i/ (long e) sound away from the beginning as well, without making the hard /g/ sound.
#: If you can't do that, try to turn the /i/ sound into a quick schwa (/ə/) sound.

Hopefully, you've just pronounced the word ''[[Wiktionary:nghe|nghe]]''! It should sound something like [[:Image:vi-nghe.ogg|this]].

=== Tips ===

# Touch the back of your tongue to the roof of your mouth.
# Be careful not to make the hard /g/ sound afterwards.

__NOTOC__

'''Vegan cuisine''' uses no animal products, such as meat, dairy, or eggs.  This is more restrictive than [[Cookbook:Vegetarian cuisine|vegetarian cuisine]], which allows non-meat animal products.  All vegan recipes are therefore vegetarian, though not all vegetarian meals are vegan. See [[w:Veganism|Wikipedia's Veganism article]] for reasons why people are vegan, the history of veganism, and other vegan-related information.

Vegans should be attentive to their intake of vitamins B (especially B12) and D, calcium, iodine, and fatty acids. The [http://www.vegansociety.com/html/food/nutrition/ Vegan Society's nutrition pages] have more detailed information on this subject. See also [[w:Vegan nutrition|Vegan nutrition]] on Wikipedia.

When preparing non-vegan recipes in accordance with a vegan diet, meat, eggs, honey, and dairy are replaced with a substitute ingredient. Substitute ingredients try to replicate the taste and texture of an ingredient or its other useful properties. Substituting for an ingredient works to greater or lesser degrees, depending upon the recipe, and some ingredients are almost impossible to replace. For more information see [[Cookbook:Vegan Substitutions|Vegan Substitutions]].

Many vegans choose to avoid specialty substitute ingredients, as these products are often highly processed and high in sodium and allergen ingredients. Cooking with wholefoods such as unprocessed legumes, grains, nuts, seeds, fruits and vegetables can be a healthier approach to veganism. Many non-vegans will also enjoy these foods. Vegans often find that cooking 'real' foods rather than substitutes result in higher quality, better tasting meals that appeal to vegans and non-vegans alike.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{cleanup|This page is from a first person point of view, and uses an example rather than explaining how to write a good free response entry.}}

* Pay attention to the text--the methods the author uses, or the language the author uses (preferably both). Get your ideas through to the reader before labelling something as a rhetorical technique. If you do use names of rhetorical techniques, do not simply throw them out there. Explain why.
 you can used tamplets to help start your response paragraph.

* The rules for grading the FRQ change radically on the different AP tests.  Be careful.


Ex: &quot;One nation of the people, by the people, and for the people&quot; is famous in part because Abraham Lincoln made a grammatically appealing statement. (Topic sentence) By using the prepositions (&quot;of&quot;, &quot;by&quot;, &quot;for&quot;), he reinforces his point by using parallel structure, and a repetitive vocative anaphora which harkens back to the role that the &quot;people&quot; play in making up a &quot;nation&quot;.

Reasons why this is a good passage:
* It uses quotations from the passage.
* It analyzes the parts of speech (prepositions) that add meaning, the sentence structure (my reference to parallel structure).
* It has a nice sentence to conclude the paragraph, naturally and effectively. This could be seen as a negative if it detracts from the topic of the paragraph or adds irrelevant or extraneous information.
* It uses the word &quot;vocative&quot; and &quot;refers&quot; and has a high level of diction. I really think that your ideas are always more important than diction, so please do not memorize a vocabulary list and agonize over diction during the 40-minute essay period. 

Vocative comes from the Latin (vocare) and is similar to other English word such as &quot;vocation&quot;. It means &quot;call&quot;. The &quot;-ive&quot; postfix normally means you are looking at a noun.

&lt;p&gt;Miss Winter&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AP English&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;11 September 2003&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;center&gt;Free response: A person's identity is determined at birth&lt;/center&gt;
:When a person is born, their identity is mostly unformed. The experiences in a person's life form their values and views, the most important part of their identity. However, many cultural barriers, like race, are determined at birth; these later impact the formation of their identity.
:A person's identity is mostly taught to them. This is demonstrated by the actions of True Son in &quot;The Light in the Forest&quot; by Conrad Richter and of Thomas Black Bull in &quot;When the Legends Die&quot; by Hal Borland. When both boys were forced out of living in the lifestyle of the Native Americans, they both held closest to the values taught to them in their childhood. When True Son was forced out of his Native American family and into his biological, white family, True Son hated being with the white people because he had been taught that they were his enemies.

:Yet why, in the end, was True Son sympathetic to a boy who reminded him of his biological brother? This is a combination of two parts of True Son's life. The Native Americans had told True Son about the slaughtering of Native American villages, including children, by the white man, and had told True Son that Native Americans didn't kill children. After seeing that the Native Americans of True Son's tribe had killed and scalped a white girl, True Son knew the Native Americans wouldn't go out of their way not to kill a child. The other experience in his life that impacted True Son's decision was when he was forced back into his biological family. The only person who accepted True Son as acting like a Native American was True Son's brother. Because of True Son's experiences, a boy on the raft that was going to be ambushed reminded True Son of his own brother. Experiences later in life can influence a person's identity, in addition to experiences in a person's childhood.

:Thomas Black Bull was also heavily influenced by his early boyhood. The lifestyle that Thomas held on tightest to was the lifestyle Thomas grew up in – the way of the Native American. Even after being forced into white culture, Thomas remembered how he was brought up. Thomas' mother's thriftiness is remembered by Thomas when Ray is drunk and has several thousand dollars. Thomas prevented Ray '''[editing needed]'''  At the end of the book, Thomas finally finds peace in returning to his roots by living for a short time in the “old way,” the way of the Native Americans, and then going back to live in his home town.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Email spam (or just &quot;Spam&quot;) is unsolicited email, similar to conventional &quot;junk mail&quot;, but often on a larger scale.

Spam is estimated to have cost U.S. organizations over $10 billion (in lost productivity) in 2003.

Various software products are available to block or filter spam.  Even lawmakers are stepping up to fight spam- in the United States the Can-Spam Act of 2003 was passed into law.

&quot;Spammers&quot; - people or organizations responsible for sending out email spam - use large lists of email addresses that are collected in a number of ways. One of these means is by using computer programs that search websites for email addresses. An email address that appears on a website is therefore more likely to get spammed, other things being equal. There are various ways of preventing your email being harvested in this way. One is to include it as an image rather than a link. This is not ideal, though, because it means firstly that people will have to type the address themselves, and secondly, it makes the address inaccessible to blind people, or people who browse without images. An alternative, better method, is to use a small piece of 'JavaScript' to insert the email address into the page when it is displayed, keeping it out of the html which an email-collecting spam program might look at.  One final method is to create a contact form to display on your website.  The website user would fill out the form which when submitted forwards the message to you without displaying your email address.  This final method has one drawback in that it circumvents the user's email system and does not provide the user with a record of the email that they sent.

I have also seen many people try the format of me@REMOVETHISaol.com or whatever. The person who has a genuine interest in emailing you will remove the REMOVETHIS part of the eddress before sending, but programmes that gather email addresses en-masse will use it as-is - thus, you do not receive spam. One must be fairly inventive to make this effective; the instance given would be algorithmically handled by most site-scraping email bots.

In addition, there is a new anti-spam feature now availible. Named the &quot;Challenge/Response System&quot;, this either sends a link, or a word-verification page to a user, the first time they e-mail you. The user must either click the link or enter the word to verify they are not a spamming program. After this, you get the e-mail and they're added to your allow list.

A study, by Brockmann &amp; Company IT consultants showed that challenge-response proved to be superior to appliances, hosted spam filters and commercial filters.Brockmann surveyed more than 500 businesses, with 40% of the respondents having IT responsibilities. The independently funded study resulted in the creation of a spam index to measure how satisfied workers were with their spam technologies.

Despite being less sophisticated than filtering technology sold by antispam and antivirus vendors, the challenge-response method was twice as effective as hosted services for spam prevention. According to the survey, 67% of challenge-response users specified that they are very satisfied with their email experience as compared to next highest technology, hosted services, in which 42% reported that they were very satisfied. Commercial software filters, such as those produced by McAfee, Symantec and Trend Micro, scored the lowest satisfying only 22% of respondents.(SearchSecurity.com, Robert Westervelt Jul. 2007)

Spam is a very common thing and at one point or another it is something that we have all had. Spam is not only an annoying email, it is a tactics for marketing. However many times you have received this type of email, it is becoming more and more dangerous. It can be generated by businesses as well as individuals. It is used to promote products and is also brought about by things like forwarding ( things like jokes, images or chain letters) spam can be used to gather information from your computer if opened as well as used to send out viruses. It is becoming an increasing threat. Spam has become such an issue, that people now have to have an entire email address just as a &quot;throw away account&quot; an email address specifically catered toward junk mail because if we were to let it, it would take up about 90% of our inbox's, not only is this an issue for our email account but it is also being directed towards our phone, and needs to be handled with caution

== Introduction ==
As soon as a child first learns about numbers, they become interested in big ones, a million, a billion, a trillion. They even make up their own, a zillion etc. One of the first mathematical questions a child asks is &quot;what is the largest number?&quot; This will often lead to a short explanation that there are infinitely many numbers. 

But there are many different ''types'' of infinity - in fact, there are infinite types of infinity! This chapter will try to explain what some of these types mean and the differences between them.

==Finite and Infinite Sets==

There was once a mathematician called Georg Cantor who created a new branch of mathematics called '''set theory''' in the late 19th century. Set theory involves collections of numbers or objects. Here's a set:

:&lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3,4,5\}&lt;/math&gt;

This set consists of five elements, namely the first five natural numbers. Now consider the set:

:&lt;math&gt;\{6,7,8,9,10\}&lt;/math&gt;

Are these sets of the same size? Yes, they are. This is because they both have five elements. As we will see later, this method of comparing sizes does not work for all sets. An alternate method for comparing set sizes is to match elements of sets in a one-one fashion.

Think of a small child who wants to compare the number of marbles she has with her brother's collection. Let's say she doesn't know how to count beyond ten. She can still compare the sizes of their collections of marbles by lining up their marbles in two parallel lines. The line on the left contains her marbles while the one on the right contains her brother's. If each marble on the left is aligned with exactly one marble on the right, then they both have the same number of marbles.

We can use the same idea to compare infinite sets. If we can find a way to pair up one member of set A with one member of set B, and if there are no members of A without a partner in B and vice versa then we can say that set A and set B have the same number of members. Formally, two sets &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; are of the same size if there is a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; such that for every &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;f(a)&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt; and moreover, for every &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;, there exists an &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(a) = b&lt;/math&gt;. 

====Example====
Consider our previous example. We want to know if the sets &lt;math&gt;\{1,2,3,4,5\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{6,7,8,9,10\}&lt;/math&gt; have the same size. We can create the following matching.

====Example====
Let Set N be all counting numbers. N is called the set of natural numbers. 1,2,3,4,5,6,... and so on. Let Set B be the negative numbers -1,-2,-3, ... and so on. Can the members of N and B be paired up? The formal way of saying this is &quot;Can A and B be put into a one to one correspondence&quot;? 

Obviously the answer is yes. 1 in set N corresponds with -1 in B. Likewise:
:'''N''' &amp;nbsp; '''B'''
:1 &amp;nbsp; -1
:2 &amp;nbsp; -2
:3 &amp;nbsp; -3
and so on. Here, the one-one function that maps from A to B is &lt;math&gt;f(x) = -x&lt;/math&gt;.

So useful is the set of counting numbers that any set that can be put into a one to one correspondence with it is said to be ''countably infinite''.

====Example====
The set of integers is the set containing all elements from the set N, the set B and the element 0. That is 

{... -3,-2,-1, 0, 1, 2, 3, ...}

The set of integers is usually denoted by Z.  Note that N the set of natural numbers is a subset of Z. All members of N are in Z, but not all members of Z are in N.

'''Is the set of integers countably infinite?''' In other words, can the set of integers be put in one-one correspondence with the set of all natural numbers?

Since the set N is contained in the set Z, we may be tempted to declare that these two sets are not of the same size. However, we can 

:'''Z''' &amp;nbsp; '''N'''
: &amp;nbsp;0 &amp;nbsp; 1
: -1 &amp;nbsp; 2
: &amp;nbsp;1 &amp;nbsp; 3
: -2 &amp;nbsp; 4
and so on. We can write this one-one correspondence as a function

&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \left\{\begin{array}{cl}
\frac{x - 1}{2} &amp; x \text{ is odd} \\
\frac{-x}{2} &amp; x \text{ is even}
\end{array} 
\right.
&lt;/math&gt;

We can verify that this function generates all the integers in Z from the natural numbers in N.

Strange indeed! A subset of Z (namely the natural numbers) has the same size as Z itself! Infinite sets are not like ordinary finite sets. In fact this is sometimes used as a definition of an infinite set. '''An infinite set is any set which can be put into a one to one correspondence with at least one of its subsets'''. Rather than saying &quot;The number of members&quot; of a set, people sometimes use the word '''cardinality''' or '''cardinal value'''. Z and N are said to have the same cardinality.

====Exercises====
#Is the number of even numbers the same as the natural numbers?
#What about the number of square numbers?
#Is the cardinality of positive even numbers less than 100 equal to the cardinality of natural numbers less than 100? Which set is bigger? How do you know? In what ways do finite sets differ from infinite ones?

===Is the set of rational numbers bigger than N?===
In this section we will look to see if  we can find a set that is '''bigger''' than the countable infinity we have looked at so far. To illustrate the idea we can imagine a story.

There was once a criminal who went to prison. The prison was not a nice place so the poor criminal went to the prison master and pleaded to be let out. She replied:

''&quot;Oh all right - I'm thinking of a number, every day you can have a go at guessing it. If you get it correct, you can leave.&quot;''

Now the question is - can the criminal get himself out of jail? (Think about if for a while before you read on)

Obviously it depends on the number. If the prison master chooses a natural number, then the criminal guesses 1, the first day, 2,the second day and so on until he reaches the correct number. Likewise for the integers 0 on the first day, -1 on the second day. 1 on the third day and so on. If the number is very large then it may take a long time to get out of prison but get out he will. 

What the prison master needs to do is choose a set that is not countable in this way. Think of a number line. The integers are widely spaced out. There are plenty of numbers in between the integers 0 and 1 for example. So we need to look at ''denser'' sets. The first set that springs to most peoples mind are the fractions. There are an infinite number of fractions between 0 and 1 so surely there are more fractions than integers? Is it possible to count fractions? Let's think about that possibility for a while. If we try to use the approach of counting all the fractions between 0 &amp; 1 then go on to 1 - 2 and so on we will come unstuck because we will never finish counting the ones up to 1 ( there are an infinite number of them). But does this mean that they are uncountable ? Think of the situation with  the integers. Ordering them ...-2, -1, 0, 1, 2, ... renders them impossible to count, but ''reordering'' them 0, -1, 1, -2, 2, ... allows them to be counted.

There is in fact a way of ordering fractions to allow them to be counted. Before we go on to it let's revert to the normal mathematical language. Mathematicians use the term ''rational number'' to define what we have been calling fractions. A rational number is any number that can be written in the form p/q where p and q are integers. So 3/4 is rational, as is -1/2. The set of all rational numbers is usually called Q. Note that Z is a subset of Q because any integer can be divided by 1 to make it into a rational. E.g. the number 3 can be written in the form p/q as 3/1.

Now as all the numbers in Q are defined by two numbers p and q it makes sense to write Q out in the form of a table. 

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\frac{1}{1} &amp; \frac{1}{2} &amp; \frac{1}{3} &amp; \cdots\\ &amp;  &amp; \\\frac{2}{1} &amp; \frac {2}{2} &amp; \frac{2}{3} &amp; \cdots\\ &amp; &amp; \\\frac{3}{1} &amp; \frac{3}{2} &amp; \frac{3}{3} &amp; \cdots\\\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that this table isn't an exact representation of Q. It only has the positive members of Q and has a number of multiple entries.( e.g. 1/1 and 2/2 are the same number) We shall call this set Q'. It is simple enough to see that if Q' is countable then so is Q.

So how do we go about counting Q'? If we try counting the first row then the second and so on we will fail because the rows are infinite in length. Likewise if we try to count columns. But look at the diagonals. In one direction they are infinite ( e.g. 1/1, 2/2, 3/3, ...) but in the other direction they are finite. So this set is countable. We count them along the finite diagonals, 1/1,  1/2, 2/1,   1/3, 2/2, 3/1....

====Exercises====
# Adapt the method of counting the set Q' to show that the set Q is also countable. How will you include 0 and the negative rationals? How will you solve the problem of multiple entries representing the same number ?
# Show that &lt;math&gt; \infty \times \infty = \infty &lt;/math&gt; (provided that the infinites are both countable)

===Can we find any sets that are bigger than N?===

So far we have looked at N, Z, and Q and found them all to be the same size, even though N is a subset of Z which is a subset of Q. You might be beginning to think &quot;Is that it? Are all infinities the same size?&quot; In this section we will look at a set that is ''bigger'' than N. A set that ''cannot'' be put into a one to one correspondence with N, no matter how it is arranged.

The set in question is R: the real numbers. A real number is any number on the number line. Remember that the set Q contains all the numbers that can be written in the form p/q with p and q integers, q different from 0. Most real numbers can never be put in this form and they are named &quot;irrational numbers&quot;. Examples of irrational numbers include &lt;math&gt; \pi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; e,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2} &lt;/math&gt;.

The set R is huge! Much bigger than Q. To get a feel for the different sizes of these two infinite sets consider the decimal expansions of a real number and a rational number. Rational numbers always either terminate:
*1/8 = 0.125 

or repeat:
*1/9 = 0.1111111......

Imagine measuring an object such as a book. If you use a ruler you might get 10cm. If you take a bit more care to and read the mm you might get 10.2cm. You'd then have to go on to more accurate measuring devices such as vernier micrometers and find that you get 10.235cm. Going onto a travelling microscope you may find its 10.235823cm and so on. In general the decimal expansion of any ''real'' measurement will be a list of digits that look completely random.

Now imagine you measure a book and found it to be 10.101010101010cm. You'd be pretty surprised wouldn't you? But this is exactly the sort of result you would need to get if the book's length were rational. Rational numbers are dense (you find them all over the number line), infinite, yet much much rarer than real numbers.

===How we can prove that R is bigger than Q===
It's good to get a feel for the size of infinities as in the previous section. But to be really sure we have to come up with some form of proof. In order to prove that R is bigger than Q we use a classic method. We assume that R is the same size as Q and come up with a contradiction. For the sake of clarity we will restrict our proof to the real numbers between 0 and 1.We will call this set R'. Clearly if we can prove that R' is bigger than Q then R must be bigger than Q also.

If R' was the same size as Q it would mean that it is countable. This means that we would be able to write out some form of list of all the members of R' (This is what countable means, so far we have managed to write out all our infinite sets in the form of an infinitely long list). Let's consider this list.

:R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
:R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
:R&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;
:.
:.
:.
Where R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the first number in our list, R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the second, and so on. Note that we haven't said what order the list is to be written. For this proof we don't need to say what the order of the list needs to be, only that the members of R are listable (hence countable). 

Now lets write out the decimal expansion of each of the numbers in the list.

:0.r&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;r&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;r&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;r&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;...
:0.r&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;r&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt;r&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;r&lt;sub&gt;24&lt;/sub&gt;...
:0.r&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt;r&lt;sub&gt;32&lt;/sub&gt;r&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt;r&lt;sub&gt;44&lt;/sub&gt;...
:0.r&lt;sub&gt;41&lt;/sub&gt;r&lt;sub&gt;42&lt;/sub&gt;r&lt;sub&gt;43&lt;/sub&gt;r&lt;sub&gt;44&lt;/sub&gt;...
:.
:.
:.

Here r&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; means the first digit after the decimal point of the first number in the list. So if our first number happened to be 0.36921... r&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; would be 3, r&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; would be 6 and so on. Remember that this list is meant to be complete. By that we mean that it contains ''every'' member of R'. What we are going to do in order to prove that R is not countable is to construct a number in R' that is not already on the list. Since the list is supposed to contain ''every'' member of R', this will cause a contradiction and therefore show that R' is unlistable.

In order to construct this unlisted number we choose a decimal representation:

:0.a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;...

Where a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the first digit after the point etc.

We let a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; take any value from 0 - 9 inclusive ''except'' the digit r&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;. So if r&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; = 3 then a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; can be 0, 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9.  Then we let  a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be any digit except r&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt; (the second digit of the second number on the list). Then a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; be any digit except r&lt;sub&gt;33&lt;/sub&gt; and so on.

Now if this number, that we have just constructed ''were'' on the list somewhere then it would have to be equal to R&lt;sub&gt;something&lt;/sub&gt;. Let's see what R&lt;sub&gt;something&lt;/sub&gt; it might be equal to. It can't be equal to R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; because it has a different first digit (r&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; and a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Nor can it be equal to R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; because it has a different second digit, and so on. In fact it can't be equal to ''any'' number on the list because it differs by at least one digit from ''all'' of them. 

We have done what we set out to do. We have constructed a number that is in R' but is not on the list of all members of R'. This contradiction means that R' is bigger than any list. It is not listable. It is not countable. It is a bigger infinity than Q.

===Are there even bigger infinities?===

There are but they are difficult to describe. The set of all the possible combinations of any number of real numbers is a bigger infinity than R. However trying to imagine such a set is mind boggling. Let's look instead at a set that looks like it should be bigger than R but turns out not to be. 

Remember R', which we defined earlier on as the set of all numbers on the number line between 0 and 1. Let us now consider the set of all numbers in the plane from [0,0] to [1,1]. At first sight it would seem obvious that there must be more points on the whole plane than there are in a line. But in transfinite mathematics the &quot;obvious&quot; is not always true and proof is the only way to go. Cantor spent three years trying to prove it true but failed. His reason for failure was the best possible. It's false.

[[Image:Points_on_a_line_and_a_plane.svg|250px]]

Each point in this plane is specified by two numbers, the x coordinate and the y coordinate; x and y both belong to R. Lets consider one point in the line. 0.a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.... Can you think of a way of using this one number to specify a point in the plane ? Likewise can you think of a way of combining the two numbers x= 0.x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;x&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.... and y= 0.y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;y&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.... to specify a point on the line? (think about it before you read on) 

One way is to do it is to take 
:a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
:a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
:a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:a&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:.
:.
:.

This defines a one to one correspondence between the points in the plane and the points in the line. (Actually, for the sharp amongst you, not quite one to one. Can you spot the problem and how to cure it?)

====Exercises====
#Prove that the number of points in a cube is the same as the number of points on one of its sides.

===Continuum hypothesis===

We shall end the section on infinite sets by looking at the Continuum hypothesis. This hypothesis states that there are no infinities between the natural numbers and the real numbers. Cantor came up with a number system for transfinite numbers. He called the smallest infinity &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; with the next biggest one &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt; and so on. It is easy to prove that the cardinality of N is &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; (Write any smaller infinity out as a list. Either the list terminates, in which case it's finite, or it goes on forever, in which case it's the same size as N) but is the cardinality of the reals = &lt;math&gt;\aleph_1&lt;/math&gt;?

To put it another way, the hypotheses states that:
:There are no infinite sets larger than the set of natural numbers but smaller than the set of real numbers.

The hypothesis is interesting because it has been proved that &quot;It is not possible to prove the hypothesis true or false, using the normal axioms of set theory&quot;

==Limits ''Infinity got rid of''==
The theory of infinite sets seems weird to us in the 21st century, but in Cantor's day it was downright unpalatable for most mathematicians. In those days the idea of infinity was too troublesome, they tried to avoid it wherever possible.

Unfortunately the mathematical topic called '''analysis''' was found to be highly useful in mathematics, physics, engineering. It was far too useful a field to simply drop yet analysis relies on infinity or at least infinite processes. To get around this problem the idea of a ''limit'' was invented. 

Consider the series
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1},  \frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{4}, \cdots , \frac{1}{n} \cdots &lt;/math&gt;
This series is called the harmonic series.

Note that the terms of the series get smaller and smaller as you go further and further along the series. What happens if we let n become infinite? The term would become &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\infty}&lt;/math&gt;

But this doesn't make sense. (Mathematicians consider it sloppy to divide by infinity. Infinity is not a real number, you can't divide by it). A better way to think about it (The way you probably already do think about it, if you've ever considered the matter) is to take this approach:
Infinity is very big, bigger than any number you care to think about. So let's let ''n'' become bigger and bigger and see if 1/''n'' approaches some fixed number. In this case as ''n'' gets bigger and bigger 1/''n'' gets smaller and smaller. So it is reasonable to say that the ''limit'' is 0.

In mathematics we write this as
:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{n \to \infty} \frac {1}{n} = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
and it reads:
:the limit of 1/''n'' as ''n'' approaches infinity is zero

Note that we are not dividing 1 by infinity and getting the answer 0. We are letting the number ''n'' get bigger and bigger and so the reciprocal gets closer and closer to zero. Those 18th Century mathematicians loved this idea because it got rid of the pesky idea of ''dividing by infinity''. At all times ''n'' remains finite. Of course, no matter how huge ''n'' is, 1/''n'' will not be ''exactly'' equal to zero, there is always a small difference. This difference (or error) is usually denoted by &amp;epsilon; (epsilon).

===info -- infinitely small===
&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em; border: 2px dotted purple;&quot;&gt;
When we talk about infinity, we think of it as something big. But there is also the infinitely small, denoted by &amp;epsilon; (epsilon). This animal is closer to zero than any other number. Mathematicians also use the character &amp;epsilon; to represent anything small. For example, the famous Hungarian mathematician Paul Erdos used to refer to small children as epsilons.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Examples===
Lets look at the function
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{x^2 + x}{x^2} &lt;/math&gt;
What is the limit as x approaches infinity ?

This is where the idea of limits really come into its own. Just replacing ''x'' with infinity gives us very little:
:&lt;math&gt; \ \frac{\infty^2 + \infty}{\infty^2} = ? &lt;/math&gt;

But by using limits we can solve it
:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{x \to \infty} \frac{x^2 + x}{x^2} =  1 + \lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{ 1}{x} = 1&lt;/math&gt; 

For our second example consider this limit as x approaches infinity of &lt;math&gt; x^3 -x^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Again lets look at the ''wrong'' way to do it. Substituting &lt;math&gt; x = \infty&lt;/math&gt; into the expression gives &lt;math&gt; \infty^3 -\infty^2 &lt;/math&gt;. Note that you cannot say that these two infinities just cancel out to give the answer zero.

Now lets look at doing it the ''correct'' way, using limits
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty}x^3 -x^2 = \lim_{x \to \infty}x^2(x-1) = \infty &lt;/math&gt;

The last expression is two functions multiplied together. Both of these functions approach infinity as ''x'' approaches infinity, so the product is infinity also. This means that the ''limit'' does not exist, i.e. there is no finite number that the function approaches as ''x'' gets bigger and bigger.

One more just to get you really familiar with how it works. Calculate:
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{\sin x}{x} &lt;/math&gt;

To make things very clear we shall rewrite it as 
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{1}{x}(\sin x) &lt;/math&gt;

Now to calculate this limit we need to look at the properties of sin(x). Sin(x)is a function that you should already be familiar with (or you soon will be) its value oscillates between 1 and -1 depending on x. This means that the absolute value of sin(x) (the value ignoring the plus or minus sign) is always less than or equal to 1:
:&lt;math&gt; |\sin x| \le 1&lt;/math&gt;

So we have 1/x which we already know goes to zero as x goes to infinity multiplied by sin(x) which always remains finite no matter how big x gets. This gives us
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{1}{x}(\sin x)  = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

===Exercises===


Evaluate the following limits;

#&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{3x^2 -4}{2x^2 +x} &lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{x^2 -1}{2x^3 +3} &lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty}\frac{cos x}{x^2} &lt;/math&gt;
#&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to \infty}(2x^2 -x^4) &lt;/math&gt;

==Infinite series==
Consider the  infinite sum 1/1 + 1/2 + 1/4 + 1/8 + 1/16 + ....
Do you think that this sum will equal infinity once all the terms have been added ? Let's sum the first few terms.

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
S_1 &amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{1} &amp;=&amp; 1 \\
S_2 &amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2} &amp;=&amp; 1.5 \\
S_3 &amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} &amp;=&amp; 1.75 \\
S_4 &amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{8} &amp;=&amp; 1.8750 \\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;


Can you guess what &lt;math&gt;S_\infty&lt;/math&gt; is ?

Here is another way of looking at it. Imagine a point on a number line moving along as the sum progresses. In the first term the point jumps to the position 1. This is half way from 0 to 2. In the second stage the point jumps to position 1.5 - half way from 1 to 2. At each stage in the process (shown in a different colour on the diagram) the distance to 2 is halved. The point can get as close to the point 2 as you like. You just need to do the appropriate number of jumps, but the point will never actually reach 2 in a finite number of steps. We say that in the limit as n approaches infinity, S&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; approaches 2.

===Zeno's Paradox===
The ancient Greeks had a big problem with summing infinite series. A famous paradox from the philosopher Zeno is as follows:

In the paradox of Achilles and the tortoise, we imagine the Greek hero Achilles in a footrace with the plodding reptile. Because he is so fast a runner, Achilles graciously allows the tortoise a head start of a hundred feet. If we suppose that each racer starts running at some constant speed (one very fast and one very slow), then after some finite time, Achilles will have run a hundred feet, bringing him to the tortoise's starting point.

During this time, the tortoise has &quot;run&quot; a (much shorter) distance, say one foot. It will then take Achilles some further period of time to run that distance, during which the tortoise will advance farther; and then another period of time to reach this third point, while the tortoise moves ahead. Thus, whenever Achilles reaches somewhere the tortoise has been, he still has farther to go. Therefore, Zeno says, swift Achilles can never overtake the tortoise.

I'm going to be pedantic and whine about

''&quot;Infinity is unlike a normal number.&quot;''

Well, no, it's not. In fact, it's not really a number at all.
(Sometimes people treat it like a number --
as if &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; were just an unusual, special number, like &amp;pi; is an unusual number.
But that leads to all kinds of confusion).

* &quot;The word &quot;infinity&quot; doesn't represent an actual number that is bigger than all the others; &quot;infinite&quot; just means &quot;without end,&quot; and is a way of describing something that never comes to an end. There are infinitely many numbers, because there is no last number. And that's really all it means.&quot; http://mathforum.org/library/drmath/view/60400.html

* &quot;Infinity is not a number, it is an idea.&quot; http://perplexus.info/show.php?pid=1341&amp;cid=7939

* &quot;'infinity' is ... a 'process'.&quot; http://www.jatiyah.freeserve.co.uk/infinity.htm

* &quot;Infinity is not a number; it is the name for a concept.&quot; http://mathforum.org/dr.math/faq/faq.large.numbers.html

If there's no objections, I'm going to change
the article to say something like
''&quot;Infinity is not number.&quot;''
and try to make it consistent with the &quot;infinite process&quot; idea.

== examples of aleph-one, aleph-two, etc. ==

Could anybody please explain or (using the logic-style and/or ;) ) give an example of an aleph-two cardinality series? [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] 23:20, 1 Jan 2004 (UTC)
::No not really. The set of all possible subsets (Called the power set) of a set is always bigger than that set. E.g. if A = {a,b,c} the P(A) = {{empty set}{a}{b}{c}{a,b}{a,c}{b,c}{a,b,c}}Even for infinite sets  the cardinality of  the power set is always higher than the set itself. I believe it's true that

 &lt;math&gt;P(\aleph^0) = \aleph^1 &lt;/math&gt;
(I have to check on a book for the proof)

:but I don't know if &lt;math&gt;P(\aleph^1) = \aleph^2 &lt;/math&gt;

Even so power sets aren't exactly easy to visualize. I think they are too obscure for this book. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 13:31, 19 Jan 2004 (UTC)

:Well, okay. By the way, isn't it usually written &lt;math&gt;\aleph_0&lt;/math&gt; and not &lt;math&gt;\aleph^0&lt;/math&gt;? I have to go to lessons now (science in fact!) so bye... [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] 13:35, 19 Jan 2004 (UTC)

::Yes - I dashed it off quick without thinking. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 14:16, 19 Jan 2004 (UTC)

Here's some examples:
* Aleph-zero: the set of positive integers -- countably infinite. (Any particular member of this set is a relatively harmless finite integer, like 2999).
* Aleph-one: set of the real numbers between zero and one -- uncountable. Think of the binary expansion of a real number: 0.x1x2x3x4x5x6..., with a *countably infinite* number of bits (or decimal places, whatever). It takes a (countably) infinite amount of information just to describe a typical real number, a single member of the set. The set of all of them is larger.
* Aleph-two: one example is the number of open curves of length 1. Imagine you're driving from the start to the end of one particular curve. Any particular point on the curve, you could be turning to the left or to the right. Since there's aleph-one particular points on the curve, it takes aleph-one bits of information just to describe one particular curve. The set of all of them is larger.

==Direction==
This chapter is already looking interesting. But I'm not sure what direction this chapter is taking. It seems to be more like a book then a textbook; more passive then interactive. I dont know enough about infinity, maybe that's why I dont see where the exercises come in. How do we involve the reader? [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 15:52, 13 Jan 2004 (UTC)

:Me too, I'm coming to the end of what I can do off the top of my head or from memory. Perhaps you can start by reading what I've already written and making sure it all makes sense. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 14:16, 19 Jan 2004 (UTC)

==Page Needs to be split==
I did a quick print preview and found that this module now runs to 10 pages. I still have more to write on infinite sets and [[w:transfinite|transfinite]] numbers, so I propose that we split this page. What say you? [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]]
:I say no. Other chapters are already collosal (primes, complex number...) and I think this one should follow. I certainly don't shy away from a long page without first reading a page at least. The reading style is easy and light here for that reason :) [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] 17:10, 19 Jan 2004 (UTC)

Whoops, sorry for that &quot;fix&quot;, I see what happened now. Never mind :) [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] 20:17, 19 Jan 2004 (UTC)
:That's OK It's part of what makes mathematics difficult. You have to be so precise with the language! one stray 1 in a subscript completely alters the meaning :-( Still with three people regualy checking this page those sort of errors should be picked up. Slightly more worrying is real errors that may have slipped in because of simplifying the formal proofs. &quot;Proper proofs&quot; are dead hard to read, but are very carfefully written to ensure nothing dodgy.[[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 20:25, 19 Jan 2004 (UTC)

==I don't understand something in the closed forms section==
Copied from the page :''So the closed form of'' 
:1 + x + x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + x&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ...
''is''
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{1 - x}
&lt;/math&gt;

''We can equate them:''
:&lt;math&gt;
1 + x + x^2 + x^3 + ... = \frac{1}{1 - x}
&lt;/math&gt;

''We are definitely not saying the two expressions are equal in the ''numerical'' sense, for example if we substitute ''x'' = 2 into the equation we get on the right hand side -1, but we know the left hand side equals infinity. Instead we use the ''closed-forms'' for their nice algebraic properties.''

It doesn't make sense to equal  two things that are not equal. The series converges for |x| less than 1 so shouldn't we say something along these lines ? (I don't know anything about closed ofrms unfortunately) [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 14:21, 20 Jan 2004 (UTC)

:This is tricky. They are not equal numerically but are equal algebraicly. Maybe things will clear up when the whole thing is written up. [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 14:29, 20 Jan 2004 (UTC)#

==Limits in relation to infinity==
My original intention was to introduce the more rigorous definition of limits in relation to infinity in this chapter. The explanation of limits already present is intuitively very clear, but to be mean to the readers I would really want to see it expanded upon. I was thinking of covering (lim x -&gt; L = inf) kind of thing as well. Diagrams would be nice. What do you think? [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 14:40, 20 Jan 2004 (UTC)

I think it's a  good idea. Being mean is good as long as the section gets prgressively harder as it goes along so that the readers can choose to stop at a point and still get some good info up to that point. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 15:03, 20 Jan 2004 (UTC)

==Eh?==
(Is very jetlagged, so veracity of comment may not be 100% ;) - didn't Godel go about showing that it really didn't matter whether you took the continuum to be aleph_1 or something &quot;in between&quot; or greater than aleph_1 or something, that basically things would work out either way? Should check later... [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 01:25, 27 Jan 2004 (UTC)
:It rings a bell, I'll try to check too. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 19:40, 27 Jan 2004 (UTC)
:OK I've found a good website - [http://www.ii.com/math/ch/ here]. Basically the continium hypothesis cannot be proved or disproved using the standard set of axioms of set theory. Godel proved that CH being true was consistant with standard set theory and Cohen prove that CH being false was also consistant. So it is not possible  to prove CH without adding some new axioms.

== Question on &quot;Are there even bigger infinities?&quot; ==

One way is to do it is to take

    a1 = x1
    a2 = y1
    a3 = x2
    a4 = y2
    .
    .
    .

This defines a one to one correspondance between the points in the plane and the points in the line. (Actually, for the sharp amongst you, not quite one to one. Can you spot the problem and how to cure it?)

I've found the problem. This doesn't work for a number that &quot;approach zero&quot; -- A number that is as close to zero as possible but not exactly zero, i.e. 0.000000......(after infinite 0s) 001.
For this number, we don't know if the &quot;1&quot; belongs to x or y, so it can be
(0.000...01,0) or (0,0.000...01)
But I've no ideas on how to cure this. Can anyone help?


: To get to it, the problem is that you are looking at the plane '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and not something like '''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. '''R''' is uncountable, '''Z''' is. Do you see the problem? '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is not countable then. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 13:34, 26 Oct 2004 (UTC)

: &quot;(after infinite 0s)&quot; ? If we're still talking about real numbers, that would be identical to the real number zero. I don't see what the problem is. (I don't want to get into transfinite numbers just yet).

== Natural number definition ==

Since set theory is being referenced early in the book, shouldn't we use the set-theory notion of Natural numbers, and call the first natural number 0?  I know that in various parts of math and science, people begin the &quot;natural numbers&quot; at 1, but here it seems innappropriate. [[User:Siroxo|Siroxo]] 10:20, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)

== a kind freshman's question ==
well im a freshman at highschool and i had to look up this infinity concept for extra credit and your website has proven to be useful a bit confusing for me but i get the bigger concept but the one concept that has croosed my mind is that infinity cna be limited when you say x&gt;1 and x&lt;2. just in there the answers are infinite but yet they are limited. you can chose any number between 1 and 2 and the decimal number between 1 and 2 are infinite so you have an infinite number of solutions but yet you are still being limited how can that be? what type of infinity is that?
:It is true that all the real numbers between 1 and 2 are quite small in magnitude (they are all less than 2). Also all the numbers fit into this line of no more than 1 unit in length. Yet there are infinitely many real numbers in there. It is strange, no doubt. I think you have already noted that &quot;infinitely many&quot; does not mean &quot;very large&quot;. In set theory, we have this concept of &quot;countably infinite&quot; and &quot;uncountably infinite&quot;. The set of natural number are &quot;countable&quot; in the sense that you can list them one by one in a meaningful order, and there are infinitely many natural numbers. So we call the natural numbers &quot;countably infinite&quot;. All the real numbers between 1 and 2 are not &quot;uncountably infinite&quot;. That's because you can not count them in a meaningful way. A mathematical way of saying that is: there is no one to one correspondence between the natural numbers and the real numbers. It's like the natural numbers and the real numbers come from two type of infinity, one countable, the other not. [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 23:19, 7 January 2006 (UTC)

Hi, the point here is not so much concerning the uncountability (viz. just take the rational numbers between 1 and 2, they are countably infinite, and yet your kind of doubt remains to hold). The point here is about the two notions of numbers, one being those which count the elements in a set (here that can be an infinity), and the other, being those on the number line. In this case the infinity is the furthest imaginary point on the right end. If you keep these two interpretations as different in your mind, the problem disappears! Really, the size of the set of rational/real numbers between 1 and 2 is infinite, however, the numerical stickers on them which place them on the number line are bounded (or as you say, &quot;limited&quot;); hence, there is no mathematical inconsistency here in deed. So far as the size of the set is concerned, the numerical identification of its elements does not matter much as you can easily see that the number of points on any two line segments are the same (take a triangle ABC, let R and S be the midpoints of AB and AC resp. for any point P on BC, the line AP cuts the line RS at a unique point Q, giving a one-to-one correspondence between the points on BC, and those on RS -- although the lengths are different). Thus you can keep stretching one of these segments to have bigger and bigger limits, and the number of points on them do not change! In fact you can stretch it all the way to infinity (the &quot;infinity&quot; point on the number line). Try the function &lt;math&gt;tan (\pi (x-1)/2&lt;/math&gt;) on the numbers between 1 and 2 for instance. Hope this helps.

==Suggest a Title Change ==
It seems like the article doesn't really deal with set theory in more than a basic way. Since the bulk of material is concerned with infinity, maybe the title should just be something like &quot;Infinity&quot;. Well, maybe not so vague, but at least strip the &quot;Set Theory&quot; from the title, as there is no real discussion of it.

:Thanks. Your observation is correct, but the module will be rewritten to incorporate set theory. That is the plan. [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 16:51, 17 July 2006 (UTC)

==Errata==

In &quot;Limits Infinity got rid of, Examples&quot;, it is correctly said, that 
&quot;Sin(x)is a function that you should already be familiar with (or you soon will be) its value oscillates between 1 and -1 depending on x. This means that the absolute value of sin(x) (the value ignoring the plus or minus sign) is always less than or equal to 1:&quot;,
but then the formula states &quot;|x|&lt;=1&quot;. There's no reason for x to behave so: shouldn't that read &quot;|sin(x)|&lt;=1&quot;?
