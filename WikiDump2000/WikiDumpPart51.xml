Wenn er auf den Kontinent fährt, wandert Herr Standish gern. Heute früh fährt er in die Stadt St. Pölten in Niederösterreich. Er spricht mit einer fremden Frau:  
&lt;p clear=&quot;left&quot;&gt;
* ''Herr Standish'': Entschuldigen Sie bitte. Wo ist hier ein Hotel?
* ''Die Frau'': Gleich dort drüben. Das ist das Hotel &quot;Zur Post&quot;.
* ''Herr Standish'': Gibt es ein Restaurant darin? 
* ''Die Frau'': Ja gewiss! Ein Restaurant mit einfacher Küche, besonders zum Abendessen. Aber ich könnte Ihnen ein anderes Restaurant empfehlen. Es heißt 'Alt-Wien', und es gibt dort das beste Frühstück. Das Restaurant ist links neben dem Hotel, um die Ecke. 
* ''Herr Standish'': Danke sehr. Und können Sie mir sagen, wo das Rathaus von St. Pölten ist?
* ''Die Frau'': Wie bitte?
* ''Herr Standish'': Wie komme ich zum Rathaus?  
* ''Die Frau'': Rechts um die Ecke und dann immer geradeaus &amp;ndash; ungefähr ein Kilometer.
* ''Herr Standish'': Danke sehr.
* ''Die Frau'': Bitte sehr. Wiedersehen.
* ''Herr Standish'': Auf Wiedersehen.

== Lesestück 5-1 ~ Eine Geschichte über St. Pölten ==
&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;[[Image:Map at sankt pölten.png|250px]]&lt;br /&gt;&lt;small&gt;''Karte: St. Pölten in Österreich''&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Niederösterreich ist sowohl flächenmäßig als auch nach Einwohnern das größte der neun österreichischen Bundesländer. Sankt Pölten ist die Landeshauptstadt von Niederösterreich. Der Name St. Pölten geht auf den heiligen Hippolytos zurück, nach dem die Stadt benannt wurde.

Die Altstadt befindet sich dort, wo vom 2. bis zum 4. Jahrhundert die Römerstadt ''Aelium Cetium'' stand. 799 wurde der Ort als &quot;Treisma&quot; erwähnt. Das Marktrecht erhielt St. Pölten um 1050, zur Stadt erhoben wurde es 1159. Bis 1494 stand St. Pölten im Besitz des Bistums Passau, dann wurde es landesfürstliches Eigentum. Bereits 771 findet sich ein Benediktinerkloster, ab 1081 gab es Augustiner-Chorherren, 1784 wurde deren Kollegiatsstift aufgehoben, das Gebäude dient seit 1785 als Bischofssitz. Zur Landeshauptstadt von Niederösterreich wurde St. Pölten mit Landtagsbeschluss vom 10. Juli 1986, seit 1997 ist es Sitz der Niederösterreichischen Landesregierung.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{High School Mathematics Extensions/TOC}}

:::''&quot;It is by logic that we prove, but by intuition that we discover.&quot;''

==Introduction==
Mathematicians have been, for the past five hundred years or so, obsessed with proofs. They want to prove everything, and in the process proved that they can't prove everything (see [[w:Incompleteness theorem|this]]). This chapter will introduce the axiomatic approach to mathematics, and several types of proofs.

==Direct proof==
The direct proof is relatively simple &amp;mdash; by logically applying previous knowledge, we ''directly prove'' what is required.

'''Example 1'''

Prove that the sum of any two even integers ''x'' and ''y'' is even.

'''Solution 1'''

We know that since ''x'' and ''y'' are even, they must have 2 as a factor. Then, we can write the following:

Let x = 2a, y = 2b, for some integers ''a'' and ''b''

Then:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
x + y
&amp;=&amp; 2a + 2b\\
&amp;=&amp; 2(a + b)\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
, by the distributive property of integers

The number 2(a + b) clearly has 2 as a factor, which implies it is even. Therefore, x + y is even.

'''Example 2'''

Prove the following statement for non-zero integers ''a, b, c'':

If ''a'' divides ''b'' and ''b'' divides ''c'', then ''a'' divides ''c''.

'''Solution 2'''

If an integer ''x'' divides an integer ''y'', then we can write y = qx, for some non-zero integer ''q''. So let's say that b = qa and c = rb, for some non-zero integers ''q'' and ''r''. Then:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}c
&amp;=&amp;rb\\
&amp;=&amp;r(qa)\\
&amp;=&amp;(rq)a\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
, by the associative property of integer multiplication.

But since ''q'' and ''r'' are integers, their product ''qr'' must also be an integer. Therefore, ''c'' is the product of some integer multiplied by ''a'', so we get that ''a'' divides ''c''.

==Mathematical induction==
Deductive reasoning is the process of reaching a conclusion that is guaranteed to follow. For example, if we know
* All ravens are black birds, and
* For every action, there is an equal and opposite reaction 
then we can conclude:
* This bird is a raven, therefore it is black.
* This billiard ball will move when struck with a cue.

Induction is the opposite of deduction. To induce, we observe how things behave in specific cases and from that we draw conclusions as to how things behave in the general case. 

Suppose we want to show that a statement (let us call it ''S'' for easier notation) is true for all natural numbers. This is how induction a proof by induction works:
# First, we show that ''S'' is true for the natural number 1. This is usually called the ''basis'' or the ''base case''.
# Then, we show that ''S'' is true for natural number &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; whenever it is true for natural number &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt;.
# By mathematical induction, ''S'' is true for all natural numbers.

To understand how the last step works, notice the following
* ''S'' is true for 1 (due to step 1)
* ''S'' is true for 2 because it is true for 1 (due to step 2)
* ''S'' is true for 3 because it is true for 2 (due to previous)
* ''S'' is true for 4 because it is true for 3 (due to previous)
* ''S'' is true for 5 because it is true for 4 (due to previous)
* and so on ...

'''Example 1'''
Show that the identity
:&lt;math&gt;1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = \frac{(n + 1)n}{2} &lt;/math&gt;
holds for all positive integers.

'''Solution'''
Firstly, we show that it holds for 1
: &lt;math&gt;1 = \frac{(1 + 1)1}{2} = \frac{2}{2} = 1 &lt;/math&gt;

Suppose the identity holds for some natural number ''k'':
:&lt;math&gt;1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k = \frac{1}{2}(k + 1)k &lt;/math&gt;

This supposition is known as the induction hypothesis.  We assume it is true, and aim to show that,
:&lt;math&gt;1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k + (k + 1) = \frac{1}{2}(k + 2)(k + 1) &lt;/math&gt;
is also true.

We proceed
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k &amp; &amp; =&amp; \frac{1}{2}(k + 1)k\\
\\
1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k &amp;+ (k + 1) &amp;=&amp; \frac{1}{2}(k + 1)k + (k + 1)\\
\\
&amp; &amp; = &amp; (k + 1)(\frac{k}{2} + 1)\\
\\
&amp; &amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{2}(k + 1)(k + 2)
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
which is what we have set out to show. Since the identity holds for 3, it also holds for 4, and since it holds for 4 it also holds for 5, and 6, and 7, and so on.

There are two types of mathematical induction: strong and weak. In weak induction, you assume the identity holds for certain value k, and prove it for k+1. In strong induction, the identity must be true for any value lesser or equal to k, and then prove it for k+1.

'''Example 2'''
Show that n! &gt; 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; for n &amp;ge; 4.

'''Solution'''
The claim is true for n = 4. As 4! &gt; 2&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, i.e. 24 &gt; 16.
Now suppose it's true for n = k, k &amp;ge; 4, i.e.
:k! &gt; 2&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt;
it follows that
:(k+1)k! &gt; (k+1)2&lt;sup&gt;k&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; 2&lt;sup&gt;k+1&lt;/sup&gt;
:(k+1)! &gt; 2&lt;sup&gt;k+1&lt;/sup&gt;
We have shown that if for n = k then it's also true for n = k + 1. Since it's true for n = 4, it's true for n = 5, 6, 7, 8 and so on for all n.

'''Example 3'''
Show that
:&lt;math&gt;1^3 + 2^3 + ...+ n^3 = \frac {(n+1)^2n^2}{4} &lt;/math&gt;

'''Solution'''
Suppose it's true for n = k, i.e.
:&lt;math&gt;1^3 + 2^3 + ...+ k^3 = \frac {(k+1)^2k^2}{4} &lt;/math&gt;
it follows that
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
1^3 + 2^3 + ...+ k^3 + (k+1)^3 &amp; = &amp;\frac {(k+1)^2k^2}{4} + (k+1)^3\\
&amp; = &amp;  (k+1)^2 (\frac{k^2}{4} + (k+1))\\
&amp; = &amp;  \frac {1}{4}(k+1)^2 (k^2 + 4k + 4)\\
&amp; = &amp;  \frac {1}{4}(k+1)^2 (k + 2)^2
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;
We have shown that if it's true for n = k then it's also true for n = k + 1. Now it's true for n = 1 (clear). Therefore it's true for all integers.

=== Exercises ===
1. Prove that &lt;math&gt;1^2 + 2^2 + ... + n^2 = \frac{ n(2n^2 + 3n +1)}{6} &lt;/math&gt;

2. Prove that for n &amp;ge; 1,
:&lt;math&gt; (1 + \sqrt{5})^n = x_n + y_n\sqrt{5}&lt;/math&gt;
where x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; and y&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; are integers.

3. Note that
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n[i^k - (i-1)^k] = n^k&lt;/math&gt;
Prove that there exists an explicit formula for
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^ni^m&lt;/math&gt; for all integer ''m''. E.g.
&lt;math&gt;1^3 + 2^3 + ... + n^3 = \frac{n^2(n+1)^2}{4}&lt;/math&gt;

4. The sum of all of the interior angles of a triangle is &lt;math&gt;180^\circ&lt;/math&gt;; the sum of all the angles of a rectangle is &lt;math&gt;360^\circ&lt;/math&gt;. Prove that the sum of all the angles of a polygon with ''n'' sides, is &lt;math&gt;(n - 2)\cdot 180^\circ&lt;/math&gt;.

==Proof by contradiction==
:''&quot;When you have eliminated the impossible, what ever remains, however improbable must be the truth.&quot; Sir Arthur Conan Doyle''

The idea of a proof by contradiction is to:
# First, we assume that the ''opposite'' of what we wish to prove is true.
# Then, we show that the logical consequences of the assumption include a contradiction.
#Finally, we conclude that the assumption must have been false.

=== &amp;radic;2 is irrational ===
As an example, we shall prove that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; is not a rational number. Recall that a rational number is a number which can be expressed in the form of p/q, where p and q are integers and q does not equal 0 (see the 'categorizing numbers' section [[HSE Complex Number|here]]).

First, assume that &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt; is ''rational'':&lt;br&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
\sqrt{2} = \frac{a}{b}
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
where ''a'' and ''b'' are coprime (i.e. integers with no common factors, with greatest common divisor 1). If ''a'' and ''b'' are not coprime, we remove all common factors. In other words, ''a/b'' is in simplest form. Now, continuing:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
\sqrt{2} &amp;=&amp; a/b \\
2 &amp;=&amp; a^2/b^2 \\
2b^2 &amp;=&amp; a^2
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

We have now found that ''a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' is some integer multiplied by 2. Therefore, ''a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' must be divisible by two. If ''a&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' is even, then ''a'' must also be even, for an odd number squared yields an odd number. Therefore we can write ''a = 2c'', where ''c'' is another integer.

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
2b^2 &amp;=&amp; a^2 \\
2b^2 &amp;=&amp; (2c)^2 \\
2b^2 &amp;=&amp; 4c^2 \\
b^2 &amp;=&amp; 2c^2
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

We have discovered that ''b&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' is also an integer multiplied by two. It follows that ''b'' must be even. We have a contradiction! Both ''a'' and ''b'' are even integers. In other words, both have the common factor of 2. But we already said that ''a/b'' is in simplest form, with no common factors. Since such a contradiction has been established, we must conclude that our original assumption was false. Therefore, &amp;radic;2 is irrational.

=== Contrapositive ===
Some propositions that take the form of ''if xxx then yyy'' can be hard to prove. It is sometimes useful to consider the ''contrapositive'' of the statement. Before I explain what contrapositive is let us see an example
:&quot;If ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is odd then ''x'' is also odd&quot;
is harder to prove than
:&quot;if ''x'' is even then ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is also even&quot;
although they mean the same thing. So instead of proving the first proposition directly, we prove the second proposition instead.

If ''A'' and ''B'' are two propositions, and we aim to prove
:If ''A'' is true then ''B'' is true
we may prove the equivalent statement
:If ''B'' is false then ''A'' is false
instead. This technique is called proof by contrapositive.

To see why those two statements are equivalent, we show the following boolean algebra expressions is true (see [[High School Mathematics Extensions/Logic | Logic]])
:&lt;math&gt;p \Rightarrow q \equiv q' \Rightarrow p' \!&lt;/math&gt;
(to be done by the reader).

=== Exercises ===
1. Prove that there is no perfect square number for 11,111,1111,11111......

2. Prove that there are infinitely number of ''k'''s such that, 4''k'' + 3, is prime. (Hint: consider N = p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;...p&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; + 3)

This is some basic information to help with reading other higher mathematical literature.

===Quantifiers===
Sometimes we need propositions that involve some description of rough quantity, e.g. &quot;For ''all'' odd integers x, x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is also odd&quot;. The word ''all'' is a description of quantity. The word &quot;some&quot; is also used to describe quantity.

Two special symbols are used to describe the quanties &quot;all&quot; and &quot;some&quot;
:&lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt; means &quot;for all&quot; or &quot;for any&quot;
:&lt;math&gt;\exists&lt;/math&gt; means &quot;there are some&quot; or &quot;there exists&quot;

'''Example 1'''&lt;br&gt;
The proposition:
:''For all even integers ''x'', x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is also even.''
can be expressed symbolically as:
:&lt;math&gt;(\forall x)(x\mbox{ is even} \Rightarrow x^2\mbox{ is even}) &lt;/math&gt;

'''Example 2'''&lt;br&gt;
The proposition:
:''There are some odd integers ''x'', such that x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is even.''
can be expressed symbolically as:
:&lt;math&gt;(\exist x)(x\mbox{ is odd} \Rightarrow x^2\mbox{ is even}) &lt;/math&gt;
This proposition is false.

'''Example 3'''&lt;br&gt;
Consider the proposition concerning (z = x'y' + xy):
:''For any value of ''x'', there exist a value for ''y'', such that z = 1.
can be expressed symbolically as:
:&lt;math&gt;(\forall x)(\exist y)(z = 1) &lt;/math&gt;
This proposition is true. Note that the order of the quantifiers is important. While the above statement is true, the statement
:&lt;math&gt;(\exist y)(\forall x)(z = 1) &lt;/math&gt;
is false. It asserts that there is one value of y which is the same for all x for which z=1. The first statement only asserts that there is a y for each x, but different values of x may have different values of y.

====Negation====
Negation is just a fancy word for the opposite, e.g. The ''negation'' of &quot;All named Britney can sing&quot; is &quot;Some named Britney can't sing&quot;. What this says is that to disprove that all people named Britney can sing, we only need to find one named Britney who can't sing. To express symbolically:
:Let ''p'' represent a person named Britney
:&lt;math&gt;[(\forall p)(p\mbox{ can sing})]' = (\exists p)(p\mbox{ cannot sing})&lt;/math&gt;

Similarly, to disprove
:&lt;math&gt;(\forall x)(x\mbox{ is odd} \Rightarrow x^2\mbox{ is even}) &lt;/math&gt;
we only need to find one odd number that doesn't satisfy the condition. Three is odd, but 3&amp;times;3 = 9 is also odd, therefore the proposition is FALSE and
:&lt;math&gt;(\exists x)(x\mbox{ is odd} \Rightarrow x^2\mbox{ is odd}) &lt;/math&gt;
is TRUE

In summary, to obtain the ''negation'' of a proposition involving a quantifier, you replace the quantifier by its opposite (e.g. &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\exist&lt;/math&gt;) and the ''quantified proposition'' (e.g. &quot;x is even&quot;) by its negation (e.g. &quot;x is odd&quot;).

'''Example 1'''
:&lt;math&gt;(\forall x)(\exists y)(x(x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 3) + 1 = y^2) &lt;/math&gt;
is a true statement.
Its negation is 
:&lt;math&gt;(\exists x)(\forall y)(x(x + 1)(x + 2)(x + 3) + 1 \ne y^2) &lt;/math&gt;

== Axioms and Inference ==
If today's mathematicians were to describe the greatest achievement in mathematics in the 20th century in one word, that word will be '''abstraction'''. True to its name, abstraction is a very abstract concept (see [[w:Abstraction_%28mathematics%29|Abstraction]]).

In this chapter we shall discuss the ''essence'' of some of the number systems we are familiar with. For example, the real numbers and the rational numbers. We look at the most fundamental properties that, in some sense, ''define'' those number systems.

We begin our discussion by looking at some of the more obscure results we were told to be true
* 0 times any number gives you 0
* a negative number multiplied by a negative number gives you a positive number
Most people simply accept that they are true (and they are), but the two results above are simple consequences of what we believe to be true in a number system like the real numbers!

To understand this we introduce the idea of axiomatic mathematics (mathematics with simple assumptions). An axiom is a statement about a number system that we assume to be true. Each number system has a few axioms, from these axioms we can draw conclusions (inferences).

Let's consider the Real numbers, it has axioms
Let ''a'', ''b'' and ''c'' be real numbers
: For ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' taken from the real numbers
:'''A1:''' ''a''+''b'' is a real number also (''closure'')
:'''A2:''' There exist 0, such that 0 + ''a'' = ''a'' for all ''a'' (existence of zero - an ''identity'')
:'''A3:''' For every ''a'', there exist ''b'' (written -''a''), such that a + b = 0 (existence of an additive inverse)
:'''A4:''' (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c'' = ''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'') (associativity of addition)
:'''A5:''' ''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a'' (commutativity of addition)

: For ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' taken from the real numbers excluding zero
:'''M1:''' ''ab'' is a real number also (''closure'')
:'''M2:''' There exist an element, 1, such that 1''a'' = ''a'' for all ''a'' (existence of one - an ''identity'')
:'''M3:''' For every ''a'' there exists a ''b'' such that ''ab'' = 1
:'''M4:''' (''ab'')''c'' = ''a''(''bc'') (associativity of multiplication)
:'''M5:''' ''ab'' = ''ba'' (commutativity of multiplication)

:'''D1:''' ''a''(''b'' + ''c'') = ''ab'' + ''ac'' (distributivity)

These are the ''minimums'' we assume to be true in this system. These are ''minimum'' in the sense that everything else that is true about this number system can be derived from those axioms!

Let's consider the following true identity
:(x + y)z = xz + yz
which is not included in the axioms, but we can prove it using the axioms. We proceed:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{matrix}
(x + y)z &amp; = &amp; z(x + y) \ \mbox{by M5}\\
         &amp; = &amp; zx + zy \ \mbox{by D1}\\
         &amp; = &amp; xz + yz \ \mbox{by M5}\\
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Before we proceed any further, you will have notice that the real numbers are not the only numbers that satisfies those axioms! For example the rational numbers also satisfy all the axioms. This leads to the abstract concept of a ''field''. In simple terms, a ''field'' is a number system that satisfies all those axiom. Let's define a ''field'' more carefully:

&lt;blockquote style=&quot;padding: 1em; border: 2px dotted purple;&quot;&gt;
A number system, ''F'', is a ''field'' if it supports + and &amp;times; operations such that:
: For ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' taken from ''F''
:'''A1:''' ''a'' + ''b'' is in ''F'' also (''closure'')
:'''A2:''' There exist 0, such that 0 + ''a'' = ''a'' for all ''a'' (existence of zero - an ''identity'')
:'''A3:''' For every ''a'', there exist ''b'' (written -''a''), such that a + b = 0 (existence of an additive inverse)
:'''A4:''' (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c'' = ''a'' + (''b'' + ''c'') (associativity of addition)
:'''A5:''' ''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a'' (commutativity of addition)

: For ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'' taken from ''F'' with the zero removed (sometimes written ''F''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt;)
:'''M1:''' ''ab'' is in ''F'' (''closure'')
:'''M2:''' There exist an element, 1, such that 1''a'' = ''a'' for all ''a'' (existence of one - the ''identity'')
:'''M3:''' For every ''a'' there exists a ''b'' such that ''ab'' = 1 (inverses)
:'''M4:''' (''ab'')''c'' = ''a''(''bc'') (associativity of multiplication)
:'''M5:''' ''ab'' = ''ba'' (commutativity of multiplication)

:'''D1:''' ''a''(''b'' + ''c'') = ''ab'' + ''ac'' (distributivity)
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Now, for '''M3''', we do not let ''b'' be zero, since 1/0 has no meaning. However for the ''M'' axioms, we have excluded zero anyway.

For interested students, the requirements of ''closure'', ''identity'', having ''inverses'' and ''associativity'' on an operation and a set are known as a [[Abstract algebra:groups|group]]. If ''F'' is a group with addition and ''F''&lt;sup&gt;*&lt;/sup&gt; is a group with multiplication, plus the distributivity requirement, ''F'' is a field. The above axioms merely state this fact in full.

Note that the natural numbers are not a field, as '''M3''' is generally not satisfied, i.e. not every natural number has an inverse that is also a natural number.

Please note also that (-''a'') denotes the additive inverse of ''a'', it doesn't say that (-a) = (-1)(a), although we can prove that they are equivalent.

'''Example 1'''

Prove using only the axioms that 0 = -0, where -0 is the additive inverse of 0.

'''Solution 1'''
:0 = 0 + (-0) by '''A3:''' existence of inverse
:0 = (-0) by '''A2:''' 0 + a = a

'''Example 2'''

Let F be a field and ''a'' an element of F. Prove using nothing more than the axioms that 0''a'' = 0 for all ''a''.

'''Solution'''
:0 = 0a + (-0a) by '''A3''' existence of inverse
:0 = (0 + 0)a + (-0a) by Example 1
:0 = (0a + 0a) + (-0a) by distributivity and commutativity of multiplication
:0 = 0a + (0a + (-0a)) by associativity of addition
:0 = 0a + 0 by '''A3'''
:0 = 0a by '''A2'''.

'''Example 3'''

Prove that (-''a'') = (-1)''a''.

'''Solution 3'''
:(-a) = (-a) + 0
:(-a) = (-a) + 0a by Example 2
:(-a) = (-a) + (1 + (-1))a
:(-a) = (-a) + (1a + (-1)a)
:(-a) = (-a) + (a + (-1)a)
:(-a) = ((-a) + a) + (-1)a
:(-a) = 0 + (-1)a
:(-a) = (-1)a

One wonders why we need to prove such obvious things (obvious since primary school). But the idea is not to prove that they are true, but to practise inferencing, how to logically join up arguments to prove a point. That is a vital skill in mathematics.

=== Exercises ===
1. Describe a field in which 1 = 0

2. Prove using only the axioms if u + v = u + w then v = w (subtracting u from both sides is not accepted as a solution)

3. Prove that if xy = 0 then either x = 0 or y = 0

4. In F&lt;sub&gt;-&lt;/sub&gt;, the operation + is defined to be the difference of two numbers and the &amp;times; operation is defined to be the ratio of two numbers. E.g. 1 + 2 = -1, 5 + 3 = 2 and 9&amp;times;3 = 3, 5&amp;times;2; = 2.5. Is F&lt;sub&gt;-&lt;/sub&gt; a field?

5. Explain why Z&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (modular arithmetic modular 6) is not a field.

== Problem Set ==
1. Prove
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{1}{\sqrt 1} + \frac{1}{\sqrt 2} + ... + \frac{1}{\sqrt n }\ge \sqrt n
&lt;/math&gt;
for &lt;math&gt;n\ge 1&lt;/math&gt;

2. Prove by induction that &lt;math&gt;2n^3 - 3n^2 + n + 31 \ge 0 &lt;/math&gt;

3. Prove by induction
:&lt;math&gt; {n \choose 0} + {n\choose 1} + {n\choose 2} + ... + {n\choose n}  = 2^n&lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt;{n \choose m} = \frac{n!}{m!(n-m)!} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n! = n\cdot (n-1)\cdot (n-2)\cdot ... \cdot 2\cdot 1&lt;/math&gt;
:and 0! = 1 by definition.

4. Prove by induction &lt;math&gt; {n \choose 0} + 2{n\choose 1} + 2^2{n\choose 2} + ... + 2^n{n\choose n}  = 3^n&lt;/math&gt;

5. Prove that if x and y are integers and n an odd integer then &lt;math&gt;\frac{x^n + y^n}{x + y} &lt;/math&gt; is an integer.

6. Prove that (n~m) = n!/((n-m)!m!) is an integer. Where n! = n(n-1)(n-2)...1. E.g. 3! = 3&amp;times;2&amp;times;1 = 6, and (5~3) = (5!/3!)/2! = 10.

Would the translation for ''spielen'' be ''play'', as is on the page, or the infinitive ''to play''? [[User:Lord Emsworth|Lord Emsworth]] 02:35, 1 Nov 2003 (UTC)
:I think ''spielen'' is the infinitive, ''I can play'' should be ''Ich kann spiele''. Maybe [[User:ThomasStrohmann|Thomas]] can clear this up. [[User:Etothex|Etothex]] 04:48, 1 Nov 2003 (UTC)

I think it is a matter of how you want to present verbs. I originally had them as &quot;to play&quot; (which is correct), but it is also correct I believe to simply list the english verb that ''spielen'' represents: play. The vocabulary is not a direct translation list, but a list of words in German from the excercise and what they mean in that context) in English. I have two text books and a large Dictionary in front of me and one text gives the verbs thus: spielen - to play; whereas another textbook and the dictionary (New Cassell's) list them thus: spielen - play. - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 05:11, 1 Nov 2003 (UTC)
:Hmm, ok. I looked up ''spielen'' on LEO and I got the infinitive 'to play', with(present tense)
&lt;pre&gt;
ich 	spiele 	 AKLL OF THESE ARE &quot;play&quot; IN ENGLISH
du 	spielst 	
er/sie 	spielt 	
wir 	spielen 	
ihr 	spielt 	
sie 	spielen 
&lt;/pre&gt;
but then babelfish/altavista translated 'I can play' as ''Ich kann spielen'', so I don't know what's correct. I suppose since you know more German than I do that you're right. :) [[User:Etothex|Etothex]] 08:39, 1 Nov 2003 (UTC)

Yes, ''kann spielen'' is correct:
&lt;pre&gt;
ich       kann spielen
du        kannst spielen (formal: Sie können spielen)
er/sie/es kann spielen
wir       können spielen
ihr       könnt spielen (formal: Sie können spielen)
sie       können spielen
&lt;/pre&gt;
The formal &quot;Sie&quot; is captialized.

Some other forms with the infinitive:
&lt;pre&gt;
ich        muss   / darf   / soll   / will
du         musst  / darfst / sollst / willst
er/sie/es  muss   / darf   / soll   / will
wir        müssen / dürfen / sollen / wollen
ihr        müsst  / dürft  / sollt  / wollt
sie        müssen / dürfen / sollen / wollen
&lt;/pre&gt;

And some things (negation of the above) which are different:
&lt;pre&gt;
ich muss        I must
ich darf        I am allowed to
ich muss nicht  I don't need to
ich darf nicht  I must not 
ich soll        I should
ich soll nicht  I should not
ich kann        I can (I am able to, I am allowed to)
ich kann nicht  I cannot (like above)
ich will        I want to
ich will nicht  I dont't want to
&lt;/pre&gt;

::Well, I'm saying either way of presentation is correct. Not giving the English &quot;to play&quot;, but instead using &quot;play&quot; is just a matter of personal preference. My very big German dictionary does not present English verbs as &quot;to xxxxx&quot; in the German to English translations. - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 09:44, 1 Nov 2003 (UTC)

:::Yes, the &quot;to&quot; is just a confirmation (clarification) that it is the inifinitive. The dictionary usually only lists irregular forms, so it's somewhat reduntant (although my dictionary says &quot;to&quot; ;). --[[User:Vulture|Vulture]] 09:53, 1 Nov 2003 (UTC)

''Fräulein'' was used instead of ''Frau'' to refer to an unmarried woman. It's no longer used since the 60s or 70s. It's rather infrequently used to address a waitress. Otherwise it has a humoristic or ironic meaning. --[[User:Vulture|Vulture]] 07:53, 4 Nov 2003 (UTC)

::Hey, that's when I learned German!  What is &quot;Miss&quot; now? Anyway, certainly go in and change anything you see to modernize the German. Really appreciated! - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 18:41, 4 Nov 2003 (UTC)

:::''Fräulein'' was replaced by ''Frau'', there is no special &quot;Miss&quot;. You might use it you translate something english and &quot;Miss&quot; (instead of Mrs) is important. But you might also simply use &quot;Miss&quot; in this case. --[[User:Vulture|Vulture]] 09:19, 5 Nov 2003 (UTC)

::Hard to believe a culture would dump a word implying youthful beauty (Fräulein) for a word that has a more (IMHO) frumpy connotation (Frau).  Did the young people simply start calling &quot;chicks&quot; --&gt; &quot;Fraus&quot;?  Or was there always a different set of colloquial expressions, and Fräuline went out with the Miss, Mrs., Ms. trends as in the US? - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 17:34, 5 Nov 2003 (UTC) Along the same lines, would changing the sentence in Gesprach 2-2 &gt;&gt; Helena: ''Sie ist hübsch, wenn man kleine Mädchen mit langen schwarzen Haaren mag.'' to &gt;&gt;Helena: ''Sie ist hübsch, wenn man kleine Fräulein mit langen schwarzen Haaren mag.'' put more of an edge on her jealose reply to Karl?  That is, could one translate ''Fräulein'' in this case as &quot;girl (tart)&quot;? Or is there a word that would be more suitable (or is ''Mädchen'' just fine)?  - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]]

:::It was considered inappropriate to see if somebody is married in the name (the &quot;title&quot;), especially if it's only used for females (i.e. no &quot;Herrlein&quot;). &quot;Mädels&quot;, &quot;Mädchen&quot; is more like &quot;chicks&quot;. &quot;Schlampe&quot; might do for Helena (*). My dictionary gives &quot;slut&quot; as translation.
(*) to say, not to be - &quot;Zicke&quot; (nanny goat ;), cow, bitch, prude, silly thing) might better characterize Helena. I don't think those translations are right though.

::::For now I can leave it at &quot;mädchen&quot; I don't want her attitude to be too obvious: A more subtle &quot;oh yeh, if you like that kind of girl&quot; is what I'm aiming for - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 16:27, 6 Nov 2003 (UTC)

In [[German: Lesson 2]] I've changed one &quot;Fremder&quot; to &quot;Fremde&quot; and another one to &quot;Fremden&quot;. Both are nominative plural, and I don't know exactly why they differ, but I'm quite sure of this because I'm a native German speaker. It probably has something to do with &quot;fremd&quot; being an adjective. &quot;Der Fremde&quot; is a noun, but the endings are the same as those of the adjective: &quot;fremde Leute&quot; (=&quot;foreign people&quot;) but &quot;die fremden Leute&quot; (=&quot;the foreign people&quot;).--[[User:El|El]] 15:57, 7 Nov 2003 (UTC)

:Ok, Marsh. I'm not sure if it's necessary to introduce reflexive verbs in the first lesson. You could avoid it by saying: &quot;Heinrich trifft Karl. Sie sind Freunde.&quot; -- [[User:Hansm|Hansm]] 18:38, 16 Dec 2003 (UTC)
:Of course, it's (almost) right to say &quot;Haben Sie Herr Standish schon angetroffen?&quot;. But I feel, the word &quot;antreffen, angetroffen&quot; is pretty difficult for the first lesson. You could say &quot;Haben Sie Herrn Standish schon getroffen?&quot; Anyway, this is more common.
:Or how about &quot;Haben Sie Herrn Standish schon gesehen?&quot; - Note: Actualy, &quot;Herr Standish&quot; stands in the Dativ, here. Nevertheless, many Germans would also say &quot;Herr Standish&quot; in colloquial language.
:Since you want to give a lesson about pronouns and the 2 forms for the 2nd person, I would try to keep the rest as easy as possible. The sentence &quot;Aber verstehe ich richtig, dass er zu Besuch ist?&quot; has a relativ sentence. Wouldn't it easyer just to say: &quot;Ist er zu Besuch?&quot; -- [[User:Hansm|Hansm]] 18:51, 16 Dec 2003 (UTC)

I think there's a little problem with &quot;heißen&quot; in section &quot;Grammatik 2-3&quot;: It's only used in a passive meaning like it's said there: &quot;Thus heißen can best be translated as 'to be named' or 'to be called'.&quot; But the 4 examples demonstrate an active meaning of &quot;call/name&quot;. This would be translated as &quot;nennen&quot; in German, so the examples really may make it clearer, but they are wrong... or at least have a quite archaic sound ;) - [[User:Monsi|Monsi]] 17:59, 3 Mar 2004 (UTC)
:I believe there are a number of German nouns that make sense in the present tense in German, but are not so easily or singularly translated into English.  English would never say &quot;I name Eric&quot; for &quot;my name is...&quot; - But if you are saying German would not any more really say &quot;Ich heiße Erick&quot; but....what (?) &quot;Ich nenne Erick?&quot; Still the same non-correspondence between German present tense and English. Please clarify; is it that heißen is really only used in the passive? - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 05:44, 4 Mar 2004 (UTC)
::Yes, heißen is only used in the sense of &quot;to be called&quot;. It used to be used like &quot;jdn etw. heißen&quot;(to call sb. sth.), but that usage is archaic, dating back to the 1920s or so I'd say. &quot;nennen&quot; requires the reflexive pronoun if used to refer to oneself: &quot;Ich nenne mich Judith&quot;, but that's not really common when introducing oneself, it's like saying &quot;I call myself Judith&quot;. &quot;nennen&quot; is what we use to say &quot;to call sb. sth.&quot; nowadays though, e. g. &quot;er nannte ihn einen Idiot&quot; = &quot;he called him an idiot&quot;.
:::I was not happy with the way the lesson was going using ''heißen''&amp;mdash;too complicated for so early in the text, and even the examples come from sentences that have since moved deeper into the book. I will rewrite and drop ''heißen'' here; but it or ''nennen'' will show up sooner than latter. Are some of the examples with ''heißen'' &quot;modern&quot;, or all &quot;archaic&quot; - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 17:10, 5 Mar 2004 (UTC)

There is a lot more going on here: 
# The line about 'to be' refering to the use of present continous makes no sense at all. 'Heißen/Nennen' (Heißen is wrong as we know, substitute with 'Nennen'and it works). But nevertheless, 'Nennen' needs a passive construction similar to its closest English equivalent 'to be called xyz'. Continous does not! come into it. &quot;Die Firma wird Trans-Global genannt.&quot; -&gt; &quot;The company is called Trans-Global&quot; Both passive voice.
# Contrary to the commentary there is a different way to express 'is called'. It takes - surprise - the verb 'heißen' only with a change of subjects: Forget the 'They' and a passive voice. It is rather &quot;Die Firma heißt Trans-Global.&quot; Nice, clean and easy.
# What's the deal with 'Um!-Global'? Proper names, especially of Latin origin, only get the worse for translation. Trans-Global sounds like a good German import-export firm. There probably is one for real just around the corner!
# Concerning Company = 'Gemeinde'. 'Gemeinde' means either 'parish' (religious group) or 'district' (local bureaucratic entity). I would go for 'Firma'.
# 'Die Geschäftsmänner'. Thought long and hard about it and the conclusion is, that maybe with pc and the rest of it, the plural of 'Geschäftsmann' is now 'Geschäftsleute'. We just don't use pure masuline plurals anymore, even if they happen to be all male.  
# I will quickly nip over and correct 'das! Vereinigtes! Königreich' 
# Somewhere I changed 'friends' = 'Brüder' into 'Freunde'. To call a mate your sibbling is theoretically possible in a colloquial setting (a bit like Hey Bro'). For the beginner, it could only be confusing. 
# There is also a problem with 'die Frau' = 'Ms.' That is just confusing vocab practice because 'die Frau' = 'the woman'. That does not convey the meaning of honorific adress. You have to cut out the defnite article. Better then to learn it as a phrase than as an ambivlent single word. 
It's even worse for the male form: 'Der Herr' without anything else indicating the use as title/honorific would actually refer to god. 

That's it for the moment.

OK. Fix what you regard as archaic (a lot of these words come from LEO which has no systyem for indicating what is currently acceptable and what is archaic). I'll change the Herr und Frau as you suggest. - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 17:42, 7 Apr 2004 (UTC)

According to [http://dict.leo.org/ LEO], it is &quot;Vereinigtes Königreich&quot; - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 18:49, 6 Jan 2005 (UTC)

&quot;Vereinigtes Königreich&quot; without articel, but &quot;Das Vereinigte Königreich ...

== &quot;Das ist richtig.&quot; rather unusual ==

In Germany &quot;Das ist richtig&quot; is mostly used as &quot;That's correct&quot; as a teacher says to his pupil (&quot;Did I make a mistake?&quot; - &quot;No, that's correct&quot;). But here it is used twice in unusual situtations: 
:&quot;Ist er zu Besuch? - Ja. Das ist richtig.&quot; should be simply &quot;Ja.&quot; or &quot;Ja, er wohnt zur Zeit bei mir.&quot; or &quot;Ja&quot; with another additional information.
:&quot;Zu viel ist zu viel. - Das ist richtig.&quot; should be &quot;So ist es.&quot;, &quot;Da haben Sie Recht.&quot; or something like that.
::Obviously such subtleties reflect (among other things) changes in the use of words/phrases over time.  I have no problem with using your suggestions - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 18:51, 14 November 2005 (UTC)

== studieren ==

&quot;Today we study German.&quot; would rather be &quot;Heute lernen wir Deutsch.&quot; 
To study means &quot;studieren&quot; or &quot;lernen&quot; - but in German the two words are not the same thing. &quot;Studieren&quot; is what you do at a university - usually for a couple of years (even though ''we'' tend to drop out or change our subjects quite often // studieren can as well mean to examine thoroughly)
jacs --[[User:Jacs|Jacs]] 01:08, 31 January 2006 (UTC)
:Considering that the lesson here is going from English to German (from a story about University studies), it complicates things to substitute the &quot;more correct&quot; ''lernen'' - so the implication is simply that &quot;today we study German (at the university)&quot;.  I do not see the need for a change? - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 05:05, 16 February 2006 (UTC)</text>

==Conjugating 'to be'==

&lt;pre&gt;
Ich bin groß.              I am tall.
Du bist sehr groß.         You are very tall.
Sie ist klein.             She is short.
Sie sind groß.             They are tall.
&lt;/pre&gt;

In these cases, we use the correct form of ''sein'' for each situation. Please notice the final two sentences both use 'Sie', and we must look at the verb to determine the difference between 'she' and 'they'.

In German, the English infinitive 'to be' is translated as ''sein''.

This is the table of the forms of 'sein', with rough English translations. Note that in English, there are only three forms (am, is, are) while German has five (bin, bist, ist, sind, seid).

Also, the verb conjugation of the two you-formals are always the exact same.

&lt;big&gt;'''German'''&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''sein'''&lt;/big&gt;

==Conjugating Normal Verbs==

&lt;pre&gt;
Er spielt Volleyball.      He plays volleyball.
Ich mache Hausaufgaben.    I do my homework.
Wir kommen aus München.    We come from Munich.
Was machst du?             What are you doing?
&lt;/pre&gt;

In these sentences, different verbs and endings are used. Note that the verb is always in second position.

When conjugating normal verbs, use the endings shown below (a memory hook is the ''&quot;best ten&quot;'' endings). Note that in normal verbs, such as spielen and machen, ihr-form and er/sie/es-form are the same and the wir-form, sie (pl)-form and the formal are all the same as the infinitive.

==Conjugating Irregular Verbs==

&lt;pre&gt;
Ich habe keine Zeit.       I have no time.
Gib mir das Buch!          Give me the book.
Sie wandert gern.          She likes to hike.
Er liest einen Roman.      He is reading a novel.
&lt;/pre&gt;

In each of these sentences, we use an irregular verb. Irregularity occurs in the ich-form or the du-form and er/sie/es-forms. There are three types of irregularity.

===E in the first syllable===

One form of irregularity occurs ''sometimes'' when the verb contains an 'e' in the first syllable. The change is simple: the du-form and er/sie/es forms both change the 'e' to an 'i.e.' or an 'i'. Two common examples are shown. Note that the er/sie/es-form and ihr-form are no longer the same.

&lt;big&gt;'''sehen - to see'''&lt;/big&gt;

===Haben===

A similar, yet different, change occurs in the verb &quot;haben&quot;. As in the irregularity above, the du-form and er/sie/es-form change.

&lt;big&gt;'''haben - to have'''&lt;/big&gt;


{| border=&quot;1&quot; style=&quot;background-color: #CCFFCC;&quot;

===Verbs ending in Consonant-N===

Some verbs change the ich-form for obvious reasons. &quot;Wandern&quot;  and &quot;basteln&quot;  are two examples. Both drop the first e in the ich-form.
&lt;!-- I'm not a german speaker... how is that _obvious_?  Why does it do so? --&gt;

==Conjugating Modals==

&lt;pre&gt;
Ich will ins Kino gehen.   I want to go to the movies.
Dürfen wir hier essen?     May we eat here?
Was kann ich für dich tun? What can I do for you?
Er mag Romane lesen.       He likes to read books.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Modals are a new kind of verb. They are the equivalent to helping verbs in English. There are seven basic modals: können (can), mögen (like), dürfen (may), wollen (want), sollen (should), müssen (must), and möchten (would like). Möchten isn't technically a modal, but it acts like one in most aspects.

Modals are conjugated very differently. The ich-form and er/sie/es-form are always alike and singular has a different verb in the first syllable (except in sollen and möchten). Below are the conjugations of the six basic modals and möchten.

&lt;big&gt;'''können - can'''&lt;/big&gt;

==Separable Verbs==

&lt;pre&gt;
Du siehst schön aus!       You look good!
Ich muss mein Zimmer aufräumen.
                           I have to clean my room.
Komm mit!                  Come with!
Probier diese Jeans an!    Try these jeans on.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Some verbs in German are separable: they have a prefix that can be separated from the base. When the verb is used with a modal, it regains the prefix at the end of the sentence. When it is the main verb of the sentence, the prefix is moved to the end of the sentence.

An &quot;example&quot; in English would be the word &quot;intake&quot;. When it is used as a verb, it becomes &quot;take ... in&quot;. When it is used as an adjective or a noun, it becomes &quot;intake&quot; again.

Two easy examples of separable verbs are ''aussehen'' and ''mitkommen''. Note that aussehen is also irregular.

&lt;big&gt;'''aussehen - to appear'''&lt;/big&gt;

The story about Zurich, Switzerland is modified from the entry at Zürich in the German Wikipedia - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 03:23, 27 Feb 2004 (UTC)

Might it not be too soon in the lessons to be conjugating a verb? I'm thinking we should introduce indirect articles, pronouns before much can be said about verbs.  Maybe we should make a series of &quot;blank&quot; lesson pages and lay out on each one our ideas of grammar lessons to be taught. We can move the ideas around until it makes some sense, and (at the same time) work on whatever parts we have an interest in. If the &quot;idea&quot; gets moved, the worked on grammar lesson can be moved with it.  The alternative is to develop grammar lessons, then rename the pages after an outline on order is established? What say you all? - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 05:20, 1 Nov 2003 (UTC)
:Sure. I was just copying the structure of the French Wikibook, they begin conjugating early. [[User:Etothex|Etothex]] 05:45, 1 Nov 2003 (UTC)
:Oh, BTW, could you check out [[Talk:German:_Lesson_2]]? There seems to by some problem with the conjugation of ''spielen''. [[User:Etothex|Etothex]] 06:11, 1 Nov 2003 (UTC)
::If you can believe it, I found my old beginning German textbook from highschool.  I'm using that (very roughly) to gage progress through the lessons.  Keep adding stuff in. If I think it looks too advanced, I can always move it a few lessons further on. So no problem, really. - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 03:04, 3 Nov 2003 (UTC)

::Actually I responded to that one earlier (see [[Talk:German: Lesson 2]]). Not a problem, just a matter of preference. I think either way is &quot;correct&quot; but I think leaving the &quot;to&quot; off the English verbs makes the presentation easier for the student by better matching the German-English. - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]]
----
   Du  bist  You  are  
   Ihr  seid  You (formal)  are  
   Sie  sind  They  are''

I beg to differ with the above translations. I was under the impression that &quot;du&quot; and &quot;ihr&quot; are the singular and plural familiar you, while &quot;sie&quot; is both &quot;she&quot; and &quot;they,&quot; and finally, &quot;Sie&quot; (capitalized) is the singular and plural formal you. [[User:Lord Emsworth|Lord Emsworth]] 19:07, 1 Nov 2003 (UTC)

I think you have that right Lord Emsworth. As soon as we can establish where it is good to start conjugating verbs, we can get it in correctly (or we can cjhange it now and maybe move it later) - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 03:00, 3 Nov 2003 (UTC)

Hi, I've edited some typos in the Gespraech 4-1. Just for the record I'd like to say that German universities are generally not expensive at all (I payed a
little less than $200 per semester and half of it was for a ticket that gave me unlimited public transportation in my area). [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]

:Thanks! Keep editing those sentences.  I'm counting on you and the couple of other native speakers to make this thing look real. Does not expensive extend to medical school?  Should I have him going to school somewhere other than Germany?  I was working towards a conversation involving him selling some furniture. Of course, he could have another reason for doing so. Would the idea of a poor graduate student not be typical in Germany as it would in the US? -- [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 07:50, 14 Nov 2003 (UTC)

::The idea of a poor graduate student is quite OK, and I guess there are some specific medical schools that are expensive. So we can leave the version as it is (btw. I really like the idea that you are building up plots that go together in a nice story) [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]

The phrase &quot;Ich habe sie gern!&quot; in the first dialogue is used to refer to a person rather than to an object. &quot;Ich mag sie.&quot; (sie referring to &quot;die Wohnung&quot;) would be more appropriate in this context, but still sounds kinda strange. The first one, &quot;Mir gefällt deine Wohnung.&quot; is the best version, and basically has the same meaning as &quot;Ich habe sie gern!&quot; (&quot;I like it!&quot;, basically)

Also corrected some typos and word order problems (&quot;sieht&quot; not &quot;seht&quot; and &quot;sich umsehen&quot; not &quot;umsehen sich&quot;).

Second dialogue: &quot;Ich glaube, dass sie 'Karoline' heißt.&quot; would sound more natural if phrased &quot;Ich glaube, sie heißt 'Karoline'.&quot;
Oh, and is brunette really black where you come from? It's rather brown around here... [[User:MartinR|Martin]]

I think some sentences aren’t a good German:
* &quot;Ein Bruder besucht&quot; is wrong German. Better: &quot;Markus bekommt Besuch von seinem Bruder&quot; 
:Similar improvement made (now Lesson 6) - [[User:Marshman|marsh]]
* I don’t understand the phrase &quot;Mutti sagt Hallo&quot;. Does Karl say that? (Lesson 6)
:It follows &quot;Karl:&quot;  Should say &quot;Mother says hello&quot;; they are brothers and Karl lives with his parents. - [[User:Marshman|marsh]]
* &quot;Ich glaube, dass sie 'Karoline' heißt.&quot; is correct German. But I think it’s better to say &quot;Ich glaube, sie heißt Karoline&quot;.
:Changed - [[User:Marshman|marsh]]
-- [[User:Daniel B|Daniel]] 19:11, 21 Aug 2004 (UTC)

Edit: To call someone &quot;ein Schwein&quot; in German is quite offending even for good friends. Better say: &quot;Du bist ein Ferkel!&quot; (i.e. &quot;Du bist ein Schwein!&quot; means &quot;You are a hog!&quot;) das Ferkel = piglet or in that case substitute and &quot;polite form&quot; for the word pig.
:Good point. &quot;Mark, you are a pig!&quot; is a perfectly appropriate response in English, but too harsh (insulting) in German - [[User:Marshman|marsh]] 04:38, 22 September 2005 (UTC)</text>

''die Wörter'' is the plural of ''das Wort''. What about adding (n.) or (n) for neutrum (or neuter ?)?  The nominative plural always is with ''die''.
:Better to just put in both sing. and pl. rather than leave gender &quot;unannounced&quot;. I will fix - [[User:Marshman|Marsh]]

''zu viel'' is the new spelling after the ''Rechtschreibreform''.--[[User:Vulture|Vulture]] 10:08, 1 Nov 2003 (UTC)

Thanks. I do trust you to know about these things. My dictionary is 1958, so could well be dated -- [[User:Marshman|Marsh]] 18:52, 3 Nov 2003 (UTC)

Additionally: Not only Poetically, die Worte is also used instead of die Wörter. Wörter is used, e. g. in ''Wie viele Wörter beinhaltet das Wörterbuch'' (How many words does the dictionary include)? But: ''Achte auf deine Worte!'' (Take care about what you say). --[[User:Jayk|Jayk]] ([[User talk:Jayk|talk]]) 14:11, 19 February 2009 (UTC)

== Just some remarks on this lesson from an Austrian ==

conversation:
* I don't know this, but it seems unlikely that there is a Hotel &quot;St.Pölten&quot; in St. Pölten. Almost everywhere in Austria, a safe bet for a Hotel's or inn's name is &quot;Zur Post&quot;.
* instead of &quot;dort drinnen&quot; I would use &quot;darin&quot;.
* A restaurant wouldn't be called &quot;Das Wien&quot;, since Wien doesn't have an article. So the lady should say &quot;Es heißt 'Wien'.&quot; Again, this is an unlikely name for a restaurant in St.Pölten. Maybe &quot;Alt-Wien&quot; or something like that.
* &quot;Guten Tag&quot; even as a greeting is rather unusual in Austria (&quot;Grüß Gott&quot; is standard). It is virtually non-existent as a parting and feels very much out of place to me. It's very unlikely that she should say that. She should say &quot;(Auf) Wiedersehn&quot;.

list of vocabulary:
Österreich and Niederösterreich don't have articles (but they have neutral gender).
&quot;gutbürgerliche Küche&quot; is not really plain food, but rather good and traditional food.

:Sehr gut! I'll make the changes as you suggest.  As for the names of places, they are of course not meant to be real locations, but your suggestions seem helpful in adding to the authenticity of the lesson. I suppose I might need to find a way to indicate gender of nouns that normally do not take an article; perhaps &quot;(das) Österreich&quot; or &quot;[das] Österreich&quot; ?

This is a list of all the fruits generally considered edible by various cultures and used for culinary purposes. Some are not widely used and would be hard to get a hold of, but they offer interesting alternatives to the common or garden varieties.

Note that this is a list of &quot;fruits&quot; in the culinary sense of the word, not the botanical sense of the word. Consequently, items that are botanically classified as fruits, but are usually referred to in cooking as &quot;vegetables&quot; (such as the [[cookbook:Tomato|tomato]]) will be in the [[Cookbook:Vegetables|vegetables]] section, and not here. For a discussion of the '''botanical''' vs. '''culinary''' definitions of that part of a plant called the &quot;fruit&quot; see '''[[Wikipedia:en:Fruit|Fruit]]''' at ''Wikipedia''.

There exist also many fruits that are certainly edible and locally popular but for various reasons have not become widespread in their use.  Often this is due to marketing considerations, more than anything. 

== Temperate fruits ==
Fruits of temperate climates are almost universally borne on trees or woody shrubs or lianas. They will not grow adequately in the tropics, as they need a period of cold (a '''chilling requirement''') each year before they will flower. The [[Cookbook:Apple|apple]], [[Cookbook:Pear|pear]], [[Cookbook:Cherry|cherry]], and [[Cookbook:Plum|plum]] are the most widely grown and eaten, owing to their adaptability. Many other fruits are important regionally but do not figure prominently in commerce. Many sorts of small fruit on this list are gathered from the wild, just as they were in Neolithic times.

The [[Wikipedia:en:Rosaceae|Family Rosaceae]] dominates the temperate fruits, both in numbers and in importance. The pome fruits, stone fruits, brambles, and strawberry are all members of Rosaceae.

The '''[[wikipedia:pome|pome]]''' fruits:

[[Image:Fuji apple.jpg|thumb|right|Fuji apples]]

* [[Cookbook:Apple|Apple]] and crabapple (''Malus'' spp.)
* [[Cookbook:Chokeberry|Chokeberry]] also called cooking apple (''Aronia'' spp.)
* [[Cookbook:Haw|Haw]], the fruit of the hawthorn (''Crataegus'' spp.)
* [[Cookbook:Juneberry|Juneberry]] or saskatoon (''Amelanchier'' spp.)
* [[Cookbook:Medlar|Medlar]] (''Mespilus germanica'')
* [[Cookbook:Pear|Pear]], European and Asian species (''Pyrus'' spp.)
* [[Cookbook:Quince|Quince]] (''Cydonia oblonga'' and ''Chaenomeles'' spp.)
* [[Cookbook:Rowan|Rowan]] or mountain ash (''Sorbus aucuparia'')
* [[Cookbook:Sorb|Sorb]] or sorb apple, the fruit of the service tree (''Sorbus domestica'')
* [[Cookbook:Asian Pear|Asian pear]]

The '''stone fruits''', drupes of the Genus ''[[Prunus]]'':

[[Image:W outou4051.jpg|thumb|right|Cherries]]

* [[Cookbook:Apricot|Apricot]]
* [[Cookbook:Cherry|Cherry]], sweet, sour, and wild species (''Prunus avium'', ''P. cerasus'', and others)
* [[Cookbook:Plum|Plum]], of which there are several domestic and wild species; dried plums are called '''prunes'''
* [[Cookbook:Peach|Peach]] and its variant the [[Cookbook:Nectarine|nectarine]] (''Prunus persica'')
* Hybrids of the preceding species, such as the [[Cookbook:Pluot|pluot]]

In non-technical usage, '''berry''' means any small fruit that can be eaten whole and lacks objectionable seeds. The '''bramble fruits''', compound fruits of the Genus ''Rubus'', are some of the most popular pseudo-berries:

* [[Cookbook:Blackberry|Blackberry]], of which there are many species and hybrids, such as dewberry, [[Cookbook:Boysenberry|boysenberry]], and [[Cookbook:Loganberry|loganberry]]
* [[Cookbook:Tayberry|Tayberry]], a cross between Raspberry and Blackberries
* [[Cookbook:Raspberry|Raspberry]], several species (genus ''Rubus'')
* [[Cookbook:Cloudberry|Cloudberry]]
* [[Cookbook:Wineberry|Wineberry]]

The true berries are dominated by the [[Wikipedia:en:Ericaceae|Family Ericaceae]], many of which are hardy in the subarctic:

* [[Cookbook:Bearberry|Bearberry]]
* [[Cookbook:Bilberry|Bilberry]] or whortleberry or Blueberry (UK)
* [[Cookbook:Blueberry|Blueberry]]
* [[Cookbook:Cranberry|Cranberry]] (''Vaccinium'')
* [[Cookbook:Crowberry|Crowberry]]
* [[Cookbook:Huckleberry|Huckleberry]]
* [[Cookbook:Lingonberry|Lingonberry]]

Other berries (not in Ericaceae):

[[Image:Johannisbeeren.jpg|right|thumb|Red currants]]

* [[Cookbook:Barberry|Barberry]]
* [[Cookbook:Currant|Currant]] (''Ribes'' spp.), red, black, and white types
* [[Cookbook:Elderberry|Elderberry]]
* [[Cookbook:Gooseberry|Gooseberry]]
* [[Cookbook:Nannyberry|Nannyberry]] or sheepberry (''Viburnum'' spp.)
* [[Cookbook:Seaberry|Seaberry]] or sea buckthorn
* [[Cookbook:Wolfberry|Wolfberry]] (''Lycium barbarum'', ''Lycium'' spp.)

Some fruits native to [[Wikipedia:en:Asia|Asia]] that were not common elsewhere until the 20th century:

* [[Cookbook:Cornelian Cherry|Cornelian cherry]]
* [[Cookbook:Goumi|Goumi]]
* [[Cookbook:Jujube|Jujube]]
* [[Cookbook:Kiwifruit|Kiwifruit]] (a.k.a. the &quot;kiwi&quot; or Chinese gooseberry, ''Actinidia'' spp.)
* [[Cookbook:Loquat|Loquat]]
* [[Cookbook:Mulberry|Mulberry]] (some species)
* [[Cookbook:Persimmon|Persimmon]], ''Diospyros kaki''

Some tree fruits native to [[Wikipedia:en:North America|North America]] that are eaten in a small way:

* [[Cookbook:Buffaloberry|Buffaloberry]] (''Shepherdia argenta''), which grows wild in the prairies of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Canada|Canada]]
* [[Cookbook:Chokeberry|Chokeberry]] (''Aronia'' spp.)
* American [[Cookbook:Grape|grape]]: North American species (e.g., ''Vitis labrusca'') and American-European hybrids are grown where ''Vitis vinifera'' is not hardy and are used as [[wikipedia:rootstock|rootstock]]s
* [[Cookbook:Juneberry|Juneberry]] or saskatoon, which is cultivated in Canada (''Amelanchier'' spp.)
* [[Cookbook:Pawpaw|Pawpaw]] (''Asimina triloba'', not to be confused with ''Carica papaya'', which is called pawpaw in some English dialects)
* American [[Cookbook:Persimmon|persimmon]] (''Diospyros virginiana'')

Several [[Wikipedia:en:cactus|cacti]] yield edible fruits, which are important traditional foods for some Native American peoples:

* [[Cookbook:Prickly Pear|Prickly pear]]
* [[Cookbook:Saguaro|Saguaro]]

Some exceptions to the statement that temperate fruits grow on woody perennials are:

[[Image:Watermelon seedless.jpg|right|thumb|Watermelon]]

* [[Cookbook:Melon|Melon]] (''Cucumis melo''): cantaloupe and other [[Cookbook:Musk Melon|muskmelons]], [[Cookbook:Honeydew Melon|honeydew]]
* [[Cookbook:Sunberry|Sunberry]] or wonderberry (''Solanum'' spp.)
* [[Cookbook:Watermelon|Watermelon]] (''Citrullus vulgaris'')

The false fruits are not botanically fruits at all but are used as fruits in the kitchen:

[[Image:Truskawki.jpg|right|thumb|Strawberries]]

* [[Cookbook:Rhubarb|Rhubarb]]
* [[Cookbook:Strawberry|Strawberry]] (''Frigaria spp.'')

== Mediterranean and subtropical fruits ==
Fruits in this category are not hardy to extreme cold, as the preceding temperate fruits are, yet tolerate some frost and may have a modest chilling requirement. Notable among these are natives of the [[Wikipedia:en:Mediterranean|Mediterranean]]:

* [[Cookbook:Fig|Fig]] (''Ficus spp.'')
* [[Cookbook:Grape|Grape]], called [[Cookbook:raisin|raisin]], [[Cookbook:sultana|sultana]], or [[Cookbook:Currant|currant]] when dried (''Vitis'')
* [[Cookbook:Pomegranate|Pomegranate]]
* [[Cookbook:Date|Date]] (''Phoenix dactylifera'')
* [[Cookbook:Mulberry|Mulberry]]

In the important genus ''[[Cookbook:Citrus|Citrus]]'' some members are tropical, tolerating no frost. All common species of commerce are somewhat hardy:

[[Image:Mandarinen.jpg|thumb|right|Mandarins]]

* [[Cookbook:Citron|Citron]]
* [[Cookbook:Grapefruit|Grapefruit]] and its predecesor the [[Cookbook:pummelo|pummelo]] (also known as the shaddock)
* [[Cookbook:Kumquat|Kumquat]]
* [[Cookbook:Lemon|Lemon]]
* [[Cookbook:Lime|Lime]] (an important hybrid of the [[Cookbook:Key Lime|Key Lime]] and the [[Cookbook:Citron|Citron]])
* [[Cookbook:Mandarin|Mandarin]], [[Cookbook:clementine|clementine]], [[Cookbook:tangelo|tangelo]], [[Cookbook:Tangerine|tangerine]], and similar
* [[Cookbook:Orange|Orange]], of which there are sweet and sour species
* [[Cookbook:Ugli Fruit|Ugli fruit]], a hybrid

Other subtropical fruits:

* [[Cookbook:Feijoa|Feijoa]] (''Feijoa sellowiana'' or ''Acca sellowiana'')

* [[Cookbook:Tamarillo|Tamarillo]] (''Cyphomandra betacea'')

== Tropical fruits ==
Tropical fruit grow on plants of all habits. The only characteristic that they share is an intolerance of frost.

[[image:Pumpkins.jpg|right|251px|thumb|Pumpkins]]

A '''Pumpkin''' is a large, orange, spherical squash. In the USA, pumpkins are traditionally associated with Halloween and Thanksgiving and made into pumpkin pie. In other parts of the world, such as Australia, they are eaten year-round, usually as a savoury dish. It is similar in taste to [[Cookbook:Sweet Potato|sweet potato]].

There are many different varieties of pumpkin, and they have slightly different flavours, but the major differences are in the skin colour and the thickness of their rind. Some varieties have a very thin rind which is easy to cut and actually becomes edible when you cook the pumpkin, but as a whole the rind is discarded. Most varieties of pumpkin are at least technically edible. As a rule of thumb, the larger the pumpkin, the tougher the skin and the woodier and more tasteless the flesh. The large orange pumpkins sold for carving in the United States at Halloween are still edible, but they are not as good as pumpkins specifically grown for eating. This is less important if you are making pie, but is something to keep in mind when cooking pumpkins to eat directly.

==Preparing a Halloween Pumpkin for Eating==

When preparing pumpkin to eat, ensure that you've thoroughly washed the outside with warm water and soap or detergent. This is especially important for pumpkins bought in a 'pumpkin patch', since they may not have been washed before.  Although typical large carving pumpkins can taste awful, they are edible. It is always best to use &quot;cooking pumpkins&quot; when selecting a pumpkin which you intend to eat.  If you are carving it for Halloween before eating, wash it before you cut into it and rinse it again after displaying. This will cut down the amount of bacteria and fertilizer on the peel. Also make sure to cut off any pieces with wax or soot from candles on it. If your pumpkin has dirt on it, it may be worth it to rinse it off outside with a garden hose before washing it in your sink, to avoid making your sink dirty.

If you have a carved pumpkin which you are intending to eat, it would be best to avoid leaving it out for more than 2 days. If possible, carve it on Halloween and bring it in that night. Leave it in a cool, dark place until you cook it. At worst, you would end up with a moldy, rotten pumpkin. If you are lucky, then your pumpkin may just dry out a bit, and you end up with some pieces which are chewy. Either way, best to take down your pumpkin early, or you will have fruit flies!

==Cooking Pumpkin==
An interesting fact is that most canned 'pumpkin' is actually hubbard squash. Hubbard squash has the characteristic rich orange flesh and bold flavor that users of canned pumpkin will be familiar with. If you are trying to make home made pumpkin pie, you may have found that the taste of 'sweet pumpkins' is not as rich as what is normally found in canned pumpkin. For better results try using hubbard squash.

Pumpkin by itself is excellent. To cook pumpkin, slice into chunks no larger than 3&quot;x3&quot;, and all chunks must be about the same size. Leave the peel on. Steam in the microwave or on the stove until all pieces are soft and mushy. Then, you can serve directly at the dinner table with butter, leaving it to diners to remove the peel. Alternatively, you could let it cool, peel in the kitchen, mash it up with butter to taste, then heat and serve.

If you have a small pumpkin, you can roast it whole - just slice the top off first so that the steam can escape, and roast for about an hour. When it is done you can scoop out the seeds and discard, and if you remove some or most of the flesh you can use it as an unusual serving bowl to hold other food.

For a 'poor man's pumpkin pie', after peeling and mashing, instead of butter, mix with sugar, nutmeg, and cinnamon to taste. Serve hot, cold, or at room temperature.

For diners on controlled diets, the sugar and butter can be omitted, and still have a tasty side dish or dessert. Without the butter, pumpkin is a very low-fat food, and is also very high in certain vitamins.

=Force=

A net '''force''' on a body causes a body to accelerate.  The amount of that acceleration depends on the body's '''inertia''' (or its tendency to resist changes in motion), which is measured as its '''mass'''.  When Isaac Newton formulated Newtonian mechanics, he discovered three fundamental laws of motion. 

Later, Albert Einstein proved that these laws are just a convenient  approximation. These laws, however, greatly simplify calculations and are used when studying objects at velocities that are small compared with the speed of light.

==Friction==
'''It is the force that opposes relative motion or tendency of relative motion between two surfaces in contact''' represented by f.
When two surfaces move relative to each other or they have a tendency to move relative to each other, at the point (or surface) of contact, there appears a force which opposes this relative motion or tendency of relative motion between two surfaces in contact. It acts on both the surfaces in contact with equal magnitude and opposite directions (Newton's 3rd law). Friction force tries to stop relative motion between two surfaces in contact, if it is there, and when two surfaces in contact are at rest relative to each other, the friction force tries to maintain this relative rest. Friction force can assume the magnitude (below a certain maximum magnitude called limiting static friction) required to maintain relative rest between two surfaces in contact. Because of this friction force is called a self adjusting force.
 
Earlier, it was believed that friction was caused due to the roughness of the two surfaces in contact with each other. However, modern theory stipulates that the cause of friction is the Coulombic force between the atoms present in the surface of the regions in contact with each other.

Formula: Limiting Friction = (Friction Coefficient)(Normal reaction)

Static Friction = the friction force that keeps an object at relative rest.

Kinetic Friction = sliding friction

==Newton's First Law of Motion==
(The Law of Inertia)

'''A static object with no net force acting on it remains at rest or if in movement it will maintain a constant velocity'''

This means, essentially, that acceleration does not occur without the presence of a force. The object tends to maintain its state of motion. If it is at rest, it remains at rest and if it is moving with a velocity then it keeps moving with the same velocity. This tendency of the object to maintain its state of motion is greater for larger mass. The &quot;mass&quot; is, therefore, a measure of the inertia of the object.

In a state of equilibrium, where the object is at rest or proceeding at a constant velocity, the net force in every direction must be equal to 0.

At a constant velocity (including zero velocity), the '''sum of forces''' is 0. If the sum of forces does not equal zero, the object will accelerate (change velocity over time).

It is important to note, that this law is applicable only in non-accelerated coordinate systems. It is so, because the perception of force in accelerated systems are different. A body under balanced force system in one frame of reference, for example a person standing in an accelerating lift, is acted upon by a net force in the earth's frame of reference.   

'''Inertia is the tendency of an object to maintain its velocity i.e. to resist acceleration.'''
*Inertia is not a force.
*Inertia varies directly with mass.

==Newton's Second Law of Motion==

*'''The time rate of change in momentum is proportional to the applied force and takes place in the direction of the force.'''

*'''The acceleration of an object is proportional to the force acting upon it.''

These two statements mean the same thing, and is represented in the following basic form (the system of measurement is chosen such that constant of proportionality is 1) :

{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\vec{F} = \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(m\vec{v})&lt;/math&gt;}}

The product of mass and velocity i.e. ''m'''''v''' is called the momentum.  The net force on a particle is ,thus, equal to rate change of momentum of the particle with time. Generally mass of the object under consideration is constant and thus can be taken out of the derivative.

{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\vec{F} = m \frac{\mathrm{d}}{\mathrm{d}t}(\vec{v})= m\vec{a}&lt;/math&gt;}}


'''Force''' is equal to '''mass''' times '''acceleration'''.  This version of Newton's Second Law of Motion assumes that the mass of the body does not change with time, and as such, does not represent a general mathematical form of the Law.  Consequently, this equation cannot, for example, be applied to the motion of a rocket, which loses its mass (the lost mass is ejected at the rear of the rocket) with the passage of time.

An example:
If we want to find out the downward force of gravity on an object on Earth, we can use the following formula:
{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\|\vec{F}\| = m\|\vec{g}\|&lt;/math&gt;}}

Hence, if we replace m with whatever mass is appropriate, and multiply it by 9.806 65 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, it will give the force in newtons that the earth's gravity has on the object in question(in other words, the body's weight).

[[File:Example Newton's 2nd in 1D, Thrust and Drag.ogv|thumbtime=10:18|middle|720px|Example problem of Newton's 2nd law in one dimension.'']]

==Newton's Third Law of Motion==

'''Forces occur in pairs equal in magnitude and opposite in direction'''

This means that for every force applied on a body A by a body B, body B receives an equal force in the exact opposite direction.  This is because forces can only be applied by a body on another body.  It is important to note here that the pair of forces act on two different bodies, affecting their state of motion. This is to emphasize that pair of equal forces do not cancel out.

'''There are no spontaneous forces.'''

It is very important to note that the forces in a &quot;Newton 3 pair&quot;, described above, can never act on the same body. One acts on A, the other on B.  A common error is to imagine that the force of gravity on a stationary object and the &quot;contact force&quot; upwards of the table supporting the object are equal by Newton's third law.  This is not true. They may be equal - but because of the second law (their sum must be zero because the object is not accelerating), not because of the third.

The &quot;Newton 3 pair&quot; of the force of gravity (= earth's pull) on the object is the force of the object attracting the earth, pulling it upwards.  The &quot;Newton 3 pair&quot; of the table pushing it up is that it, in its turn, pushes the table down.

==Newtonian Gravity==
Newtonian Gravity (simplified gravitation) is an ''apparent'' [[../Force|force]] (a.k.a. ''pseudoforce'') that simulates the attraction of one mass to another mass. Unlike the three fundamental (real) forces of electromagnetism and the strong and weak nuclear forces, gravity is purely attractive. As a force it is measured in '''newtons'''. The distance between two objects is measured between their centers of mass.


{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt; F = \frac{Gm_1m_2}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;}}

'''Gravitational force''' is equal to the product of the '''universal gravitational constant''' and the masses of the two objects, divided by the square of the distance between their centers of mass.


{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt; g = \frac{Gm_1}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;}}

The value of the '''gravitational [[../Fields|field]]''' which is equivalent to '''the acceleration due to gravity''' caused by an object at a point in space is equal to the first equation about gravitational force, with the effect of the second mass taken out.


{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;U = -\frac{GMm}{r}&lt;/math&gt;}}

'''Gravitational potential energy of a body to infinity''' is equal to the '''universal gravitational constant''' times the mass of a body from which the gravitational field is being created times the mass of the body whose potential energy is being measured over '''the distance between the two centers of mass'''.  Therefore, the difference in potential energy between two points is the difference of the potential energy from the position of the center of mass to infinity at both points.  Near the earth's surface, this approximates:


{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\Delta U_g = mgh\ &lt;/math&gt;}}

'''Potential energy due to gravity near the earth's surface''' is equal to the product of mass, acceleration due to gravity, and height (elevation) of the object.

If '''the potential energy from the body's center of mass to infinity''' is known, however, it is possible to calculate the '''escape velocity''', or the velocity necessary to escape the gravitational field of an object.  This can be derived based on utilizing the '''law of conservation of energy''' and the equation to calculate '''kinetic energy''' as follows:


{{PSG/eq|
&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{ke}_{initial} = \Delta U &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \boldsymbol{ke}_{initial} = {U}_{infinity} - {U}_{initial} &lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{GMm}{r}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{v}_{esc} = \sqrt{\frac{2GM}{r}}&lt;/math&gt;

=Work =

'''Work''' is equal to the scalar product of '''force''' and '''displacement'''.
{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;W = \vec{F}\cdot\vec{d}&lt;/math&gt;}}
The scalar product of two vectors is defined as the product of their lengths with the cosine of the angle between them.
'''Work''' is equal to '''force''' times '''displacement''' times the cosine of the ''' angle ''' between the directions of force and displacement.
{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;W =\|\vec{F}\|\ \|\vec{d}\|\cos\theta&lt;/math&gt;}}
'''Work''' is equal to change in ''' kinetic energy ''' plus change in ''' potential energy ''' for example the potential energy due to gravity. &lt;!-- We'd better introduce energy somehow first. --&gt; 
{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;W = \Delta\mathrm{KE}+ \Delta\mathrm{PE}_g\ &lt;/math&gt;}}
'''Work''' is equal to average ''' power ''' times ''' time. '''
{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;W = Pt\ &lt;/math&gt;}}
The '''Work''' done by a force taking something from point 1 to point 2 is
{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;W_{1,2}=\int_{\vec{x}_1}^{\vec{x}_2}\vec{F}\cdot d\vec{l}&lt;/math&gt;}}


Work is in fact just a transfer of energy. When we 'do work' on an object, we transfer some of our energy to it. This means that the work done on an object is its increase in energy. Actually, the kinetic energy and potential energy is measured by calculating the amount of work done on an object. The gravitational potential energy (there are many types of potential energies) is measure as 'mgh'. mg is the weight/force. And h is the distance. The product is nothing but the work done. Even kinetic energy is a simple deduction from the laws of linear motion. Try substituing for v^2 in the formula for kinetic energy.

When work is applied to an object or a system it adds or removes '''kinetic energy''' to or from that object or system. More precisely, a net force in one direction, when applied to an object moving opposite or in the same direction as the force, kinetic energy will be added or removed to or from that object. Note that work and energy are measured in the same unit, the joule (J).

'''Whole spices compared to ground spices'''

Most spices and herbs are available in either a finely ground form for cooking or in the raw form as a seed, nut, leaf, or tuber.  Most of the time, the ground form is required to properly flavor the dish.  Generally, whole spices keep their flavor longer than the ground spices. [[Cookbook:South Asian cuisines|South Asian cuisines]] often use whole spices that they roast freshly before grinding for use, maximising the flavors and aromas released into the food.

Bay leaves are generally used in stews and soups and are almost always used whole.

'''Green spices compared to dried spices'''

Often, a recipe will require modifications if the fresh version is used because the flavors do change in the drying process. Fresh herbs are nearly always better than dried herbs, as some subtle aromatics are lost during drying. When substituted in recipes, one part dried herbs are approximately equal to 3 parts fresh herbs. For example, 1/3 tablespoon of dried basil is equal to about one tablespoon of chopped fresh basil.

== Differences ==

The difference between herbs and spices is that, if a leaf of a plant can be used to add flavor or aroma to dishes, then it is an herb. If it is another part, like the seed, fruit, berry, and bark, then it is a spice.

==Indian Spices==
{{cookwork|Move section to a separate page, expand and rewrite for factual correctness}}

The term &quot;curry powder&quot; is the English equivalent of the South Asian spice mixtures known as [[Cookbook:Garam masala|garam masala]].  However in South Asian cuisine these are far more varied in their content than the generic curry powders found in Western supermarkets and grocers. The primary spices used in Indian cooking are:

* [[Cookbook:Cumin|Cumin]] seeds, either ground or whole.  They are put in the oil before cooking.
* Ground [[Cookbook:Coriander|coriander]] seeds.
* [[Cookbook:Cardamom|Cardamom]] seeds, roasted in the oil before cooking
* [[Cookbook:Carom|Carom]] seeds, roasted in the oil before cooking
* [[Cookbook:Curry Leaf|Curry leaves]], used in South Indian cooking (very different from curry powder, see [[w:Curry Tree|Curry Tree]])
* [[Cookbook:Ginger|Ginger]], aromatic, pungent and spicy, adds a special flavor and zest to Asian stir fries and many fruit and vegetable dishes.
* [[Cookbook:Red pepper|Red pepper]], used to achieve hot flavor of Mexican, Creole, Cajun, Thai, and Indian cooking. Red pepper is a pungent, hot powder with a strong bite. It is advisable to use only small amounts of Red pepper as it intensifies as it is cooked.
* [[Cookbook:Garam Masala|Garam masala]], which depending on the recipe is either put in early or late in the cooking process, is a blend of roasted aromatic spices.
* [[Cookbook:Mustard Seed|Mustard seeds]], which are put in the oil before cooking until they pop and release their flavour.
* [[Cookbook:Nigella|Nigella]] (Kalonji) are small black seeds used to give naan bread its distinctive flavour.
* [[Cookbook:Panch Puran|Panch Puran]], a spice blend.
* [[Cookbook:Turmeric|Turmeric]] powder, which colors the dish.

Overall, the flavour of Indian cooking is made from a combination of these different spices, often with some of them roasted in oil at the beginning of cooking to release aromatic flavours.  Whether spices are added early or late in the cooking process and cooked in oil or dry roasted can greatly affect the flavour of the resulting dish. Different recipes from the various parts of India and surrounding countries use different combinations.

=Energy=

Kinetic energy is simply the capacity to do work by virtue of motion.

'''(Translational) kinetic energy''' is equal to one-half of '''mass''' times the square of '''velocity'''. 
{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{KE}_T=\frac{1}{2}m\|\vec{v}\|^2&lt;/math&gt;}}
'''(Rotational) kinetic energy''' is equal to one-half of '''moment of inertia''' times the square of '''angular velocity'''.
{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{KE}_R=\frac{1}{2}I\omega^2&lt;/math&gt;}}
'''Total kinetic energy''' is simply the sum of the translational and rotational kinetic energies.  In most cases, these energies are separately dealt with.  It is easy to remember the rotational kinetic energy if you think of the moment of inertia I as the ''rotational mass''.  However, you should note that this substitution is not universal but rather a rule of thumb.

Potential energy is simply the capacity to do work by virtue of position (or arrangement) relative to some zero-energy reference position (or arrangement).

'''Potential energy''' due to gravity is equal to the product of '''mass''', '''acceleration''' due to gravity, and '''height (elevation)''' of the object. 
{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PE}_g= -m\vec{g}\cdot\vec{x}=mgy&lt;/math&gt;}}
Note that this is simply the vertical displacement multiplied by the weight of the object.  The reference position is usually the level ground but the initial position like the rooftop or treetop can also be used.
'''Potential energy''' due to spring deformation is equal to one-half the product of the '''spring constant''' times the square of the '''change in length''' of the spring.
{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{PE}_e=\frac{1}{2}k\|\vec{x}-\vec{x}_e\|^2=\frac{1}{2}k\|\Delta\vec{x}\|^2&lt;/math&gt;}}
The reference point of spring deformation is normally when the spring is &quot;relaxed,&quot; i.e. the net force exerted by the spring is zero. It will be easy to remember that the one-half factor is inserted to compensate for finite '&quot;change in length&quot; since one would want to think of the product of force and change in length &lt;math&gt;(k\Delta\vec{x})\cdot\Delta\vec{x}&lt;/math&gt; directly.  Since the force actually varies with &lt;math&gt;\Delta\vec{x}&lt;/math&gt;, it is instructive to need a &quot;correction factor&quot; during integration.

'''Energy:''' a theoretically indefinable quantity that describes potential to do work. SI unit for energy is the joule (J). Also common is the calorie (cal). &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''The joule:''' defined as the energy needed to push with the force of one newton over the distance of one meter. Equivalent to one newton-meter (N&amp;middot;m) or one watt-second (W&amp;middot;s).&lt;br&gt;
:'''1 joule = 1 J = 1 newton • 1 meter = 1 watt • 1 second'''&lt;br&gt;
Energy comes in many varieties, including Kinetic energy, Potential energy, and Heat energy.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Kinetic energy (K):''' The energy that an object has due to its motion. Half of velocity squared times mass. Units: joules (J)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Potential energy due to gravity (U&lt;sub&gt;G&lt;/sub&gt;):''' The energy that an object has stored in it by elevation from a mass, such as raised above the surface of the earth. This energy is released when the object becomes free to move. Mass times height time acceleration due to gravity. Units: joules (J) &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Potential energy due to spring compression (U&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;):''' Energy stored in spring when it is compressed. Units: joules (J)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Heat energy (Q):''' Units: joules (J)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Spring compression (D&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;):''' The difference in length between the spring at rest and the spring when stretched or compressed. Units: meters (m)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Spring constant (k):''' a constant specific to each spring, which describes its “springiness”, or how much work is needed to compress the spring. Units: newtons per meter (N/m) &lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Change in spring length (&amp;Delta;x):''' The distance between the at-rest length of the spring minus the compressed or extended length of the spring. Units: meters (m)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Moment of inertia (I):''' Describes mass and its distribution. (kg•m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
'''Angular momentum (&amp;omega;):''' Angular velocity times mass (inertia). (rad/s)

=Momentum= 

==Linear momentum==
{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\vec{p} = m\vec{v}&lt;/math&gt;}}
'''Momentum''' is equal to '''mass''' times '''velocity'''.

==Angular momentum==


{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\vec{L} = \vec{r}\times\vec{p} = m\vec{r}\times\vec{v}&lt;/math&gt;}}
'''Angular momentum''' of an object revolving around an external axis '''O''' is equal to the cross-product of the '''position vector''' with respect to '''O''' and its '''linear momentum'''.


{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\vec{L} = I\vec{\omega}&lt;/math&gt;}}

'''Angular momentum''' of a rotating object is equal to the '''moment of inertia''' times '''angular velocity'''.

==Force and linear momentum, torque and angular momentum==

{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\vec{F} = \frac{\Delta\vec{p}}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt;}}

is equal to the '''change in linear momentum''' over the '''change in time'''.


{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\vec{\tau} = \frac{\Delta\vec{L}}{\Delta t}&lt;/math&gt;}}

'''Net torque''' is equal to the '''change in angular momentum''' over the '''change in time'''.

==Conservation of momentum==


{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}_i = \mathbf{p}_f&lt;/math&gt;}}


{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\vec{L}_i = \vec{L}_f&lt;/math&gt;}}

Let us prove this law. 

We'll take two particles, say, ''a'' and ''b''. Their momentums are &lt;math&gt;\vec p_a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\vec p_b&lt;/math&gt;.They are moving opposite to each other along the x-axis and they collide.
Now force is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\vec{F} = \frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{p}}{\mathrm{d}t}&lt;/math&gt;
According to Newton's third law,the forces on each particle are equal and opposite.So,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\mathrm{d}\vec{p}_a}{\mathrm{d}t} =- \frac{\mathrm{d} \vec{p}_b}{\mathrm{d}t}&lt;/math&gt;
Rearranging, 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d (\vec{p}_a + \vec{p}_b)}{\mathrm{d}t} =0&lt;/math&gt;

This means that the sum of the momentums does not change with time. Therefore, the law is proved.

&lt;H2&gt;Variables&lt;/H2&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== Grammatik 4-4 ~ Personal Pronouns: Accusative Case ==
Here are the personal pronouns in the '''accusative''' case: 


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFCC&quot;
|-
|
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &lt;center&gt;Singular&lt;/center&gt;
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &lt;center&gt;Plural&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1st person || &amp;nbsp;'''mich'''&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;me&amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;'''uns''' || &amp;nbsp;us
|-
| 2nd person&amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;'''dich''' ('''Sie'''*)
| &amp;nbsp;you
| &amp;nbsp;'''euch''' ('''Sie'''*) || &amp;nbsp;you
|-
| 3rd person
| &amp;nbsp;'''ihn, sie, es&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;'''
| &amp;nbsp;him, her, it&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;'''sie''' &lt;small&gt;(all genders)&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/small&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;them&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|} *&lt;small&gt;'''Polite''' form.&lt;/small&gt; 

The accusative case is that of the object of a verb. Only transitive verbs take direct objects. The pronoun (and noun in two cases) '''object''' in each of these sentences is &lt;u&gt;underlined&lt;/u&gt; in the German and the English:
 ''Können Sie &lt;u&gt;mich&lt;/u&gt; verstehen?''       Can you understand &lt;u&gt;me&lt;/u&gt;?
 ''Ich kann &lt;u&gt;Sie&lt;/u&gt; verstehen.''          I can understand &lt;u&gt;you&lt;/u&gt;. 
 ''Ich kann &lt;u&gt;sie&lt;/u&gt; verstehen''           I can understand (&lt;u&gt;her&lt;/u&gt; or &lt;u&gt;them&lt;/u&gt;).
 ''Ich kann &lt;u&gt;ihn&lt;/u&gt; dir zurück kicken!''  I can kick &lt;u&gt;it&lt;/u&gt; back to you!
Note the order of the pronouns in this last sentence. If the direct object (here: ''ihn'') is a personal pronoun, it precedes the dative (''dir''); if it were a noun, the dative would precede it, as in these sentences:
 ''Hier, ich kicke dir &lt;u&gt;den Ball&lt;/u&gt; zu.''       Here, I kick &lt;u&gt;the ball&lt;/u&gt; to you. 
 ''Darf ich Ihnen &lt;u&gt;meine Freundin&lt;/u&gt; vorstellen?''   May I introduce &lt;u&gt;my friend&lt;/u&gt; to you? 

Other uses of the accusative case in German will be explored in future lessons. Tables of the personal pronouns in all cases are summarized in [[German/Appendix 3|Pronoun Tables]].

== Grammatik 4-5 ~ Personal Pronouns in the Dative Case ==
Here are the personal pronouns in the '''dative''' case: 


{| border=&quot;1&quot; bgcolor=&quot;#FFFFCC&quot;
|-
|
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &lt;center&gt;Singular&lt;/center&gt;
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; | &lt;center&gt;Plural&lt;/center&gt;
|-
| 1st person || &amp;nbsp;'''mir'''&amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;me&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;'''uns''' || &amp;nbsp;us
|-
| 2nd person&amp;nbsp; || &amp;nbsp;'''dir''' ('''Ihnen'''*)
| &amp;nbsp;you
| &amp;nbsp;'''euch''' ('''Ihnen'''*) || &amp;nbsp;you
|-
| 3rd person || &amp;nbsp;'''ihm, ihr, ihm'''
| &amp;nbsp;him, her, it&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| &amp;nbsp;'''ihnen''' &lt;small&gt;(all genders)&lt;/small&gt;
| &amp;nbsp;them&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
|}*&lt;small&gt;'''Polite''' form.&lt;/small&gt;

The dative case is that of the indirect object of a verb. The pronoun '''indirect object''' of these sentences is &lt;u&gt;underlined&lt;/u&gt; in the German and the English:
 ''Es geht &lt;u&gt;mir&lt;/u&gt; gut''              It goes (for) &lt;u&gt;me&lt;/u&gt; well 
 ''Wie geht es &lt;u&gt;dir&lt;/u&gt;?''             How goes it (for or with) &lt;u&gt;you&lt;/u&gt;
 ''Und können Sie &lt;u&gt;mir&lt;/u&gt; sagen...?''     And can you tell &lt;u&gt;me&lt;/u&gt;...?
 ''Karl gibt &lt;u&gt;ihm&lt;/u&gt; den Ball''       Karl gave &lt;u&gt;him&lt;/u&gt; the ball.
 ''Wie geht es &lt;u&gt;Ihnen&lt;/u&gt;?''           How goes it (with) &lt;u&gt;you&lt;/u&gt;? (How are you?)             
This last sentence is an example from Gespräch 1-2 using the polite form of 'you'. Whether singular or plural must be established by context. This next sentence translates with ''ihnen'' as 'them':
 ''Wie geht es &lt;u&gt;ihnen&lt;/u&gt;?''           How goes it with &lt;u&gt;them&lt;/u&gt;? (How are they?)
The meaning of ''ihnen'' (or ''Ihnen'') would have to come from context in a conversation.

Another use of the dative case in German is after these prepositions: '''''aus, bei, mit, nach, seit, von, zu'''''. You will be introduced to the meanings of these prepositions over many future lessons rather than all at once, because some have many meanings in English. Indeed, because each language associates specific prepositions with many common sayings (and these often do not correspond in German and English), these &quot;little&quot; words can be troublesome for students. Nonetheless, you should memorize now the list of prepositions above to always remember their association with the dative case. Tables of the pronouns in all cases are summarized in [[German/Appendices/Phrasebook|Appendix 2]].

Word order in a German sentence with an indirect object depends upon whether that direct object is a pronoun or a noun. If the &lt;u&gt;direct object is a noun, the dative precedes the accusative&lt;/u&gt;; if the &lt;u&gt;direct object is a personal pronoun, the accusative precedes the dative&lt;/u&gt;:
{|
|''Ich gebe dem Jungen den Ball.''
|I give the boy the ball.
|-                      
|''Ich gebe ihm den Ball.''
|I give him the ball.
|-
|''Ich gebe ihn ihm.''
|I give it to him.
|-
|''Ich gebe ihn dem Jungen.''
|I give it to the boy.

Great edits! Just a tip, you can use &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; to stop html tags auto-rendering. Have a look at what I've done with the tag section of [[Programming:HTML]]
