'''Appetizers''' are dishes served before a meal or at a cocktail party or other informal occasion.  They are often referred to as ''snacks'' or ''hors d' oeuvres''.  

In general, appetizers are intended to be eaten by hand in a bite or two, or at least be capable of being cut with the side of a fork, rather than a knife.  Since appetizers are a customary course in French and Italian cooking, among other styles of cooking, it is fairly easy to find haute cuisine recipes for appetizers.  

Arguably, one fundamental, unspoken, purpose of appetizers, especially in a restaurant setting, is to keep hungry people fed until the main dish is served.  

In a home setting, people who might have trouble getting the main meal on the table in a timely fashion on a particular day, such as a holiday, might especially want to have planned in advance to serve an appetizer of some type or sort.

One of the most fundamental appetizer categories in modern times, ignoring haute cuisine, is the ''dip'' and ''carrier'' combination, of which the variations are endless.

----

== Wiederholung ==
Lesson 5 is a review (''Wiederholung'') lesson to summarize the German language lessons presented in Lessons 1 through 4. You should, then, return to [[German/Lesson_1|Lektion 1]] and review (that is, reread) each of the four lessons back up to this point.  For a more advanced course, you might now incorporate each of the advanced lessons into this &quot;review&quot; process.  That is: review Lesson 1, then do Lesson 1A, review Lesson 2, then do Lesson 2A, etc.
----

== Parts of Speech and Word Order ==
Sentences are composed of parts that perform specific functions. You have been introduced to most (but not all) the major parts of speech: pronouns/nouns, verbs, and adjectives; and how these are expressed in German compared with English.  Consider the following:

'''''Ich brauche Wurst und Käse'''''
:I (pronoun as subject) need (verb) sausage and cheese (nouns as direct objects)
'''''Haben sie zu viel Arbeit?'''''
:Have (verb) they (pronoun subject) too much (adjectives) work (noun direct object)?

Word order in a simple sentence follows that used in English. Subject and verb are reversed to form a question. In English, but not in German, the question sentence could also be stated (and, in fact, occurs more often in the US) as 'Do they have too much work?'

== Nouns ==
Nouns are words that typically occur in sentences as either subjects (performers of some action) or objects (recipients of some action). Most nouns are the name of either a &quot;person, place, or thing&quot; and, in German, are always capitalized.  Every noun in German has an &quot;assigned&quot; gender (&lt;u&gt;masculine&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;feminine&lt;/u&gt;, &lt;u&gt;neuter&lt;/u&gt;), and we learn each noun with its nominative case, definite article (''der'', ''die'', ''das'', respectively) in order to also learn that gender.  Thus, a ''Vokabeln'' section for nouns is presented thusly:
 der Anhang, die Anhänge      appendix, appendices      (singular and plural)
 die Brücke                   bridge
 der Freund, die Freunde      friend, friends           (singular and plural)
 das Gespräch, die Gespräche  conversation, conversations
 die Gram'''mat'''ik                grammar                   (note irregular stress) 
 die Lek'''tion'''                  lesson                    (note irregular stress)
 die Straße                   street

[[Image:Chocolate.jpg|thumb|Chocolate, a common confection.]]

'''Confections''', also known as '''sweets''', '''lollies''', and '''candy''', refers to any sweet, sugar-rich dish or food item. Confectionery items include sweets, lollipops, candy bars, chocolate and other sweet items of snack food. 

''Note: If you are going to list a recipe here, first check the [[Cookbook:Dessert|dessert]] section to see if it would be better listed there.''

Can someone guide me on how to enter letters in the Devanagari script? I can probably cover some of the basic grammar, having studied Hindi for 10 years now! [[User:Gokul madhavan|Gokul madhavan]] 13:45, 14 Feb 2004 (UTC)

Well, I'm going to bed now. :) I just wanted to say that I know the book looks like a mess but I know what I'm doing and it's gonna be great. :)

== Writing lessons ==

I would really like to see lessons teaching how to read and write Hindi step-by-step. It's hard to learn from an overview of letters. Lack of examples is another problem, but even if there were examples afterwards the learning situation would be far from perfect because the student would still have to memorise all letters at once in order to be able to begin practising. 

What I have found really useful when learning non-Latin alphabets is a &quot;divide and conquer&quot; method that introduces few letters at a time and offers example words for practise immediately after each letter / each set of letters. What's even better is if those example words are understandable without prior knowledge of the language, that is, international words. For example: names of countries, cities or famous people (if their name isn't significantly different in Hindi than in English), common personal names, Hindi words that have entered English, English words that are used in Hindi, words that both Hindi and English have derived from Greek or Latin...  The advantage of using these words is that students will be able to quickly see their own progress and the whole learning process becomes as fascinating as solving a puzzle. See the &quot;Read Write and Pronounce Greek&quot; lessons in the [[Modern Greek]] Wikibook for an example, or [http://www.alphadictionary.com/rusgrammar/alphabet.html this external page on Cyrillic]. 

If you'd like to try this approach for teaching how to write Hindi, I'd be glad to help you, even though I don't know it yet (I'd learn it though and I have learned a variety of foreign alphabets already). Just create a big list of suitable words on a planning page like [[Modern Greek/Writing lessons plan]], answer me here and I'll try to find an optimal order for letters. 

Thanks for your efforts to teach a language that is hard to find in European schools!

[[User:Junesun|Junesun]] 16:37, 11 July 2006 (UTC)

P.S.: If there's somebody generally unsure about how to create good language lessons, I really recommend reading the following two pages about it: [[Authoring Foreign Language Textbooks]] and [[Authoring Foreign Language Textbooks/Bite-sized language lessons]].

== Transliteration scheme ==

This book uses a ton of different [[w:Transliteration|transliteration]] schemes. It's confusing and it looks like a total mess. I suggest that [[w:ISO 15919|ISO 15919]] be used throughout the page. I'll look into doing some machine transliteration myself if I can find the proper software. [[User:Tasnu Arakun|Tasnu Arakun]] ([[User talk:Tasnu Arakun|talk]]) 18:24, 12 November 2008 (UTC)

== In e-book/pdf format ==

There are tons of free online lessons on Hindi available but I haven't ever found one that is downloadable format. So maybe we can produce the Hindi Wikibook in a pdf format. I can do the compilation and editing and producing part. And the German wikibook has a great structure that could be followed. We'd need more content as well.[[User:Shyboy16|Shyboy16]] ([[User talk:Shyboy16|talk]]) 10:14, 14 April 2010 (UTC)</text>

&lt;h2&gt;Strong Nouns&lt;/h2&gt;
This is the strong noun A-Stem section, there are other kinds of strong nouns but we will deal with those later.


&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Masculine A-Stem Nouns&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Gothic has strong and weak nouns (along with strong and weak adjectives!).  There are many stems or different declensions within each class of nouns.  Here I will show you a-stem nouns.  There are three genders in Gothic:  masculine, feminine, neuter.  These are not always sex-based as in English.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

{| border=&quot;3&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot;
|+ A-Stem Nouns
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | || align=&quot;center&quot; | Singular
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Plural
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Nominative || align=&quot;center&quot; | -s
| align=&quot;center&quot; | -os
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Accusative || align=&quot;center&quot; | -
| align=&quot;center&quot; | -ans
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Genitive || align=&quot;center&quot; | -is
| align=&quot;center&quot; | -e
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Dative || align=&quot;center&quot; | -a
| align=&quot;center&quot; | -am
|}
&lt;p&gt;
Now onto the masculine article (definite).  Gothic has no indefinite article (a, an) but only a definite (the) which has masculine, feminine, and neuter forms.
&lt;p&gt;

{| border=&quot;3&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot;
|+ Masculine Article
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | || align=&quot;center&quot; | Singular
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Plural
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Nominative || align=&quot;center&quot; | sa
| align=&quot;center&quot; | thai
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Accusative || align=&quot;center&quot; | thana
| align=&quot;center&quot; | thans
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Genitive || align=&quot;center&quot; | this
| align=&quot;center&quot; | thize
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Dative || align=&quot;center&quot; | thamma
| align=&quot;center&quot; | thaim
|}
&lt;p&gt;For a while here I'm going to be basically throwing you &lt;b&gt;a lot&lt;/b&gt; of tables.  But here I'll explain the cases:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nominative&lt;/b&gt;:  marks the subject of the sentence
&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Accusative&lt;/b&gt;:  marks the direct object of the sentence
&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Genitive&lt;/b&gt;:  marks possession
&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dative&lt;/b&gt;:  marks the indirect object of a sentence.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;h2&gt;Strong Nouns&lt;/h2&gt;
This is the strong noun A-Stem section, there are other kinds of strong nouns but we will deal with those later.


&lt;p&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Masculine A-Stem Nouns&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

Gothic has strong and weak nouns (along with strong and weak adjectives!).  There are many stems or different declensions within each class of nouns.  Here I will show you a-stem nouns.  There are three genders in Gothic:  masculine, feminine, neuter.  These are not always sex-based as in English.
&lt;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;

{| border=&quot;3&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot;
|+ A-Stem Nouns
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | || align=&quot;center&quot; | Singular
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Plural
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Nominative || align=&quot;center&quot; | -s
| align=&quot;center&quot; | -os
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Accusative || align=&quot;center&quot; | -
| align=&quot;center&quot; | -ans
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Genitive || align=&quot;center&quot; | -is
| align=&quot;center&quot; | -e
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Dative || align=&quot;center&quot; | -a
| align=&quot;center&quot; | -am
|}
&lt;p&gt;
Now onto the masculine article (definite).  Gothic has no indefinite article (a, an) but only a definite (the) which has masculine, feminine, and neuter forms.
&lt;p&gt;

{| border=&quot;3&quot; cellspacing=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;1&quot;
|+ Masculine Article
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | || align=&quot;center&quot; | Singular
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Plural
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Nominative || align=&quot;center&quot; | sa
| align=&quot;center&quot; | thai
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Accusative || align=&quot;center&quot; | thana
| align=&quot;center&quot; | thans
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Genitive || align=&quot;center&quot; | this
| align=&quot;center&quot; | thize
|-
| align=&quot;center&quot; | Dative || align=&quot;center&quot; | thamma
| align=&quot;center&quot; | thaim
|}
&lt;p&gt;For a while here I'm going to be basically throwing you &lt;b&gt;a lot&lt;/b&gt; of tables.  But here I'll explain the cases:
&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Nominative&lt;/b&gt;:  marks the subject of the sentence
&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Accusative&lt;/b&gt;:  marks the direct object of the sentence
&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Genitive&lt;/b&gt;:  marks possession
&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Dative&lt;/b&gt;:  marks the indirect object of a sentence.

Guaka, je hebt waarschijnlijk het aantal spaties tussen de woorden in het Nederlands en Engels gewijzigd, maar nu ziet het er bij mij heel raar uit. Eerst was het bij mij goed (de tweede kolom begon overal op dezelfde plek), nu fout; bij jou is het waarschijnlijk andersom. Wat wel raar is, want regels met een spatie zouden monospaced moeten zijn, dus voor iedereen hetzelde. Zijn de volgende regels voor jou monospaced?

 test                    20 spaties later
 langere test mmmmm      6 spaties later

::The gender problem.
This section is confusing. The northern Dutch varieties had already pretty much lost the three gender system by the end of the 17th century. The spelling system, and the lexicographic tradition servicing spelling needs, articifially maintained the three gender system until the mid-20th century, and consequently dictionary entries still contain the indications m or v for common gender nouns. But the standard language simply has a two gender system and it will be much easier for learners to just stick to that. Another problem is that anaphoric reference by means of demonstratives does not relate to the grammatical gender but to sex: so you get 'het meisje en haar vriend' (the-NTR girl-DIM and her friend). Since this is not generally acknowledged people are generally at a loss as to which demonstrative to use with nonanimate nouns, often resorting to a hypercorrect feminine demonstrative. In view of this, I'll just have a go at simpifying this section.

:tja daarmee heb je natuurlijk wel alle Vlaamse Nederlandstaligen weer eens buitenspel gezet. Bovendien zijn woorden op -ing en -heid wel degelijk vrouwelijk. Ook in het Noorden. Ze komen dan ook regelmatig voor met ''ter''.  Verder denk ik dat je possessives met demonstratives verwart.

::Let me say that in English too: by doing this you have once again denied all Flemish speakers the right to consider this their language too. (This is a bad Dutch habit for which this Dutchman is utterly ashamed). Besides words like the ones on -ing and -heid are feminine even in the North. (See the official word list of the Taalunie known as the little Green Book: it also contains gender. Including m, f and common.) Words on -ing often occur with the distinctly feminine ''ter'', also in the North. Besides I think you are confusing demonstratives and possessives. ''Haar'' is a possessive, not a demonstrative.

::Besides it is really confusing to say that 'de man' and 'de vrouw' are both common gender. Even in English it is recognized that 'the man' is masculine and 'the woman' is feminine. This is why they are refered to as he and she (hij and zij).

Finding your family village name: 
You must find your ancestor’s community's name before you will be able to locate ancestral records that were recorded in the &quot;old country.&quot; This will usually require beginning research in the U.S., or whatever your home country, to determine the correct community.

First, begin with yourself. Gather everything you know about your own origins: where you were born, what religion you were raised in, your own civil and religious records. Then go back one generation at a time, looking for all of the available information you have. Where did your parents live? Where were they born? Gather their records. Sometimes even the smallest detail can lead you on the path to discovery. At times, you will not be able to locate a particular record for a parent or grandparent. If that is the case, look for records of their siblings. Often those will have the information you seek.

=Records to Search=

==Family documents:==

Get out those old shoe boxes, start reading and really look at the details. Old letters often contain family connections, dates, locations and hints to lead you in the right direction. The same applies to old photographs which may have names and dates, or the photograpy studio or photographer’s name. Address books, postcards and, of course, family Bibles contain information and clues. Deeds, marriage certificates, naturalization papers, social security papers, Wills, and even insurance policies can be sources for information. I found one great-great grandmother’s address in Poland in an old personal address book which was about to be thrown out when her granddaughter passed on.

Contact your relatives. Many families are large, and an aunt, great-uncle, or distant cousin may have family documents you were not even aware existed. Begin with the one who was closest to your ancestor or cared for them before they died. Often those relatives end up with the ancestor’s documents.

An important note about family Bibles: in most of the older Bibles, the family information is listed about 2/3 to 3/4 of the way toward the back of the book (unlike modern Bibles where this information is listed in the first few pages).

==Public Records==

Public records in general present some problems. Families changed their names; names were misspelled due to language barriers; phonetic spellings were used by clerks; different pronunciation of letters from one language to the next, typographical errors and poor penmanship created transcription errors, among others. Some records are missing due to misfiling, or were destroyed by fire and flood. This is as true in the U.S. as it is in other countries; the 1890 Federal Census being a prime example.

===Vital records===

Birth, marriage and death records are generally located in the county seat in which the event happened (in the USA, other arrangements apply in the rest of the world). The cost of those records vary from county to county, and often depend upon whether you ask for a certified copy of the record or just a genealogical copy (generally cost less). 

Most U.S. counties can be accessed on the web as follows:
www.co.”countyname”.”state two letter abbreviation”.us/ (omit the quotation marks in your search. If that doesn’t work, just do a web search with your favorite search engine. The information for obtaining the records should be on the county site. In the U.S. this information can be found on the USGenWeb site: http://www.usgenweb.org/. There is also a World GenWeb site that may help for researching in other countries: http://www.worldgenweb.org/.

Another source to find vital records by state in the U.S. can be found at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/howto/w2w/w2welcom.htm. Some of these state sites give the year in which the state began to maintain the records, the locations to find earlier records, and refer to databases which are also searchable on the web.

===SSDI===

The Social Security Death Index is available free on line at  http://ssdi.rootsweb.com/  Scroll down a bit and just put the name in the search box, and a list of persons with that name will come up. The Social Security Death Index is generally updated every three months.

When a person is found, the name, date of birth, date of death, last residence, the state in which the number was issued, and the number itself is shown. If you wish to obtain a copy of the original Social Security Application, you can click on the SS-5 letter link. The following information was requested on the application: Name, current address, birthdate, birthplace (generally City and State, place of employment and business address (if applicable) and names of parents (mother’s full maiden name).

Social Security is constantly updating this file.  If the person for whom you are looking recently died, they probably won't be here.  Give it a few months before you check again.

===Obituaries===

Published obituaries can be a valuable source of information. Often parents’ names, spouses, children and surviving siblings are shown. This is especially valuable if you are unable to locate information on your ancestor and don’t have the female siblings’ married names. Generally, if listed at all, it is with their then present married name, giving you another piece of information to allow you to continue your search.

Obituaries may be found in the “morgue” of the local newspapers, historical libraries in various cities and counties, and some public libraries have film or online databases for obituaries, marriages and death notices.

===Alien Registration===

Alien registration was required beginning in 1940 for resident aliens in the USA. The records can be obtained for the years 1940-1944 from the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

===Voter Registration===

Most U.S. counties and states keep voter registration records. The states’ records are generally kept in the office of the Secretary of State. You can check with the county or state departments for information. Additionally, the LDS has filmed numerous voter registration indexes for various areas of the United States. You can check their Family History Library Catalog on line to see if your location has been filmed. http://www.familysearch.org/eng/Library/FHLC/frameset_fhlc.asp


===WWI Draft Registration===
In 1917 and 1918 males old enough to serve in the military were required to register for the draft, whether citizen or alien. See more detailed information on Ancestry [http://images.ancestry.com/iexec?htx=list&amp;cat=WW1 WWI Draft Information at Ancestry.com]

The LDS has compiled the WWI Draft Registration on microfiche arranged by state of residence, and you can contact your local Family History Center to view the registration records. Information is available at 
[http://www.familysearch.org/eng/Library/fhlcatalog/supermainframeset.asp?display=titledetails&amp;titleno=995075&amp;disp=Register+of+World+War+I+draft+registrati%20%20&amp;columns=*,0,0 WWII Draft Info at FamilySearch.org]

===United States Census===

The U.S. census is an excellent source of information, although it won’t usually give you the town of origin, it will give the country and occasionally the Province, such as “Prussian Posen” or “Russian Warsawa”. Keep in mind that the reference to “Posen” and “Warsawa” in these records generally refer to the Province and not the city.

Remember that these records are organized by family group.  You will generally find parents and children, but sometime will also find grandparents and even great-grandparents living with their descendants.  This information is also valuable because it provides a fairly accurate view of where the family (including siblings) were located when the individal census was taken - given several, this can show how the family members came and went in a household.

Census films may be obtained at your local Family History Center of the LDS (see the Family History Library search page listed under voter registration above) or through the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) http://www.archives.gov/research_room/genealogy/research_topics/census_records.html.

These records are also available on line through the paid genealogical subscription sites, www.Ancestry.com and www.Genealogy.com.

===Immigration records===

There are a number of sources for ship manifests, and their availability varies with the time and port to which your ancestor immigrated. The most well-known is the Ellis Island database on line, and if your ancestors immigrated between 1892 and 1924 to the port of New York, you may find that information free online: http://www.ellisisland.org/sign/index.asp?ACT=LL&amp;login_targ=none. You must register to use the site, but it is without charge. 

There have been some problems with the Ellis Island database indexing and linking, and the usual problems with misspellings and transcription errors. Another site which can help with such problems is the Stephen P. Morse website which gives search options not available from the Ellis Island site, and a way in which to find “missing manifests.” http://stevemorse.org/

For more information on Ellis Island records, go to the Jewish GenWeb site:
http://www.jewishgen.org/infofiles/eidbfaq.html

The LDS has filmed numerous passengers records for many ports, and have some ports indexed so that you can find your ancestor’s name and arrival date before you order the actual manifest. Again, you can check what records they hold at http://www.familysearch.org/eng/Library/FHLC/frameset_fhlc.asp

NARA also has many manifests for U.S. ports: http://www.archives.gov/research_room/genealogy/immigrant_arrivals/passenger_records.html

Additional passenger arrival information can be found on the following sites: 

Immigration and Ships Passenger Lists Research Guide http://home.att.net/~arnielang/ship04.html#whatrec

Polish Genealogical Society of America
http://www.pgsa.org/ships.htm

An extensive reference for immigration to Australia, Canada, Europe, the U.S. and other parts of the world is found on Mary’s Genealogy Treasures at: http://www.telusplanet.net/public/mtoll/immigr.htm.

Declarations of Intent or Citizenship Applications are generally found in the local county court of residence prior to the Federal government taking over the naturalization process. A guide to finding these records is found at: http://www.germanroots.com/naturalizationrecords.html

There are some free and paid searchable naturalization databases on the web for the U.S. and Canada at: http://www.germanroots.com/naturalization.html

===Land records===

These are often harder to obtain and study than other documents, but they may hold clues, if not outright references to former residence.

===Probate records===

Again, these may hold clues, if not outright references to former residence.

==Religious records==

Baptismal records and marriage applications kept by the churches often have parents’ names and place of birth. If you cannot find your ancestor’s batismal certificate, you may have be able to find a sibling’s record and locate the information indirectly.

Catholic records are generally kept in the parish in which the ceremony was performed. If a parish has closed, the records may have been sent to the Diocese or Archdiocese archives, or to the nearest church still in existence. Many local parishes are now on line in the U.S. To locate a specific church by town or city and even by foreign Language masses, this site is very helpful:  [http://www.masstimes.org/ASP/ http://www.masstimes.org/ASP/ ]. There is even a scrollable map so you can find a parish nearest your ancestors’ home.

There is no set web address for the Archidiocese in the U.S., but a web search for “catholic archdiocese” and the city or state will generally get you good results. For a Diocese, you can use a similar search. Many have information about how to obtain genealogical records.

The Evangelical(Lutheran) church of the U.S. has genealogical assistance. Their website is: [http://web.archive.org/web/20030608115537/http://www.elca.org/os/archives/index.html http://www.elca.org/os/archives/index.html]. Genealogical information is at the top right.

Additionally, the Lutheran World Federation has information and links to their member churches throughout the world. Just click on “member churches” and scroll down to the area in which you are searching: [http://web.archive.org/web/20030608115537/http://www.elca.org/os/archives/index.html http://www.elca.org/os/archives/index.html] .

Jewish records: Jewish Temples did not (and do not) keep records as did the Christian churches. These are family records, and were kept in the family papers. Some of the mohels who performed the bris mila kept records, but they were his personal records and would be with his family documents. Of course, many of these were lost through war and the holocaust, but there are still many ways one can search for their Jewish ancestors. Jewis GenWeb has an excellent guide to searching for family and ancestors: [http://www.jewishgen.org http://www.jewishgen.org ].</text>

Research success is more than knowing where to look. In addition to data about your family, you'll want to have maps, background information about places, material about resources and how to use them. It won't take long for you to gather so much information that you can't keep track of it all. A systematic method for handling data is crucial. A good system has these qualities:
*All materials are stored securely and redundantly
*System is easily to understand, use and maintain
*Provides the ability to transport relevant data to research sites
*Facilitates the future publication / distribution of collected information

Decide how you will store irreplaceable materials (original documents, photos). Always copy or scan originals and store the originals in a secure location (safety deposit box, safe, firesafe box, etc.) Label each newly acquired document with a source description and an ID. You may find it easiest to just number each document sequentially. It becomes almost impossible to know in advance how to organize an ID system that handles all future acquisitions. Refer to this document ID when extracting data from the document into your research system (binders, software, etc.) Most genealogy software allows you to keep a list of sources. Use this ID to file the documents, or enter you own ID as part of each source notation.

Unless you can always bring a notebook computer to every research site, you should use a binder to display the current state of your research for reference. You'll need to know what you already know as you look for new information.

A new option for those that use computers for recording their research, you can use a USB thumb drive/flashdrive/memory stick and load the entire Personal Ancestral File (PAF) program on the drive along with your database and access it at any computer that has USB capabilities.  Other computer programs may be able to do the same thing, but I am not sure.  PAF is a free computer download from www.familysearch.org that has documentaion and multimedia abilities.  The PAF program is a windows based program, but can be run on a MAC if a pc-emulator is used.</text>

When starting genealogy, you should ask yourself what you want to accomplish with your research.

Are you primarily curious about your ancestors and want to see what information is easily available? Do you want to devote your life to uncovering and preserving the past? 

What parts of your family do you wish to research? Some people prefer to focus on a few lines and mostly ignore the lines that marry in. Some people collect every person that can be tied in, including every umpteenth cousin many times removed. What about adoptions? Which line do you research? If you have a surname to research that isn't very common, will you research anyone with that name, whether there is any known connection to you or not (&quot;one-name study&quot;)?

As time goes on, your scope may change. But try to determine at the beginning what you wish to research in order to avoid re-doing previous work.</text>

Working backwards from yourself to your most distant ancestors is a critical method in tracing one's own ancestry. Although it requires discipline, it is extremely important to systematically work backwards in time through the record trail, exhausting all record sources for each person, before working on their parents and grandparents. Without working systematically backwards, it becomes more and more easy to miss a crucial piece of evidence, or to rely on a hypothesis or guess as the foundation for later efforts. Use of a checklist for every person you are researching can make this methodical task easier.

In order to properly work backwards, one should use evidence in one generation regarding the previous generation as your foundation.

Birth, marriage, and death certificates, both civil and ecclesiastic, often name, or even describe the occupation of the bride or groom's father and mother. Many times the certificate's subject's place of birth is given, and sometimes the place of the parents birth as well. For example, old civil birth records (1865-1910) in New York City, found at the Municipal Archives, have a field for Father, Father's Place of Birth, Mother (with maiden name), and Mother's Place of Birth. Similarly, Old ecclesiastic records from the villages around Kaiserslautern in southern Germany often describe the fathers of both groom and bride, the fathers' residences, and occupations. Less often in the oldest records, the mother is named. However, using either record, one would certainly establish a solid footing for looking into the previous generation.

However, a single record, such as a birth, is not enough if further records are available. If one readily find the civil birth record, it can serve as a guide for the location of the same person's ecclesiastic baptismal, christening, or circumcision records, which may confirm, conflict, or expand upon the information in the civil record.

Further research should be conducted upon your subject, however. Marriage and death certificates and records, both civil and church, land records, coroner's reports, voters rolls, census returns, and numerous other pieces can add to your understanding of a person's parents and their history.

In many cases, you will find information about several different generations at the same time.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this section we will look at certain mathematical processes which deal with the fundamental property of '''''recursion''''' at its core.

== What is recursion? ==
Recursion, simply put, is the process of describing an action in terms of itself. This may seem a bit strange to understand, but once it &quot;clicks&quot; it can be an extremely powerful way of expressing certain ideas.

Let's look at some examples to make things clearer.

=== Exponents ===
When we calculate an exponent, say ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, we multiply ''x'' by itself three times. If we have ''x''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, we multiply ''x'' by itself five times.

However, if we want a recursive definition of exponents, we need to define the action of taking exponents in terms of itself. So we note that ''x''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; for example, is the same as ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;times; ''x''. But what is ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;? ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is the same as ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;times; ''x''. We can continue in this fashion up to ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;=1. 
What can we say in general then? Recursively, 
: ''x''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; = ''x'' &amp;times; (''x''&lt;sup&gt;n-1&lt;/sup&gt;)
with the fact that
: ''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;=1

We need the second fact because the definitions fail to make sense if we continue with negative exponents, and we would continue indefinitely!

=== Recursive definitions===
Reducing the problem into same problem by smaller inputs.
for example
             a power n
             2 power 4
    the recursion(smaller inputs) of this function is = 2.2.2.2.1
    for this we declare some recursive definitions 
   a=2
   n=4
   f(0)=1
   f(1)=2
   f(2)=2
   f(3)=2
   f(4)=2
   for this recursion we form a formula f(x)= a.f(n-1)
   by putting these samaller values we get the same answer.

== Recurrence relations ==
In mathematics, we can create recursive ''functions'', which depend on its previous values to create new ones. We often call these ''recurrence relations''.

For example, we can have the function :''f''(''x'')=2''f''(''x''-1), with ''f''(1)=1
If we calculate some of ''f''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s values, we get
:1, 2, 4, 8, 16, ...

However, this sequence of numbers ''should'' look familiar to you! These values are the same as the function 2&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;, with x = 0, 1, and so on.

What we have done is found a ''non-recursive'' function with the same values as the ''recursive'' function. We call this ''solving'' the recurrence relation.

=== Linear recurrence relations ===
We will look especially at a certain kind of recurrence relation, known as ''linear''.

Here is an example of a linear recurrence relation:
: ''f''(''x'')=3''f''(''x''-1)+12''f''(''x''-2), with f(0)=1 and f(1)=1

Instead of writing ''f''(''x''), we often use the notation ''a''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; to represent ''a''(''n''), but these notations are completely interchangeable. 

Note that a linear recurrence relation should always have stopping cases, otherwise we would not be able to calculate ''f''(2), for example, since what would ''f''(1) be if we did not define it? These stopping cases when we talk about linear recurrence relations are known as ''initial conditions''.

In general, a linear recurrence relation is in the form
: ''a''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;=''A''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''A''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-2&lt;/sub&gt;  + ... +  ''A''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-j&lt;/sub&gt;
: with ''f''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)=''u''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''f''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)=''u''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''f''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;)=''u''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; as initial conditions.
The number ''j'' is important, and it is known as the ''order'' of the linear recurrence relation. Note we always need at least ''j'' initial conditions for the recurrence relation to make sense.

Recall in the previous section we saw that we can find a nonrecursive function (a ''solution'') that will take on the same values as the recurrence relation itself. Let's see how we can solve some linear recurrence relations - we can do so in a very systematic way, but we need to establish a few theorems first.

==== Solving linear recurrence relations ====
===== Sum of solutions =====
This theorem says that:
: If ''f''(''n'') and ''g''(''n'') are both solutions to a linear recurrence relation ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;=''Aa''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sub&gt;+''Ba''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-2&lt;/sub&gt;, their sum is a solution also.

This is true, since if we rearrange the recurrence to have ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-''Aa''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sub&gt;-''Ba''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-2&lt;/sub&gt;=0
And we know  that ''f''(''n'') and ''g''(''n'') are solutions, so we have, on substituting into the recurrence
: ''f''(''n'')-''Af''(''n''-1)-''Bf''(n-2)=0
: ''g''(''n'')-''Ag''(''n''-1)-''Bg''(n-2)=0

If we substitute the sum ''f''(''n'')+''g''(''n'') into the recurrence, we obtain
: (''f''(''n'')+''g''(''n''))-''A''(''f''(''n''-1)+''g''(''n''-1))-''B''((''f''(''n''-2)+''g''(''n''-2))=0

On expanding out, we have
:''f''(''n'')-''Af''(''n''-1)-''Bf''(n-2)+''g''(''n'')-''Ag''(''n''-1)-''Bg''(n-2)
But using the two facts we established first, this is the same as
:0+0=0

So ''f''(''n'')+''g''(''n'') is indeed a solution to the recurrence.

=====General solution=====
The next theorem states that:
: Say we have a second-order linear recurrence relation, ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;-''Aa''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-1&lt;/sub&gt;-''Ba''&lt;sub&gt;''n''-2&lt;/sub&gt;=0, with supplied initial conditions. 
&lt;BR&gt;Then &amp;alpha;''r''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; is a solution to the recurrence, where ''r'' is a solution of the quadratic equation
: ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-A''x''-B=0
which we call the ''characteristic equation''.
&lt;br&gt;We guess (it doesn't matter why, accept it for now) that &amp;alpha;''r''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; may be a solution. We can prove that this  is a solution IF (and only if) it solves the characteristic equation ;&lt;br&gt;

We substitute &amp;alpha;''r''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; (r not zero) into the recurrence to get
:&amp;alpha;''r''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;-''A''&amp;alpha;''r''&lt;sup&gt;n-1&lt;/sup&gt;-''B''&amp;alpha;''r''&lt;sup&gt;n-2&lt;/sup&gt;=0
then factor out by &amp;alpha;''r''&lt;sup&gt;n-2&lt;/sup&gt;, the term farthest on the right
:&amp;alpha;''r''&lt;sup&gt;n-2&lt;/sup&gt;(''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-''Ar''-''B'')=0
and we know that ''r'' isn't zero, so ''r''&lt;sup&gt;n-2&lt;/sup&gt; can never be zero. So ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-''Ar''-B must be zero, and so &amp;alpha;''r''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;, with ''r'' a solution of ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-''Ar''-''B''=0, will indeed be a solution of the linear recurrence. Please note that we can easily generalize this fact to higher order linear recurrence relations.

&lt;!-- this next bit could be removed?? does it help anyone? --&gt;
&lt;br&gt;&lt;B&gt; Where did this come from? Why does it work (beyond a rote proof)?  Here's a more intuitive (but less mathematically rigorous) explanation. &lt;/B&gt; &lt;br&gt;  Solving the ''characteristic equation'' finds a function that satisfies the linear recurrence relation, and conveniently doesn't require the summation of all n terms to find the ''n''th one.&lt;br&gt;
We want :  a function F(n) such that F(n) =  A * F(n-1) + B * F(n-2) &lt;br&gt;
We solve :  x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = A* x  + B, and call the solution(s) ''r''.  There can be more than one value of r, like in the example below! &lt;br&gt;
We get :  a function F(n)  = r&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;  that satisfies F(n) = A * F(n-1) + B * F(n-2)&lt;br&gt;
Let's check: Does  r&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; = A*r&lt;sup&gt;n-1&lt;/sup&gt; + B*r&lt;sup&gt;n-2&lt;/sup&gt; ? Divide both sides by r&lt;sup&gt;n-2&lt;/sup&gt; and you get r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = A*r + B, which must be true because r is a solution to x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = A* x  + B &lt;br&gt; 
&lt;!-- this is bad. substituting works much better. Is not possible to prove it this way --&gt;
&lt;br&gt; &lt;B&gt;Why does ''a''*r&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; also satisfy the recurrence relation? &lt;/B&gt; If F(n)is a solution to the recurrence relation, so is F(n)+ F(n), based on the &quot;Sum of Solutions&quot; theorem above.  One can then take that sum, 2*F(n), and add another F(n) to get 3*F(n), and it will still satisfy the recurrence (and so on...).  Thus any whole number multiple of F(n), such as ''a''*F(n) will satisfy the recurrence relation (''a'' can also be any fraction and probably any real number at all, but I'm too lazy to adapt the current explanation).  Because r&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; satisfies the recurrence, so does ''a''*r&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;.  

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Because we have a second order recurrence, the general solution is the sum of two solutions, corresponding to the two roots of the characteristic equation. Say these are r and s. The the general solution is  C(r&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;)+D(s&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;) where C,D are some constants. We find them using the two (there must be two so that we can find C and D) starting values of the relation. Substituting these into the general solution will give two equtions which we can (hopefully) solve. 
&lt;!-- 
for complex nums: CE has roots r = s \pm it = re^i\theta/GS is A(re^i\th)+B(re^-i\th), A, B in C|. if A=B*, r^n(a cos n\th+B sin n\th), a, b in |R
--&gt;

====Example====
Let's work through an example to see how we can use the above theorems to solve linear recurrence relations. Examine the function ''a''(''n'') given here
: ''a''(''n'')=''a''(''n''-1)+2''a''(''n''-2)
The characteristic equation of this recurrence relation is
: ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-''r''-2 = 0  from above, as A=1 and B=2&lt;br&gt;
i.e. (''r''-2)(''r''+1)=0 which has roots 2, -1.

So the general solution is C(2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;)+D(-1)&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;.


To find C and D for this specific case, we need two starting values, let's say ''a''(''1'') = 0 and ''a''(''2'') = 2.  These give a system of two equations&lt;br&gt; 0 = C(2&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;)+D(-1)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;br&gt; 2 = C(2&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)+D(-1)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;br&gt;  Solving these two equations yields: C = 1/3 , D = 2/3, so the solution is 1/3*(2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;)+2/3*(-1)&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;.
