This book aims to be a comprehensive source for any developer who is interested in programming for the Windows platform. It starts at the lowest level, with the Win32 API (C and VB Classic) and then goes over to [[/Microsoft Foundation Classes/|MFC]] (C++). Beyond these basic sections, it will cover COM, and the creation of ActiveX modules from a variety of languages. Next, it delves into the Windows DDK, and talk about programming device drivers for Windows platform. Finally, it moves on to the highest-level programming tasks, including shell extensions, shell scripting, and finally ASP and WSH.

Other topics that will be discussed here are: Writing screen-savers, creating HTML help modules, and compiling DLL files. 

This book will focus on topics that are specific to Windows, and avoids general programming topics. For related material the reader is encouraged to look into Wikibooks other works, they will cover general programming, ASM, C, C++, Visual Basic and Visual Basic.NET and other languages and concepts in greater detail. Appropriate links to these books are provided.

The reader is assumed to have a previous knowledge of the programming languages involved. Specifically, prior knowledge in C, C++, and Visual Basic is required for certain sections of this book.

      <comment>/* Frequently Asked Questions about Vectors */ added TOC to  facilitate students seeking info</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Vectors''' are quantities that are characterized by having both a numerical '''quantity''' (called the &quot;magnitude&quot; and denoted as |''v''|) and a '''direction'''. Velocity is an example of a vector; it describes the time rated change in position with a numerical quantity (meters per second) as well as indicating the direction of movement.

The definition of a vector is any quantity that adds according to the parallelogram law (there are some physical quantities that have magnitude and direction that are not vectors).

'''Scalars''' are quantities in physics that have '''no direction'''. Mass is a scalar; it can describe the quantity of matter with units (kilograms) but does not describe any direction.

==Multiplying vectors and scalars==
*A '''scalar''' times a '''scalar''' gives a '''scalar''' result. 
*A '''vector''' scalar-multiplied by a '''vector''' gives a '''scalar''' result (called the dot-product).
*A '''vector''' cross-multiplied by a '''vector''' gives a '''vector''' result (called the cross-product).
*A '''vector''' times a '''scalar''' gives a '''vector''' result.

==Frequently Asked Questions about Vectors==
=====When are scalar and vector compositions essentially the same?=====
'''Answer:''' when multiple vectors are in same direction then we can just add the magnitudes.so, the scalar and vector composition will be same as we do not add the directions. 
=====What is a &quot;dot-product&quot;? (work when force not parallel to displacement)=====
[[Image:Man_walking_up_a_hill.png|thumb|A Man walking up a hill]] 
'''Answer:''' Let's take gravity as our force.  If you jump out of an airplane and fall you will pick up speed. (for simplicity's sake, let's ignore air drag). To work out the kinetic energy at any point you simply multiply the ''value'' of the force caused by gravity by the ''distance'' moved in the direction of the force. For example, a 180 N boy falling a distance of 10 m will have 1800 J of extra kinetic energy. We say that the man has had 1800 J of work done on him by the force of gravity. 


Notice that energy is ''not'' a vector. It has a value but no direction. Gravity and displacement are vectors. They have a value plus a direction. (In this case, their directions are down and down respectively) The reason we can get a scalar energy from vectors gravity and displacement is because, in this case, they happen to point in the same direction. Gravity acts downwards and displacement is also downwards.

When two vectors point in the same direction, you can get the scalar product by just multiplying the ''value'' of the two vectors together and ignoring the direction.

But what happens if they don't point in the same direction?


Consider a man walking up a hill. Obviously it takes energy to do this because you are going against the force of gravity. The steeper the hill, the more energy it takes every step to climb it. This is something we all know unless we live on a salt lake.

In a situation like this we can still work out the work done. In the diagram, the green lines represent the displacement. To find out how much work ''against'' gravity the man does, we work out the ''projection'' of the displacement along the line of action of the force of gravity. In this case it's just the y component of the man's displacement. This is where the cos &amp;theta; comes in. &amp;theta; is merely the angle between the velocity vector and the force vector.

If the two forces do not point in the same direction, you can still get the scalar product by multiplying the projection of one force in the direction of the other force.  Thus:
{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}\equiv \|\vec{a}\|\ \|\vec{b}\|\ \cos\theta&lt;/math&gt;}}
There is another method of defining the dot product which relies on components.
{|align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; style=&quot;border: solid 3px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em&quot;
|align=&quot;center&quot;|&lt;math&gt;\vec{a}\cdot\vec{b}\equiv a_xb_x+a_yb_y+a_zb_z&lt;/math&gt;
|}

=====What is a &quot;cross-product&quot;? (Force on a charged particle in a magnetic field)=====

'''Answer:''' Suppose there is a charged particle moving in a constant magnetic field. According to the laws of electromagnetism, the particle is acted upon by a force called the Lorentz force.  If this particle is moving from left to right at 30 m/s and the field is 30 Tesla pointing straight down perpendicular to the particle, the particle will actually curve in a circle spiraling out of the plane of the two with an acceleration of its charge in coulombs times 900 newtons per coulomb!  This is because the calculation of the Lorentz force involves a cross-product.when cross product can replace the sin0 can take place during multiplication.
A cross product can be calculated simply using the angle between the two vectors and your right hand.  If the forces point parallel or 180&amp;deg; from each other, it's simple: the cross-product does not exist.  If they are exactly perpendicular, the cross-product has a magnitude of the product of the two magnitudes.  For all others in between however, the following formula is used:

{|align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; style=&quot;border: solid 3px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em&quot;
|align=&quot;center&quot;|&lt;math&gt;\left\|\vec{a}\times\vec{b}\right\| = \left\|\vec{a}\right\|\ \left\|\vec{b}\right\|\sin\theta&lt;/math&gt;
|}


[[File:Right_hand_rule_cross_product.svg|thumb|The right-hand rule: point your index finger along the first vector and your middle finger across the second; your thumb will point in the direction of the resulting vector]]
But if the result is a vector, then what is the direction? That too is fairly simple, utilizing a method called the &quot;right-hand rule&quot;.

The right-hand rule works as follows:  Place your right-hand flat along the first of the two vectors with the palm facing the second vector and your thumb sticking out perpendicular to your hand.  Then proceed to curl your hand towards the second vector.  The direction that your thumb points is the direction that cross-product vector points!  Though this definition is easy to explain visually it is slightly more complicated to calculate than the dot product.
{|align=&quot;center&quot; width=&quot;100%&quot; style=&quot;border: solid 3px #D6D6FF; padding: 1em&quot;
|align=&quot;center&quot;|&lt;math&gt;(a_x,\ a_y,\ a_z)\times(b_x,\ b_y,\ b_z) =(a_yb_z-a_zb_y\ ,a_xb_z-a_zb_x\ ,a_xb_y-a_yb_x)&lt;/math&gt;
|}

=====How do you draw vectors (in or out of the plane of the page)board)=====
[[Image:Vector addition subtraction.svg|thumb|How to draw vectors in the plane of the paper]]
[[Image:Notation for vectors in or out of a plane.svg|thumb|Standard symbols of a vector going into or out of a page]]
'''Answer:''' Vectors in the plane of the page are drawn as arrows on the page.  A vector that goes into the plane of the screen is typically drawn as circles with an inscribed X.  A vector that comes out of the plane of the screen is typically drawn as circles with dots at their centers. The X is meant to represent the fletching on the back of an arrow or dart while the dot is meant to represent the tip of the arrow.

==Indonesian and Malay==
Maybe this book should be presented as Indonesian and Malay?  If you don't have time to add notes for where Malay is different, somebody else might do it.

:Sure thing. --[[User:Robbyjo|Roby Joehanes]] 21:55, 22 Nov 2003 (UTC)

I disagree.  For one, I don't know where they differ, but also, they are different languages.  Sure, there's a high degree of mutual understanding between speakers of the language, but they should be different books.

If the people writing the Malay one want to copy and paste this one with minor alterations then they can feel free, but they shouldn't be merged. [[User:Mr john|Mr john]] 14:21, 2 April 2006 (UTC)

:I also disagree - they are significantly different. I think of it as being like someone from London and someone from Scotland speaking in a Scots-influenced English. (I'm not trying to say which is which - just that there's differences in accent and vocab). Note that Indonesian has a lot of Dutch words that don't occur in Malay, and Malay has more English influence. See the Wikipedia article [[w:Differences between Malay and Indonesian|Differences between Malay and Indonesian]] (and that could be linked from this Wikibook, rather than duplicating the work). 

:I like the idea, though, of having notes on where [[Malay]] differs, in the text or in a section at the end of the page; also of this book copying and modifying pages to and from Malay, where appropriate. Perhaps there could be a template used temporarily at the top of a Malay page, saying something like &quot;This page has been copied from the Indonesian Wikibook, and may need further changes to reflect Malay usage.&quot; Or the reverse if copied from the Malay to the Indonesian Wikibook. --[[User:Singkong2005|Singkong2005]] 01:30, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

== How can I say it in Indonesian language? ==

How can I say &quot; How was the school? &quot; in Indonesian language?

thank you,

jameelhy@yahoo.com

It's probably too late and I can't tell when you made the edit because you didn't sign your post, but it's ''bagaimana sekolahnya?'' although, due to Indonesian's lack of tenses this could mean &quot;how is the school?&quot; as well. [[User:Mr john|Mr john]] 14:21, 2 April 2006 (UTC)

==This is a good book==
Thank you for this nice project. -- 22:40, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

Thank you

== Just a thought ==
I feel that the &quot;ahli&quot; section of this page concentrate too much on &quot;bahasa gaul&quot; instead of the formal and more advanced &quot;Bahasa Indonesia.&quot; It should include a more complex vocabulary than those in the &quot;beginner section&quot;
Thanks

I agree, but I would like to think that my particular area of expertise is &quot;bahasa gaul&quot; so that's what I wrote lessons on.  It's not concentrated on &quot;bahasa gaul&quot; for any reason other than no one else has written any lessons for it yet.  It's a work in progress.  If you have specific requests for lessons then post them here and I'll see what I can do.
Thanks,

I've been doing a web search for an advanced vocabulary list with no luck. Does anyone know a good link? Such a link would also be useful as an &quot;external link&quot; or &quot;additional resource&quot; for an &quot;advanced&quot; page in this Wikibook.

Memorising lists of words suits my style of learning (I use mnemonics - but of course I also need to back it up with practice). 

I'm at the stage where I can read a newspaper or book without too much difficulty, but there's still a few words per article or page that I don't understand. Making my own lists as I go works okay, but a ready made vocab list would be more efficient. Memorising words from a dictionary is probably going to give me a lot of rarely used words (and all of them starting with &quot;A&quot;...!)

For the moment though, I do appreciate the pages on informal use from Mr John. --[[User:Singkong2005|Singkong2005]] 01:55, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

:I found a site with some tips on mnemonics - but only two, and at a very basic level. [http://wwwfp.education.tas.gov.au/indonesianonline/TR/TRs_Penyelematan_binatang/Making%20connections.html Teacher Resource - Penyelamatan binatang]
The tips, on one of the linked PDFs, are:
:* &lt;tt&gt;Many students mix up the numbers 4 and 6 (empat and enam) - but maybe remembering that you 'pat' a dog which has four legs will help. &lt;/tt&gt;
:* &lt;tt&gt;How can you remember the meanings of kanan and kiri (right and left)? Perhaps simply that kanan and right both have five letters; and kiri and left both have four.&lt;/tt&gt;
:These could be rewritten and included in a mnemonics page, e.g. [[Indonesian/Mnemonics]] - I don't know a good translation for mnemonics, unless we use ''cara penghafalan'' or ''cara menghafalkan kata''. --[[User:Singkong2005|Singkong2005]] 04:20, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

::I'm starting a page here: [[Indonesian/Adding vocabulary with word association]] - it probably needs a better name, and it's very basic, but it's a start.  --[[User:Singkong2005|Singkong2005]] 05:28, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

Thanks for the compliments, I'm glad the articles are of interest.  If you have any other areas of slang you'd like articles on, let me know. On the subject of vocab lists, I'm not sure how useful they are without the context of an article...  If you find an online article that you think is a good example (that we're allowed to use) I'd be happy to list the difficult and interesting words, provide some commentary on the article and maybe have some comprehension questions at the end...  Would that be more useful than just having parallel translations?[[User:Mr john|Mr john]] 08:17, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

== Can we use other free (as in beer) sites as part of a curriculum? ==
A page on the above Tasmanian Department of Education site, [http://wwwfp.education.tas.gov.au/indonesianonline/learningobjects.htm Learning Objects], has some free, useful resources for beginners &amp; high school students. (Graphics based, with very slow, clear pronunciation... rather formal (''Kalau bepergian''?? I never heard the word ''bepergian'' in 2 years in Indo - only ''pergi''), but that's standard for Indonesian lessons in Australia, I find.) 

Resources like these which are free (as in beer) but not open-source are good for giving inspiration - no controversy, I think. I think they are also good for linking from the modules, and even using as part of the curriculum - at least until we have developed better resources here. This would consist of linking from a Wikibooks page, not replicating or infringeing copyright in any way.

Would this conflict with Wikibooks policies? --[[User:Singkong2005|Singkong2005]] 04:20, 3 August 2006 (UTC)

:I asked this at the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge#Can we use other free (as in beer) sites as part of a curriculum?|the Staff lounge]] and it seems that Wikiversity encourages this practice, and there doesn't seem to be a policy against it in Wikibooks (perhaps making it clear that that we're not endorsing the external link). --[[User:Singkong2005|Singkong2005]] 05:03, 11 August 2006 (UTC)

== Audiobook (Pimsleur?) ==

This wikibook is a great effort to provide instructional tools in learning Bahasa Indonesia. It would be great if there is an accompanying audio instruction.

Recently I've been using Pimsleur methods to learn spanish, and I find it very good. If anyone is an expert in liguistic and language instructional methods, and is interested in doing Pimsleur audio on Indonesian language, I'd be delighted to help to read out the phrases, since I'm an indonesian native speaker. However, I can't be the one who organize and edit the audio because I don't have experience in language teaching methods. Besides, I think &quot;pimsleur method&quot; itself is not copyrighted (am I correct) although there are pimsleur branded instructional recordings released by Simon and Schuster. Hence I'd think it's possible to replicate the method and record our own instructional recordings in order to make language instruction more accessible (currently the Simon and Schuster Pimsleur is really expensive!).

== Childrens' songs == 

I like this section.  I'm glad to see the wikibook has progressed since I last looked at it.  I'll add a few songs soon.  As far as I know most childrens' songs are open source.  It could be interesting to add some popular songs and comment on the lyrics there, but I'm not sure if we'd be violating copyright...  Does anyone want to weigh in on this?

Incidentally, I have no idea how to add audio to these pages...  If someone does work out how to do it I could record some of the childrens' songs on guitar and post them...  I'd rather not sing them though if someone wants to go a wikollaboration. [[User:Mr john|Mr john]] 08:17, 10 January 2007 (UTC)

:There are some good [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:WikiProject_Spoken_Wikipedia/Recording_guidelines recording guidelines] for the Spoken Wikipedia that you can look at. Then just upload to [[commons:Main Page|Wikimedia Commons]] or Wikibooks using the &quot;Upload file&quot; link in the Toolbox on the sidebar (must be logged in). Have a look at [[Chinese/Lesson_1]] to see how I linked to audio from within the lessons. I wouldn't worry of you can only provide the guitar. Using Audacity it's easy to splice audio together, so someone could add their singing voice later on. -&amp;nbsp;[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 10:19, 10 January 2007 (UTC)</text>

Work is equal to the integral of '''force''' times '''velocity''' times '''displacement''' times '''time.'''

An integral, if the force isn't constant.

      <text xml:space="preserve">''When work is applied to an object or a system it adds or removes kinetic energy to or from that object or system. More precisely, a net force in one direction, when applied to an object moving opposite or in the same direction as the force, kinetic energy will be added or removed to or from that object. (Someone please explain this to me though because energy is not a vector.) Note that work and energy are measured in the same unit, the Joule (J).''
:That's why you have to use a scaler product! Work is the scaler product of force and displacement. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 09:37, 10 Nov 2003 (UTC)

Please, what is a scalar product ? If I dont know this, many other people wont know this, and we could use a good, concise definition here on the site. Thanks, --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

OK I'll have a go. Let's take gravity as our force.  If you jump out of an aeroplane and fall you will pick up speed. (for simplicity sake let's ignore air drag). To work out the kinetic energy at any point you just multiply the  ''value'' of the force of gravity, by the ''distance'' moved. So for example a 100kg man falling a distance of 10m will have 1000kJ extra kinetic energy. We say that the man has had 1000kJ of work done on him by the force of gravity. 

Notice that energy is ''not'' a vector, it has a value but no direction. Gravity and dispacement are vectors. They have a value plus a direction.(In this case their directions are down and down respectively) The reason we can get a scalar energy from vectors gravity and dispacement is because in this case they happen to point in the same direction. Gravity acts downwards and displacement is also downwards. 

When two vectors point in the same direction, you can get the scalar product by just multiplying the ''value'' of the two vectors together and ignoring the direction.


What happens if they don't point in the same direction?
[[Image:Man_walking_up_a_hill.png]] 


Consider a man walking up a hill. Obvoiusly it takes energy to do this because you are going against the force of gravity. The steeper the hill the more energy it takes every step, this is something we all know unless we live on a salt lake.

In a situation like this we can still work out the work done. In the diagram the green lines represents the displacement. To fond out how much work ''against'' gravity the man does we work out the ''projection'' of the displacement along the line of action of the force of gravity. In this case it's just the y component of the man's displacement. This is where the cos&amp;theta; comes in. 

If the two forces do not point in the same direction, you can still get the scaler product by multiplying the projection of one force in the direction of the other force. '''A'''('''B'''cos&amp;theta;)

I hopes this makes sense. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 17:16, 10 Nov 2003 (UTC)

But don't these situations only apply in the specific instances that you have described? Surely, the relationship might not always be cos theta, rather sin theta. Sorry if I'm mistaken. Also, the formula describing work done = deltaKE + deltaPE is also a specific instance, where there are no losses, for example air resisitance or friction. Shouldn't this be mentioned? If you're going into the preciseness of vectors and scalars or whatever, shouldn't this be mentioned? Finally, I'd just like to say it's a great job you're doing here!

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''linear transformation''' is an important concept in mathematics because many real world phenomena can be approximated by linear models. 

Unlike a linear function, a linear transformation works on vectors as well as numbers.

== Motivations and definitions ==
Say we have the vector &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;, and we rotate it through 90 degrees, to obtain the vector &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;. 

Another example instead of rotating a vector, we stretch it, so a vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; becomes &lt;math&gt;2\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt;, for example. &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; becomes &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 4 \\ 6 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Or, if we look at the ''projection'' of one vector onto the ''x'' axis - extracting its ''x'' component - , e.g. from
&lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 3 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; we get &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

These examples are all an example of a ''mapping'' between two vectors, and are all linear transformations. If the rule transforming the matrix is called &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;, we often write &lt;math&gt;T\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; for the mapping of the vector &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; by the rule &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is often called the transformation.

Note we do not always write brackets like when we write functions. However we ''should'' write brackets, especially when we want to express the mapping of the sum or the product or the combination of many vectors.

== Definitions ==
===Linear Operators===

Suppose one has a field K, and let x be an element of that field. Let O be a function taking values from K where O(x) is an element of a field J. Define O to be a linear form if and only if:
# O(x+y)=O(x)+O(y)
# O(&amp;lambda;x)=&amp;lambda;O(x)

===Linear Forms===
Suppose one has a vector space V, and let x be an element of that vector space. Let F be a function taking values from V where F(x) is an element of a field K. Define F to be a linear form if and only if:
# F(x+y)=F(x)+F(y)
# F(&amp;lambda;x)=&amp;lambda;F(x)

===Linear Transformation===
This time, instead of a field, let us consider functions from one vector space into another vector space. Let T be a function taking values from one vector space V where L(V) are elements of another vector space. Define L to be a linear transformation when it:
# ''preserves scalar multiplication'': T(&amp;lambda;'''x''') = &amp;lambda;T'''x'''
# ''preserves addition'': T('''x'''+'''y''') = T'''x''' + T'''y'''

Note that not all transformations are linear. Many simple transformations that are in the real world are also non-linear. Their study is more difficult, and will not be done here. For example, the transformation ''S'' (whose input and output are both vectors in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) defined by

&lt;math&gt;S\mathbf{x} = S\begin{pmatrix} x \\
                                     y  \end{pmatrix}= \begin{pmatrix}  xy\\
                                                                        \cos(y)\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

We can learn about nonlinear transformations by studying easier, linear ones. 

We often ''describe'' a transformation T in the following way
:&lt;math&gt;T : V \rightarrow W&lt;/math&gt;

This means that T, whatever transformation it may be, maps vectors in the vector space V to a vector in the vector space W.

The actual transformation ''could'' be written, for instance, as
:&lt;math&gt;T\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} x + y \\ x - y \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

== Examples and proofs ==
Here are some examples of some linear transformations. At the same time, let's look at how we can prove that a transformation we may find is linear or not.

=== Projection ===
Let us take the projection of vectors in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to vectors on the ''x''-axis. Let's call this transformation T.

We know that T maps vectors from '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, so we can say 
: &lt;math&gt;T: \mathbb{R}^2 \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^2&lt;/math&gt;

and we can then write the transformation itself as
: &lt;math&gt;T\begin{pmatrix} x_0 \\ x_1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} x_0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Clearly this is linear. (''Can you see why, without looking below?'')

Let's go through a proof that the conditions in the definitions are established.

==== Scalar multiplication is preserved ====
We wish to show that for all vectors '''v''' and all scalars &amp;lambda;, T(&amp;lambda;'''v''')=&amp;lambda;T('''v''').

Let 
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}=\begin{pmatrix} v_0 \\ v_1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;. 
Then 
:&lt;math&gt;\lambda\mathbf{v}=\begin{pmatrix} \lambda v_0 \\ \lambda v_1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
Now
:&lt;math&gt; T(\lambda\mathbf{v}) = T\begin{pmatrix} \lambda v_0 \\ \lambda v_1\end{pmatrix} = &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix} \lambda v_0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;
If we work out &amp;lambda;T('''v''') and find it is the same vector, we have proved our result. 
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda T\mathbf{v}= \lambda \begin{pmatrix} v_0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}=&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{pmatrix} \lambda v_0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;
This is the same vector as above, so under the transformation T, ''scalar multiplication is preserved''.

==== Addition is preserved ====
We wish to show for all vectors '''x''' and '''y''', T('''x'''+'''y''')=T'''x'''+T'''y'''.

Let 
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x}=\begin{pmatrix} x_0 \\ x_1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;. 
and
: &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{y}=\begin{pmatrix} y_0 \\ y_1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;. 
Now
: &lt;math&gt;T(\mathbf{x}+\mathbf{y})=T\left(\begin{pmatrix} x_0 \\ x_1 \end{pmatrix}+\begin{pmatrix} y_0 \\ y_1 \end{pmatrix}\right)=&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;T\begin{pmatrix} x_0 + y_0 \\ x_1 + y_1 \end{pmatrix} =&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} x_0 + y_0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
Now if we can show T'''x'''+T'''y''' is this vector above, we have proved this result.
Proceed, then,
:&lt;math&gt;T\begin{pmatrix} x_0 \\ x_1 \end{pmatrix} + T\begin{pmatrix} y_0 \\ y_1 \end{pmatrix}=\begin{pmatrix} x_0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} + \begin{pmatrix} y_0 \\0 \end{pmatrix}=&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{pmatrix} x_0 + y_0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
So we have that the transformation T ''preserves addition''.

==== Zero vector is preserved ====
Clearly we have 
: &lt;math&gt;T\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ 0 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

==== Conclusion ====
We have shown T preserves addition, scalar multiplication and the zero vector. So T must be linear.

== Disproof of linearity ==
When we want to ''disprove'' linearity - that is, to ''prove'' that a transformation is ''not'' linear, we need only find one counter-example.

If we can find just one case in which the transformation does not preserve addition, scalar multiplication, or the zero vector, we can conclude that the transformation is not linear.

For example, consider the transformation 
: &lt;math&gt; T\begin{pmatrix} x \\ y\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix}  x^3 \\ y^2\end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

We suspect it is not linear. To prove it is not linear, take the vector
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{v} = \begin{pmatrix} 2 \\ 2 \end{pmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;
then
: &lt;math&gt; T(2\mathbf{v}) = \begin{pmatrix} 64 \\ 16 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
but
: &lt;math&gt; 2T(\mathbf{v}) = \begin{pmatrix} 16 \\ 8 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

so we can immediately say T is not linear because it doesn't preserve scalar multiplication.

=== Problem set ===
Given the above, determine whether the following transformations are in fact linear or not. Write down each transformation in the form T:V -&gt; W, and identify V and W. (Answers follow to even-numbered questions):
# &lt;math&gt;T\begin{pmatrix} v_0 \\ v_1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} v_0^2 + v_1 \\ v_1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;T\begin{pmatrix} v_0 \\ v_1 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 1 \\ v_0 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;T\begin{pmatrix} v_0 \\ v_1 \end{pmatrix} = \mathbf{0}&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;T\begin{pmatrix} v_0 \\ v_1 \\ v_2 \end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} v_0 - v_2 \\ v_1 \end{pmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

==== Answers ====
: 2. No. A check whether the zero vector is preserved readily confirms this fact. T : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; -&gt; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;
: 4. Yes. T : '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; -&gt; '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Images and kernels ==
We have some fundamental concepts underlying linear transformations, such as the ''kernel'' and the ''image'' of a linear transformation, which are analogous to the ''zeros'' and ''range'' of a function.

=== Kernel ===
The ''kernel'' of a linear transformation T: V -&gt; W is the set of all vectors in V which are mapped to the zero vector in W, ie., 
: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{ker}\ T = \{v \in V\ |\ T\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0}\}&lt;/math&gt;

Coincidentally because of the matr to the matrix equation A'''x'''='''0'''.

The kernel of a transform T: V-&gt;W is always a subspace of V. The dimension of a transform or a matrix is called the ''nullity''..

=== Image ===
The ''image'' of a linear transformation T:V-&gt;W is the set of all vectors in W which were mapped from vectors in V. For example with the trivial mapping T:V-&gt;W such that T'''x'''='''0''', the image would be '''0'''. (''What would the kernel be?'').

More formally, we say that the image of a transformation T:V-&gt;W is the set
: &lt;math&gt; \mathrm{im}\ T = \{w \in W\ |\ w=T\mathbf{v}\ \mathrm{and}\ \mathbf{v}\in V\}&lt;/math&gt;

== Isomorphism ==

A linear transformation T:V -&gt; W is an isomorphic transformation if it is:
* one-to-one and onto.
* kernel(T) = {0} and the range(T) = W.
* an inverse of T exists.
* dim(V) = dim(W).

Mostly interested in seeing language books grow, and would be very happy to dig in to others to brush up on math, sciences, etc.  

I am currently working on 

* a book on [[Understanding darcs]].  
* a book on [[Haskell]].
* a book on [[Computer programming/Functional programming]].  
* some [[:fr:Langue des signes française|French Sign Language]] resources

== Test stuff ==
* waiting on http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org/show_bug.cgi?id=10967
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
-- foo
let x = foo
&lt;/source&gt;

Hi Kowey! I welcomed you to wikipedia, now I'm welcomminmg you to wikibooks :-)

Things work much the same here as in wikipedia, except it's a much smaller community here. We've only been going a little while, but we've done a lot already. I don't think we have amunal of sytle yet, but take a look at some of the books already started to get ideas about layout etc. 

Check out [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]] and post any queries you have. You'll find things slower and friendlier here. I hope you like it and decide to stay. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 13:48, 10 Nov 2003 (UTC)

: thanks for the second welcome, Theresa. [[User:152.81.15.98|152.81.15.98]] 11:27, 11 Nov 2003 (UTC)

:Can you not log in either ? [[User:217.204.254.211|217.204.254.211]] 12:43, 11 Nov 2003 (UTC) -Theresa

:I can log in, but staying logged in when i click on &quot;new messages&quot; is a whole different story [[User:152.81.15.98|152.81.15.98]] 14:19, 11 Nov 2003 (UTC) (eric aka kowey)

Re NPOV - I happen to agree with you (For example, in the [[Programming:C]] book, it's important to point out bad techniques in programming in C that lead to awful code). But out-and-out plugging one product over another is hardly in the general &quot;spirit&quot; of NPOV - plugging a product isn't in the spirit of teaching, it's in the spirit of promotion...

But I think perhaps some changes need to be made to [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view]], but exactly ''what'' to change will be a sticky area. Strict NPOV works well, but once you relax the restriction then you get a lot of grey area. What if someone is coming to write about the history of Palestine for example, and they add a lot of anti-Israeli sentiment, or vice versa...Is that in the spirit of teaching the correct things? Does that adhere to the &quot;spirit&quot; of NPOV? Very sticky...

Anyway, thanks for your response :) [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 23:18, 19 Dec 2003 (UTC)

[[Computer programming/Types]] got additions by [[User:AlMac|AlMac]] effectively doubling the size of the article since prior folks like you last worked on it.  I just thought you might like to see what I did to it. [[User:AlMac|AlMac]] 23:49, 17 July 2005 (UTC)

==Understanding darcs==
I've just read wikibook ''Understanding darcs'' and it really helped me understand the concepts behind that software.
Thanx for that piece of work.

arno.

:Thanks for the feedback! It feels good to hear that this actually helps people -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 09:07, 9 April 2006 (UTC)

== 'Type basics' feedback ==
Re our discussion today, I added some notes and a log to the [[Talk:Haskell/Type basics]] page. Cheers, [[User:DavidHouse|DavidHouse]] 19:50, 24 July 2006 (UTC)

== VFD pages ==

Regarding the pages that you nominated for deletion at [[WB:VFD]], I am going to delete those pages soon, as per your request. Since these pages constitute your own work, perhaps you would like to keep a copy before it disappears? Since these pages dont represent a violation of policy, I am in no hurry to delete them, and I am inclined to offer you the chance to save this material if needed. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 01:30, 6 October 2006 (UTC)

==Haskell book==

I noticed a lot of the new pages were commented as &quot;tex extraction/import&quot;... does the licence from wherever they're coming from require noting the source? (It's a good idea to do so anyway, but not required under certain licenses). I just want to make sure it's all in good form :-). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 18:53, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

:Hello! Thanks for your concern.  I spoke with the author personally at a conference, and he gave me his permission to import his book into wikibooks (knowing that implicitly, this would pass it under the GFDL).  After a few friendly reminders, he sent me the TeX sources, which have never before been released.  Otherwise, the book has been available as PDF under the terms, which I quote here:&lt;blockquote&gt;
Copyright (c) Hal Daume III, 2002-2006. The preprint version of this tutorial is intended to be free to the entire Haskell community, so we grant permission to copy and distribute it for any purpose, provided that it is reproduced in its entirety, including this notice. Modified versions may not be distributed without prior concent of the author, and must still maintain a copy of this notice. The author retains the right to change or modify this copyright at any time, as well as to make the book no longer free of charge.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
:Is there anything specific you think I should do to clarify this?  I have thanked the author on the main page of [[Haskell/YAHT]], but if you think I should do something more formal, please let me know.  Cheers, -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 20:14, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

::&quot;we grant permission to copy and distribute it for any purpose, '''provided that it is reproduced in its entirety''', including this notice. '''Modified versions may not be distributed without prior concent of the author'''&quot;

::hmmm. The boldfaced sections actually create a rather serious problem, since they don't jibe with the GFDL. Are you sure he understands fully what the GFDL means? Neither of those conditions could legally be applied to a GFDL document. I'd say hold off adding more until he gives consent... sorry about this, but these things are better nipped in the bud. Hopefully he can just change that notice on the copyright, but until he does, it can't be on a GFDL copyrighted server. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:03, 22 October 2006 (UTC)

:::Yes, I'm sure he understands the implications of this, if nothing else for the fact that he was willing that it be put onto a wiki. -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 05:51, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

::::OK. If you get a chance to talk to him again, just ask him if he can remove those 2 clauses, or just change the copyright to GFDL. The problem is that the modified versions of this document will in theory be under the GFDL, but if it's based on a document that has a copyright with those clauses, the GFDL would actually violate his copyright. Again, it's all a pain in the butt at first, but it pays off in the end to take care of these things at the beginning, rather than later. If for some reason he (or his heirs, etc.) objected to a later publication of the book, we'd have a deep doo-doo situation ;-). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 14:24, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

:::::Will do! I really appreciate the care that you guys (wikimedia admin volunteers) are taking in covering our collective butts.  Will report back.  -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 14:37, 23 October 2006 (UTC)

Hi again. If you just leave a link somewhere to where he has the GFDL licence, that will do the trick :). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:27, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

::Hi. How about [http://darcs.haskell.org/yaht/yaht.pdf this official pdf] which the author links to from his [http://www.cs.utah.edu/~hal/htut/ home page]?  It includes the sentence:
:::&quot;Note that this tutorial may alternately be distributed under the terms of the GNU Free Document License, as permission has been granted to incorporate it into the Wikibooks projects.&quot;
::Is that enough? -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 13:31, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

:::Yup :). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:35, 3 November 2006 (UTC)

Hey, I noticed you mention that a scientific calculator should give an error and to contact you if it does not. I am using an HP (50G), and I was easily able to calculate the factorial of 1,000. I did have problems in Haskell though (using ghci) with a stack overflow.

== Wikibooks Newsletter, Volume 1 ==

This is a short newsletter that is being distributed to all active wikibookians.  You are getting this message because you are recognized as an established contributor to the project.  This newsletter will be distributed on a regular basis to help share news, information, and tips. It comes from a bot account, [[User:The Staff]]. [[User:The Staff]] is currently operated by a team of wikibooks admins, the complete list of which is available on the user page of the bot. If you would like to not receive this newletter anymore, please remove your name from the list at [[Wikibooks:Active wikibookians]].

The work you do at Wikibooks is greatly appreciated.  However there are plenty of other opportunities for you to get involved and help us to create a thriving Wikibooks community.
We are sure that there are things we can do to help you and your understanding of Wikibooks and similarly there are certainly things you could do to help Wikibooks become a better place.

We would like to ask all wikibookians to add the [[WB:BB|Bulletin Board]] to your watchlists.  The Bulletin Board is a fast and easy way for wikibookians to communicate important news and events to the entire community. If you have important news to share with the community, you can feel free to add your own entry to that page.

If you have general questions or comments about Wikibooks, you are welcome to post a message on [[WB:SL|The Staff Lounge]], a free discussion area.  Your input would also be welcomed in the [[WB:VFD|Votes for Deletion]] and [[WB:RFA|Requests for Adminship]] discussion pages. These pages are all active discussion areas that help to shape the Wikibooks community as a whole.

Sometimes it is easy to forget that the Wikibooks community is much larger and more diverse then the people who work in a single book, or on a single bookshelf. Hopefully, together we can all make Wikibooks a better place, and a more valuable educational resource.

== Chapter titles in [Linguistics] ==

I didn't revert your changes.  I changed the visible text for two of the sections.  An anonymous editor had changed &quot;How we make words&quot; to &quot;How you make words&quot;, and &quot;Speech sounds go to work&quot; to something like &quot;Speech sound to go work&quot; (I forget the exact change, but it was just pranksterism, regardless).

Your changes seem completely appropriate to me. [[User:ACW|ACW]] 17:01, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

:Oops, my mistake.  I ''did'' revert your changes, but I didn't mean to.  Look at the diffs and you'll see what I had in mind.  I'll try again, and this time I'll do it right, leaving the titles as you had them. I apologize for the goofup. [[User:ACW|ACW]] 17:05, 27 February 2007 (UTC)

== Featured Books and other Work ==

I just wanted to let you know that i've seen alot of the work you've been doing around here, especially with the featured books templates, and i just wanted to personally thank you for your effort. It's always nice to see new faces working on the same old projects. 

If you need any help with your projects or in general, let me know. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 23:13, 29 April 2007 (UTC)

:Hey, thanks for that!  I feel very lucky to always stumble upon the friendliest communities of the net (Haskell, darcs, wikibooks).  I'm actually just looking out for the [[Haskell]] wikibook, but trying to do it in a way that benefits everybody as well.  Best, -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 06:16, 30 April 2007 (UTC)

::It's always good to get more programmers around here. Even though wiki is just a text-markup tool, programmers just seem to &quot;get it&quot; more quickly then other editors do. The kinds of things that you are doing with that featured book template are typically reserved for the oldest and most experienced editors, and even many of them can't quite figure out how to use a named template parameter properly. Of course, it doesnt help that some of the wiki syntax is so complicated. Anyway, keep up the good work! --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:21, 30 April 2007 (UTC)

== [[Control Systems]] ==

Yeah, i'm fine with the space shuttle for now for the book blurb here. I'll look through commons and see if i can find something a little better, but if not this is okay. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] ([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) 14:09, 15 May 2007 (UTC)

== languages bookshelf ==

Good morning, Kowey. I'm a bit concerned my latest comment on the discussion might get lost on the page, which is starting to look like an overgrown garden, so I'll repeat it here to make sure you see it as it's important:

&quot;Yesterday I placed a request on the template's talk page with intructions for the change. There has not been any response yet. If we decide to implement my and Kowey's proposal for disambiguation pages/templates (for languages with multiple textbooks), the bookshelf template will subsequently need to be updated to reflect that; or if Junesun's alternative proposal of leaving multiple books in the bookshelf template itself is opted for, again that will entail modifications. In this respect, what I have requested (#4) can be considered as &quot;provisional&quot;, but I think it's a step in the right direction. Kowey's disambiguation strategy sounds good to me but it does require &quot;technical&quot; implementation (i.e. somebody still has to make those pages or templates). Kowey, could you yourself either: (1) create them and incorporate them, or (2) failing that, at least create ONE of them for me to see exactly what your proposal looks like, and I can try to do the others following that model if you prefer it that way? Alan&quot;

I also noticed this morning that Xania has reorganised the list of English books on the bookshelf. Quite a list it is too. That might be a good place to start if you would like to try out your idea about the transcluded list strategy. I'd like to see an illustration of how that is going to work... Cheers, Alan --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 08:04, 10 June 2007 (UTC)

== Questionable links ==

Hi Kowey. Would you take a look at the question I've raised at the bottom of [[Wikibooks talk:Languages bookshelf]] and at the links in question? What do you think? If you agree with me, since you've been involved longer than I have with the project perhaps you'd like to say something on the matter? --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 21:38, 10 June 2007 (UTC)

Hello again. I see you still haven't responded to/about Lutonia. I didn't incorporate Lutonia's book into the individual-language bookshelf system we recently developed because I wanted to wait and see what would be decided (and avoid any additional work that might have to be undone afterwards). Any thoughts? Cheers, Alan --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 10:11, 23 June 2007 (UTC)

:Hi, yeah, sorry about that.  I've been meaning to look into ways we can import his work into wikibooks and find means for him to work with us.  That's the only barrier, really... technical stuff.  The books have no place here until this work is done, however.  If only we could state this in a very positive way that keeps him with us -- [[User:Kowey|Kowey]] 15:18, 23 June 2007 (UTC)

::I also happen to think that content-wise his books are methodologically highly unsound, although that is probably irrelevant since &quot;censorship&quot; of books on such grounds is not contemplated in Wikibooks. If I were to agree with encouraging him to stay &quot;with us&quot; it would be for purely &quot;ethical&quot; reasons, rather than because I see his work as a useful contribution to the quality (or eventual prestige) of the series. It's not a valid reason for turning him away, either; it's also not, therefore, the reason why I have called the books into question. Given all that, I would explain as delicately as possible the technical problem, but wouldn't go as far as bending over backwards or in any sense &quot;begging&quot; him to &quot;stay&quot;. My opinion for what it's worth. --[[User:A R King|A R King]] 17:47, 25 June 2007 (UTC)

== Thanks for the welcome! ==

Hi Kowey,
Thanks for the welcome to the Haskell wikibook project!  I've been looking for a way to contribute to the Haskell community, and at the moment I've found that the wikibook is a place where I can contribute productively.  You can expect to see lots of edits from me in the near future. =)  I already hang out in #haskell-books some, but I didn't know about the mailing list; I will go subscribe to it. --[[User:Byorgey|Byorgey]] 15:10, 5 July 2007 (UTC)

== Thank you + LaTeX ==

Hi Kowey!

Thank you for your welcome message. 
I have added an answer to your comment on my Wikibook

I admired the diagrams in your Haskell book. How were they made?

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Chapter 1. Introduction to Basic Ecology&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;  
&lt;/center&gt;
----
&lt;p&gt;
[[image:Geastrum.jpg|thumb|360px|right|An earth star fungus, ''Geastrum'' aff. '' welwitschii''. The strange structures shown are but a small part of the fungus, developed by that organism under genetic control to produce and disperse its spores. Much more of the biomass of this life form is found within the soil.]]

The objective of this wikibook, ''A Study Guide to Basic Ecology'', is to give the reader a better understanding of the way life functions on Earth, and how it is organized. This section will introduce basic concepts and definitions required to establish a course that is both biological and ecological in approach. You will learn that there are numerous terms in ecology which basically mean the same thing, and that there are also a plethora of views on precise definitions. As ecology emerged in the 19th and early 20th centuries, many concepts of ecological organization were proposed. These came from both zoologists and botanists&amp;mdash;whom seldom read the other's literature&amp;mdash;and from different schools of thought. 
==  Definition of Ecology==
The term '''''oekologie''''' ([[Wikipedia:en:Ecology|ecology]]) was coined in 1866 by the German biologist, [[Wikipedia:en:Ernst_Haeckel|Ernst Haeckel]] from the Greek ''oikos'' meaning &quot;house&quot; or &quot;dwelling&quot;, and ''logos'' meaning &quot;science&quot; or &quot;study&quot;. Thus, ecology is the &quot;study of the household of nature&quot;.  Haeckel intended it to encompass the study of an animal in relation to both the physical environment and other plants and animals with which it interacted.   

A contemporary definition of ecology is: 
&lt;center&gt;
'''''The scientific study of the distribution and abundance of organisms and the interactions that determine distribution and abundance'''''{{ref|Begon2006}}.
&lt;/center&gt;
This definition encompasses not only the plants and animals that Haeckel recognized but microscopic organisms such as [[Wikipedia:en:Bacteria|Bacteria]], [[Wikipedia:en:Archaea|Archaea]] and [[Wikipedia:en:protozoa|protozoa]], as well.  The interactions that determine an organism's distribution and abundance are processes that include energy flow, growth, reproduction, predation, competition and many others.
{{ref|something2000}}

== Basic Ecology Definitions ==
[[Image:The Earth seen from Apollo 17.jpg|thumb|right|250px|'''Ecology''' is essentially the study of the workings of the planet Earth.]]
To fully understand the science of ecology, there are some common terms that must be defined.
The term '''environment''' describes, in an unspecified way, the sum total of physical and biotic conditions that influence an organism (Kendeigh, 1961). The subset of the planet earth ''environment'' into which life penetrates is termed the '''biosphere'''. With respect to the planet earth, the biosphere penetrates only a limited distance into the rock beneath the land and the oceans, and a limited distance out away from the planet towards space.  All human effort so far has failed to demonstrate that the biosphere extends beyond these limits or that other biospheres exist elsewhere in the universe. We cannot therefore conclude that they do not exist, only that we know nothing of that existence. 
'''Ecosystem''' is perhaps the most widely used term in ecology. It is defined as the system of organisms and physical factors under study or consideration. 
Although the boundaries of ecosystems are sometimes quite difficult to define in nature, ecosystems&amp;mdash;however bounded&amp;mdash;comprise the basic units of that nature (Tansley, 1935). '''Habitat''' is generally considered by biologists to be the physical conditions that surround a species, or species population, or assemblage of species, or community (Clements and Shelford, 1939).

The basic physical units of the biosphere are the '''lithosphere''' (the land), '''hydrosphere''' (the water), and '''atmosphere''' (the air). Apparently there is no permanent biota of the atmosphere, although insects and birds among others utilize that environment extensively (Hesse, et al., 1951).

&lt;big&gt;NOTE:&lt;/big&gt; Definitions of terms used in this textbook have been collected into various glossaries, the basic one being [[../Main Glossary|Basic Ecology Glossary]].

== Scope of Ecology ==
[[Image:River gambia Niokolokoba National Park.gif|right|thumb|360px|Tropical woodlands and River Gambia. The surface of the earth is covered by an exceedingly complex biological system capturing energy from sunlight. Availability of water determines the &quot;density&quot; of this system.]]
Humanity has been studying nature for thousands of years and formally for several centuries under the science of biology, so why do we say that Ecology is a relatively new science?  (Note, the term &quot;ecology&quot; is only about 150 years old). What is it that ecologists do or study that biologists might not? Kendeigh (1961, p. 3) wrote that &quot;[e]cology is one of three main divisions of biology; the other two being morphology [organism structural aspects] and physiology [organism functional aspects]&quot;. The behavioral sciences encompass one facet of the interaction of an organism with its physical and biological surroundings, and therefore are part of ecology.

Several techniques are used to study Ecology; one of the methods is known as strong inference.  Strong inference is defined as the method of testing a hypothesis by deliberately attempting to demonstrate the falsity of the hypothesis (Kinraide and Denison, 2003).  Performing experiments is the preferred method of using strong inference.  The point of an experiment is to control variables and/or patterns and to predict the outcomes.  

Traditionally, Ecology is based more on weak inference (the other type of inference) rather than strong inference. In weak inference there are no experiments; rather, there are correlations between observations.  Weak inference is defined as a &quot;common sense&quot; approach using simple system models to build understanding (Elner and Vadas).  

Both weak and strong inference have been used throughout many different science courses over the last several thousands of years (Kinraide and Denison).  However, strong inference is said to be more advantageous because weak inference is more prone to error.  Weak inference makes people try to cling to one point of view; whereas strong inference (doing experimentation) causes people to think from more than one point of view and keep coming up with different hypotheses to test as their old hypotheses get falsified.  

Ecology incorporates and overlaps with many other disciplines in both the biological and physical sciences. Certainly on one level, there is no information about the natural environment that does not have some applicability to ecology. On the other hand, such interrelationships between the sciences are much more the norm than most people realize. Ecology, according to Kendeigh (1961, p. 1), is a distinct science because of the way information about the natural world is organized; and because of its unique methodologies and point-of-view by which knowledge is extracted from such information.
:''Ecology has no aim, but ecologists have. The problems of the ecologist are not fundamentally different from those of any other kind of naturalist. The superficial differences in aim are due to the different points of view, or methods of approach, rather than to any essential differences in the character of the problems'' &amp;mdash; (Charles Adams, 1913; cited in Hedgepeth, 1957). 

It may be helpful here to list the phenomenon that ecologists are particularly interested in if only to better clarify the boundaries of this text covering basic ecology (list modified from Kendeigh, 1961, p 1).  Ecologists study: 
# structural, functional, and behavioral adaptations of organisms in relation to their environment (Chapter 3); 
# interrelationships between species and their populations, and populations in their communities (Chapter 4);
# local and geographic distributions of organisms;
# regional variations in organism abundances;
# temporal changes in the distribution, abundance, and behaviors of organisms; and
# evolution of the interrelationships described.

Ecology is both a biological and an environmental science, something that should certainly be evident from the definition provided above. Many environmental sciences are minimally concerned with biology (meteorology, for example) and others (environmental toxicology, for example) necessarily combine physical and biological sciences. Environmentalism on the other hand is a political position involved with various aspects of managing the environment.

There are many subcategories of Ecology. Plant Ecology looks at the differences and similarities of various plants in differing climates and habitats. The origins of Animal Ecology can be traced to two Europeans, R. Hesse of [[Wikipedia:en:Germany|Germany]] and [[Wikipedia:en:Charles_Sutherland_Elton|Charles Elton]] of [[Wikipedia:en:England|England]] . Physiological Ecology, or [[Wikipedia:en:Ecophysiology|ecophysiology]], studies the responses of the individual organism to the environment. The idea of [[Wikipedia:en:Population_ecology|Population Ecology]] was brought forward by two famous men, [[Wikipedia:en:Charles_darwin|Charles Darwin]], who looked at the similarities and dissimilarites of populations and how they replaced each other over time, and [[Wikipedia:en:Mendel|Gregor Mendel]] . The last subcategory is [[Wikipedia:en:Ecosystem_ecology|Ecosystem Ecology]], which brought about terms such as [[Wikipedia:en:Limnology|limnology]], introduced by A. Thienemann.

== Early History of Ecology ==
Because ecology is a facet of biology, it is not possible to clearly define a time or person that represents the beginning of ecological thought as distinct from biology. One of the first ecologists was probably Theophrastus, a contemporary and student of Aristotle.  Theophrastus described various interrelationships between animals and between animals and their environment as early as the 4th century BC (Ramalay, 1940).

* Read [[Wikipedia:en:Theophrastus|Theophrastus]] (&lt;small&gt;Links need not be pursued at this time except as necessary to clarify points&lt;/small&gt;)

Over the next several centuries biological knowledge gradually expanded as naturalists, such as Bufon and Linnaeus, contributed to a growing understanding of the nature of plants and animals.  These early naturalists of course understood that organisms had a relationship with the environment, and especially that the distribution of forms was related to physical aspects of the geography.

The modern ecological concept of integrated communities of organisms began in the 19th century with the studies of August Grisebach (1838), a German botanist.  A contemporary and fellow countryman, Ernst Haeckel, coined the term &quot;ecology&quot; in 1866. Other biologists followed Grisbach's ecological approach to natural history studies: K. Möbius (1877) investigating Danish oyster banks, Stephen A. Forbes (1887), describing a lake community as a microcosm, J. E. B. Warming (1895), describing Danish plant communities, and C. C. Adams conducting ecological stuidies in northern Michigan (1905) and at Isle Royale (1909).

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{C Programming/Navigation|Variables|Simple math}}

When you take time to consider it, a computer would be pretty useless without some way to talk to the people who use it.  Just like we need information in order to accomplish tasks, so do computers.  And just as we supply information to others so that ''they'' can do tasks, so do computers.

These supplies and returns of information to a computer are called '''input''' and '''output'''.  'Input' is information supplied to a computer or program.  'Output' is information provided by a computer or program.  Frequently, computer programmers will lump the discussion in the more general term ''input/output'' or simply, '''I/O'''.

In C, there are many different ways for a program to communicate with the user.  Amazingly, the most simple methods usually taught to beginning programmers may also be the most powerful. In the [[Programming:C#A taste of C|&quot;Hello, World&quot; example]] at the beginning of this text, we were introduced to a Standard Library file stdio.h, and one of its functions, printf(). Here we discuss more of the functions that stdio.h gives us.


== Output using printf() ==

Recall from the beginning of this text the demonstration program duplicated below:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 #include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
   
 int main(void)
 {
    printf(&quot;Hello, world!\n&quot;);
    return 0;
 }
&lt;/source&gt;

If you compile and run this program, you will see the sentence below show up on your screen:


{| cellspacing=3
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|bgcolor=lightgrey|
   '''Hello, world!'''
|}

This amazing accomplishment was achieved by using the ''function'' &lt;tt&gt;printf()&lt;/tt&gt;. A function is like a &quot;black box&quot; that does something for you without exposing the internals inside. We can write functions ourselves in C, but we will cover that later.

You have seen that to use &lt;tt&gt;printf()&lt;/tt&gt; one puts text, surrounded by quotes, in between the parentheses. We call the text surrounded by quotes a ''literal string'' (or just a ''string''), and we call that string an ''argument'' to printf.

As a note of explanation, it is sometimes convenient to include the open and closing parentheses after a function name to remind us that it is, indeed, a function. However usually when the name of the function we are talking about is understood, it is not necessary.

As you can see in the example above, using &lt;tt&gt;printf()&lt;/tt&gt; can be as simple as typing in some text, surrounded by double quotes (note that these are double quotes and not two single quotes). So, for example, you can print any string by placing it as an argument to the &lt;tt&gt;printf()&lt;/tt&gt; function:


{| cellspacing=3
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|bgcolor=lightgrey|
   printf(&quot;This sentence will print out exactly as you see it...&quot;);
|}

And once it is contained in a proper &lt;tt&gt;main()&lt;/tt&gt; function, it will show:


{| cellspacing=3
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
|bgcolor=lightgrey|
   '''This sentence will print out exactly as you see it...'''
|}

=== Printing numbers and escape sequences ===
==== Placeholder codes ====
The &lt;tt&gt;printf&lt;/tt&gt; function is a powerful function, and is probably the most-used function in C programs. 

For example, let us look at a problem. Say we don't know what 19 + 31 is. Let's use C to get the answer.

We start writing

 #include &quot;stdio.h&quot; // this is important, since printf 
                    // can't be used without this line

 int main(void)
 {
    printf(&quot;19+31 is&quot;);


but here we are stuck! &lt;tt&gt;printf&lt;/tt&gt; only prints strings! Thankfully, printf has methods for printing numbers. What we do is put a ''placeholder'' format code in the string. We write:

   printf(&quot;19+31 is '''%d'''&quot;, 19+31);

The placeholder %d literally &quot;holds the place&quot; for the actual number that is the result of adding 19 to 31. 

These placeholders are called '''format specifiers'''. Many other format specifiers work with &lt;tt&gt;printf&lt;/tt&gt;. If we have a floating-point number, we can use &lt;tt&gt;%f&lt;/tt&gt; to print out a floating-point number, decimal point and all. Other format specifiers are:

*%d  - int      (same as %i)
*%ld - long int (same as %li)
*%f  - float
*%lf - double
*%c  - char
*%s  - string
*%x  - hexadecimal

==== Tabs and newlines ====
What if, we want to achieve some output that will look like:
    '''1905 '''
   '''312 +'''
   '''-----'''

&lt;tt&gt;printf&lt;/tt&gt; will not put line breaks in at the end of each statement: we must do this ourselves. But how?

What we can do is use the newline ''escape character''. An escape character is a special character that we can write but will do something special onscreen, such as make a beep, write a tab, and so on. To write a newline we write &lt;tt&gt;\n&lt;/tt&gt;. All escape characters start with a backslash.

So to achieve the output above, we write
   printf(&quot; 1905\n312 +\n-----\n&quot;);

or to be a bit more clear, we can break this long printf statement over several lines. So our program will be 
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;

int main(void)
{
   printf(&quot; 1905\n&quot;);
   printf(&quot;312 +\n&quot;);
   printf(&quot;-----\n&quot;);
   printf(&quot;%d&quot;, 1905+312);
   return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
There are other escape characters we can use. Another common one is to use &lt;tt&gt;\t&lt;/tt&gt; to write a tab. You can use &lt;tt&gt;\a&lt;/tt&gt; to ring the computer's bell, but you should not use this very much in your programs, as excessive use of sound is not very friendly to the user.
{{BookCat}}

== Other output methods ==
=== puts() ===

The puts() function is a very simple way to send a string to the screen when you have no placeholders to be concerned about.  It works very much like the printf() function we saw in the &quot;Hello, World!&quot; example:

   puts(&quot;Print this string.&quot;);

will print to the screen:

   Print this string.

followed by the newline character (as discussed above).  (The &lt;code&gt;puts&lt;/code&gt; function appends a newline character to its output.)
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
   #include&lt;stdio.h&gt;
   f(int i,int j,int k)
   {
     printf(&quot;%d%d%d&quot;,i,j,k);
   }
   main()
   {
     int x=1,y=2,z=3;
     f(x+y,y=x+z,z=x+y);
   }
&lt;/source&gt;
== Input using scanf() ==

The scanf() function is the input method equivalent to the printf() output function - simple yet powerful.  In its simplest invocation, the scanf ''format string'' holds a single ''placeholder'' representing the type of value that will be entered by the user.  These placeholders are exactly the same as the printf() function - %d for ints, %f for floats, and %lf for doubles.

There is, however, one variation to scanf() as compared to printf().  The scanf() function requires the memory address of the variable to which you want to save the input value.  While ''pointers'' are possible here, this is a concept that won't be approached until later in the text.  Instead, the simple technique is to use the ''address-of'' operator, '''&amp;'''. For now it may be best to consider this &quot;magic&quot; before we discuss pointers.  

A typical application might be like this:
&lt;source lang=c&gt;
#include &quot;stdio.h&quot;

int main(void) 
{
   int a;

   printf(&quot;Please input an integer value: &quot;);
   scanf(&quot;%d&quot;, &amp;a);
   printf(&quot;You entered: %d\n&quot;, a);

   return 0;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
If you were to describe the effect of the scanf() function call above, it might read as: &quot;Read in an integer from the user and store it at the address of variable ''a'' &quot;.

If you are trying to input a ''string'' using ''scanf'', you should '''not''' include the &amp; operator. The code below will not compile.
   scanf(&quot;%s&quot;, &amp;a);

The correct usage would be:
   scanf(&quot;%s&quot;, a);

This is because, whenever you use a format specifier for a string (%s), the variable that you use to store the value will be an array and, the array names (in this case - a) themselves point out to their base address and hence, the '''address of''' operator is not required.

(Although, this is vulnerable to [[w:Buffer overflow|Buffer overflow]]. fgets() is preferred to scanf()).

'''Note on inputs''':  When data is typed at a keyboard, the information does not go straight to the program that is running.  It is first stored in what is known as a '''buffer''' - a small amount of memory reserved for the input source.  Sometimes there will be data left in the buffer when the program wants to read from the input source, and the scanf() function will read this data instead of waiting for the user to type something. Some may suggest you use the function fflush(stdin), which may work as desired on some computers, but isn't considered good practice, as you will see later. Doing this has the downfall that if you take your code to a different computer with a different compiler, your code may not work properly.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi Maffu, welcome to Wikibooks! I hope you like the place and choose to [[Wikibooks:Wikibookians|stay]] :)

I don't think splitting scanf/printf into its own section is a good idea. It's good to have some level of centralization - I'll move te stuff back, you can reply here if you have some disagreement if you like :) 

Thanks [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 23:04, 10 Nov 2003 (UTC)



Thanks, Dysprosia.  I have no objection in the general.  It just seemed that the scanf/printf section was going to get very long - between escape sequences, placeholders, etc.  I thought it left a big hole, but figured it could be filled in easily enough.  Don't you think this subsection is going to overwhelm the topic?

Maffu 23:09, 10 Nov 2003 (UTC)

: C's ''simple'' IO system can be covered by just considering scanf and printf for the moment. We can get into the more nitty-gritty stuff with files and getc and fprintf and all that other wonderful stuff in another section :) [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 23:11, 10 Nov 2003 (UTC)


I guess I was referring to the other simple I/O methods.  Can't get much simpler than gets(), puts(), and cout.  These should at least be mentioned under the &quot;simple&quot; category.   Maffu 23:20, 10 Nov 2003 (UTC)

== C book and printf ==

Hello and greatings from the Wikipedia world. I went ahead and moved the C-specific content from the Wikipedia article on printf into the C book here, which it looks like you edit. You can take a look at what I did and move it around if you would like (I added a section to the end of the functions chapter) and linked to a new printf page from there. -- Zach (Zachlipton on Wikipedia).

== Parallèles (Pearson Prentice Hall) ==
Something I would recommend is taking a look at the staging and format of some popular French textbooks. The one I'm currently using is Parallèles. It's March of my second college semester and we're just now getting to lui and leur, yet they're stuck right in the first lesson section, before you've even hit a different tense! I've posted below the chapter contents for the first three chapters in my current book to give an idea of how they do it. (Please excuse me for not using accents, it's hard to do in Firefox!)

*Prèliminaire - Entrée en scène
**Introductions (Bonjour, comment vous appelez-vous, je m'appelle, au revoir, etc.)
**Identification (Qu'est ce que c'est? C'est... Voila... Voici...)
**Le jour, la date, et les nombres cardinaux
**Phonetique: Alphabet, accents et consonnes
*1. Premiers contacts
**People, origin, and profession
**Les pronom sujets; le verbe etre; la negation ne...pas
**Le genre et le nombre a trente, articles definis et indefinis, contractions
**Les verbes en -er; changements orthographiques de quelques verbes en -er (-ger, -cer, -érer)
**Expressions de fréquence (ne...jamais, parfois, etc.) et de quantité (assez, beaucoup, peu, plus)
**Questions oui/non (intonation, est-ce que, n'est-ce pas)
*2. On rejoint la communaute francophone
**Le verbe avoir; l'expression il y a
**Les mots de la famille
**Les adjectifs reguliers: accord et place
**Les nombres cardinaux de 31 a un millard
**Questions d'information (Combien, Comment, Pourquoi, etc.); inversion

As you can see, they take it rather slowly. I think that if we're going to create a dynamite wikibook, we'll want to follow a similar pattern. In between all of that, they add tons of culture, stories, etc. 

I am a writer by nature, but very, very limited in my French ability. I would be more than willing to work with someone or different people to add flavor text to the wikibook (such as conversations, stories, characters, etc) if they could translate for me? (Granted, I'm certain there are people who could do that themselves without having to go through English to get there.) I would guess it might help, though, to produce French from an Anglophone learner's perspective. --[[User:Averykrouse|Averykrouse]] 04:49, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

Yes, I don't really like the organization of the first four lessons (1. Intorductions, 2. Gender, Subject pronouns, 3.Date and Time, 4. Description). Your book has the alphabet and pronunciation, which we have in our introduction, as part of a general preliminary lesson. Maybe we should combine the &quot;reading French&quot; lesson with lesson 1. We defintately need to reorganize from the introduction to lesson 1.4.  

Right now level one covers the present tense, etre, avoir, and faire, and basic pronouns. Could you make a list of all the grammar your book covers other than tenses and irregular verbs?

We're horribly lacking in stories and conversations. Luckily, Merrheim, a native French speaker, has agreed to write stories for each lesson, so the book would improve at least a little in that regard. --[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 16:14, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

ps. Remeber alt + 1 3 0 on the numpad for é, which is where most accents are used. For the others, use the &quot;insert&quot; box below the editor. The first set is accent aigu, the second accent grave, and the third the carot marks.
----
As far as grammar specifically is concerned, here is the rundown by chapter. (I went ahead and listed the tenses and verbs as well because that is one area that I'd like to address in our organization styles. I've also given the general topic used in each chapter to exemplify the vocab used as it relates to the grammar.)

P. L'alphabet, accents et consonnes, le jour et la date (avec les nombres cardinaux de 1 à 30)

1. (Indentifying people, objects, and daily activities) Les pronoms sujets, le verbe être, la négation ne...pas; &lt;br&gt;le genre et le nombre, articles définis et indéfinis; contractions; &lt;br&gt;les verbes en -er, changements orthographiques de quelquesverbes en -er; &lt;br&gt;Questions oui / non (intonation, est-ce que, n'est-ce pas); &lt;br&gt; syllabation et liason

2. (Describing personality, tastes, family, friends) Le verbe avoir, l'expression il y a; &lt;br&gt;Les adjectifs réguliers: accord et place; &lt;br&gt;Les nombres cardinaux de 31 à un milliard; &lt;br&gt;Questions d'information; inversion

3. (A tour of France, weather, seasons) Les adjectifs qui précèdent le nom; &lt;br&gt;Le verbe faire; &lt;br&gt;Le verbe aller et le futur proche; &lt;br&gt;L'adjectif interrogatif quel; l'adjectif démonstratif ce

4. (City life, directions, and shops) Les adjectifs possessifs (ma, tes, notre, etc); &lt;br&gt;L'impératif et le conditionnel de politesse (je voudrais, je pourrais only); &lt;br&gt;Les verbes réguliers en -re, le verbe prendre;

5. (A person's physical features, personality, and character) Les verbes réguliers en -ir, les verbes comme ouvrir; &lt;br&gt;Adjectifs irréguliers, les pronoms toniques, c'est vs. il est/elle et; &lt;br&gt;Le passé composé avec avoir; &lt;br&gt;Le comparatif et le superlatif de l'adjectif

6. (House, furnishings, chores, and daily routines) Les verbes partir, sortir, dormir; &lt;br&gt;Le verbe venir, le passé récent; &lt;br&gt;Les verbes pronominaux au présent et à l'impératif

''(This point is where first semester college French ends and second begins in this book.)''

7. (Food, shopping, and table manners) L'article partitif, révision de l'article défini et indéfini (le café vs. du café, etc); &lt;br&gt;Les verbes mettre, boire, et recevoir; &lt;br&gt;Expressions de quantité; &lt;br&gt;Les verbes pronominaux au passé composé

8. (Holidays, events, memories) Les pronoms relatifs qui et que; &lt;br&gt;L'imparfait (description); &lt;br&gt;L'imparfait (habitudes); &lt;br&gt;Les verbes vouloire, pouvoire, et devoir

9. (de lycée) Les verbes connaître, savoir, et suivre; &lt;br&gt;Les pronoms compléments d'objet direct; &lt;br&gt;La narration au passé: l'imparfait vs. le passé composé; &lt;br&gt;Les expressions de temps depuis, il y a, pendent

10. (la fac, university life) Les verbes dire, lire, et écrire; &lt;br&gt;Les pronoms compléments d'objet indirect; &lt;br&gt;Les pronoms y et en; &lt;br&gt;Le conditionnel

11. (careers, clothes) Les pronoms interrogatifs; &lt;br&gt;Le pronom interrogatif lequel; &lt;br&gt;Les verbes croire et voir; &lt;br&gt;Le présent du subjonctif: verbes réguliers, les expressions impersonnelles d'obligation

12. (travel and leisure) Les noms géographiques et les prépositions; &lt;br&gt;Le subjonctif d'être et d'avoir, l'emploi du subjonctif après les expressions de volonté; &lt;br&gt;Le sobjonctif des verbes irréguliers; &lt;br&gt;Le subjonctif après les expressions d'émotion

Voilà! --[[User:Averykrouse|Avery W. Krouse]] 21:12, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

Thanks for the list. Sections we could have:

*contractions - in French? what kind of contractions?
*L'adjectif interrogatif quel; l'adjectif démonstratif ce
*changements orthographiques de quel
*Les pronoms compléments d'objet direct - what are these?
*L'impératif et le conditionnel de politesse (je voudrais, je pourrais only) - Basic introductions to tenses might be a very good idea.
*Les expressions de temps depuis, il y a, pendent - definately add to level two
*Questions d'information; inversion

I think that level one is way too early for the subjunctive and the more difficult pronouns like lequel. I also don't view lui and leur as anything special that takes more than five minutes to learn. 

Anyway, I'm interested in hearing your views on the progression. I think having the difficulty level increase is the best course. If you haven't done so already, check the structure lesson on the planning page. If you have a better structure, we should reorganize as soon as possible. On a related note, would copying the organization straight out of a book be any kind of legal infringement? --[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 00:56, 5 March 2006 (UTC)

Actually, I would say that just the organization structure itself wouldn't be an infringement on copyright. If we're dividing those fourteen chapters into three sections (perhaps Étages or Étapes), the chapter numbering wouldn't even match up. And for the flavor text, I would highly recommend a theme per chapter, but we could probably use different themes than the ones they use. (They also focus a lot on French / American parallels (hence the name) and connections to other Francophone places.)

In general, it's important to give things one at a time. One tense at a time, one irregular at a time, one regular set at a time, one pronoun at a time, etc, especially considering that if a student gets lost in the first chapter, they wouldn't carry anything over to build with in the second chapter, and so forth.

To make it more presentable as a textbook, I would definitely like to see more dialogues, character profiles, etc. (Wow, I just had a great idea!) Let's introduce a character. Luc Beauchamp, let's say. And we see him start in a new college (introductions, basic vocabs, etc.) to lycée (friends, interactions, after school stuff), to the bac (testing, adjectives, careers), to the fac (college life), to graduation (reminiscing about old times = l'imparfait!), to choosing a career (the conditional), to starting a family, and so forth. It gives us clear story lines, something the reader can relate to, and a format to work towards when adding the meat of the chapter. The bones are the bones one way or the other, grammar is grammar, but vocabulary and comprehension is the meat.

What do you think? Something we could flesh out, maybe using the above grammar outline to format around? --[[User:Averykrouse|Avery W. Krouse]] 07:18, 5 March 2006 (UTC)

The problem with giving tenses and verbs one at a time is that later on you can't. For example, ~4 verbs are conjugated irregularly in the subjunctive, and ~10 more have irregular stems. 40 verbs have irregular passé simple stems. (See [[French/Lessons/Revolution%21|the section]]). The verbs that were irregular in the present indicative will for the most part be irregular in all the other tenses, and you can't devote a chapter to each verb. The book ''has to'' get more rigorous as it progresses. 

But I wholeheartedly agree to starting off as simply as possible. Level one has one regular set/irregular verb section and one misc grammar section in each lesson. Level two has 3-4 irregular verbs per lesson. After level two, we're done with introducing new irregular verbs.

I also agree with guiding the reader and explaining things rather than simply showing vocabulary charts. The problem is that we need  to introduce the grammar and vocabulary first. Level one should be mostly vocabulary, and four mostly prose French. There should also be just as many practice exercises as sections and a test for each lesson. Things like dialogues should be included to force the reader to go back and reread vocabulary and grammar.

As for Luc, I think that's a great idea and will make the course a lot more interesting. If we follow the current structure, level one could be the summer before he goes to university, where Luc describes himself, we meet his family and see his house, watch him play with his friends, take trips to the science and art museum, etc. Level two could be Luc in university, where we learn about his daily life. Level three could be Luc taking a vacation before going to an interview and getting a job, and later having a kid of his own.

Finally, I'm for whatever book organization you feel is best. To see another French book as an example, go [http://www.glencoe.com/sec/worldlanguages/french/ose/index.html here] and enter user: BONVL105  and pass: w6pUtRux for level 1 and user: BONVL205 pass: yaN6pRef  for level two. --[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 09:06, 5 March 2006 (UTC)

During the next few days I should have all the grammar sections completed and expanded, so we won't have to worry about that anymore, or at least until level four. I've pretty much given all the vocabulary I have so either someone else will have to finish [[French/Lessons/Planning#Lesson_To-Do|what's left]] or we'll just use basic Google translations. Whatever book organization we choose, we'll still have the same grammar and vocabulary, so that will be taken care of. --[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 09:37, 5 March 2006 (UTC)

One of the comments I would make is that it's not necessary to devote a chapter to each verb, just make sure that the basic verbs are covered well, and as we get to harder tenses and different irregulars, group them in simple sets. Partir/sortir/dormir, vouloir/pouvoir, etc. With tenses, I don't see it that necessary to place every single irregular stem in the page, just a good selection of frequently used ones. Then, we should have a chart of verbs (one each for er, re, and ir, then for each orthographic group like cer and ger, then for each of the irregular verbs we've presented (and a handful extra)). After all, this is just a textbook designed to take the reader through approximately three semesters worth of French, correct?

Also, for vocabulary, let's try and make a balance between pure vocab lists, contextually-learned vocab (vocab placed inside of stories and dialogues), and sets of examples (Luc se coucher. Il se leve. Il s'habille. Etc.) The way my book does it is to do the dialogues and stories and whatnot and at the end of each section, have a list of new vocab that was used in that section, so that you end up with a handful of vocab lists in each chapter. That way, anything the student didn't catch in context they can pick up manually. --[[User:Averykrouse|Avery W. Krouse]] 01:55, 6 March 2006 (UTC)

Also also, we need to consider the dialogues that are already in place. For example, the two at the end of the introductory lesson contain reflexive pronouns, imperfect tense, etc. This is way too far ahead for introductory. The general rule for staging this kind of thing ought be: 80% What they already have, 15% what they will get next, 5% other vocabulary (often with translated citations). Right now, the students should be able to learn both by rote and by context. The dialogues and stories become useless when they would require an outside source to translate them (if only because most people aren't going to go to that much trouble). We have to consider that right now, most of our readers will be learning on their own. We should be as explanatory as possible, at least throughout the first lesson, including lots of full sentence French examples with full sentence English translations. --[[User:Averykrouse|Avery W. Krouse]] 02:06, 6 March 2006 (UTC)

Ideally, this course should teach dedicated and hard-working readers to speak the language fluently. By the end of level four, all French grammar will be covered in depth. Five should be conducted in French. The Glencoe books I've linked to commonly have grammar that hasn't been formally taught, but that translates straightforwardly. Other grammar should be included, but with footnote translations. I completely agree with everything else you said. As for what we should do now, first we should get the core content (grammar and vocabulary) done, then we can build around that complete all-encompassing lessons. The student should never have to leave the book (or ideally the lesson) to look anything up. 

The higher level Glencoe books have texts accompanying chapters structured as introduction/context, vocabulary for the text, the text, questions on the text. I have started one to accompany the Revolution lesson, found [[French/Lessons/Revolution!/Text|here]]. We should have many more of these in the later levels. Finally, I would like to ask you to write English introductions to the beginning lessons, since I know you can right a lot better than I can. We're making progress! --[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 03:40, 6 March 2006 (UTC)

One more thing: how do you think we should handle grammar review? The Glencoe books did this by combining lessons from the previous book. For example a tense learned in three lessons in the previous book would be reviewed in one lesson in the next. The new grammar lessons would also be the bigger size. The third Glencoe book is almost all grammar review. We could follow that example, which is what I did, or we could have a review lesson at the end of each level before the test, like the German Wikibook, since our levels aren't separate year courses. --[[User:Hagindaz|Hagindaz]] 04:45, 6 March 2006 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The study of '''power series''' is aimed at investigating series which can approximate some function over a certain interval.

== Motivations ==
Elementary calculus ([[Calculus/Differentiation|differentiation]]) is used to obtain information on a line which touches a curve at one point (i.e. a tangent). This is done by calculating the gradient, or slope of the curve, at a single point. However, this does not provide us with reliable information on the curve's actual ''value'' at given points in a wider interval. This is where the concept of power series becomes useful.

===An example===
&lt;!-- needs a pic --&gt;
Consider the curve of ''y'' = cos(''x''), about the point ''x'' = 0. A naïve approximation would be the line ''y'' = 1. However, for a more accurate approximation, observe that cos(''x'') looks like an inverted parabola around ''x'' = 0 - therefore, we might think about which parabola could approximate the shape of cos(''x'') near this point. This curve might well come to mind:

&lt;math&gt;y = {1 - { x^2 \over 2}}&lt;/math&gt;

In fact, this is the best estimate for cos(''x'') which uses polynomials of degree 2 (i.e. a highest  term of ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) - but how do we know this is true? This is the study of power series: finding optimal approximations to functions using polynomials.

== Definition ==
A ''power series'' is a [[Calculus/Series|series]] of the form
: ''a''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; + ... + ''a''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''x''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;

or, equivalently,

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{j=0}^n a_jx^j&lt;/math&gt;

== Radius of convergence ==
When using a power series as an alternative method of calculating a function's value, the equation
: &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\sum_{j=0}^n a_jx^j&lt;/math&gt;
can only be used to study ''f''(''x'') where the power series converges - this may happen for a finite range, or for all [[w:Real_number|real numbers]].

The size of the interval (around its center) in which the power series converges to the function is known as the ''radius of convergence''.

===An example===
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1-x}=\sum_{n=0}^\infty x^n &lt;/math&gt; (a geometric series)
this converges when | ''x'' | &lt; 1, the range -1 &lt; ''x'' &lt; +1, so the radius of convergence - centered at 0 - is '''1'''. It should also be observed that at the ''extremities'' of the radius, that is where ''x'' = 1 and ''x'' = -1, the power series does not converge.

===Another example===
:&lt;math&gt;e^x=\sum_{n=0}^\infty \frac{x^n}{n!}&lt;/math&gt;
Using the [[Calculus/Series#Ratio test|ratio test]], this series converges when the ratio of successive terms is less than one:
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} \left|\frac{x^\left(n+1\right)}{\left(n+1\right)!}\frac{n!}{x^n}\right|&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} \left|\frac{x^n x^1}{n! \left(n+1\right)}\frac{n!}{x^n}\right|&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;

:or &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty}\left|\frac{x}{n+1}\right|&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;
which is always true - therefore, this power series has an infinite radius of convergence. In effect, this means that the power series can ''always'' be used as a valid alternative to the original function, e&lt;sup&gt;''x''&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Abstraction===
If we use the ratio test on an arbitrary power series, we find it converges when
:&lt;math&gt;\lim \frac{|a_{n+1}x|}{|a_n|} &lt;1 &lt;/math&gt;
and diverges when
:&lt;math&gt;\lim \frac{|a_{n+1}x|}{|a_n|} &gt;1 &lt;/math&gt;
The radius of convergence is therefore
:&lt;math&gt;r=\lim \frac{|a_n|}{|a_{n+1}|}&lt;/math&gt;
If this limit diverges to infinity, the series has an infinite radius of convergence.

==Differentiation and Integration==
Within its radius of convergence, a power series can be differentiated and integrated term by term.
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dx} \sum_{j=0}^\infty a_jx^j = 
\sum_{j=0}^\infty (j+1)a_{j+1}x^j&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\int \sum_{j=0}^\infty a_jz^j dz = \sum_{j=1}^\infty \frac{a_{j-1}}{j}x^j&lt;/math&gt;

Both the differential and the integral have the same radius of convergence as the original series.

This allows us to sum exactly suitable power series. For example,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1+x}=1-x+x^2-x^3+ \ldots&lt;/math&gt;
This is a geometric series, which converges for | ''x'' | &lt; 1. Integrating both sides, we get
:&lt;math&gt;\ln (1+x) = x-\frac{x^2}{2}+\frac{x^3}{3} \ldots &lt;/math&gt;
which will also converge for | ''x'' | &lt; 1. When ''x'' = -1 this is the harmonic series, which ''diverges'; when ''x'' = 1 this is an alternating series with diminishing terms, which ''converges'' to ln 2 - this is testing the extremities.

It also lets us write power series for integrals we cannot do exactly such as the error function:
:&lt;math&gt;e^{-x^2}=\sum (-1)^n \frac{x^{2n}}{n!}&lt;/math&gt;
The left hand side can not be integrated exactly, but the right hand side can be.
:&lt;math&gt;\int_0^z e^{-x^2}dx=\sum  \frac{(-1)^n z^{2n+1}}{(2n+1)n!}&lt;/math&gt;
This gives us a power series for the sum, which has an infinite radius of convergence, letting us approximate the integral as closely as we like.
