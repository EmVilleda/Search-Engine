Where do you get these fuzzy logic cookers, havent seen them in Scotland yet.
[[User:TonyClarke|TonyClarke]] 00:53, 6 Dec 2003 (UTC)

:Not sure what to say.  They've been in the US for about 5 years, and available in Japan for five years before that.  You might try an Asian supermarket, if you have any near you in Scotland, as the one near me (in California) has models you otherwise can't buy in the US.  Here's a site in the US that will ship them internationally, as I havn't been able to locate a UK merchant.

Of course, it doesn't matter anymore, as I went back and checked ''The Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook'', and was wrong, soups can be done in any type of cooker, on the normal setting. Now I've got to change the article. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]]

Thanks for the information Gentgeen. Maybe I haven't looked out for them, I try to follow a raw food  diet so cooking is  an infrequent event for me! Thanks again

Reduced the amound of rice and increased the water because when I tried it, the rice sucked up all the water.  [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 01:28, 7 Jan 2004 (UTC)</text>

{{spice}}

'''Ginger''' is used extensively as a cooking ingredient or [[Cookbook:Spice|spice]] in [[Cookbook:Asian Cuisine|Asian cuisine]] and others. It is part of mainstream western food in [[Cookbook:Ginger beer|ginger beer]] and [[Cookbook:Dessert|desserts]] such as [[Cookbook:Gingerbread|gingerbread]] and [[Cookbook:Ginger Snap|ginger snaps]] (a type of cookie). Though generally called &quot;root&quot;, it is actually the [[Cookbook:Rhizome|rhizome]] of the plant ''Zingiber officinalis''.  

Young ginger roots are juicy and fleshy with a very mild taste.
They are often pickled in [[Cookbook:Vinegar|vinegar]] as a snack or just cooked as an ingredient in many dishes.
Mature ginger roots are fibrous and nearly dry. The juice from old ginger roots is extremely hot and is often used as a spice in Chinese cooking to cover up other strong odors and flavors such as in seafood and mutton.

[[Image:ARS_ginger.jpg|thumb|right|25.4-pound ginger root]]
Ginger is also made into candy, is used as a flavoring for cookies and cake,
and is the main flavor in &quot;ginger ale&quot;, a sweet, carbonated, non-alcoholic
beverage.

Dried and powdered ginger is used to add spiciness to gingerbread and other recipes. It tastes quite different from fresh ginger, and they can not be substituted for each other.

Ginger is grown throughout the tropical areas of the world.  The most expensive, and highest quality varieties, generally come from [[Cookbook:Cuisine of India|India]] and [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Jamaica|Jamaica]] while most mass market ginger is grown in [[Cookbook:Cuisine of China|China]].

A related plant known as ''[[Cookbook:Galangal|galangal]]'' is often used for similar purposes
in various [[Cookbook:Southeast Asian cuisines|South-East Asian cuisines]].

[[Image:Milk glass.jpg|thumb|Milk is a common [[Cookbook:Basic foodstuffs|ingredient]] in many [[Cookbook:Dessert|desserts]] and [[Cookbook:Bread|breads]].  It also can be served as a beverage.]]
The milk of some mammals, particularly cows, goats, sheep, and buffalo, is collected for human consumption, either directly, usually after pasteurization, or is processed into [[Cookbook:Dairy|dairy product]]s such as [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]], [[Cookbook:Butter|butter]], [[Cookbook:Yogurt|yogurt]], [[Cookbook:Vanilla Ice Cream|ice cream]], or [[Cookbook:Cheese|cheese]].  When used alone, ''milk'' almost always refers to cow's milk.

Another use is to refer to plant-based milks, usually [[Cookbook:Soy Milk|soy milk]] or rice milk; typical variations are [[Cookbook:Almond Milk|almond milk]], oat milk, hemp milk, and banana milk.  These can either be made at home or bought commercially; they rarely include any animal milk or animal milk by-products, and so can be eaten by those who can't digest lactose or casein. They can be substituted for animal milk in recipes in some situations, although they may impact the flavour or texture of the resulting dish.  These milks should be treated much as animal milk - that is, they should be refrigerated, especially after opening, and used within a few days.

When raw animal milk is left standing for a while, it turns sour. This is the result of [[Cookbook:Fermentation|fermentation]]: lactic acid bacteria naturally present in raw animal milk turn the animal milk sugar into lactic acid. This fermentation process is exploited in the production of various dairy products.

Pasteurized animal milk does not have these bacteria, so instead of souring it will putrefy if kept unrefrigerated, and should be stored between 1 °C and 4 °C. The putrefaction of animal milk can be forestalled by using ultra-high temperature (UHT, also known as ultra-pasteurization) treatment; animal milk so treated can be stored unrefrigerated for several months until opened.

Lactose in animal milk is digested with the help of the enzyme lactase produced by the bodies of infants.  In humans, production of lactase falls off in adulthood, in many cases to the point where lactose becomes indigestible, leading to lactose intolerance, a gastrointestinal condition that afflicts many. 

Casein is the main protein in animal milk, and is particularly concentrated in cheese made with animal milk. Whey is the other major protein in animal milk, and is separated from casein in the manufacturing process of cheese made with animal milk. Both proteins can provoke undesirable symptoms in some people, although casein intolerance is more widely recognised and is often connected with gluten intolerance and coeliac disease.

Milk possesses the ability to reduce the perceived spiciness level of some spicy foods thanks to the casein which binds with capsaicin oil and then carries it away.

{{spice}}

'''Cinnamon''' is a [[Cookbook:Spice|spice]] obtained from the inner bark of a small evergreen tree native to [[w:Sri Lanka|Sri Lanka]]. Cinnamon is principally employed in cookery as a condiment and flavouring material, being largely used in the preparation of some kinds of [[Cookbook:Chocolate|chocolate]] and [[Cookbook:liqueur|liqueur]]s.

The best cinnamon is from Sri Lanka, but the tree is also grown at Tellicherry, in [[w:Java island|Java]], the [[w:West Indies|West Indies]], [[w:Brazil|Brazil]], and [[w:Egypt|Egypt]]. Sri Lanka cinnamon of fine quality is a very thin smooth bark, with a light-yellowish brown colour, a highly fragrant odour, and a peculiarly sweet, warm and pleasing aromatic taste. 

Its flavour is due to an aromatic oil which it contains to the extent of from 0.5 to 1%. This essential oil, as an article of commerce, is prepared by roughly pounding the bark, macerating it in sea-water, and then quickly distilling the whole. It is of a golden-yellow colour, with the peculiar odour of cinnamon and a very hot aromatic taste.

Being a much more costly spice than [[Cookbook:Cassia|cassia]], that comparatively harsh-flavoured substance is frequently substituted for or added to it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''route''' is the path that data takes when travelling through a network from one host to another. Routing is the process by which the path, or some subset of it, is determined. One of the characteristic features of the Internet, as compared to other network architectures, is that each node that receives a packet will typically determine for itself what the next step in the path should be.

&lt;!-- Provide links to descriptions of other network architectures above. --&gt;

IP routing decisions are generally made based on the destination of network traffic.  When an IP packet is sent from a node on the network, it will consult its ''routing table'' to determine the next hop device that the traffic should be sent to, in order for it to reach its final destination.  The routing table on a typical home machine may look something like this (except formatted properly :):

&lt;!-- Argh! How do you make this use a fixed-width font!?! It lies about starting with a space doing it! --&gt;
 Kernel IP routing table
 Destination     Gateway         Genmask         Flags Metric Ref    Use Iface
 x.y.z           *               255.255.255.255 UH    0      0        0 ppp0
 192.168.0.0     *               255.255.255.0   U     0      0        0 eth0
 127.0.0.0       *               255.0.0.0       U     0      0        0 lo
 default         x.y.z           0.0.0.0         UG    0      0        0 ppp0

So, for example, when it receives a packet on interface eth0 which has a destination of 216.239.59.104, it will consult the table and see that it should send it through the default interface, the host x.y.z, which is on interface ppp0.

The routing table is constructed from a combination of statically defined routes and those learned from dynamic routing protocols.

Statically defined routes may be declared at system boot time, or via a command line interface.  They will generally include the following parameters:
* '''Destination''' - this may be either a single host, or a network (in which case a network mask is also required).
* '''Gateway''' - the device to which traffic with the defined destination should be sent. 

Static routes may also include the following parameters:
*'''Interface''' - the interface through which the traffic to a destination must be sent.  (Most OSs can determine this automatically)
*'''Metric''' - the number of 'hops' away that the gateway is from this host.  For a gateway that resides on a directly connected network, the metric is '1'.

The ''default route'' is a special case of a statically defined route.  It is the route of last resort.  All traffic that does not match another destination in the routing table is forwarded to the default gateway.

Dynamic routing protocols allow network attached devices to learn about the structure of the network dynamically from peer devices.  This reduces the administrative effort required to implement and change routing throughout a network.  Some examples of dynamic routing protocols are:

* '''RIP''' (Routing Information Protocol)
* '''OSPF''' (Open Shortest Path First)
* '''ISIS''' (Intermediate system to intermediate system)
* '''BGP''' (Border Gateway Protocol)
* '''IGRP''' (Interior Gateway Routing Protocol)

ISIS and OSPF are link-state protocols, meaning each node part of the same zone, will know the state of all the link in the mesh. Due to the exponential number of link in a mesh, thoses protocols are for small mesh such as an ISP national backbone.

RIP is usually used to easily announce customer's routes in a backbone.

BGP is used as an external routing protocol to exchange routes with other entities. ISP use BGP extensivly to &quot;trade&quot; their routes. It can also be used to carry customers routes accross a network, in a MPLS backbone for example.

[[Image:Fleur_de_muscade.jpg|right|thumb|Mace]]
{{spice}}

'''Nutmeg''' and mace are two spices derived from the same plant, the nutmeg tree (''Myristica fragrans'').
The nutmeg tree is indigenous to the Banda Islands of [[Cookbook:Cuisine of Indonesia|Indonesia]] but is also grown in the [[Cookbook:Caribbean cuisines|Caribbean]] (e.g., Grenada). Several commercial products are produced from the nutmeg tree, nutmeg and mace being the best known. Nutmeg is the actual seed of the tree, roughly egg-shaped and about an inch long, while mace is the dried &quot;lacy&quot;, reddish covering of the seed.

Other products include their essential oils. Other nutmeg tree species include the ''M. argentea'' which produces 'Papuan' nutmegs from Papua (Indonesia) and Papua New Guinea, and ''M. malabarica'' which produces 'Bombay' nutmegs from [[Cookbook:Cuisine_of_India|India]]; both are used as adulterants of ''M. fragrans'' products. 

The spices in their ground form are mainly used in the food processing industry, principally in the seasoning of meat products; they are also used in soups, sauces, baked goods and spice mixes such as [[Cookbook:Curry|curry]] powder in [[Cookbook:Cuisine_of_Japan|Japan]]. Both spices have similar taste qualities; mace is more popular in light coloured foods because of its light orange colour. Mace (edited from &quot;Nutmeg&quot;), in general, tends to be sweeter and more delicate.

The essential oil is obtained by the steam distillation of ground nutmeg. The oil is colourless or light yellow and smells and tastes of nutmeg. Essential nutmeg oil as such is used as natural food flavouring in baked goods, syrups, beverages (e.g., cola), sweets, etc. It replaces ground nutmeg as it leaves no particles in the food.

Nutmeg is extremely toxic when injected intravenously. Excessive consumption of the spice is also dangerous and can lead to death. Nutmeg can also cause hallucinations when taken in excess, along with nausea, dehydration, and generalised body pain.

      <comment>I removed some stuff I wrote about myself when I was 16. It's not exactly applicable anymore.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">* My name is Hal Newnan. I graduated Summa Cum Laude from Macomb (MIchigan's) Community College's South Campuses's Graphic Communication Arts (since renamed) program with 2 Associates Degrees: 1) in Electronic Publishing, and 2) in Illustration. 

The point made in the statistic noted in the Wiki Graphic Design book is well taken! Probably less than 10% of the graduates of any given program will find their way into any kind of work related to their studies. Less than 2-5% are likely to achieve positions of high rank or pay. One of our program's directors, Brian Sauriol, speaks at length of the dedication he has admired in other graphic artists who have soared to the pinnacles of success through (often) grim determination and disciplined hard work. Perhaps the wealthy do fall flat on their faces.

As a mid-life career switcher, I was advised (by a friend who had followed her graphic design career from college in NYC to advertising agencies there, and still works it in Ann Arbor, MI) to find work at a print house. This I have done through our Co-op Industrial program. 

I can highly recommend this course of action, it is grounding me in completing practical tasks for my employer (like building and modifying their website) and doing their brochure and logo work. I also get frequent chances to work with Illustrator to design labels for our customers as well as for our owners. 

I see that Brian's finding teaching work helps him to stay on top of developments in the profession.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;'''Articles'''&lt;/big&gt;

Articles can be definite or indefinite.

In both cases, as in the other Romance languages of the Iberian Peninsula, articles have two genders: masculine and feminine. Number can be singular or plural.

The most general paradigm for the definite article is:

#'''masculine, singular:'''   o  
#'''feminine, singular:'''   a
#'''masculine, plural:'''   os
#'''feminine, plural:'''   as

Gender and number must agree with that of the noun (and adjective).

#'''O''' mesache ye en '''a''' borda = The boy is in the shepherd's hut.
#'''As''' mesachas son en '''o''' lugar = The girls are in the village.

&lt;Big&gt;&lt;big&gt; Einfache Mathematik ~ &lt;/big&gt;Simple Mathematics&lt;/Big&gt;

== Lernen 7 ~ Zählen von 13 bis 100 ==
Once you have memorized the numbers from 1 to 12 (see [[German/Lesson 3|Lernen 3]]), counting higher in German becomes very much like counting in English. From 13 to 19, add ''-zehn'' (10; &quot;-teen&quot; in English) after the cardinal number root: 

13 &amp;ndash; ''dreizehn'' (irregular in English: '&lt;u&gt;thir&lt;/u&gt;teen')&lt;br&gt;
14 &amp;ndash; ''vierzehn''&lt;br&gt;
15 &amp;ndash; ''fünfzehn''&lt;br&gt;
16 &amp;ndash; ''sechzehn'' (note that the 's' in ''sechs'' is dropped and the 'ch' is pronounced like the 'ch' in ''ich'')&lt;br&gt;
17 &amp;ndash; ''siebzehn'' (note that the 'en' in ''sieben'' is dropped)&lt;br&gt;
18 &amp;ndash; ''achtzehn''&lt;br&gt;
19 &amp;ndash; ''neunzehn''

Above 19 the counting system is constant: add ''-zig'' (&quot;-ty&quot; in English) to the cardinal root. Thus, we get:

20 &amp;ndash; ''zwanzig''&lt;br&gt;
21 &amp;ndash; ''einundzwanzig'' (note: 'one-and-twenty')&lt;br&gt;
22 &amp;ndash; ''zweiundzwanzig'' (note: 'two-and-twenty')&lt;br&gt;

And the same for 30, 40, 50....etc.

30 &amp;ndash; ''dreißig'' (this is an exception to the -zig Rule)&lt;br&gt;
40 &amp;ndash; ''vierzig''&lt;br&gt;
50 &amp;ndash; ''fünfzig''&lt;br&gt;
60 &amp;ndash; ''sechzig''&lt;br&gt;
70 &amp;ndash; ''siebzig''&lt;br&gt;
80 &amp;ndash; ''achtzig''&lt;br&gt;
90 &amp;ndash; ''neunzig''&lt;br&gt;
100 &amp;ndash; ''hundert''

So, combining these, we get:

34&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; ''vierunddreißig'' (note: 'four-and-thirty')&lt;br&gt;
143 &amp;ndash; ''hundertdreiundvierzig'' (note: 'hundred-three-and-forty')&lt;br&gt;
170 &amp;ndash; ''hundertsiebzig''&lt;br&gt;
199 &amp;ndash; ''hundertneunundneunzig''

It would be excellent practice towards learning these numbers by counting (in German, of course) from 1 to 199&amp;mdash;or counting along any continuous sequence that comes to mind. For example, start with your age and count to 50 (count down if appropriate).

We can use these symbols to ask and answer simple problems in mathematics. Some of the examples that follow include first a question (''Frage'') and then the answer (''Antwort''):
  ''Wieviel ist sechs und sieben?''            How much is 6 and 7?   
     ''Sechs und sieben ist dreizehn''            6 and 7 is 13
  ''Wieviel ist fünfzig plus achtzehn?''       How much is 50 + 18?
     ''Fünfzig plus achtzehn ist gleich achtundsechzig''  50 + 18 = 68
  ''Wieviel ist siebzig minus zehn?''          How much is 70 - 10?
     ''Siebzig minus zehn ist gleich sechzig''     70 - 10 = 60
  ''Wieviel ist neun durch drei?''             How much is 9 divided by 3?
     ''Neun durch drei ist gleich drei''          9 &amp;divide; 3 = 3

== Hub Bearings ==

Over time the bearings in the hubs of a bicycle wheel may come out of adjustment causing the wheel to wobble from side to side (this can also be the result of the wheel being out of true; a sure sign of loose bearings is that the rim can be moved laterally in the fork by hand). Additionally, road dirt and moisture infiltrate the bearings, causing rough operation and premature wear. Even if these issues do not arise, the bearings' lubrication will eventually need to be replaced in order to maintain the life and health of the hubs. These problems can be addressed by overhauling the hubs. The basic techniques are similar to maintaining any other ball bearing assemblies, whether the headset or bottom bracket on the bike, or on complete different applications.

On some recent model mountain bikes, there has been a rash of rear hubs getting significant play after only a few rides; this may be due to bad cones or lock nuts.  The drive side lock nut should be your number one suspect in this case if the bike is new.

==Parts of the hub==
[[Image:Labeled Bicycle Hub Comparison-en.svg|right|thumb|A diagram showing two types of rear hubs: a freehub, and a threaded hub for freewheels.]]
From the inside out:
*Shell
*Bearing cup
*Bearings
*Bearing cone
*Dust cover
*Lock washer
*Lock nut
*Axle
*Quick release skewer

===Shell===
Main body of hub, holds the axle assembly and is the connection point for the spokes.

===Bearing Cup===
Is pressed into the shell.

===Bearing Cone===
Forms the outside bearing races, fits onto axle, usually adjustable.

===Bearings===
There are three major types of bearings in use on bicycle hubs:

====Cup and Cone types====
*Loose ball bearings are placed individually in the bearing race
*Caged bearings are simply loose ball bearings held in a framework, which simplifies their insertion in the hub. They differ from sealed, or cartridge, bearings in that the bearings are visible in a simple cage made of a circular piece of sheet metal with holes punched for the bearings, and the bearings can be inserted and replaced into the cage with simple hand tools, or even just with the fingers. Cup and cone bearing hubs also usually have some form of sealing but it is separate to the bearings.

====Cartridge type====
*Cartridge bearings are assembled and sealed in a permanently assembled cartridge, which renders them inaccessible. Cartridge bearings which have sealing have the advantage of being highly resistant to infiltration by dust and moisture, and usually needing no adjustment. They will generally last many years without service. If they do fail, they are simply replaced. Some hubs cannot be disassembled when the cartridge bearings are worn or fail; the more expensive ones can sometime be serviced by the manufacturer...

== Cleaning and repacking a traditional cone and cup front hub ==

*Place the wheel flat. Have something under the hub to catch loose bearings (unless you know for certain that they aren't loose). Usually, it does not matter which side of the wheel is up, however a few nonstandard axles have the cone on one side cast as an integral non-removable part of the axle and therefore the other cone must be on the top side for removal. This will be obvious to inspection.
*Using a box or cone wrench, unscrew the lock nut from the cone. It will be necessary to hold the cone from rotating while doing this; this will usually require a cone wrench, as the width of a normal open or adjustable wrench head is too great to fit on a normal cone. 
*Remove lock washer and any other hardware.
*Unscrew bearing cone
*Pry out circular dust cover situated above bearings (this may also be done after axle is removed, as is necessary on the bottom side of the wheel)
*Separate wheel and axle
At this point, depending on how the grease is distributed on the parts, the ball bearings may well stick to the axle, or drop out of the hub or into the axle hole through the hub, or remain in the cup. If the bearings are in a cage, they will generally remain in place unless the cage has been excessively worn.

It is advisable to leave the other cone and locknut assembly undisturbed in its position on the axle, as this will allow you to maintain the original side to side alignment of the axle assembly in the hub as much as possible. (Of course, this is mandatory where this assembly is not removable). It can be cleaned and greased in this condition. (If the cone is damaged, then it will need to be disassembled and replaced).
*Clean and inspect the bearings. Be prepared to replace any that are cracked or pitted. Most mechanics simply replace all loose bearings with new ones, as the cost is minimal compared to the labor involved in cleaning and examining old ones, and if the hub is reassembled with a bad or dirty ball it will rapidly wear. Similarly, caged bearings are usually replaced as a set, cage and all; in most cases, however, it is advantageous to replace caged bearings with loose bearings of the same size, as this results in a greater number of bearings in the hub, providing greater area and therefore greater resistance to wear, at the expense of only slightly more difficulty in keeping track of the bearings during assembly.
*Clean and inspect bearing cones. There should be no scratches or rough spots at all in the smooth track caused by the rolling bearings. A damaged cone can usually be replaced.
*Clean and inspect cups.
*The cup is factory pressed into the hub shell or sometimes cast as part of the shell, and is not generally user removable. Once again, the track of the rolling bearings should be completely free of scratches or rough spots. If the cup is damaged, sometimes a shop with a press can replace it. 
*Grease bearing cups
*Re-insert bearings, which should be held in place by the grease
*Put another layer of grease on top of the bearings
*Re-insert dust covers
*Re-assemble by reinserting axle from underside, and replacing the cone, washer(s) and lock nut on top.
*Adjust as necessary. For ball bearings the adjustment is somewhat particular; there should be no excessive drag from over tightening, but also no excessive play from looseness. Although the proper adjustment is pretty obvious by &quot;feel&quot;, tightening the locknut on the cone usually disturbs the adjustment enough to throw it off; therefore a bit of experience helps to estimate to what tightness the bearings should be adjusted, before tightening the locknut to produce the correct result afterwards. In practice, usually three wrenches are needed; one on the locknut, a cone wrench on the cone, and a third wrench on the locknut and cone assembly on the underside of the wheel, presumably firmly gripping the axle. This provides the ability to minutely tighten or loosen the top cone and locknut independently until the perfect tightness is achieved.

== Maintaining a cartridge bearing hub ==

[[Image:Cartridge_hub.png|right|thumb|An example of a cartridge hub]]

There are many different designs so this is just an overview of the basic principles that can be used to service most cartridge bearing hubs.

===Clean and lubricate bearings===

If you ride in wet conditions you may be able to extend the life of the bearings by periodically cleaning and lubricating them. In most circumstances this is not required and the bearing will have an acceptable life with no maintenance.
The idea is to remove one of the seals from the bearing so it can be cleaned and fresh grease applied.
*Typically the end caps block access to the seal so need to be removed. The method of attachment varies from hub to hub. Some just press on and can be pulled off by hand, others screw onto the axle and have flats for removal with a spanner or are held on by set screws. The end caps may also be part of the axle itself and the axle is removed by inserting an allen key into each end of the axle and unscrewing.

*Now there is access to the seal it is removed. This can be done by prying it out with a razor blade or small flat head screwdriver.

*Clean the bearing using degreaser and or rag.

*Apply fresh grease, a [[w:Grease_gun_(tool)|grease gun]] makes the job easier.

*Push the seal back into place and replace the end caps.

===Replace bearings===

Replacement bearings can be sourced from good bike shop or from any bearing supplier. Typically bearings are identified from the numbers on the side of the bearing, take the old bearings with you to make sure you get the correct replacements.

Removing old bearings.

* Remove end caps. Some just press on and can be pulled off by hand, others screw onto the axle and have flats for removal with a spanner or are held on by set screws. The end caps may also be part of the axle itself and the axle is removed by inserting an allen key into each end of the axle and unscrewing.

* Remove axle. Use a rubber mallet to hammer the axle out of the hub. The step on the axle will push one of the bearings out of the hub shell. Remove the bearing from the axle and use the axle to remove the other bearing from the hub shell.

* Some hubs do not use an axle with steps for the bearings to push against. These typically have a spacer instead. To remove the bearings push the spacer to the side and use a rubber mallet and a large flat head screwdriver to push the bearings out of the hub.

* Clean and inspect the hub shell and axle.

Installing new bearings.

Cartridge bearings are not good at absorbing side loads. When being pressed into the hub the force needs to be pushing on the outer metal ring to avoid damaging the bearing. A suitable sized [[w:Socket_wrench|socket]] can be used to do this.
[[Image:Cartridge_socket.png|right|thumb|Pressing in a cartridge bearing with socket]]
* Lightly grease hub shell and axle where bearing will sit.

* Press a bearing into one side of the hub shell. Use a rubber mallet and socket trying to keep the bearings as straight as possible.

* Insert the axle or spacer.

* Press the second bearing into the hub. The bearing should be pushed in far enough that there are no side loads on the bearing. With good quality hubs you should just be able to push it in all the way and have everything line up. Cheaper hubs may require care to avoid putting side loads on the bearing. If the hub has a spacer to help keep it lined up you can insert the axle part way into the underside of the hub.

* Put the end caps back on.
