== Notes ==

These planned articles are pitifully out of order &amp;ndash; I'd like them to be ordered by difficulty, and have one lead into the other, like an academic course would.

I also plan to use some of the content on [http://www.1ec5.org/mingerweb/viet/index.html Học với Tôi], one of my websites, in this textbook. As I understand it, doing so would not violate any copyrights or policies here at Wikibooks, because I'm the author of Học với Tôi.

If you speak Vietnamese, or have an understanding of Vietnamese culture, please help out with this textbook. I'm still learning Vietnamese (maybe you can tell by the quality of my translations), so I definitely can't do this by myself.

== My book ==

I also wrote a Vietnamese course [http://dohongnam.com/vn Let's Learn Vietnamese]

== Writing a course ==

Great that Wikibooks will now have a Vietnamese course! I'm looking forward to it. I will probably start learning Vietnamese next year.

Have you seen the article on creating a language course on Wikibooks? I think it's quite useful. Also, you may want to have a look at the course format I found works best for students: [[Bite-sized language lessons]]. Good luck!

== Continued updates? ==

Doesn't seem the material has been updated any time recently, so just wanted to do a shout out to let you authors know that there are those of us still interested in learning Vietnamese. Also believe my case is quite common: fluent Vietnamese speaker who can't write Viet and reads Viet using English phonetics (which is basically an educated guess most of the time... I can do it on the fly though ;D ), so if you folks could consider making a course for Native English speakers who know how to speak Viet but can't write or really read Viet, that would be great.

      <comment>/* Past tense */ Fix grammar.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Unlike Western languages, Vietnamese doesn't change the ending of the verb (that is, verbs don't conjugate) to express when the statement occurs (the statement's tense). Instead, Vietnamese relies on context to express tense. So, where textbooks for other languages will need to spend chapters and chapters, or pages and pages, to teach you how to change tense, we'll teach you in one page! See what we mean by [[Pros and cons#Pro: Vietnamese is simple.|simple]]?

==Tense words==

One way to do this is to add certain words either before the verb itself, or at the end of the sentence, or both:

===Present tense===
As in most languages, you don't have to do anything special for the present tense &amp;ndash; no words expressing tense need to be added. Example:

&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 200%; text-align: center&quot;&gt;
&lt;ruby lang=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;&lt;rb&gt;Tôi học&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;rt lang=&quot;en-us&quot;&gt;I study&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;/ruby&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

===Present progressive tense===
Place ''đang'' in front of the verb. Example:

&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 200%; text-align: center&quot;&gt;
&lt;ruby lang=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;&lt;rb&gt;Tôi&lt;/rb&gt; &lt;rb style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;đang&lt;/rb&gt; &lt;rb&gt;học&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;rt lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt; I am studying&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;/ruby&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

===Past tense===
Either place ''đã'' in front of the verb, or place ''rồi'' at the end of the sentence. You can use both, and it often sounds better when you do use both, but it's not necessary, because both words mean &quot;already.&quot; Example:

&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 200%; text-align: center&quot;&gt;
&lt;ruby lang=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;&lt;rb&gt;Anh&lt;/rb&gt; &lt;rb style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;đã&lt;/rb&gt; &lt;rb&gt;học&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;rt lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;He already studied&lt;/rt&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

can also be written as:

&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 200%; text-align: center&quot;&gt;
&lt;ruby lang=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;&lt;rb&gt;Anh học&lt;/rb&gt; &lt;rb style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;rồi&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;rt lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;He studied already&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;/ruby&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

Whereas English and many other languages have two past tenses &amp;ndash; the preterite and imperfect past &amp;ndash; Vietnamese has only one.

===Future tense===
Place ''sẽ'' (will, shall, is about to, plans to) in front of the verb. Example:

&lt;div style=&quot;font-size: 200%; text-align: center&quot;&gt;
&lt;ruby lang=&quot;vi&quot;&gt;&lt;rb&gt;Anh&lt;/rb&gt; &lt;rb style=&quot;font-weight: bold&quot;&gt;sẽ&lt;/rb&gt; &lt;rb&gt;học&lt;/rb&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;rt lang=&quot;en&quot;&gt;He will study&lt;/rt&gt;&lt;/ruby&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

==Time words==

There is another, more natural way of expressing tense. Just use words that express time in the sentence:

===Present tense===
Again, you don't have to do anything special here. But sometimes it's helpful to add ''hôm nay'' (today) at the beginning or end of the sentence, just to clear things up.

===Present progressive tense===
Place words like ''bây giờ'' (now) or phrases like ''ngay bây giờ'' (right now) at the beginning or end of the sentence.

===Past tense===
Place words like ''hôm qua'' (yesterday) at the beginning or end of the sentence, or words like ''mới'' (recently) right before the verb. You can do both, actually.

===Future tense===
Place words like ''ngày mai'' (tomorrow) at the beginning or end of the sentence.

==Context==

Although other methods of expressing tense also rely on context in the sentence, another way to express tense has to do with common sense. For example, in the sentence, . . .

''(More to come.)''

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{PSG}}
==Buoyancy==
'''Buoyancy''' is the force due to pressure differences on the top and bottom of an object under a fluid (gas or liquid).

Net force = buoyant force - force due to gravity on the object

== Bernoulli's Principle ==
Fluid flow is a complex phenomenon. An ideal fluid may be described as:

* The fluid flow is '''steady''' i.e its velocity at each point is constant with time.
* The fluid is '''incompressible'''. This condition applies well to liquids and in certain circumstances to gases.
* The fluid flow is '''non-viscous'''. Internal friction is neglected. An object moving through this fluid does not experience a retarding force. We relax this condition in the discussion of '''[[w:Stokes' Law|Stokes' Law]]'''.
* The fluid flow is '''irrotational'''. There is no angular momentum of the fluid about any point. A very small wheel placed at an arbitary point in the fluid does not rotate about its center. Note that if turbulence is present, the wheel would most likely rotate and its flow is then not irrotational.


As the fluid moves through a pipe of varying cross-section and elevation, the pressure will change along the pipe. The Swiss physicist [[w:Daniel Bernoulli|Daniel Bernoulli]] ([[w:1700|1700]]-[[w:1782|1782]]) first derived an expression relating the pressure to fluid speed and height. This result is a consequence of conservation of energy and applies to ideal fluids as described above.

''Consider an ideal fluid flowing in a pipe of varying cross-section. A fluid in a section of length ''&amp;Delta;''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' moves to the section of length ''&amp;Delta;''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' in time ''&amp;Delta;''t.''
The relation given  by Bernoulli is:


{{PSG/eq|&lt;math&gt;P + \frac{1}{2}\rho v^2 + \rho gh = K&lt;/math&gt;}}


[where: ''P'' is pressure at cross-section, ''K'' is a constant, ''h'' is height of cross-section, ''&amp;rho;'' is density, and ''v'' is velocity of fluid at cross-section.]


In words, the Bernoulli relation may be stated as:
''As we move along a streamline the sum of the pressure (P), the kinetic energy per unit volume and the potential energy per unit volume remains a constant.''

== Unix and Linux ==

=== Overview ===

Unix is the original Internet Operating System (NFS, TCP/IP, RPC, ...).
Linux is a Unix clone written from scratch by Linus Torvalds with assistance from a world wide team of developers across the Net.
Properties of both systems are:
* Portable, multi-user, multiprocessing
* Device-independent input/output
* Shared resources, high performance and highly secure
* Line commands
* GUI
Linux aims toward POSIX compliance and supports also other standard API's such as BSD and SVR4.
Linux has all the features you would expect in a modern Unix, including true multitasking/multiple-users, virtual memory, shared libraries, demand loading, shared copy-on-write executables, proper memory management and TCP/IP networking.

More and more companies and organizations are selecting Linux because of its performance, low cost, and royalty free license.

==== Unix and Linux ====

Unix is the original Internet Operating System written in 1970 developed at A&amp;T Bell Labs.
Distributed freely to government and universities.
Different entities did support different distributions.
* System V
* BSD
* SCO
Most varieties of Unix carry copyright licenses.

Linux was released in 1991 by Linus Torvalds.
The model of Linux licence is copy left from GPL.
Linux implement most of the System V and BSD Unix commands.
Use the man pages to determine the version.

==== Logging In and Out ====

The logging In session is the first step to access a Linux system.
You need a login ID and a password to be able to start using the system.
The login ID root is the super user ID that has all privileges, normally assigned to the System Administrator.
When a log in session is successful it will set some environment variables and start the shell that has been assigned to the login ID account.

Examples of variables set at log in time:
$HOME, $SHELL, $PATH, and more.
By changing the file /etc/login.defs the administrator can customize some login parameters and variables for all the users.

Examples of some of them:
 UID_MIN 500
 UID_MAX 60000
 UMASK 022
 ENV_PATH /usr/local/bin:/usr/bin:/bin
To logout use the exit or logout command.

==== Password ====

Nobody can see your password, not even the administrator.
To change passwords for users or groups, use passwd.

 passwd [options]

Common options:
* -l, -u : Lock and unlock an account.
* -g [| r]: Used for group. 
* -g set a password for group and -r removes it.
* -x|n : Maximum and minimum number of days a password remain valid.

As a general rule a password must:
* Have a minimum length
* Not contain any English language words
* Contain non-alphanumeric characters
* Contain a mixture of uppercase and lower case letters.

==== User information ====

For every user account, there is a line defined in the file &lt;tt&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/tt&gt;. The encrypted password is stored in &lt;tt&gt;/etc/shadow&lt;/tt&gt;. The format of &lt;tt&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/tt&gt; is:

 root:x:0:0:root:/root:/bin/bash
 bin:x:1:1:bin:/bin:/bin/bash
 daemon:x:2:2:Daemon:/sbin:/bin/bash
 yann:x:500:100:Yann Forget:/home/yann:/bin/bash

The x field is the old location for the password.

The format of &lt;tt&gt;/etc/shadow&lt;/tt&gt; is:

 root:IMXweyiV816gg:11996:0:10000::::
 bin:!*:8902:0:10000::::
 daemon:*:8902:0:10000::::
 yann:GoIM8j1S.IuTY:11996:0:99999:7:::

The * for the encrypted password means there is no password defined yet.
The ! Before the encrypted password means the account is locked.

==== Group information ====

For every group of users there is a line in file &lt;tt&gt;/etc/group&lt;/tt&gt;. The encrypted password is stored in &lt;tt&gt;/etc/gshadow&lt;/tt&gt;. The format of &lt;tt&gt;/etc/group&lt;/tt&gt; is:

 root:x:0:root
 bin:x:1:root,bin,daemon
 daemon:x:2:
 video:x:33:yann

The format of /etc/gshadow is:

 root:*:root:root
 bin:*:root:root
 daemon:*:root:root
 video:*:root:root,yann

Passwords for group are not often implemented since you have to pass to members of a group the password.

==== Misc. Commands ====

To get information on a logging In session, use id.

 id [options] [username]

Common options:
-g : Print only the group ID.
-u : Print only the user ID.

Example:

 $ id
 uid=0(root) gid=0(root) groups=0(root), 1(bin), 14(uucp), 15(shadow),16(dialout)

To run a shell with another user ID and group ID, use su.

 su [options] [username]

Common options:
-s : Select another shell.

Example:

 $ su toto
 passwd:

==== Shell ====

A Shell is a command line interpreter and:
* Prompts for commands.
* Interprets command which can include:
* I/O redirection, pipes, filename generation, etc.
* Executes commands.
* Executes scripting language.

There are several popular shells:
* sh: Bourne shell, the standard scripting shell.
* csh: Berkeley shell, job control, command history, alias.
* ksh: Korn shell, Bourne syntax with Berkeley features.
* bash: Bourne Again shell, free, Korn-like shell.
* t csh: Free, Berkeley clone with many extensions.

Most shells let you customize your prompt and environment.
For bash the prompt variable is PS1.
For bash the file that can be used for the customization of the environment are:
* .bashrc  Executed for each new bash session
* .bash_profile Executed at logging In time
* .bash_logout Executed at logging Out time

=== Exercises ===

* [[LPI Linux Certification/LPIC1 Exam 101/Exercises results|Exercises results]]

== Process text streams using filters ==

=== Overview ===

Description: ''Candidates should should be able to apply filters to text streams. Tasks include sending text files and output streams through text utility filters to modify the output, and using standard UNIX commands found in the GNU textutils package.''

Key &lt;b&gt;files&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; terms&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;tt&gt; utilities&lt;/tt&gt; include:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;cat&lt;br&gt;
cut&lt;br&gt;
expand&lt;br&gt;
fmt&lt;br&gt;
head&lt;br&gt;
join&lt;br&gt;
nl&lt;br&gt;
od&lt;br&gt;
paste&lt;br&gt;
pr&lt;br&gt;
sed&lt;br&gt;
sort&lt;br&gt;
split&lt;br&gt;
tac&lt;br&gt;
tail&lt;br&gt;
tr&lt;br&gt;
unexpand&lt;br&gt;
uniq&lt;br&gt;
wc&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;

=== Pattern matching and wildcards ===

Wildcard is a pattern matching mechanism for filenames.
The purpose of wildcard is to increase productivity:
Locate files that you don't fully remember.
Locate files that have something in common.
Work with a group of files rather than individual.

The shell interprets these special characters:
 ! @ # $ % ^ &amp; * ( ) { } [ ] | \ ; ~ ' &quot; ` ?

The characters used for wildcard are:
 ?  *  [  ]  ~

If you use the wildcard characters the shell will try to generate a file from them.
Try the following:
 echo all files *

Special wildcard characters
 ? match any one character.
 * Any string
 [abcfghz] One char set
 [a-z] One char in range
 [!x-z] Not in set
 ~ Home directory
 ~user User home directory

Examples:
 ? One character filenames only
 [aA]??? Four characters, starting with a or A.
 ~toto pathname of toto home directory
 [!0-9]* All string not starting with a number.

What about these commands?
 ls [a-z][A-Z]??.[uk]
 ls big*
 ls a???a
 ls ??*

=== Shell and wildcards ===

A shell command line can be a simple command or more complex.
 ls -l [fF]*
 ls *.c | more
 ls -l [a-s]* | mail `users`

The first event in the shell is to interpret wildcards.
Only the shell interprets unquoted wildcards.

=== Quoting and Comments ===

==== Quoting ====

Do quote to prevent the shell to interpret the special characters and to transform multiple words into one shell word.

* 'string' Nearly everything within the quote is literal:
 echo 'He did it, &quot;Why?&quot;'
 echo 'Because &quot;#@&amp;^:-)&quot;'
 echo '$VAR='Me

* &quot;string&quot; Like 'string' but interprets $, \, !:
 echo &quot;What's happening?&quot;
 echo &quot;I don't know but check this $ANSWER&quot;

* The backslash \ treats the following character as literal:
 echo \$VAR=Me
 echo What\'s happening\?

* How could we display the backslash?  With the following line:
 echo \\

==== Comments ====

You can add comments in a command line or a script.
Use the character #.
A white space must immediately precede #.

Examples:
 echo $HOME # Print my Home directory
 echo &quot;### PASSED ###&quot; # Only this part is a comment
 echo The key h#, not g was pressed.

== Perform basic file management ==

=== Overview ===

Description: ''Candidates should be able to use the basic UNIX commands to copy, move, and remove files and directories. Tasks include advanced file management operations such as copying multiple files recursively, removing directories recursively, and moving files that meet a wildcard pattern. This includes using simple and advanced wildcard specifications to refer to files, as well as using find to locate and act on files based on type, size, or time.''

Key &lt;b&gt;files&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; terms&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;tt&gt; utilities&lt;/tt&gt; include:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;cp&lt;br&gt;
find&lt;br&gt;
mkdir&lt;br&gt;
mv&lt;br&gt;
ls&lt;br&gt;
rm&lt;br&gt;
rmdir&lt;br&gt;
touch&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;file globbing&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;

cp: Copy files and directories.
ls: List directory contents.

=== Create and Remove directories ===

To create a directory, use mkdir.

 mkdir [options] dir

Common options:
 -m  mode: set permission mode. Default use umask.
 -p  parent: create parent directory as needed.

Examples:
 mkdir -m 0700 bin
 mkdir -p bin/system/x86

To delete an empty directory, use rmdir.

 rmdir [options] dir

Common options:
 -p  parent: remove empty subdirectories.

Examples:
 rmdir  tmp
 rmdir -p bin/system/x86

=== Copy files and directories ===
To copy one file to another, or to a directory, use cp.

 cp [options] source target

Source and target can be a file or a directory.

Common options:
 -i  interactive: prompt to overwrite
 -r  recursive: copy the subdirectories and contents. Use -R for special files.
 -f  force: force the overwriting

The default is to silently clobber the target file.
Does not alter the source.

Examples:
 cp *.[a-z] /tmp
 cp readme readme.orig
 cp  ls /bin
 cp -ri bin/* /bin

=== Move &amp; Rename files ===

To rename a file or directory or to move a file or directory to another location, use mv.
 mv [options] source target
Source and target can be a file or a directory.

Common options:
 -i  interactive: prompt to overwrite
 -f  force: force the overwriting
 -v verbose
The default is to silently clobber the target file.

Examples:
 mv *.[a-z] /tmp
 mv readme readme.orig
 mv ls /bin
 mv -fi bin/* /bin

=== Listing filenames and information ===

The command to list files in the current directory is ls.
 ls [options] [filenames]
Common options are:
 -l for a long format
 -F Append a file type character
 -a All files, including hidden
 -R Recursive listing of subtree
 -d Do not descend into directory

The ls is equivalent to the dir command on DOS.

Examples of ls output:
 $ ls -l /bin/ls
 -rwxr-xr-x    1   root  root  46784 mar 23  2002 /bin/ls
 $ ls -ld /bin
 drwxr-xr-x    2 root   root   2144 nov  5 11:55 /bin
 $ ls -a .
 .bash_history .bash_profile .bashrc ...
 $ ls -dF /etc .bashrc /bin/ls
 .bashrc  /bin/ls*  /etc/

=== File types ===

The long format means:
 $ ls -l /etc/hosts    #List a long format of the file hosts
 -rw-r—r-- 1 root root 677 Jul 5 22:18 /etc/hosts
File content and location
Linux/Unix does not distinguish file by filename extension, like Windows.
To determine the file content use file.
 $ file /etc .bashrc /bin/ls /dev/cdrom
 /etc:       directory
 .bashrc:    ASCII English text
 /bin/ls:    ELF 32-bit LSB executable, Intel 80386, version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked (uses shared libs), stripped
 /dev/cdrom: symbolic link to /dev/hdc

To determine if a command is a built-in shell command or a program, use type, and use which to find its location.
 $ type cp cd ls which type
 cp is /bin/cp
 cd is a shell builtin
 ls is aliased to `ls $LS_OPTIONS'
 which is aliased to `type -p'
 type is a shell builtin
 $ which cut
 /usr/bin/cut

=== Creating and using filenames ===

Filenames can be created with:
* I/O redirection
 cat chapter1 chapter2 &gt; book
* An editor, such as vi.
 vi mynewfile
* Many of the Unix utlities
 cp file newfile
* An application
 netscape
* The touch command, which creates empty files (or updates the &quot;date modified&quot; of existing files)
 touch memo

The valid filename may have:
* Maximum 255 characters per filename
* Case sensitive 'A' and 'a' are different
* Any character except forward '/'
* Recommended alphanumeric characters as well as plus, minus, and underscore characters.
* Characters to avoid
* Hypen character.
* touch my-file -lt
* White space.
 touch more drink
 touch &quot;more drink&quot;
* Most other special characters !@#$%^&amp;*():;&quot;'}{|\&lt;,&gt;.?~`
 touch memo*

=== Remove files or directories ===

To remove files or subtree directories, use rm.
 rm [options] files
Files can be a file or a directory.

Common options:
 -i  interactive: prompt to for each removal
 -f  force: force the overwriting
 -r recursive: remove subtree directories and contents
There is no unremove or undelete command.

Examples:
 rm *.[a-z]
 rm readme readme.orig
 rm  ls /bin
 rm -rfi /bin
 cd; rm -rf *  .* # !! this removes all files of in the home directory of the current user, as well as those in the subdirectories !!

=== Locating files in a subtree directory ===

To search for a file in a subtree directory, use find.
 find [subtrees] [conditions] [actions]
The command can take multiple conditions and will search recursively in the subtree.

Some  possible conditions are:
 -name [FNG] # Search fo the FNG name
 -type c  # Type of file [bcdfl]
 -size [+-]# # Has a +- size in blocks (c:bytes,k:kilo)
 -user [name] # Own by user
 -atime [+-]# # Accessed days ago +n means not been accessed for the last n days -n means been accessed the last ndays.
 -mtime [+-]# # Modified days ago
 -perm nnn # Has permision flags nnn 
Some  possible actions are:
 -print  # Print the pathname
 -exec cmd {} \; # Execute cmd on the file
 -ok cmd {} \; # Same as -exec but ask first

Examples
 find . -name '*.[ch]' -print
 find /var /tmp . -size +20 -print
 find ~ -type c -name '*sys*' -print
 find / -type f -size +2c -exec rm -i {} \;
 find / -atime -3 -print
 find ~jo ~toto -user chloe -exec mv {} /tmp \;

To locate a binary, source file, or man pages, use whereis.
 Whereis [options]
Common options:
 -b: Search only for binaries.
 -m: Search only for manual sections.
 -s: Search only for sources.
Examples:
 $ whereis host
 host: /usr/bin/host /etc/host.conf /usr/share/man/man1/host.1.gz
 $ whereis -m host
 host: /usr/share/man/man1/host.1.gz

To locate a file located somewhere defined by the PATH variable, use which.
 $ which -a ls
 /bin/ls
The -a will look for all possible matches in PATH, not just for the first one.

== Use streams, pipes, and redirects ==

=== Overview ===

Description: ''Candidates should be able to redirect streams and connect them in order to efficiently process textual data. Tasks include redirecting standard input, standard output, and standard error, piping the output of one command to the input of another command, using the output of one command as arguments to another command and sending output to both stdout and a file.''

Key &lt;b&gt;files&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; terms&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;tt&gt; utilities&lt;/tt&gt; include:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;tee&lt;br&gt;
xargs&lt;br&gt;
&lt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;&lt;&lt;br&gt;
&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|&lt;br&gt;
` `&lt;/tt&gt;

=== Standard input and standard output ===

For each command executed in a terminal, there are:
a standard input value 0. (default keyboard)
a standard output value 1.(default terminal)
and a standard output for the errors value 2. (default terminal).

Each channel can also be identified by an address:
&amp;0 for input,
&amp;1 for output, 
And &amp;2 for errors.

Each channel [n] can be redirected.
[n]&lt; file: Default value of n is 0 and it reads standard input from file.
[n]&gt; file: Default value is 1 and it sends standard output to file, overwriting the file if it exists. (clobber)
[n]&gt;&gt;file: Default value is 1 and it appends standard output to file.
&lt;&lt;word: Read standard input until word is reached.
`command`: Substitute the command name by the result.

Examples:

 $ pwd &gt; file  # out=file in=none error=terminal.

 cat chap* &gt;book # out=book in=none error=terminal.

 mv /etc/* . 2&gt;error # out=terminal in=none error=error.

 echo end of file &gt;&gt; book # out=book in=none error=terminal.

 set -o noclobber # Shell does not clobber existing files.

 ls &gt; list 2&gt;&amp;1 # ls and errors are redirected to list.

 ls 2&gt;&amp;1 &gt; list # Errors are redirected to standard output and ls output is redirected to list.

 cat `ls /etc/*.conf` &gt; conffile 2&gt;&gt;/tmp/errors

''Concatenate all the configuration files from /etc dir in  conffile and append errors in file /tmp/errors.''

Redirecting with pipes

Pipes are an efficient way to  apply multiple commandes concurrently.

 command1 | command2

The standard output of command1 will be piped to the standard input of command2.
The standard error is not piped.

Examples:
 ls -l /dev | more
 ls -l /etc/*.conf | grep user | grep 500
 ls -l /bin | mail `users`

To redirect the standard output to a file and to the terminal at the same time, use tee.
 ls -l /dev | tee file
 ls -l /etc | tee -a file # Append to the file

Building arguments

The xargs utility constructs an argument list for a command using standard input.

 xargs [options] [command]

The xargs command creates an argument list for command from standard input. It is typically used with a pipe.

Common options:
-p: prompt the user before executing each command.

Examples:
 ls f* | xargs cat # Print to standard output the content of all files starting with f.
 find ~ -name 'proj1*' print | xargs cat

''Search in the Home directory for files starting with proj1 and send it to the standard input of cat.''

Use the /dev/null device file to discard output or error messages.

Try the following:
 grep try /etc/*
 grep try /etc/* 2&gt; /dev/null
 grep try /etc/* &gt; /dev/null 2&gt; /dev/null

=== Exercises ===

# Create a file list.bin that will contain all the filenames from /bin directory.
# Write a command that will append the list of files from /usr/local/bin to the file named list.bin and discard any error output.
# Split list.bin file into files that are 50 lines long and remove list.bin.
# From the splitted files create back list.bin. but with inversed order.
# Simplify the following commands:
 ls *.c | xargs rm
 ls [aA]* | xargs cat
 cat `ls *.v` 2&gt;/dev/null
# Use find to do the following command:
 more `ls *.c`
# Write a command that will create a file list.sbin with the contents of /sbin and at the same time display it to standard output.
# Create a file that within the filename you include the creation time.
# Create a file that will contain all the filename in reverse order with extension .conf from the /etc directory.

== Create, monitor, and kill processes ==

=== Overview ===

Description: ''Candidates should be able to manage processes. This includes knowing how to run jobs in the foreground and background, bring a job from the background to the foreground and vice versa, start a process that will run without being connected to a terminal and signal a program to continue running after logout. Tasks also include monitoring active processes, selecting and sorting processes for display, sending signals to processes, killing processes and identifying and killing X applications that did not terminate after the X session closed.''

Key &lt;b&gt;files&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; terms&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;tt&gt; utilities&lt;/tt&gt; include:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;&amp;&lt;br&gt;
bg&lt;br&gt;
fg&lt;br&gt;
jobs&lt;br&gt;
kill&lt;br&gt;
nohup&lt;br&gt;
ps&lt;br&gt;
top&lt;/tt&gt;

=== Create processes ===

A running application is a process.
Every processes have:
A process ID.
A parent process ID.
A current directory PWD.
A file descriptor table.
A program which it is executing.
Environment variables,  inherited from its parent process.
Stdin, stdou, and stderr
Other

Bash is a program that when it is executed becomes a process.
Each time you execute a command in a shell a new process is created.
Except for the buil-in shell command. They run in the shell context. Use type to check if a command is a built-in shell command.

Example
type cp ls which type
Monitor processes
Once the system is up and running from a terminal it is possible to see which processes are running with the ps program.
To display a long format of all the processes in the system, do:

 ps -Al
 F S   UID   PID  PPID  C PRI  NI ADDR SZ WCHAN  TTY          TIME CMD
 004 S     0     1     0  0  80   0 -   112 do_sel ?        00:00:04 init
 004 S     0   381     1  0  80   0 -   332 do_sel ?        00:00:00 dhcpcd
 006 S     0  1000     1  0  80   0 -   339 do_sel ?        00:00:00 inetd
 044 R     0  1524  1222  0  79   0 -   761 -      pts/3    00:00:00 ps

The ps program will display all the processes running and their PID numbers and other information.
To see a long format of the processes in your login session, do a:

 ps -l
 F S   UID   PID  PPID  C PRI  NI ADDR SZ WCHAN  TTY          TIME CMD
 000 S   500  1154  1139  0  80   0 -   724 wait4  pts/1    00:00:00 bash

 040 R   500  1442  1435  0  79   0 -   768 -      pts/4    00:00:00 ps
 F: Process Flags 002: being created, 040: forked but didn't exec, 400: killed by a signal.
 S: Process States: R: runnable, S: sleeping, Z: zompbie
 UID: User ID, PID: Process ID, PPID: Parent Process ID, C: Scheduler, PRI: priority
 NI: Nice value, SZ: size of routine, WCHAN: name of routine

=== Monitor processes ===

To monitor the processes in real-time, use top.

RSS: The total amount of physical memory used by the task.
SHARE: The amount of shared memory used by the task.
%CPU: The task's share of  the  CPU  time.
%MEM: The task's share of the physical memory.
Once top is running it is also possible to execute interactive commands:
Type N to sort tasks by pid.
Type A to sort tasks by age (newest first).
Type P to sort tasks by CPU usage.
Type M to sort tasks by memory usage.
Type k to kill a process (prompted for pid).

=== Kill processes ===

The ps program will display all the processes running and their PID numbers.
Once the PID is known, it is possible to send signals to the process.
SIGSTOP to stop a process.
SIGCONT to continue a stopped process.
SIGKILL to kill a process.

The program to send a signal to a process is called kill.

 kill -SIGKILL [pid]
 kill -63 [pid]
 kill -l

By default a process is started in foreground and it is the only one to receive keyboard input. Use CTRL+Z to suspend it.

To start a process in backgroud use the &amp;.
 bash &amp;
 xeyes &amp;

Job control

In a bash process it is possible to start multiple jobs.
The command to manipulate jobs are:
 jobs   # List all the active jobs
 bg %job  # Resume job in background
 fg %job  # Resume job in foreground
 kill %job # Kill background job

When bash is terminated all processes that have been started from the session will receive the SIGHUP signal.
This will by default terminate the process.

To prevent the termination of a process, the program can be started with the nohup command.

 nohup mydaemon

== Modify process execution priorities ==

=== Overview ===

Description: ''Candidates should should be able to manage process execution priorities. Tasks include running a program with higher or lower priority, determining the priority of a process and changing the priority of a running process.''

Key &lt;b&gt;files&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; terms&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;tt&gt; utilities&lt;/tt&gt; include:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;nice&lt;br&gt;
ps&lt;br&gt;
renice&lt;br&gt;
top&lt;/tt&gt;

=== Priorities ===

To start a command with an adjusted priority, use nice.&lt;br /&gt;
'''nice -n +2 [command]'''&lt;br /&gt;
'''nice -n -19 [command]'''&lt;br /&gt;
The program '''nice''' changes the base time quantum of the scheduler.&lt;br /&gt;
i.e. it informs the scheduler how important a process is, which is used as a guide to how much CPU time to give it.&lt;br /&gt;

For example if you wanted to listen to music whilst ripping another CD, you could use '''nice -n +5 oggenc''', you shouldn’t get any “hops” in the music playback, as the scheduler “knows” the oggenc process is less important. &lt;br /&gt;

The value can go from -19 (highest priority) to +20 (lowest priority).&lt;br /&gt;
The default value is 0. Only root can set a value below zero.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
To modify the priority of a running program, use renice.&lt;br /&gt;
'''renice +1 -u root'''&lt;br /&gt; # Change the priority for all root processes.&lt;br /&gt;
'''renice +2 -p 193 '''&lt;br /&gt; # Change the priority for PID 193&lt;br /&gt;

5) Do a print from ps formated as: “username”, “command”, “nice value”
6) Kill all the process called “bash” and owned by user polto..

== Regular Expression ==

=== Overview ===

Description: ''Candidates should be able to manipulate files and text data using regular expressions. This objective includes creating simple regular expressions containing several notational elements. It also includes using regular expression tools to perform searches through a filesystem or file content.''

Key &lt;b&gt;files&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; terms&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;tt&gt; utilities&lt;/tt&gt; include:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;grep&lt;br&gt;
regexp&lt;br&gt;
sed&lt;/tt&gt;

=== Pattern matching ===

There are two kinds of pattern matching:
* Wildcards (File Name Generation)
* Regexp (Regular Expression)

Wildcard characters  are mainly applied when they are used in the current directory or subdirectories.
When wildcard characters *, ?, [ - ], ~, and ! are used in regexp they no longer generate filenames.

Some of the utilities that use regexp are:
* grep, egrep
* vi
* more
* sed
* Perl

Limited regexp search pattern
Used by all utilities using regexp.

* Any 1 char  . Ab.a  Abla or Abca
* 1 char set  [   ] Ab[sd]a  Absa or Abda only
* 1 char range [ - ] Ab[a-z]a  Abaa or Abba or ...
* Not in set  [^ ] Ab[^0-9]a  Abaa or Abba or ...
* 0 or more  * Ab*a  Absala or Aba or ...
* Begin line  ^ ^Aba  Line starts&gt;Aba
* End line  $ Aba$  Aba&lt;line ends
* Literal  \ Aba\$  Aba$

Example:
 Ab[0-3]s
 ^Ab\^bA
 [01]bin$
 ^..\\
 [^zZ]oro

Combinations of limited regexp
Combinations used by all utilities using regexp.

* Any string  .* Ab.*a  Abrahma or Abaa or ...
* String from  [   ]* th[aersti]* There or This or ...
* Multi range  [ - - ] Ab[0-2][a-c]a Ab0aa or Ab1aa or ...
* Match \  \\ \\[a-zA-Z]* \Bethoven

Examples: 
 Ab[0-3][a-z]s
 ...$
 ^[01]\^2
 [0-9][a-z] \$
 [a-zA-Z]*
 ^[^c-zC-Z]*
 ^[a-zA-Z0-9]$

Modifier patterns
Replace strings matched by regexp patterns

* Match m  \{m\}  b[0-9]\{3\} b911
* One or more \{m,\}  b[0-9]\{2,\} b52
* Up to n  \{m,n\}  b[0-9]\{2,4\} b1234
* Begining of word \&lt;  \&lt;wh  where
* End of word \&gt;  [0-9]\&gt;  bin01

=== grep ===

To find text in a file, use grep.

 grep [options] [string] [files]

Best to quote the string to prevent interpretation.

Common options:
-i: Ignore case
-l: List filename only if at least one matches
-c: Display only count of matched lines
-n: Also display line number
-v: Must not match.

Examples:
 grep host /etc/*.conf
 grep -l '\&lt;mai' /usr/include/*.h
 grep -n toto /etc/group
 grep -vc root /etc/passwd
 grep '^user' /etc/passwd
 grep '[rR].*' /etc/passwd
 grep '\&lt;[rR].*' /etc/passwd

=== sed ===

To apply a command on a stream, use sed.

 sed [address1][,address2][!]command[options] [files...]

The program sed will  apply a command from address1 to address2 in a file.
The address1 and address2 format are regular expressions.
The sed program is a noninteractive editing tool.

Examples:
 sed '1,3s/aa/bb/g' file # Replace in file from line 1 to 3 aa by bb.
 sed '/here/,$d' file # Delete line from here to the end.
 sed '/here/d' file # Delete lines with word here.
 sed '1,/xxx/p' file # Print lines from 1 to xxx.
 sed '/ll/,/ff/!s/maison/house/g' file # In file replace words maison by house excluding lines from ll to ff.

# List in etc/ directory all the files that contain numerical characters.
# Print with ls only the directory names in /. 
# Do “ps -aux” and replace user r_polto by root and print it in to a file called new_process.txt
# List all process called apache and owned by a usernames starting by “p” or “P”..

== Perform basic file editing using vi ==

=== Overview ===

Description: ''Candidates should be able to edit text files using vi. This objective includes vi navigation, basic vi nodes, inserting, editing, deleting, copying, and finding text.''

Key &lt;b&gt;files&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; terms&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;tt&gt; utilities&lt;/tt&gt; include:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;vi&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;i&gt;/, ?&lt;br&gt;
h,j,k,l&lt;br&gt;
G, H, L&lt;br&gt;
i, c, d, dd, p, o, a&lt;br&gt;
ZZ, :w!, :q!, :e!&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;:!&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;br&gt;

=== vi ===

When using X-Windows, you can use mouse oriented editors such as xedit.
In a cross-development environment, users use their favorite editor.
On a non-windowing system, you only need a keyboard editor such as vi.
The vi editor on Linux is the same as on any Unix systems.
vi has two modes:
* Command mode: Anything you type will be interpreted as a command
* Input mode: Anything you type will be inserted into the file
Transition from one mode to another
Command mode to Input mode: i, I, a, A, o, O keys
Input mode to Command mode: ESC key
The default starting mode is the Command mode
The file configuration .exrc can be created in your HOME directory to setup some vi behavior.
 set ignorecase # No case-sensitive
 set tabs=3 # 3 space for tab character

Perform basic file editing using vi

Enter Input Mode
* i before cursor
* I at start of line
* a after cursor
* A at end of line
* o open line below
* O open line above

Delete
* dw delete word
* dd delete line
* D delete to end of line
* x delete char at cursor

Move cursor
* l one space right
* h one space left
* j one line down
* k one line up
* $ end of line
* ^ start of line
* w next word
* e end of word

=== Exercices ===

# Use &lt;tt&gt;vi&lt;/tt&gt; from any directory to begin editing an empty buffer.
# Enter a few lines of text into this buffer.
# Save the contents of the buffer to the directory.
# Open the file again with &lt;tt&gt;vi&lt;/tt&gt;.
# Create a new line beneath what you typed earlier. (Don't use &lt;tt&gt;i&lt;/tt&gt; from command mode!)
# Exit &lt;tt&gt;vi&lt;/tt&gt; without saving these changes.

== Create partitions and filesystems ==

=== Overview ===

Description: ''Candidates should be able to configure disk partitions and then create filesystems on media such as hard disks. This objective includes using various mkfs commands to set up partitions to various filesystems, including ext2, ext3, reiserfs, vfat, and xfs.''

Key &lt;b&gt;files&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; terms&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;tt&gt; utilities&lt;/tt&gt; include:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;fdisk&lt;br&gt;
mkfs&lt;/tt&gt;

=== Partitions ===

Media can be divided into partitions.
Partitions are usually created at installation time but can also be created with the fdisk program or other utilities.
This will divide the media in partitions and different filesystems can be built and different operating systems can be installed.

IDE is recognized as follows:

* Primary Master:
::/dev/hda  : Full disk
::/dev/hda1: First partition
::/dev/hda2: Second partition
* Primary Slave: /dev/hdb
* Secondary Master: /dev/hdc
* Secondary Slave: /dev/hdd

SCSI is recognized as follows:

* ID1:
::/dev/sda: Full disk
::/dev/sda1: First partition
*ID2: /dev/sdb

USB and FireWire disks are recognized as SCSI disks.

Once it is partitioned it is possible to build a filesystem on every partition.

=== Filesystems ===

Filesystems exist to allow you to store, retrieve and manipulate data on a media.
Filesystems maintain an internal data structure (meta-data) that keeps all you data organized and accessible.
The structure of this meta-data gives the characteristic of the filesystem.
A filesystem is accessed by a driver through the organized meta-data structure.
When Linux boots it reads in /etc/fstab all the filesystems that needs to be mounted and checks if they are in an usable state.

When a power failure occurs Linux won't be able to unmout the filesystem properly and some data in the cache won't be synchronized on the media.
The meta-data may be corrupted.

Once you reboot the system, it will detect this and do a fsck to the full meta-data structure for a consistency check.
This can take a very long time. Few minutes to few hours in proportion of the media size.
Journaling a filesystem is adding a new data structure called a journal.
This journal is on-disk and before each modification to the meta-data is made by the driver it is first written into the journal.
Before each meta-data modification the journal maintains a log of the next operation.

Now, when a power failure occurs there is only the need to check the journal.
A journaling filesystem recovery is very fast. It just needs to go through the logs and fix the latest operation.
Journaling filesystem recovery can take only few seconds.

On a cluster systems, journaling allows to quickly recover a shared partition of a node that went down.

=== Linux filesystems ===

* ext2: Old very stable Linux filesystem. Efficient for files larger than ~2-3K.
* ext3: Journaling extension for ext2. Possible to move a filesystem back and forth between ext2 and ext3.
* Reiserfs: Journaling filesystem. 8-15 time faster than ext2 when manipulating small files.
* XFS: A powerfull journaling filesystem with possible quota and ACL
* Msdos: MS-Windows FAT filesystem type. (mainly used for floppy)
* Vfat: MS-Windows FAT filesystem type. (mainly used for large hdd partitions)
* NTFS (ReadOnly but loop files): MS-Windows journaling filesystem
* SMBFS: A filesystem to mount windows or samba sharing from Linux
* NFS: Network File System
...

=== Filesystem tree ===

A Linux file system has one top directory called root (/) where all sub directories of the entire system is stored.
The sub directories can be another partition, a remote directory, or a remote partition accessible through the network with NFS protocol.

=== Create filesystems ===

To create a file system on a partition, use mkfs.

 mkfs [options] -t [fstype] device [blocksize]

Common options:
:-t: fstype: File system type.
:-c : Check the device for bad blocks before building the filesystem.

The full partition will be erased and organized to the type of filesystem requested. There is no undo command.
The fstype possible are:
msdos, ext2, ext3, reiserfs,minix,xfs

The blocksize allows to customize the block size for your filesystem.

Examples:
 mkfs -t msdos /dev/fd0
 mkfs -t reiserfs /dev/hdd1  4096

==== Create extended filesystems ====

To create a extended (ext2, ext3) filesystem on an partition, use mke2fs.

 mke2fs [options] device [blocksize]

Common options:
:-b: Specify the block sizefstype: File system type.
:-c : Check the device for bad blocks before building the filesystem.
:-j: Create the filesystem with an ext3 journal.
:-L: Set the volume label for the filesystem.

With mke2fs it is possible to store the super-block the journal information on another device.
Examples:

 mkefs -b 2048 /dev/fd0 -L floppy
 mkfs -V
 mke2fs 1.26 (3-Feb-2002) Using EXT2FS Library version 1.263

=== Monitoring disk usage ===

To print the disk usage, use du.

 du [options] [files...]

Common options:
:-a: All files not just directories
:-b: Print size in bytes
:-c: Total
:-h: Human readable format. (1K, 20M,...)

Examples:

 $ du -ch Documents
 112k    Documents/Cours/LPI101
 4.0k    Documents/Cours/LPI102
 4.0k    Documents/Cours/LPI201
 4.0k    Documents/Cours/LPI202
 124k    total

 du -sk ~ # Sums up your total disk usage in kilobytes

 du -ak ~ | sort -n more # Display every file and its disk space in numerical order.

=== Filesystem disk space ===

A filesystem is composed of a meta-data structure plus a list of blocks.
To print the filesystem disk space usage, use df.

 df [options] [files...]

Common options:
:-a: All included filesystems with 0 blocks.
:-t: Limit listing to a filesystem type.
:-h: Human readable format. (1K, 20M,...)

Examples:

 $ df -t reiserfs -h
 F           1k-blocks      Used Available Use% Mounted on
 /dev/hda3             28771528   3121536  25649992  11% /

 $ df -t ext2 -h
 Filesystem            Size  Used Avail Use% Mounted on
 /dev/hda1              15M  3.8M   10M  27% /boot

=== Dumping extended filesystems info ===

To print the super block and blocks group information of an extended filesystem, use dumpe2fs.

 dumpe2fs [options] device

Common options:
:-b: print the bad blocks of the filesystem.
:-h: Display only the superblock information.

Example:
 dumpe2fs -h /dev/fd0

== Attach and detach filesystems ==

* Control mounting and unmounting filesystems

=== Overview ===

Description: ''Candidates should be able to configure the mounting of a filesystem. This objective includes the ability to manually mount and unmount filesystems, configure filesystem mounting on bootup, and configure user mountable removable filesystems such as tape drives, floppies, and CDs.''

Key &lt;b&gt;files&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; terms&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;tt&gt; utilities&lt;/tt&gt; include:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;/etc/fstab&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;mount&lt;br&gt;
umount&lt;/tt&gt;

=== Attach a filesystem ===

The mount command serves to attach the file system found on some  device to the big file tree.

 mount [options]
 mount [options] [-t vfstype] [-o options] device dir

If the device or directory is listed in /etc/fstab you can use the following:

 mount [options] [-o options [,...]] device | dir

Normally only root has the priviledge to mount devices unless it is specified in the /etc/fstab file.
Examples:
 # Print all the mounted filesystems (/etc/mtab).
 mount

 # Mount devices or dirs listed in /etc/fstab.
 mount -a

 # Mount /dev/hdc partition in read only mode without updating /etc/mtab.
 mount -n -o ro /dev/hdc /mnt

 # Allow a user to mount the CDROM if the following line is in /etc/fstab:
 # /dev/cdrom /media/cdrom iso9660 ro,user,noauto,unhide
 mount /media/cdrom 
 mount /dev/cdrom

 # Sync in realtime
 mount -o sync /dev/sdb1 /mnt/usb

=== Detach a filesystem ===

To detach a filesystem from the file tree, use umount.

 umount [options]
 umount [options] [-o options [,...]] device | dir

A busy filesystem cannot be unmounted.
* Open files
* Working directory of a process.

Examples:
 umount -a # Unmount devices or dirs listed in /etc/fstab.
 umount /mnt # Unmount the filesystem attached to /mnt.
 umount /media/cdrom  # Allow a user to unmount the CDROM if the following line is in /etc/fstab:
 /dev/cdrom  /media/cdrom  iso9660  ro,user,noauto,unhide

=== File system information ===

The file /etc/fstab contains all the file sytems and related information that will be used when doing a mount -a. (Boot time)

The file /etc/mtab is maintained by the kernel and keeps track on what is or isn't mounted.
The /etc/fstab format is:

 #Device     Mount point    Fs type  Options             1 2
 /dev/hda3   /              reiserfs defaults            1 2
 /dev/hda1   /boot          ext2     defaults            1 2
 /dev/cdrom  /media/cdrom   auto     ro,noauto,user,exec 0 0
 usbdevfs    /proc/bus/usb  usbdevfs noauto              0 0
 /dev/hda2   swap           swap     pri=42              0 0

Common options:
:ro:      read only
:noauto:  Don't mount automatically
:exec:    Can execute binary on the filesystem
:suid:    Allow to setuser bit
:user:    Allow a user to mount/unmount it
:unhide:  hidden file visible
:async:   All operations will be done asynchronously
:default: rw, suid, dev, exec, auto, nouser, and async

#* Use tar to view the contents of the floppy..

== Managing disk quota ==

=== Overview ===

Description: ''Candidates should be able to manage disk quotas for users. This objective includes setting up a disk quota for a filesystem, editing, checking, and generating user quota reports.''

Key &lt;b&gt;files&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; terms&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;tt&gt; utilities&lt;/tt&gt; include:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;quota&lt;br&gt;
edquota&lt;br&gt;
repquota&lt;br&gt;
quotaon&lt;/tt&gt;&lt;br&gt;

* Managing quotas for filesystems
* Printing quota reports
* Managing disk quota

=== Quotas ===

On a system, root can manage the useage of disk space per user and per filsystems.
The two limits that can be setup are:
The soft limit (soft =) specifies the maximum amount of disk usage a quota user is allowed to have.
The hard limit (hard =) specifies the absolute limit on the disk usage a quota user can't go beyond it.
There is also the possibility to setup a grace period that will enforce the soft limit only after an amount of time specified.

=== Setting up quotas for users ===

1) The keyword usrquota or/and grpquota must be added in file /etc/fstab for the partition interested.

 /dev/fd0  /home/yann/mnt auto    rw,noauto,user,usrquota 0 0
 /dev/hda5 /home     ext2    defaults,usrquota,grpquota 1 2

2) Add in each root filesystems the file user.quota or/and group.quota.

 touch /mnt/aquota.user
 touch /home/aquota.user
 touch /home/aquota.group 
 chmod 600  /mnt/aquota.user 
 chmod 600  /home/aquota.user 
 chmod 600  /home/aquota.group

Only root can do the quota administration and once the empty files have been created some disk quota can be set such as:
* Soft limitation on number of files and inodes.
* Hard limitation on number of files and inodes if the grace time is set.

=== Setting up quotas for users ===

3) Check the setting

 quotacheck -v mnt
 quotacheck: Scanning /dev/fd0 [/home/yann/mnt] done
 quotacheck: Checked 6 directories and 1 files

4) Enable quota on the disk

 quotaon -av
 /dev/fd0 [/home/yann/mnt]: user quotas turned on

5) Customize the disk quota limits:

 $ edquota -u yann
 Disk quotas for user yann (uid 500):
 Filesystem    locks       soft       hard     inodes     soft     hard
 /dev/fd0       15          0          0          4        0        0

 $ edquota -g yann 

 $ edquota -t
 Grace period before enforcing soft limits for users:
 Time units may be: days, hours, minutes, or seconds
 Filesystem             Block grace period     Inode grace period
 /dev/fd0                      7days                  7days

=== List quotas ===

To list quotas for an user or group, use quota.

 quota [options] [user|group]

Common options:
:-u:Default, print user quotas.
:-g:Print group quotas for the group of which the user is a member.
:-q: Print a more terse message, containing only  information on filesystems where usage is over quota.

Example:
 quota -u yann

==== Display a quota report ====

To display a quota report, use repquota.

 repquota [options] [user|group]

Common options:
:-a: Report on all filesystems indicated in /etc/mtab to be read-write with quotas.
:-g: Report for group.

Example:

 $ repquota /dev/fd0
 *** Report for user quotas on device /dev/fd0
 Block grace time: 7days; Inode grace time: 7days
                 Block limits                   File limits
 User            used    soft    hard  grace    used  soft  hard  grace
 ----------------------------------------------------------------------
 root   --       8       0       0              2     0     0
 yann   --      15       0       0              4     0     0

=== Exercises ===

* [[LPI Linux Certification/LPIC1 Exam 101/Exercises results|Exercises results]]

# Setup a soft limitation for any users that have their home directory in /home to 500M.
# Change the grace time to 0.
# Log as the user and check if the limitation works..

== File Permissions and Security ==

=== Overview ===

Unix File Security
File and Directory Permissions
Default Permissions
Changing File Permissions
Changing File Owner and Group
More Privileges
Unix file security
The biggest security problem may be you.
You own any directory or files you created.
You are responsible for accessibility of your files.
You decide who can access which files and directories.

In your home directory you will be able to grant different levels of permission to yourself, users in your group and the all other users.

=== File and Directory Permissions ===

The permission of a file or of a directory can be viewed with ls -l.

==== File permissions ====

Examples of file permissions:

 ls -l readme
 -rwxrw---- 1 toto users 14 Jul 5 10:00 readme

This means read,write, and execution permissions for user toto, read and write permissions for members of group users. No permissions for others. (0760)

 ls -l /etc/hosts
 -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 14 Jul 5 10:00 /etc/hosts

This means read and write permissions for user root, read permissions for members of group root and all others. (0644)

Examples of directory permissions:

 ls -ld /bin
 drwxr-xr-x 2 root root 4096 Jul 5 10:00 /bin

This means read,write, and execution permissions for user root, read and execution permissions for members of group root and others. (0755)

 ls -l /home/toto
 drwxr-xr-x 10 toto  users 4096 Jul 5 1:00 /home/toto

This means read, write, and execution permissions for user toto, read and execution permissions for members of group users and others. (0755)

=== Default permissions ===

The default permissions when creating a file are 0666 and when creating a directory are 0777.
Most of the systems overwrite this at boot time with the program umask.
Generally the mask value is 022. It means the write for group and other will be blocked.
To check or change the mask value, do:

 umask 
 umask 066  

Examples for file:
 default: rw- rw- rw- (0666)
 umask: 0 2 2 (0022) Block
 result: rw- r-- r-- (0644)

Examples for directory:
 default: rwx rwx rwx (0777)
 umask: 0 2 2 (0022) Block
 result: rwx r-x r-x (0755)

=== Changing file permissions ===

To change permissions on a file or directory, use chmod.
To overwrite the existing permissions, do:

 chmod 0755 /tmp #rwx for user, rx for group and others

To change add or cancel some permissions without overwriting all the existing permissions, do:

 chmod u+w readme  # Add write permission for user
 chmod +r readme  # Add read permission for everybody
 chmod -r readme  # Remove read permission for everybody
 chmod u+x,g=r readme  # Add execution for user and set read for group
 chmod u=rwx,go=rx readme  # Set read write and execution for user, read and execution for group and others

To change in recursive mode, use the -R option.

 chmod -R +x /sbin/*

== Manage file ownership ==

=== Overview ===

Description: ''Candidates should be able to control user and group ownership of files. This objective includes the ability to change the user and group owner of a file as well as the default group owner for new files.''

Key &lt;b&gt;files&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; terms&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;tt&gt; utilities&lt;/tt&gt; include:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;chmod&lt;br&gt;
chown&lt;br&gt;
chgrp&lt;/tt&gt;

=== Changing file owner and group ===

To change the owner of a file or directory, use chown.

 chown yann mon_fichier.txt

To change the group of a file or directory, use chgrp.

 chgrp dialout caller

The programs gpasswd and yast2 allow you to administrate groups.

gpasswd [-A user,...] [-M user,...] group
:-A: Add users with group administrator privileges.
:-M: Add members in group.

Group administrators can add or delete members of the group

 gpasswd -d toto users
 gpasswd -a toto users

Group administrators can set or remove the password for the group.

 gpasswd users
 gpasswd -r users

=== More privileges ===

It is possible to give more privileges to an user when it executes a particular script or program by setting the uid or gid bit of the file.

If the bit is set, the process will inherit the permissions of the owner of the file not the permissions of the user.
To set the effective uid or gid, use chmod.

 chmod 2640 [file] # (2) gid is inheritable for group.
 chmod 4640 [file] # (4) uid is inheritable for user.

Example of such program is /bin/passwd.

The sticky bit can also be set and can make the program text segment resident in RAM.
chmod 1640 [file] (1) The file program stays in RAM.

=== Exercises ===

* [[LPI Linux Certification/LPIC1 Exam 101/Exercises results|Exercises results]]

1) Write the command line by using letters with chmod to set the following permissions:

 rwxrwxr-x :
 rwxr--r-- :
 r--r----- :
 rwxr-xr-x :
 rwxr-xr-x :
 r-x--x--x :
 -w-r----x :
 -----xrwx :

2) Write the command line by using octal numbers with chmod to set the following permissions:

 rwxrwxrwx :
 --x--x--x :
 r---w---x :
 -w------- :
 rw-r----- :
 rwx--x--x :

3) With the following umask values what would be the files and directories creation permissions?

 umask = 0027
 File permissions:
 Directory permissions:

 umask = 0011
 File permissions:
 Directory permissions:

 umask = 0541
 File permissions:
 Directory permissions:

 umask = 0777
 File permissions:
 Directory permissions:

4) Create two user accounts

Logging in id: tst1, group users, with bash shell, home directory /home/tst1 &lt;br/&gt;
Logging in id: tst2, group public, with bash shell, home directory /home/tst2 &lt;br/&gt;
For the two accounts set a password.

Logging in as tst1 and copy /bin/ls into tst1 home directory as myls.  Change the owner of myls to tst1 and the permissions to 0710. What does this permission value mean?

Logging in as tst2 and try to use /home/tst1/myls to list your current directory. Does it work ?

Create in /etc/group and /etc/gshadow a new group labo with tst1 and tst2. Change the owner group of myls to labo.

Try again from tst2 account to execute /home/tst1/myls to list your current directory. Does it work?.

== Hard and symbolic links ==

=== Overview ===

Description: ''Candidates should be able to create and manage hard and symbolic links to a file. This objective includes the ability to create and identify links, copy files through links, and use linked files to support system administration tasks.''

Key &lt;b&gt;files&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; terms&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;tt&gt; utilities&lt;/tt&gt; include:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;tt&gt;ln&lt;/tt&gt;

=== Links ===

Use link when:
You want to create a pathname to a file. 
Set a shorter or fixed pathname to a file.

To link one file to another, use ln:

 ln [options] filename linkname
 ln [options] filename linkdirectory

Common options:
:-f  force: clobber existing link
:-s symbolic link

The default links are hard links (ln without an option).
On Windows they're called shortcuts.
A hard link can only be created to an existing file on the same physical device, after creation no visible association can be displayed between a link name and a file name.
A symbolic link can be created on a file that doesn’t exist yet, the association between the link name and the file name can be viewed with the ls command.

=== Linking to a file ===

The symbolic and hard link can be displayed with ls -l.
Symbolic link are indicated with an arrow: link_name-&gt;real_filename.

 $ ls -l /dev/midi
 lrwxrwxrwx   1   root   root        6    Jul 4 21:50   /dev/midi -&gt; midi00

Hard links are indicated with the number of links counter (3-1=2 in this case).

 $ ls -l readme
 -rwxrwxrwx   3   yann   users       677  Jul 4 21:50   readme

When removing a link name, use rm.
Only the link will be removed not the linked file.

=== Exercises ===

* [[LPI Linux Certification/LPIC1 Exam 101/Exercises results|Exercises results]]

# Create a directory etc and bin in your home directory.
# Copy all the files in recursive mode from /etc to your etc directory  and do the same for /bin to bin.
# In your local etc directory rename all files *.conf by *.conf.bak
# Create in your home directory a symbolic link call dir that points to your local bin/ls. Check if dir do execute ls.
# Remove the dir link. Is bin/ls still there?.

=== Section Overview ===

* 1.110.1 Install &amp; Configure XFree86
* 1.110.2 Setup a display manager|Setup a display manager
* 1.110.4 Install &amp; Customize a Window Manager Environment

== Install &amp; Configure XFree86 ==

=== Overview ===

X is a windowing system that provides the basic graphic functions of Linux.
It's designed to provide a GUI to any other systems operating across a network, regardless of OS.

X operates on a client/server model.

X is not part of the operating system. It is an application.

The standard Linux X server is Xfree86.

The XFree86 log file is located at /var/log/XFree86.0.log.

=== Configuration ===

type &quot;XFree86 -configure&quot;, it will scan your hardware and auto. generate a configuration file matching to your hardware. However, FOR PS/2 MOUSE, I usually need to modify this config file manually from &quot;&quot;Device&quot; &quot;/dev/mouse&quot;&quot; to &quot;&quot;Device&quot; &quot;/dev/psaux&quot;&quot;

=== Starting and stopping X ===

To start X you can use:&lt;br&gt;
''startx'' - terminal command used at level 3;&lt;br&gt;
''edit /etc/inittab'' to run default at level 5;&lt;br&gt;
''xinit'' - when there is no .xinitrc file;&lt;br&gt;
''init 5'' - to change manually runlevel to 5 (and run display manager);&lt;br&gt;
''xdm'' - (X Display Manager) - graphical login manager, which run automatically at boot process when starting Linux at level 5 (there are also external graphical login managers ex. kdm, gdm).&lt;br&gt;

To stop X you can use:
&lt;CTRL&gt;+&lt;ALT&gt;+&lt;BACKSPACE&gt;;&lt;br&gt;
''init 3'' - at lower level than 5 Linux will stop X Window;&lt;br&gt;
kill the XFree process.

Configuring X
To configure X on a system use XF86Setup.
The program will generate a configuration file that will be used by the XFree86 server.
To tune the screen under X use Xfine2.

Under X, the user can configure every conceivable aspect of graphic display.
Screen font size, styles
Pointer behaviour
Screen colors
Window manager

The tunning can be done on a system-wide or per-user. .xinitrc contains the default window manager and style information to be used by the ''startx'' command. This file is usually located under /home/username when defined on a per-user basis.
.Xdefaults used to setup pointer behaviour, colors, fonts, etc...

=== Exercises ===

* [[LPI Linux Certification/LPIC1 Exam 101/Exercises results|Exercises results]].

== Setup a display manager ==

=== Overview ===

X needs window managers to manipulate all the graphic applications.
Move, size.
Open and close.
Maximize, minimize, iconize.
Title bars
The look and feel is implemented in the window manager.&lt;u&gt;&lt;small&gt;shouldn't this be in Widget sets not WMs?&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/u&gt;
Provide virtual desktops.
Linux distributions contain many window managers:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fvwm2  Motif-like look, highly customizable&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;WindowMaker Next Step look, fast and lean&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Wm2  Ultra lean&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Olwm  Open look (Sun)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Fluxbox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;BlackBox&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
The desktops bring on top of X Window managers more facilities:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[http://www.kde.org KDE]: based on Qt, current at the top of market&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;[http://www.gnome.org GNOME]: The &quot;GNU&quot; Desktop, based on Gtk+-v2&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

== Networked X ==

=== Overview ===

X works in a client-server relationship where the application is the client and the server is the application that knows how to provide the services.
On a single system, both applications reside on the same system.
On a networked system the user can run an X application which is installed on a remote system and do the display on a local system.
The advantage of having a X application server is:
No local applications installation is needed.
No need to have performant local system.
No local access to data.

=== Networked X ===

Exporting a simple application : 
In order to do so do:
startx  on the serverhost.
xhost + Enable lack of identification on the server host.
telnet serverhost from the clienthost and set the DISPLAY variable to the clienthost.
Export DISPLAY=clienthost:0.0

Exporting the window manager : 
In order to do so do:
Activate xdmcp whith gdmsetup on the server
Use Xnest to connect the client on the server in broadcast

The following material is directly from the Linux Professional Institute at [http://www.lpi.org/en/obj_101.html Objectives 101] reprinted with their [[LPI Linux Certification/LPIC1 Exam 101/LPI_Permission | permission]]. Note that their inclusion in this book in no way signifies endorsement on the part of LPI.

----
This is a required exam for LPI certification Level 1. It covers basic system administration skills that are common across all distributions of Linux.

Each objective is assigned a weighting value. The weights range roughly from 1 to 10, and indicate the relative importance of each objective. Objectives with higher weights will be covered in the exam with more questions.

== Topic 101: Hardware &amp; Architecture ==

=== 1.101.1 Configure Fundamental BIOS Settings ===

;Weight: 1

Description: ''Candidates should be able to configure fundamental system hardware by making the correct settings in the system BIOS. This objective includes a proper understanding of BIOS configuration issues such as the use of LBA on IDE hard disks larger than 1024 cylinders, enabling or disabling integrated peripherals, as well as configuring systems with (or without) external peripherals such as keyboards. It also includes the correct setting for IRQ, DMA and I/O addresses for all BIOS administrated ports and settings for error handling.''

Key &lt;b&gt;files&lt;/b&gt;&lt;i&gt; terms&lt;/i&gt; and&lt;tt&gt; utilities&lt;/tt&gt; include:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;/proc/ioports&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;/proc/interrupts&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;/proc/dma&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;b&gt;/proc/pci&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;

=== 1.101.3 Configure Modem and Sound cards ===

;Weight: 1

Chinese, like all languages, has its own set of unique greetings which may be seemingly strange to learners of the language (this is particularly true if the two cultures are vastly different). Below, you will find commonly-used Mandarin greetings and farewells, along with corresponding [[Pinyin|pinyin]] pronunciations.

==Hello==

*&lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh&quot; lang=&quot;zh&quot;&gt;你好。&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot; lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot;&gt;[[Pinyin/Vocabulary#N|Nǐ hǎo]]&lt;/span&gt;; The standard &quot;hello&quot; greeting. Literally means &quot;you good.&quot;
*&lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh&quot; lang=&quot;zh&quot;&gt;您好。&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot; lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot;&gt;[[Pinyin/Vocabulary#N|Nín hǎo]]&lt;/span&gt;; The same &quot;hello&quot; greeting as above, except that &lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh&quot; lang=&quot;zh&quot;&gt;您 ([[Pinyin/Vocabulary#N|nín]])&lt;/span&gt;, like in many European languages, is the polite form of &quot;you&quot;, used when addressing elders, or teachers etc.
*&lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh&quot; lang=&quot;zh&quot;&gt;你好吗?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot; lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot;&gt;[[Pinyin/Vocabulary#N|Nǐ hǎo ma?]]&lt;/span&gt;; More often used following a greeting than not, however, this can be used as a &quot;hello&quot; by itself. 
*&lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh&quot; lang=&quot;zh&quot;&gt;您好吗?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot; lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot;&gt;[[Pinyin/Vocabulary#N|Nín hǎo ma?]]&lt;/span&gt;; The same as the &quot;&lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot; lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot;&gt;Nǐ hǎo ma?&lt;/span&gt;&quot; above, again, except that this is used as a more polite form.
*&lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh&quot; lang=&quot;zh&quot;&gt;你怎么样?&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span xml:lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot; lang=&quot;zh-Latn&quot;&gt;[[Pinyin/Vocabulary#N|Nǐ zěnmeyàng?]]&lt;/span&gt;; &quot;What's up?&quot;, &quot;How are you doing?&quot;

==Grammar==

===The adverb &lt;u&gt;Hěn&lt;/u&gt; [很]===

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | Though translated as &quot;very&quot;, &lt;u&gt;Hěn&lt;/u&gt; [很] has a weaker meaning than it does in English. It is often added before a single-syllable adjective just to enhance the rhythmic flow of the sentence. &lt;u&gt;Hěn&lt;/u&gt; is used before the adjective in affirmative sentences, but ''not'' in negative sentences or questions. A common mistake of beginners is to insert &lt;u&gt;shì&lt;/u&gt; [是] into adjectival sentences, but this usage is incorrect as &lt;u&gt;shì&lt;/u&gt; can only be used to equate combinations of nouns, noun phrases and pronouns.
|-
|}&lt;br&gt;

1. 我很忙。
:Wǒ hěn máng
:''I am (very) busy.''

===&lt;u&gt;Le&lt;/u&gt; [了] as emphasizer===

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | The particle &lt;u&gt;le&lt;/u&gt; [了] has many different functions in Chinese, but in this case, it serves to add emphasis to the verb or adjective of the sentence. It can be seen paired with &lt;u&gt;tài&lt;/u&gt; [太] to express excessiveness.
|-
|}&lt;br&gt;

1. 太多了。
: Tài duō le.
: (That's) too many.

2. 太少了。
: Tài shăo le.
: (That's) too few.

===Affirmative-negative questions===

| style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | A sentence can be made into a question by having both affirmative and negative options together. To answer in the affirmative, the verb or adjective is repeated. (An affirmative adjective in this case is usually preceded by &lt;u&gt;hěn&lt;/u&gt; [很] to avoid a comparative tone.) Responding in the negative is simply saying &quot;not verb&quot; or &quot;not adjective&quot;.

= Lesson 3: 助詞 =
The Chinese language employs heavy usage of particles to modify the meaning of characters and sentences. Since Chinese has neither inflections nor tense, the mastery of particles is an absolute must if one is to fully comprehend both written and spoken Chinese. Below, you will find some of the most common particles in everyday Chinese.

== The &lt;u&gt;De&lt;/u&gt; {的} particle as possessive ==
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; 
|-
|style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | The particle &lt;u&gt;de&lt;/u&gt; [的] can be used to indicate possession. It is roughly equivalent to the contraction &quot;X's&quot; in English, where X is the subject.
|}

Example:
       她  的   名字   是   金妮。
        Tā de míngzi shì Jīnní.
       Her name is Ginny.
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; 
|-
|style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | sometimes the &quot;的&quot; is following an adjective to make meaning clearer.
|}



Example 她是一个美丽的姑娘
         Tā shì yīge měilì de gū’niang.
        She is a beautiful girl.

== The &lt;u&gt;Le&lt;/u&gt; {了} / &lt;u&gt;Liăo&lt;/u&gt; {了} particle ==

'''Perfective Aspect Particle'''


{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; 
|-
|style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | The {了} particle is used mainly to indicate a '''completed action''' (this overlaps somewhat with the English ''perfect aspect'', i.e. &quot;to have gone&quot;, &quot;to have eaten&quot;).
|}
Example:

       他  走  了。
        Tā zŏu le.
       He has gone. 
 
※The &quot;le&quot; here is used to modify 走 (zŏu, ''to go'') into an action which has already been completed.


{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; 
|-
|style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | The {了} can also be used as an '''imperative''', that is, a command which is issued by the subject
|}
Example:

       別   再   打扰  我  了! 
       別   再   打擾  我  了! 
       Bié zài dărăo wŏ le! 
       Do not bother me again!

※In this instance, le is used in conjunction with bié (&quot;do not&quot;) to form an imperative. ''Note'': most imperatives are not formed using this construction.


{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; 
|-
|style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | The {了} , as in Liăo (a homographic variant) can be used to indicate the subject's '''capability''' in doing such and such.
|}
Example:

       我  实在    吃  不  了   了。
       我  實在    吃  不  了   了。 
        Wŏ shízài chī bù liăo le. 
       I cannot possibly eat any more.



At first glance, this sentence may seem a bit daunting as it includes two instances of the le particle, paired side-by-side. However, the first le is understood to be liăo given its placement (bù + le is a nonsensical pairing). Therefore, liăo serves to indicate the capability of eating any further and le ''emphasizes'' this assertion.

== The &lt;u&gt;Zhe&lt;/u&gt; [着] particle showing continuation ==
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; 
|-
|style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | The particle &lt;u&gt;Zhe&lt;/u&gt; [着] is used after a verb to show that the action is in progress or that the results from that action are continuing.
|}
1.  他睡着觉时有人敲门。
:Tā shuìzhe jiào shí yǒurén qiāomén
:''While he was sleeping, someone knocked on the door.''&lt;br&gt;
2. Alternatively you could take out &quot;着&quot; and say &quot;他睡觉时有人敲门。&quot;

== The &lt;u&gt;Zháo&lt;/u&gt; [着] particle indicating accomplishment ==
{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; 
|-
|style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | The particle &lt;u&gt;Zháo&lt;/u&gt; [着] is used after a verb to show accomplishment or result. 

Note: It is not to be confused with the identically written particle Zhe, which shows continuation (Lesson 3).
|}

1. 我终于把东西买着了! 
  (我終於把東西買著了!) 

:Wŏ zhōngyú bă dōngxī măi zháo le.
:''I've finally been able to buy this item!'' &lt;br/&gt;
And another word, &lt;u&gt;dào&lt;/u&gt; [到], can be seen as a substitution for 着, in most cases they are interchangeable. 

2. 他在行窃时被当场抓到。
:Tā zài xíng qìe shí beì dāng chǎng zhuā dào.
:He was(is) caught in the act of stealing.

The 把 + N + V + 着(到)了 construction is particularly useful and should be studied.

== The &lt;u&gt;De&lt;/u&gt; [得] particle indicating degree ==

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; 
|-
|style=&quot;background:#FFFFCC;&quot; | The particle &lt;u&gt;de&lt;/u&gt; [得] is used in few special constructs to indicate degree of complement (how fast, how early, how expensive, etc.). It has no equivalent in English but must be used to indicate the meanings below.
|}
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
|style=&quot;background:#ffdead;&quot; | S + V + 得 + adjective
|}
1. 我说得很好.
:Wŏ shuō de hěn hăo.
:''I speak very well.''
This construct often requires a context to gain its full meaning. 

If you wish to speak more specifically about an action, the two constructs below demonstrate the use of 得 with a direct object.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
|style=&quot;background:#ffdead;&quot; | S + V + O + V + 得 + adjective
|}
2. 我说中文说得很好.
:Wŏ shuō zhōngwén shuō de hěn hăo.
:''I speak Chinese very well.''
Note the dual-use of the verb.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
|style=&quot;background:#ffdead;&quot; | O + S + V + 得 + adjective
|}
3. 中文我说得很好.
:Zhōngwén wŏ shuō de hěn hăo.
:''I speak Chinese very well.''
This construct emphasizes the object (here being &quot;Chinese&quot;).

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot;
|-
|style=&quot;background:#ffdead;&quot; | S + O + V + 得 + adjective
|}
4. 我中文说得很好.
:Wŏ zhōngwén shuō de hěn hăo.
:''I speak Chinese very well.''
This expression is the simplification of the 2nd expression by eliminating the 1st verb. This form is even more frequently used than the 2nd expression above.

==Synopsis==
This book attempts to teach the skills that can help you to have lucid dreams &amp;mdash; dreams in which one knows he or she is dreaming. For the skeptical, lucid dreams have been [[w:Lucid_dream#Scientific history|scientifically demonstrated]] to exist. The ability to lucid dream will open your mind to a world of infinite possibilities as you become adept at taking control of your dreams.

We will start by explaining how lucid dreaming works biologically. Next, the book will prepare you for lucid dreaming by helping you to remember more of your dreams (dream recall). You will then learn a variety of ways of becoming, and staying, lucid. Finally, you will find suggested activities to try while in the dream world...

=Lesson 4: Word order and Verbs=
==Basic Word Order==
===Subject-Verb-Object===
The order of most Chinese sentences, like in English, is S-V-O, that is '''S'''ubject-'''V'''erb-'''O'''bject.

:我看这本书。
:我看這本書。
:Wǒ kàn zhè běn shū.
:''I read this book.''

Word order in Chinese is more rigid than in English. However, sometimes you may find sentences that seem to defy normal word order. For example, 我住在中国。wǒ zhù zài zhōngguó. The English translation does this too: I live in China. The reason for this is that &quot;in China&quot; is a preposition (prepositions indicate place or time) that is tacked on to the main sentence—&quot;I live.&quot;
More examples:

:下午一点半，我们走。
:Xiàwǔ yīdiǎn bàn, wǒmen zǒu.
:''At 1:30 in the afternoon, we'll go.''

:在青岛，我看到了。
:Zài qīngdǎo, wǒ kàn dào le.
:''In Qingdao, I saw it.''

As in English, a preposition can also appear after a subject.

:我在我家看这本书。
:我在我家看這本書。
:Wǒ zài wǒ jiā kàn zhè běn shū.
:''I read this book at my house.''

:我明天看这本书。
:我明天看這本書。
:Wǒ míngtiān kàn zhè běn shū.
:''I will read this book tomorrow.''

When using both a preposition for time and a preposition for place, put the preposition for time first.

:我明天在我家看这本书。
:我明天在我家看這本書。
:Wǒ míngtiān zài wǒ jiā kàn zhè běn shū.
:''I will read this book at my house tomorrow.''

:明天在我家，我看这本书。
:明天在我家，我看這本書。
:Míngtiān zài wǒ jiā, wǒ kàn zhè běn shū.
:''Tomorrow at my house, I will read this book.''

:明天，我在我家看这本书。
:明天，我在我家看這本書。
:Míngtiān, wǒ zài wǒ jiā kàn zhè běn shū.
:''Tomorrow, I will read this book at my house.''

Note the variation in word order. You can also place a preposition for place, but not for time, at the end of a sentence.

:我看这本书在我家。
:我看這本書在我家。
:Wǒ kàn zhè běn shū zài wǒ jiā.
:''I read this book at my house.''

===Topic-Comment===
Another structure for Chinese sentences is topic-comment.  That is, the first thing mentioned is the topic of discussion and then the speaker will add a comment following that.

It is used to emphasize a certain part of the sentence.  In the following example, the speaker wants to emphasize that he is going to read the particular book being discussed.

:这本书，我明天在我家看。
:這本書，我明天在我家看。
Zhè běn shū, wǒ míngtiān zài wǒ jiā kàn.
:''I will read'' this ''book tomorrow.''

==Comparisons Using &lt;u&gt;bǐ&lt;/u&gt; [比]==

|-
|style=&quot;white-space: wrap; background-color:#FFFFCC;&quot;| Comparisons can be made using &lt;u&gt;bǐ&lt;/u&gt; [比]. Adverbs (like 不，也，只，都）and any auxiliary verbs are placed before &lt;u&gt;bǐ&lt;/u&gt; in the sentence. The amount of the disparity between the two is placed after the adjective.

:她比我忙。
:Tā bǐ wǒ máng.
:''She is busier than I am.''


:东尼也比我忙很多。
:東尼也比我忙很多。
:Dōngní yě bǐ wǒ máng hěn duō.
:''Tony is also a lot busier than I am.''

There is a great description of Lucid Dreaming experience in Feynman's ''Surely You Are Joking, Mr. Feynman''. I took the liberty to make the excerpt temporarily available in my userspace at Wikipedia: [[Wikipedia:en:User:Paranoid/Feynman]]. Check it out and may be some facts experiences would be interesting to add in this book.

== Naming conventions ==
I have updated all the pages so they are properly named. The book is in a hierarchial structure now. Don't use colons to name pages, use slashes to name pages. Example:

Improper way: &quot;Lucid Dreaming: Introduction&quot;&lt;br /&gt;
Proper way: &quot;Lucid Dreaming/Introduction&quot;

Same goes with sub-pages.&lt;br /&gt;
[[User:Ksd5|Emanla Eraton]] 23:40, 19 March 2007 (UTC)

I think you made rather a hash of this.  I've just spent about half an hour making an even nastier mess of it, moving over all the Talk content and correcting the links in the [[Lucid Dreaming|main page]] and [[Print_version]].

What you should have done is just clicked on the &quot;move&quot; tab and left the &quot;Move associated talk page&quot; checkbox ticked.  That way a) the talk pages would have come over too, b) you wouldn't have created pages with 10s of K worth of content and one lonesome edit history entry which names you as completely responsible!

I didn't notice this at first and did some editting on the new pages (before I'd registered this username), including some talk sections.  That's why I wasn't able to simply move all the talk sections, and why I wasn't so eager to move your pages out of the way and move the old ones the proper way, because I'd have to reapply all my recent edits.

Hope I don't sound too annoyed.

[[User:Sourcejedi|Sourcejedi]] 20:26, 2 April 2007 (UTC)

This book needs to be marked for fixing the pages for naming.

== Conventions ==

A few conventions I'll post here for now:

* Don't just write MILD, VILD, LILD or WILD. Say &quot;the -ILD technique&quot;. The exception is WBTB (don't ask, just do it!)
* ''No'' other acronym is used.
* Write &quot;reality check&quot; (no capitals)
* To add links to a forum, use the format as on the current pages.
* Please post here before creating a new page (with the exception of reality check pages)
* Don't use the first person.

Thank you! [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 00:46, 5 Apr 2004 (UTC)

== To do ==

Stuff to do:

&lt;div style=&quot;border: 1px solid black&quot;&gt;
Done:
# &quot;Food and drink&quot; section will remain a stub for now.. however see below
# Merged &quot;Grabbing for stuff&quot; and &quot;Looking for stuff&quot; in [[Lucid Dreaming: Using]] (Thanks KirbyMeister and KC!)
# Created &quot;Dissociation&quot; section (Thanks KirbyMeister and KC!)
# Dream recall improves if you are in the same position in recall and sleep - true? (check with EWLD) -- EWLD says not to move from the position you wake up in since any movement might make dreams harder to remember, but it doesn't say anything about being easier to remember if you move into a position you slept in.

== Acronyms ==

I think we probably should agree on some acronyms to use and what they stand for... here's what I say:
# DILD - ''Dream-Initiated Lucid Dream''
# WILD - ''Wake-Initiated Lucid Dream''
# MILD - ''Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams'' or ''Mnemonically Induced Lucid Dream''
# VILD - ''Visual Induction of Lucid Dreams'' or ''Visually Induced Lucid Dream''
# LILD - ''Lucid Induction of Lucid Dreams'' or ''Lucidly Induced Lucid Dream''
# WBTB - ''Wake-Back-To-Bed''
--[[User:Tharenthel|Tharenthel]] 23:30, 26 Apr 2004 (UTC)

: We should not coin any new terms - this is a major barrier between posting on many different sites. I agree with the bottom five (WILD is sometimes taken to mean &quot;Wake Induced Lucid Dream&quot; (although it doesn't make any sense :) )but I'm not so sure about the first one (which is meant to be used to categorise techniques). It will only need to be used in few paragraphs above our excellent techniques table at [[Lucid Dreaming: Induction Techniques]]. Is it really worth &quot;teaching&quot; the reader another acronym just for that small section to read smoothly? I think not.
: If you were expecting us to choose between, eg, ''Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams'' and ''Mnemonically Induced Lucid Dream'', I refrain because often the same forums take the same acronym to meanboth those things (although the first use is more useful and the second use is dying out). This is exactly what the &quot;the -ILD technique&quot; method of writing (I didn't want to write ''technique of writing'') is set out to solve. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 06:08, 27 Apr 2004 (UTC)

:: By &quot;''Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams'' or ''Mnemonically Induced Lucid Dream''&quot; and the others like that, I actually meant that the acronym would stand for both of them depending on it's context. I probably should have said &quot;and&quot; instead, but anyway...
:: This is something like how I picture some of the techniques I know:
::* DILDs:
::** MILD (''remembering'' to recognize that you're dreaming; not quite the same thing as autosuggestion (that is, EWLD says MILD and autosuggestion are two different things, and describes them as separate (and different) techniques, but I think they both include a bit of [[en:autosuggestion|autosuggestion]]) (I'll probably put a draft of a rewritten MILD section on the [[Talk:Lucid Dreaming: Induction Techniques]] page sometime))
::** Autosuggestion (the adapted version of MILD described on ld4all.com is a lot like the &quot;Autosuggestion&quot; described in EWLD, especially the part that says it's &quot;important to not *want* it too much&quot;)
::** VILD (not completely sure about VILD - you become lucid after the dream starts, but you incubate the dream while awake)
::** Going to sleep thirsty
::** Drinking a lot before sleeping
::** LILD
::* WILDs:
::** Focusing on hypnagogic imagery
::** Counting
::Most WILD techniques are usually just called WILD like they're one technique, and that makes WILD a few bits ambiguous, which is why I think we should explain WILD and DILD as categorizations and then explain each specific induction technique. If we use WILD (and DILD) like this:
::* WILD - ''Wake-Initiated Lucid Dream'' and ''Wake-Initiation of Lucid Dreams''
::* DILD - ''Dream-Initiated Lucid Dream'' and ''Dream-Initiation of Lucid Dreams''
::...and put a note on the [[Lucid Dreaming: Induction Techniques]] page about common usage of &quot;WILD&quot; to refer to any technique that induces WILDs, then it'll still make sense to someone who reads this wikibook when someone says they &quot;used WILD&quot;. --[[User:Tharenthel|Tharenthel]] 18:46, 27 Apr 2004 (UTC)

== New section? ==

I wonder if it is worth giving a section which gives more background on what dreams are.  For example, with that background the reasons why turning on a light may not work or flying very high may not work is clear - both require ''rapid'' addition of new detail that hasn't been 'in the pipe-line'.

Such a section could also explain the way that characters in a (normal) dream are often different aspects of oneself.  There should be some discussion of what the normal function of dreaming is too, even if perforce it has to be stated conjecturally.

So - should a new section be added, if so what should it be called, or is it tooo far off-topic? (anon)

: I'm not sure about this. I have been considering an appendix section. It would have instructions for making an alarm-clock-based Novadreamer (the site I found it on has copyright-violating material), and full texts from the ld4all.com forum &quot;as the experts wrote them&quot; (stuff like Pedro's mind model text). It could also explain the reality checks, but I don't think that simple things like &quot;the mind has no external input to base the writing on&quot; is enough. Close your eyes now and imagine the words of your choice. See what I mean?
: If analysing dreams is not offtopic, neither is the new section. I think it could be lumped into the introduction. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contibutions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 10:45, 9 Feb 2004 (UTC) P.S. Why can't you fly very high? I've read of people becoming planets so I can't see any problem of scale...

== [[User:Perl]] ==

Good work with this module. I never heard of lucid dreaming before, but I am now very interested in Lucid dreaming. [[User:Perl|Perl]] 01:10, 24 Mar 2004 (UTC)

If you fly in dreams does this mean that you are definitely lucid dreaming? [[User:Perl|Perl]] 01:37, 24 Mar 2004 (UTC)

: Could you tell me where you got that idea from so I can go fix it? You can dream that you are flying without being lucid (I have flyed once in my normal dreams and about five times in my lucid dreams). Lucid dreaming just means that you are aware, to some extent, that you are dreaming. As you probably know already, we usually accept our reality whether we're in a ridiculous dream or just normal life. Changing that, by using reality checks etc, helps you make lucid dreams where everything is more vivid and you can fly more often :D.

: If you don't think you had a lucid dream, it's very unlikely you did. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 07:09, 24 Mar 2004 (UTC)

== Recall fact or myth? ==

I recently read this in a lucid dreaming book which is ''commercially sold'':

: You will have the best recall when you are lying in the same position that you were in when you were dreaming. [http://www.consciousdreaming.com/lucid-dreaming/how-to-lucid-dream.htm]

As far as I know, there is no scientific research about this, and no way I can see to seperate reality from [[en:Placebo effect]]. So - should the wikibook

# Not mention this at all (along with most things here) due to its uncertainty?
# Use [[en:Wikipedia:Avoid weasel terms|weasel terms]] to mention it?
# State it as fact, giving readers the advantage of a placebo effect they don't even realise?

At the moment, the wikibook is on the second option. Tough, tough... [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 23:34, 27 Mar 2004 (UTC)

:I had noticed that I could remember a dream as much as I wanted if I stayed immobile, and that the memories of the dream would fade away quickly if I moved, long before I had read anything about dreams or this article. More precisely, I think it's something about the vertebral column, it's like it felt different when I was immobile, and as soon as I moved the strange feeling would disappear, and the memory of the dream would fade away.

:I'd vote for the second option for the moment, or put something else to show the lack of scientific research on the subject. I do however have a strong feeling that it is true from my personal experiences. (but, then again, it could be true for some people and false for others)

:I find it strange though that this has never been studied or confirmed. There has been a lot of research in the domain of sleep and dreams, and this looks like a good clue on how dreams and sleeping work. [[User:201.92.136.117|201.92.136.117]] 01:09, 24 March 2007 (UTC)

== [[User:Kaycee]] ==

Hi all, I went ahead and added some stuff to the book. Feel free to correct grammar and such (I'm not a native English speaker).

[[User:Kaycee|KC]] 16:36, 4 Apr 2004 (UTC)

: Welcome! Can I ask you how often you have lucid dreams generally? I'm already &quot;green with envy&quot;. Can I also ask which of these looks better, [[Lucid Dreaming: Using|1]] or [http://wikibooks.org/w/wiki.phtml?title=LD_Using&amp;oldid=23354 2]? [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 00:56, 5 Apr 2004 (UTC)

:: Really depends on how much effort I put into it. If I don't think about the subject at all, LDs don't happen very often. If I read or write stuff on LDs, I get them once a week maybe. If I keep a dream diary and do reality checks, I'll go up to 3 or 4 times a week. But I'm too lazy for that .p Don't be too envious, spontaneously having LDs can sometimes alienate a person, or cause dissociative symptoms (ie., Did this thing I remember happen in a dream or in reality?). I'll probably write a page on that sometime soon.

== Recent page name changes ==

I personally don't like the new system on the wikibook with page naming. Some reasons:

* The preference on Wikipedia not to use colons in titles unless it is really necessary, because it can mess with namespaces
* Slower to type out (I can use &quot;LD Using&quot; in the search, but I have to write &quot;Lucid Dreaming: Using&quot; in links). Also compare &quot;LD RC Memory&quot; to &quot;Lucid Dreaming: Reality Checks: Memory&quot;
* &quot;Lucid Dreaming&quot; in the title, but &quot;lucid dreaming&quot; in the text? Seems a bit strange.
* The mass of redirects which have been left behind.

Can somebody explain why the changes? Until then, I'll be fixing links. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 06:29, 10 Jun 2004 (UTC)

:I definitely like the new title style, it's more logical and I think it looks better...
:* We could change the colons to dashes I guess (e.g., &quot;Lucid Dreaming - Reality Checks - Memory&quot;), but I don't think it's really that important. :-/
:* I don't think having to type a bit extra in links is that much of a problem, we only need to do that once for each link anyway.
:* &quot;Lucid Dreaming&quot; would be the title while &quot;lucid dreaming&quot; (or &quot;lucidly dreaming&quot;) is used in the text, because the wikibook is &quot;The Lucid Dreaming Wikibook&quot;; it's also &quot;the wikibook on lucid dreaming&quot;, but I think the title of the book should be capitalized (though I can see why someone wouldn't).
:* I think the benifits are worth the redirects, and we can always ask an admin to delete them sometime anyway (except for the &quot;Lucid dreaming&quot; and &quot;LD&quot; redirects to &quot;Lucid Dreaming&quot;, which we should keep).
:--[[User:Tharenthel|Tharenthel]] 17:41, 11 Jun 2004 (UTC)

Why &quot;Lucid Dreaming: Using&quot; but &quot;Talk:Lucid Dreaming: Using&quot;? Why not &quot;Talk: Lucid Dreaming: Using&quot; or &quot;Talk:Lucid Dreaming:Using&quot;? It's illogical. (hint: the spaces) [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 22:17, 11 Jun 2004 (UTC)

:The spaces are a problem, and it might have been better using &quot; - &quot; delimeters instead of &quot;: &quot; (or &quot;:&quot;, which I personally think looks ugly), though changing it now will make a lot of redirects. Anyway, &quot;Lucid Dreaming: Appendices: CAT&quot; and &quot;Lucid Dreaming - Appendices - CAT&quot; are both more logical than &quot;LD Appendices CAT&quot; (and it seems to me like a bad idea to use abbreviations too much in chapter titles anyway). --[[User:Tharenthel|Tharenthel]] 16:22, 12 Jun 2004 (UTC)

==New appendix==
Anyone else think we should make a new appendix for exercises that can help with certain induction techniques? For example, there could be a prospective memory training section for getting a better prospective memory (i.e., remembering future intentions) which helps with [[Lucid Dreaming: Induction Techniques#MILD|MILD]], or a will strengthening section to strengthen your will. They could go directly in the book, but I think they'd be easier to access with their own appendix. --[[User:Tharenthel|Tharenthel]] 15:59, 21 Jun 2004 (UTC)

==Browse buttons?==

What about putting somekinda &quot;browse buttons&quot; on the pages? These things would take you through the book in the right order without having to click on the table of contents or anything else. I know it's kinda redundant, but the wikipedia format really isn't the greatest for books. What about &quot;browse talk pages&quot; too? The buttons could be little pictures of arrows or such, to not add any unnecessary text clutter. [[User:Kaycee|KC]] 20:00, 27 Jun 2004 (UTC)

: Just looking at the usage statistics shows that these are not necessary. If you look at the front page stat for May - 758 - it is pretty close to all the other sections added up. In other words, the common browsing style is to follow a link from ld4all.com to the front page (I put direct links to pages up occassionally) and then to visit the page you want, read the information you want, and leave. There are probably very few people reading &quot;cover-to-cover&quot;.
: It might be a good idea, though, to add the navigation bar to the bottom. I have to go to school in a bit, so if somebody else were to do it first, that would be handy. (Not the reality check pages, mind!)

==Unicode characters==

So... should we use [[w:Unicode|Unicode]] characters? I replaced the &quot;--&quot;s with real em [[w:dash|dash]]es (—) and the dashes in ranges (e.g., 45–90) with real en dashes (–) and the straight [[w:Quotation mark|quotes]] with curved quotes (“ ”), but I used HTML entities (&lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;mdash;&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;&amp;amp;ldquo;&lt;/tt&gt;, etc.) and it makes the code look a bit messy. If we just use the actual Unicode characters in the code, it should look okay, and Wikibooks uses Unicode (unlike the English Wikipedia, which is still using ISO-8859-1 for some reason :-( ) so there shouldn’t be any problems with that. The only problem I can think of is that some unknown number of people might not have Unicode fonts/support (Windows 9x?). :-/ —[[User:Tharenthel|Tharenthel]] 19:37, 23 Aug 2004 (UTC)

== &quot;Spicing up&quot; ==

I was thinking about the ''old'' dreamviews site: It had beautiful pictures on the side, from the Myst game.

Wouldn't it be cool if the wikibook could be sort of spiced up with colours, pictures, etc? From Myst, or [http://www.mixnmojo.com/galleries/gallery.php?gallery=49&amp;image=293&amp;goback= LOOM], or something.

(Note about LOOM: There were a few versions, some with 16 colours, others with 64, others with 256. I'm obviously thinking of the 256-colour version. The screenshots page I linked to has a variety.)

All ideas appreciated. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 17:35, 19 Sep 2004 (UTC)

| Lucid dreaming is dreaming while aware you are dreaming. This allows you to control your dreams and have fantastical experiences.

The lucid dreaming wikibook gives you all the information you need about improving your dream recall, inducing lucid dreams, and using them to do whatever you want. There are also external references from which you can learn more.

&quot;Very nice book: very complete and useful, and also well written!&quot; - [http://ld4all.com/forum/profile.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=7 Johan]
|}

: Reworded the first sentence and added a [[w:serial comma|serial comma]] (sorry, I had to, my eyes were burning just looking at the serial comma–less version). And I think we should keep the last paragraph in the synopsis that's there now, but replace the rest of it with this one. —[[User:Tharenthel|Tharenthel]] 00:23, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)

Synopsis-except-last-paragraph is:

: This book attempts to teach you the skills that can help you to have lucid dreams — dreams in which you know that you are dreaming. Lucid dreams have been scientifically proven to exist. Being aware that you are dreaming, and still remaining asleep, can give you the ability to control your dreams. Lucid dreaming truly can be a fantastic experience. See the introduction for more details on what lucid dreaming is.

: First, you will find out a little on what dreaming is from the biological aspect. Then, the book will explain how to improve your dream recall so that you remember more of your dreams. Next, it’ll explain how to become lucid during dreams, and how to stay lucid. It’ll also explain how to keep yourself in the dream and prevent it from “fading”. Finally, there will be some suggestions for what you could do within your lucid dreams.

: Each section in each chapter has some information, and at the end of some sections, more information is given in question-and-answer form. There are also yellow boxes with links to related threads on lucid dreaming forums, with the last topic on the list being the latest.

The extra detail seems useful to me, although maybe the third paragraph (&quot;Each section...&quot;) can be removed. [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] [[Special:Contributions/r3m0t|(cont)]] [[User talk:r3m0t|(talk)]] 07:29, 26 Jan 2005 (UTC)

: Were you intending the short synopsis for a sort of cover/splash page that would come before the table of contents page? If you were, I'm definitely against that (unless it gets its own page, like &quot;Lucid Dreaming: Cover&quot; or something), but I think the short synopsis can probably replace most of the one that's there now, or at least the first paragraph (and I think the third paragraph should be removed anyway, though I don't mind the second so much). —[[User:Tharenthel|Tharenthel]] 06:04, 3 Feb 2005 (UTC)

The images are beautiful, the world they show is dreamlike, and they're all wonderfully coloured. The problem is that they are pixellated, they're oddly shaped (if you cut the black part of the screen off), and that if somebody recognises them lucid dreaming would definately ''not'' come to mind.

== Misgivings about this book's approach ==

I have to say that I believe that this project of yours is a dangerous project.

There's an allusion here. Imagine a technical support person who works for sony, can he give advice over the telephone to a person who has bought a Panasonic DVD player?-

Now this person probably could go into that caller's home, and fix the problem - because he knows enough about DVD players to do the job, if he has the item in front of his face, and in his hands...

But what's going to happen if he tries to give advice over the telephone about  equipment he isn't familiar with, is that the quizzical person is going to get himself in deeper and deeper problems from the misguided advice of someone who isn't familiar with the specific machine.

Now you say in your introduction in this book that these techniques of getting to a lucid state during a dream, can lead to very serious side affects - including psychotic episodes during the daytime hours.

I'll tell you my appraisal - a person who says he leads a person into blissful experiences, is not being honest, if he also leads that person towards nightmares....

The secret to lucid dreaming is not esoteric mind control techniques. The secret to lucid dreaming, is for the person to understand how his night time thinking processes work, enough to be able to have some agility with them, as he uses them, at night.

Dreams are another form of thinking which is done in the moment. It is a form of topic exploration technique. Just like during the day,  a person at night, will think about positive or negative, or neutral topics... and as that person mulls as topic, he will attract images and patterns in his mind which help him understand that topic.

The mind is a pattern assembler. And during a dream at night, the mind is working with several layers of patterns, piecing these ideas together...

Last night, I was dreaming, and I had a very unusual topic in mind. It was &quot;how does a self in a time of the past interfere with the dreaming process  to where the dream becomes a nightmare?&quot; and this is why I was inspired to comment on your &quot;book&quot; here.

In my dream last night, there was a  character who changed form a lot - his presence even sometimes took the form of simply an inanimate object intentionally placed out of place in the physical environment which the dream described.

But the one thing about this character who was both mysterious and imposing in his presence, was that he wanted to control my thinking process during the dream. It was similar to some mysterious evil manipulative shady character in a hollywood film who hides behind the scenes - where it's not clear to the audience what his relationship to the plot is.

The experience during this nightmare/meditation last night, I can compare to the experience of when a person isn't eating properly - and he feels these odd rushes through his skin and tissues. And he gets scared, because he isn't seeing where his homeostasis issues are in his physiology.

----

This is not something written after experimenting with your techniques - I would never be as foolish as to follow your blind advice in this book... I simply want to describe my understanding of the difference between a lucid dream and a nightmare..

All of my nightmares, I have seen have been defined by this common issue I describe here. Like any normal human being I have these types of dreams infrequently over the course of my life.

Therefore I would very strongly advise, that the writers of this book not teach people to use a mind control technique on themselves. Rather, I would advise that they teach  people how to understand their own mental processes... and how to make wise decisions about doing things in their minds...

By definition &quot;lucid dreaming&quot; means a person is lucid. He is aware of how his thinking processes are working. And this awareness gives him the agility to control his own thinking processes as he would during the day - except in context with a very different form of mental endeavor.

----

Your warnings in the introduction to this book are all well and good, but consider that the people who died from heart attacks after being given the pharmaceutical VIOXX and other cox2 inhibitors  recently are not helped by an apology. The warnings on pharmaceutical  labels are not an excuse for giving a substance which is harmful to people.

Your warnings go so far as to say that people may experience psychotic episodes by following your advice.

If you don't have the understanding to offer advice to another human being, or a concrete enough appraisal of your own mental processes to share your thoughts wisely, then please don't say anything at all. [[User:Rainbird|Rainbird]] 11:03, 21 Feb 2005 (UTC)

===Reply===

Before replying, I would like to say first that 1) I am not the author of the &quot;Possible dangers of lucid dreaming&quot; section and know nothing about its content, and 2) the &quot;Dissociation&quot; section only realistically and fully applies to those who ''already'' have psychological problems. Hundreds of people on the LD4all forum, Dreamviews.com forum, and alt.dreams.lucid USENET group have reported wonderful lucid dreams (using the techniques described on this site) without any such psychotic episodes. There is an Institute which sells courses in lucid dreaming and once selled devices to aid induction of lucid dreams; they have their own forum with hundreds of further reports on how people have had no ill effects. (To join that forum, one has to have given money to the Institute in some way, or to have participated in a study. Therefore, it could be deemed more reliable.)

You say that &quot;The secret to lucid dreaming is not esoteric mind control techniques.&quot; Firstly, almost all the techniques given here are documented in Stephan LaBerge's book, and are not &quot;esoteric&quot;, having been used by thousands of people, with mixed results. Secondly, there is no &quot;secret&quot; to lucid dreaming: a) it is no secret and b) I would never want to suggest that the methods here are the only ones, or the only possible ones.

You continue, &quot;The secret to lucid dreaming, is for the person to understand how his night time thinking processes work, enough to be able to have some agility with them, as he uses them, at night.&quot; I presume you think that you understand how night-time thinking processes work? Would you share information or references? Because quite frankly, nobody does. The exact purpose of dreams, and how they fulfill that purpose, is also unclear (although most researchers in the field agree it is something to do with learning or memory storage).

Nevertheless, you know the &quot;topic&quot; of one of your dreams: &quot;how does a self in a time of the past interfere with the dreaming process to where the dream becomes a nightmare?&quot; To be honest, I have no idea what you mean by this. Were you wondering how past events involving oneself lead to oneself having nightmares?

&quot;there was a character who changed form a lot&quot; - please clarify. Did you feel in the dream that all those forms were connected, or did you later decide it by dream interpretation?

I don't even understand how the dream relates to the rest of your post.

&quot;I would never be as foolish as to follow your blind advice in this book&quot; - please give details. All of it? Even the section on dream recall? What am I (and the other authors) missing which is making us &quot;blind&quot;? (sarcasm begins) You're very kind about the book, and I'm sure you appreciate the effort I and other authors have put into it, and the fact that all this advice is from well-respected authors and dreaming experts. (sarcasm end)

What is the &quot;common issue&quot; which is a recurring theme in your nightmare?

&quot;Therefore I would very strongly advise, that the writers of this book not teach people to use a mind control technique on themselves. Rather, I would advise that they teach people how to understand their own mental processes... and how to make wise decisions about doing things in their minds...&quot; What are these &quot;mind control techniques&quot; you have seen in this book? Are you giving this advice because you (one very individual person) have had certain nightmares throughout your life (as &quot;Therefore&quot; suggests)? How do you know about your own mental processes?

&quot;...a person is lucid. He is aware of how his thinking processes are working. And this awareness gives him the agility to control his own thinking processes as he would during the day - except in context with a very different form of mental endeavor.&quot; No, he is not aware of how his thinking processes are working. He is just in a dream. He can move around, fly, create objects, whatever. He is controlling his thinking processes ''in a way'', but it's a very limited way. If lucid dreaming affected/negated the purpose of dreams, I do not think the mind would allow it, or have evolved to make it possible.

About the last section: Yes, I understand that warnings are not much of a substitute for not actually offering advice. However, I am not the one who put the warning there, and many well-respected sites include LD4all.com, Dreamviews.com and the Lucidity Institute have done without it. I am uncertain why the book even has this warning at all.

&quot;or a concrete enough appraisal of your own mental processes to share your thoughts wisely&quot; - I'm afraid my puny 15-year-old brain is unable to understand what exactly you mean here.

As a final note, thank you for your feedback. I'm always happy to see people speaking up their views. Also, I don't know why you removed the timestamp created by &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;, but it certainly should be there (to give your words some authorship (and associated credibility) and to give an indication of how fast the discussion was), so I'm putting it back. A space before the &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;~~~~&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt; code is also useful for readability.

&lt;s&gt;I suspect you will be interested in my reply, so if you haven't replied in a few days, I will try to send an email to you.&lt;/s&gt; Because you didn't provide an email address when you created an account, that will not be possible.

===Comment on Reply===

I wrote most of the &quot;Dangers&quot; section of the book. I feel that the warnings need to be there, since I believe that in dreams you are actually dealing with your own subconscious and personality in a very direct way. This gives you the power to create both blissful and nightmarish experiences that to a certain part of your mind seem &quot;real&quot;. Not appreciating that fact may, again from my viewpoint, lead you to recklessly mess up your thought processes in a way that will affet your day-time functioning.

About the other comments, I'm with r3m0t here. [[User:Kaycee|KC]] 17:42, 15 Mar 2005 (UTC)

==Purpose==
This is a wonderful piece of work that could be a very useful book if it were oriented more purposefully.  As it stands now, however, it seems to be oriented rather frivolously.  Life is a reverent and serious pursuit for high and holy purposes, and going about a subject such as Lucid dreaming without a reverence and appreciation for that purpose is a travesty.  Would it be possible for you to research some of the ways that Lucid Dreaming can contribute to personal growth and societal betterment and orient more toward that end?  Anon Tom

A good example of such an approach is the following passage from a researcher on out of body experiences (possibly closely related to lucid dreaming). Anon Tom [[User:216.160.222.166|216.160.222.166]] 18:35, 11 August 2005 (UTC)

&lt;blockquote&gt;Astral projection enables us to use the part of our mind that has been dormant or sleeping. We can wake up this part and put it to work. It is called the subconscious, and it can be used to give us the knowledge we need to find out more about ourselves, our purpose on earth, and our relationship with God. &lt;snip&gt; I go to the astral realm and communicate with my teachers.   [http://www.near-death.com/gross.html]&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Would such a paradigm shift be possible?  Anon Tom  [[User:216.160.222.166|216.160.222.166]] 18:35, 11 August 2005 (UTC)

== Translation in french language. ==

Hello,

I'm very interesting in Lucid dreaming. However, french lucid dreaming community isn't very large.

We need documentation about lucid dreaming but we're not enough in order to redact them.

That's why I ask you if I can translate your book into french.

In waiting your approbation, Nicolas.

:No reason why not. Wikibooks is absolutely free and its content can be used for any purpose you wish, so long as it's non-commercial.

== Criticism ==
Great book guys, I've read it through a couple times (hard copy), and not only is it pretty interesting to read, it presents a fairly balanced take on a fairly controvercial topic. Other than the fact that it's not a very long book, I want to make a few points, from the point of view of a critical Wikipedia editor.

Anybody that has though seriously about lucid dreaming will know about LaBerge and his books, and it's obvious that a lot of the verifiable information in this book is supported by his writings. As a somewhat &quot;trusted leader&quot; for everything lucid, it only makes sense. A sceptic who doubts lucid dreaming (a person who may deny it's value, it's meaning, or it's existance) will interperet that fact in the following ways:
#Lucid dreaming = LaBerge
#LaBerge is the pretty much the ''only'' big name in lucid dreaming; a standout
#If LaBerge is wrong, lucid dreaming is a joke

Not to mention that all of LaBerge's books are targeted at a rather non-sceptical population (those eager to believe), not the scientific community. If you've read any of his scientific papers (not the best scientific writer, but nothing I can really criticize), you'll notice how deeply his facts are referenced, because he knows he's dealing with a lot of sceptics, and I think that you (we?) should do a little more of the same on Wikibooks. As it is right now, there's all ''too much'' sci-fi stuff in the book, and it doesn't serve well as an introduction to a sceptic. More details should be referenced from different trusted individuals (LaBerge himself seems to trust a good dozen of other scientific writers), and you have a responsibility to document the popular criticism as well, or else the whole thing just starts sounding like a sales pamphlet for LaBerge's books.

If you had a Wikibook on &quot;how to fly to the moon&quot;, you'd have to make note of the fact that there's a huge percent of the worlds population that doesn't believe it's ever been done, and some who don't think it's possible. I feel that this book should serve as a world-wide, open-perspective introduction to lucid dreaming, and as it has as of yet been written entirely by dreamers and aspiring dreamers, it really seems to present the phenomenon in a much better light than it really deserves.

This is getting a bit long, I'll try to finish up quickly. I have some suggestions, you may or may not think they're necessary.
#Split the entire book into two parts: ''What is lucid dreaming'' + ''Lucid dreaming methodology''
#Remove all references to the LD4all forums
#Take a more scientific approach to listing methods, techniques, etc.

Ok so the first one. I'm glad that this ''isn't'' just a how-to book (thank you), but if the notes about techs gets any longer it will be at great risk of becoming one (IMO). I personally think that it's much more important to present the theories, experimental results, and arguments that make up the description of lucid dreaming, than to describe how the LD community prepares for bed. Why? Well let me put it this way. If a large number of LDers started reporting that eating yoghurt before sleeping increased the chances of going lucid by a large percent, you could add that to one of your sections on methology, and it would probably be a warrented addition. The problem is that it's not scientific and it doesn't teach you anything ''useful'' about lucid dreaming to know that. If yoghurt really was of such great benefit, someone would probably eventually do a real scientific report on it and show that a certain ingredient of yoghurt (or the smell, or a certain texture that triggers a hormone in your brain, etc.) was the culprit, after which that ingredient could be added to the basic lucid dreaming description, because you would have scientific evidence that a certain ingredient has more than a passing influence on the process; it could be part of an essential cycle related to lucid dreaming. Having done that, there's no real need to include it as part of lucid dreaming &quot;methology&quot;, because it will have become a core (referenced) element of the description of lucid dreaming itself.

Number two; you'll probably hate me for this. I know why you've done it, and I don't fully disagree with you for doing it, but nobody is going to insist that LD4all is a good, solid source for anything, and as long as we're all responsible Wikipedians here, I think you should just stick to what is known to be reliable, and what we can trust not to fall victim to symptoms of popularity, desparation, over-enthusiasm, etc. It's an excellent resource for starting lucidians, and it definitely deserves a big mention, but I really don't think it should be used as a source for anything. It only takes a couple clicks before you're bombarded by posts about &quot;verified&quot; telekenisis, alien encounters, and all this new-world stuff that may do well with it's own article/book, but is all too controvercial to risk mixing in with a supposedly verifiable book on lucid dreaming. Use your own judgement.

For my third point, I'm mainly looking at the reality checks section. OK, it's ''useful'', ''informative'', and ''interesting'', but from the POV of a non-believing sceptic, it's complete nonsense. I don't really know how I can explain this from a sceptics point of view without just sounding like I'm starting to cause trouble. ''Basically'', I don't think things like these should be made into a chart. This policy exists en force in Wikipedia as well; charts are easily falsifiable, and it is difficult to make them clear, relevant, and perfectly verifiable at the same time. I just feel this chart could be made into a few paragraphs about how certain actions that work perfectly normally IRL, for some reason ''don't'' work as well in dreams, and it really begs for an ''explanation''. I understand that light switches don't work so well in dreams, but it sounds like a silly statement to be made in such a bold way, and I'm sure there are sources out there which outline theories as to why such actions such as walking steadily, clapping your hands, breathing through your hose, and looking at mirrors give unexpected results while you are dreaming. It's also difficult to present this topic in a scientific manner, because each time you say something like &quot;can you fly?&quot; the sceptic laughs and passes the whole thing off as a moronic fantasy. It may be useful to use wording more similar to &quot;are you able to intice your dream character to fly&quot; or &quot;does your subconcious tell you that you are flying&quot;, which puts some space between the writing and the fact that it's trying to express, i.e. it doesn't   appear in any way that you are claiming anyone is going to be able to &quot;fly&quot;.

I think that's enough for now, I really hope someone reads through this and considers improving this book seriously. It really is an interesting book about a fascinating subject, and there definitely needs to be better organization of the hard facts here (as I said before, there's not only one guy writing the scientific papers here!), better educating the public about the phenomenon. Sweet dreams then. [[User:222.158.118.50|222.158.118.50]] 14:36, 10 February 2007 (UTC)

: This isn't really &quot;my&quot; book any more, and this is a very late response, but...
: The first point - about the book taking the POV that LD exists. There are a few reasons why somebody wouldn't believe in LD.
:* They've never experienced it themselves - what am I to do to convince them? :)
:* It doesn't jive with their psycho-stuff about interpreting dreams - what am I to do to convinve ''them''? :)
:* They think that people can't (philosophically speaking) distinguish between an LD and a dream that (in the dream) appears to be an LD. The distinction is important to most LDers because in a false lucid dream, they find that their &quot;chosen activities&quot; in the LD don't really match what they actually wanted to do when they went to sleep.
: I don't really see the idea of writing a book about how to levitate for people who don't believe in levitation. Similarly for LD.
: Numbered point one: as long as the non-how-to part remains, it won't become &quot;just a how-to book&quot;. Which is good. The balance between sections only reflects how much people are willing to write in each section. Unfortunately, almost nobody does research on LDs, and there is great personal variance between the people who want to have LDs. Also, there is no placebo for eating yoghurt before bedtime (except comparing, say, yoghurt with some fruit) and there's clearly no placebo for reality checks. Everything we have is on a &quot;works-for-somebody&quot; basis.
: Numbered point two: I was spending time at LD4all, and I liked it - despite the supernatural areas, there are plenty of sceptics, and the LD forums have plenty of people with their feet on the ground, so to speak. (At least when I was there.) Where else am I supposed to link to? Dreamviews? Fine, link to dreamviews. :) The reader is meant to take linked information with a pinch of salt.
: Numbered point three: 'It's also difficult to present this topic in a scientific manner, because each time you say something like &quot;can you fly?&quot; the sceptic laughs and passes the whole thing off as a moronic fantasy' - it's meant to be the question that somebody asks themselves in the dream. &quot;Can I fly? Yes! I must be in a lucid dream!&quot; as opposed to &quot;Am I able to entice my dream character to fly? What dream character?&quot; (Or worse: &quot;Am I able to entice my dream character to fly? *flaps wings in a crowded train* Apparently not - I guess I must be in real life - hey, why is everybody looking at me funny?&quot;). Of course you'll be &quot;able to fly&quot; - as in feel an experience like you would expect flying to feel like. I don't think anybody would misread it as &quot;lucid dreams can make you able to actually fly in real life&quot;.

===Fixed===
I merged the few good changes, since the official articles are edited more than the old one. I also tagged some duplicate articles (glossary, appendix, and links) for deletion, since they are updated in the book.

e-mail me at egendreau@smes.org. Its way faster than my checking here. Also, I backed up the old articles (which are marked for deletion) in case they're needed.

P.S. Sourcejedi, was it you that made all the grammatical corrections in the versions on this book?

===Fixed for good===
{{done}}: I merged the appropriate edit histories. The pages that were tagged with {{tlx|delete}} were deleted, then recreated as a redirect to the &quot;real&quot; page in question (which is associated with the complete edit history). Just a reminder that copy and paste movements of content are messy to fix - if you need to move a page, then ''move'' the page... ''with the move tab'' at the top of the page. If there's a page there already, it will block you from moving to that location; [[WB:AN|ask an admin]] to help out if that's the case. It's much easier that way than if we have to come along behind merging edit histories.

:Great.  Thanks for the effort.  I'm sorry (if) my &quot;fixup&quot; contributed to the mess; as above I blame [[User:Ksd5]] for the initial copy+paste move :-).  I'll remember to find an admin as soon as I come across such problems in future.  Wikipedia's &quot;be bold&quot; definitely doesn't apply to moving pages :-).

== Problems ==

I think this book should have a section on problems such as losing awareness and/or conciousness in WILD and how to overcome them. --[[User:203.118.177.19|203.118.177.19]] 06:42, 3 November 2007 (UTC)

== Lucid Dreaming: The Psuedoscientific New Age Nonsense ==
I ask you all to look at this site: [http://www.skepdic.com/lucdream.html http://www.skepdic.com/lucdream.html]. It disproves Lucid Dreaming as more New Age nonsense, it should be piled into Astrology with junk sciences. It is possible you can dream you are awake when you are not. It is scientifically impossible to have conciousness in sub-concious sleep. Thus this is nonsense. So please remove claims this is scientific!!

:I looked at the site. Is it the second to last paragraph you're making reference to?
::&quot;Some skeptics do not believe that there is such a state as lucid dreaming (Malcolm 1959). Skeptics don't deny that sometimes in our dreams we dream that we are aware that we are dreaming. What they deny is that there is special dream state called the 'lucid state.' The lucid dream is therefore not a gateway to &quot;transcendent consciousness&quot; any more than nightmares are.&quot;
:The way I interpret this, they're saying that it might not be that we know we're dreaming, but that we ''dream'' we know we're dreaming. Maybe, maybe not. I'm not sure it makes any difference. Either way, it's possible for us to behave exactly as if we know that we're dreaming, whether or not we're just dreaming that we know we're dreaming and we don't actually know we're dreaming (and, really, how does that work? We &quot;think&quot; we know we're dreaming, but we don't actually know we're dreaming?). Two more things: Lucid dreaming is not a science, it's a phenomenon. Neurology is a science, as is psychology. And, I don't know about you, but I'm always conscious during my dreams. Otherwise I wouldn't be able to remember them, would I? If I'm consciously aware of a thought, it's a conscious thought. If a thought is not conscious, I'm not consciously aware of it. I am consciously aware of my dreams (even non-lucid ones) as they're occuring, so, it seems to me, they must be conscious.
:I understand what he means by &quot;It is possible you can dream you are awake when you are not.&quot; I myself have experienced &quot;lucid&quot; dreams which were in fact very restrictive, in which I thought I had full realization of the fact that I was dreaming, but I could hardly control any aspects of my dream as I should have been able to if I were actually fully conscious of this fact. This may support the claim that so called &quot;lucid dreaming&quot; is all an invention of our subconscious, and I believe so, but regardless of this, lucid dreaming is enjoyable when experienced as if truly under the dreamer's control. The possibility that lucid dreaming is an illusion of the subconscious is no reason to dismiss the pursuit of such experiences as nonsense or junk. I identify with the first person's wish to remove whatever semblence of scientific support is present in the wikibook, but at the same time believing in such proof is somewhat necessary to the pursuit of lucid dreaming and if a reader &quot;knows better,&quot; good for them. ;) [[Special:Contributions/72.197.183.70|72.197.183.70]] ([[User talk:72.197.183.70|talk]]) 04:35, 2 May 2008 (UTC)
:I'm removing the section you added (&quot;Criticism of Lucid Dreaming&quot;) because it contains no content except for an unsupported claim (&quot;Lucid dreaming is New Age nonsense masquerading as actual science.&quot;) and a link (which, as far as I can tell, doesn't give any support to your claim). I'll add the link to the [[Lucid Dreaming/Further Reading|Further Reading]] section. If you'd like to add information about particular criticisms of lucid dreaming, then I think the [[Lucid Dreaming/Introduction|Introduction]] would be a more appropriate place for it than the front page.

== The 'Techniques' page and its various color-classifications seem screwy ==

*Why is there even a red classification? If you can't even get anecdotal evidence, what do you have exactly?
*Why does Green place commercial books at the same level as scientific research? I mean, ''anyone'' can publish a book about any [[wikipedia:Natural Cures &quot;They&quot; Don't Want You to Know About|crackpot nonsense]] they want.  Why should that be as important a criteria as actual science?
*And as an aside, is there any actual science behind any of this? I don't mean some insane study published in Medical Hypotheses, I mean actual science.

:I agree that it can sometimes be inconsistent, that needs to be fixed. In the cases of the commercial books, I believe that it is referring to books published by scientists such as Dr. Stephen LaBerge, and other &quot;experts&quot; in the field. I'm not sure how many people write books that are complete BS about LDing, seeing how it's pretty well established what's true about it. Of course there is actual science. There are many links within the book, and I can provide you the link to the lucidity institutes's page[http://www.lucidity.com/], where you can see two of the books LaBerge has published, as well as a FAQ.

== Tibetan methods ==

First of all, I'd like to apologize for messing up the wikibook with my botched rename.
The Tibetan Method section should be expanded on. It has been at 25% status for some time now. [[User:Ksd5|Emanla Eraton]] ([[User talk:Ksd5|talk]]) 19:20, 24 February 2008 (UTC)

== Things happening because you believe them ==

I've experienced that what happens in a Lucid Dream are only the things I believe in. For instance, if I try to fly, but I think I'm going to fall, I will actually fall. I think it's an useful thing to know, to let go of your real world beliefs when you're in a Lucid Dream.

I wanted to put this somewhere, but I'm not sure where, and I also don't know whether you think the same. Thanks! [[User:Theon144|Theon144]] ([[User talk:Theon144|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Theon144|contribs]]) 17:16, 8 June 2011 (UTC)</text>
