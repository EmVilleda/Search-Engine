Welcome Mxn, I hope you enjoy your time here. BTW I graduated from UC not so long ago down there in your fair city. I checked out your links and saw your Vietnamese language work there on your site. Any plans to put some of that up on this site ? (That would be awesome if you did). --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

Hi Minh and welcome to Wikibooks. I'm really excited to see that you are making edits for the Spanish Wikibook! [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]

==Main page==
Hello again, I noticed that you undid my change to the main page without comment. Could you comment ? --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]
:Oh wait .. am I totally confused ? Sorry if so ... I should have some lunch maybe ...
:Yeah I'm spaced. Sorry, anyways hope things are nice down there in Cincy, I was just there a couple weekends ago to enjoy a graduation in the family. Too much snow up here in Cleveland right now. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

::Hehe, that's okay. It's fine here in Cincinnati, just bitterly cold. But I gather it's a bit colder up there in Cleveland. &lt;code&gt;:)&lt;/code&gt; &amp;ndash; [[User:Mxn|Minh Nguyễn]] 19:56, 15 Jan 2004 (UTC)

==Người Việt==
Chào anh! Thật vui vì tìm được một người cùng xứ trên wikibook tiếng Anh này. 
Em mới biết đến các dự án wiki và cảm thấy đây là những dự án rất có ích. Tuy nhiên em đã bỏ công &quot;tìm&quot; nhiều mà vẫn không &quot;hiểu&quot; được cách hoạt động của các dự án wikibook, wikiversity (trình độ tiếng Anh của em không tốt lắm). Anh có thể giải thích giùm em được không?

Nhân tiện anh có phải chủ dự án wikibook tiếng Việt? Em thấy wikibook tiếng Việt mình có nhiều bài viết còn sơ sài và hình như mọi người vẫn chưa hiểu cách viết Wikibook và các phần mềm wiki (giống như em).

Nếu có thể xin hãy bỏ chút thời gian trả lời câu hỏi ngốc nghếch này của em nhé! Cảm ơn.

Alkenes are electron-rich. Just look at those electrons all clumped together in the carbon-carbon double bond. They act as [[en:Lewis base|Lewis bases]]  (they give up electrons). 

Hydrohalogenation follows [[Organic Chemistry/Alkenes#Markovnikov's_Rule|Markovnikov's rule]]. That is, the carbon of the double bond that starts out more subsituted recieves the halogen (becomes more substituted) while the carbon of the double bond that starts out less substituted ends up with the hydrogen.

&lt;center&gt;[[image:Hydrohalogenation_markovnikov.png|A substituated alkene undergoing hydrohalogenation]]&lt;br&gt;''He who has, gets: This is another alkene illustrating hydrohalogenation. Notice how the more highly substituated carbon ends up with the X&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;''&lt;/center&gt;


The H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is attracted to the electron-rich double bond and adds first, on the carbon with more hydrogens, leaving the other carbon with a positive charge (a carbocation). Then the X&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; reacts with the carbocation.

      <comment>/* Geometric series */ I mean...</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

A ''series'' is the sum of a sequence of terms. An ''infinite series'' is the sum of an infinite number of terms (the actual sum of the series need not be infinite, as we will see below).

An ''arithmetic series'' is the sum of a sequence of terms with a ''common difference'' (the difference between consecutive terms). For example:
:&lt;math&gt;1+4+7+10+13+\dots&lt;/math&gt;
is an arithmetic series with common difference 3, since &lt;math&gt;a_2-a_1=3&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;a_3-a_2=3&lt;/math&gt;, and so forth.

A geometric series is the sum of terms with a common ratio. For example, an interesting series which appears in many practical problems in science, engineering, and mathematics is the geometric series
&lt;math&gt; r + r^2 + r^3 + r^4 + ...&lt;/math&gt; where the &lt;math&gt;...&lt;/math&gt; indicates that the series continues indefinitely.  A common way to study a particular series (following Cauchy) is to define a sequence consisting of the sum of the first &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; terms.  For example, to study the geometric series we can consider the sequence which adds together the first n terms:
:&lt;math&gt;S_n(r) = \sum_{i=1}^{n} r^i. &lt;/math&gt;
Generally by studying the sequence of partial sums we can understand the behavior of the entire infinite series.

Two of the most important questions about a series are:
*Does it converge?
*If so, what does it converge to?

For example, it is fairly easy to see that for &lt;math&gt; r &gt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;, the geometric series &lt;math&gt;S_n(r)&lt;/math&gt; will not converge to a finite number (i.e., it will diverge to infinity).  To see this, note that each time we increase the number of terms in the series, &lt;math&gt;S_n(r)&lt;/math&gt; increases by &lt;math&gt;r^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;, since &lt;math&gt;r^{n+1} &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;r &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt; (as we defined), &lt;math&gt;S_n(r)&lt;/math&gt; must increase by a number greater than one every term. When increasing the sum by more than one for every term, it will diverge.

Perhaps a more surprising and interesting fact is that for &lt;math&gt; |r| &lt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; S_n(r) &lt;/math&gt; will converge to a finite value.  Specifically, it is possible to show that
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} S_n(r) = \frac{r}{1-r}. &lt;/math&gt;
Indeed, consider the quantity 
:&lt;math&gt;(1-r)S_n(r) = (1-r)\sum_{i=1}^{n} r^n = \sum_{i=1}^{n} r^n - \sum_{i=2}^{n+1} r^n = r - r^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt;r^{n+1}\to 0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n\to \infty&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;|r|&lt;1&lt;/math&gt;, this shows that &lt;math&gt;(1-r)S_n(r)\to r&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n\to \infty&lt;/math&gt;. The quantity &lt;math&gt;1-r&lt;/math&gt; is non-zero and doesn't depend on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; so we can divide by it and arrive at the formula we want.

We'd like to be able to draw similar conclusions about any series.

Unfortunately, there is no simple way to sum a series. The most we will be able to do in most cases is determine if it converges. The geometric and the telescoping series are the only types of series in which we can easily find the sum of.

==Convergence==

It is obvious that for a series to converge, the ''a''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; must tend to zero (because sum of an infinite number of terms all greater than any given positive number will be infinity), but even if the limit of the sequence is 0, this is not sufficient to say it converges.

Consider the harmonic series, the sum of 1/''n'', and group terms
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
\sum_1^{2^m} \frac{1}{n} &amp; = &amp;1+\frac{1}{2} &amp; + &amp;\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{4} &amp; + &amp;\frac{1}{5}+\frac{1}{6}+\frac{1}{7}+\frac{1}{8} &amp;+\ldots &amp; + &amp;\sum_{p=1+2^{n-1}}^{2^n} \frac{1}{p} \\ 
 &amp; &gt; &amp;\frac{3}{2} &amp; + &amp;\frac{1}{4}(2) &amp; + &amp;\frac{1}{8}(4) &amp;+\ldots &amp; + &amp; \frac{1}{2^n}2^{n-1} \\
 &amp; = &amp;\frac{3}{2} &amp; + &amp;\frac{1}{2} &amp; + &amp;\frac{1}{2} &amp;+\ldots &amp; + &amp; \frac{1}{2} \quad (m \mbox{ terms})
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;
As ''m'' tends to infinity, so does this final sum, hence the series diverges.

We can also deduce something about how quickly it diverges. Using the same grouping of terms, we can get an upper limit on the sum of the first so many terms, the ''partial sums''.

:&lt;math&gt;1+\frac{m}{2} \le   \sum_1^{2^m} \frac{1}{n} \le 1+m &lt;/math&gt;
or
:&lt;math&gt;1+\frac{\log_2 m}{2}\le \sum_1^m \frac{1}{n} \le 1+ \log_2 m&lt;/math&gt;
and the partial sums increase like log ''m'', very slowly.

===Comparison test===

The argument above, based on considering upper and lower bounds on terms, can be modified to provide a general-purpose test for convergence and divergence called the ''comparison test'' (or ''direct comparison test''). It can be applied to any series with nonnegative terms:
* If &lt;math&gt;\sum b_n&lt;/math&gt; converges and &lt;math&gt;0 \le a_n \le b_n&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\sum a_n&lt;/math&gt; converges.
* If &lt;math&gt;\sum b_n&lt;/math&gt; diverges and &lt;math&gt;0 \le b_n \le a_n&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\sum a_n&lt;/math&gt; diverges.

There are many such tests for convergence and divergence, the most important of which we will describe below.

===Absolute convergence===

Theorem: If the series of &lt;b&gt;absolute&lt;/b&gt; values, &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty \left| a_n \right|&lt;/math&gt;, converges, then so does the series &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt;

We say such a series ''converges absolutely''.

'''Proof:'''

Let &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;

According to the Cauchy criterion for series convergence, exists &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt;
so that for all &lt;math&gt;N&lt;m,n&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\sum_{k=n}^{m}|a_{k}|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

We know that:

&lt;math&gt;|\sum_{k=n}^{m}a_{k}|\leq\sum_{k=n}^{m}|a_{k}|&lt;/math&gt;

And then we get:

&lt;math&gt;|\sum_{k=n}^{m}a_{k}|\leq\sum_{k=n}^{m}|a_{k}|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

Now we get:

&lt;math&gt;|\sum_{k=n}^{m}a_{k}|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

Which is exactly the Cauchy criterion for series convergence.

&lt;math&gt;Q.E.D&lt;/math&gt;


''The converse does not hold.'' The series 1-1/2+1/3-1/4 ... converges, even though the series of its absolute values diverges.

A series like this that converges, but not absolutely, is said to ''converge conditionally.'' 

If a series converges absolutely, we can add terms in any order we like. The limit will still be the same.

If a series converges conditionally, rearranging the terms changes the limit. In fact, we can make the series converge to any limit we like by choosing a suitable rearrangement.

E.g., in the series 1-1/2+1/3-1/4 ..., we can add only positive terms until the partial sum exceeds 100, subtract 1/2, add only positive terms until the partial sum exceeds 100, subtract 1/4, and so on, getting a sequence with the same terms that converges to 100.

This makes absolutely convergent series easier to work with. Thus, all but one of convergence tests in this chapter will be for series all of whose terms are positive, which must be absolutely convergent or divergent series. Other series will be studied by considering the corresponding series of absolute values.

===Ratio test===

For a series with terms ''a''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, if
:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{n \to \infty } \left| \frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n} \right| = r&lt;/math&gt;
then 
*the series converges (absolutely) if ''r''&lt;1
*the series diverges if ''r''&gt;1 (or if ''r'' is infinity)
*the series could do either if ''r''=1, so the test is not conclusive in this case.

E.g., suppose
:&lt;math&gt;a_n=\frac{n!n!}{(2n)!}&lt;/math&gt;
then
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{a_{n+1}}{a_n}=\frac{(n+1)^2}{(2n+1)(2n+2)}=\frac{n+1}{4n+2} \to \frac{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt;
so this series converges.

===Integral test===

If ''f''(''x'') is a monotonically decreasing, always positive function, then the series

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty f(n)&lt;/math&gt;

converges if ''and only if'' the integral

:&lt;math&gt;\int_1^\infty f(x)dx&lt;/math&gt;
converges. 

E.g., consider ''f''(''x'')=1/''x''&lt;sup&gt;''p''&lt;/sup&gt;, for a fixed ''p''.

*If ''p''=1 this is the harmonic series, which diverges.
*If ''p''&lt;1 each term is larger than the harmonic series, so it diverges.
*If ''p''&gt;1 then
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}\int_1^\infty x^{-p}dx &amp; = &amp; \lim_{s \to \infty}\int_1^s x^{-p}dx &amp; \\ 
&amp; = &amp; \lim_{s \to \infty } \left. \frac{-1}{(p-1)x^{p-1}} \right|^s_1 &amp;  \\ 
&amp; = &amp; \lim_{s \to \infty } \left( \frac{1}{p-1}-\frac{1}{(p-1)s^{p-1}} \right) 
&amp; =\frac{1}{p-1} \end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The integral converges, for ''p''&gt;1, so the series converges. 


We can prove this test works by writing the integral as
:&lt;math&gt;\int_1^\infty f(x)dx=\sum_{n=1}^\infty \int_n^{n+1} f(x)dx&lt;/math&gt;
and comparing each of the integrals with rectangles, giving the inequalities
:&lt;math&gt;f(n) \ge \int_n^{n+1} f(x)dx \ge f(n+1)&lt;/math&gt;
Applying these to the sum then shows convergence.

===Limit comparison test===

Given an infinite series &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum a_n&lt;/math&gt; with positive terms only, if one can find another infinite series &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum b_n&lt;/math&gt; with positive terms for which
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} \frac{a_n}{b_n} = L &lt;/math&gt;
for a positive and finite ''L'' (i.e., the limit exists and is not zero), then the two series either both converge or both diverge. That is,
* &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum a_n&lt;/math&gt; converges if &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum b_n&lt;/math&gt; converges, and
* &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum a_n&lt;/math&gt; diverges if &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sum b_n&lt;/math&gt; diverges.

''Example:''
:&lt;math&gt;a_n = n^{-\frac{n+1}{n}}&lt;/math&gt;

For large ''n'', the terms of this series are similar to, but smaller than, those of the harmonic series.  We compare the limits.

:&lt;math&gt;\lim \frac{a_n}{b_n} = \lim \frac{n^{-\frac{n+1}{n}}}{1/n} = \lim \frac{n}{n^{\frac{n+1}{n}}} 
= \lim \frac {1}{n^{\frac {1}{n}}}=1&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;

so this series diverges.

===Alternating series===
Given an infinite series &lt;math&gt;\sum a_n&lt;/math&gt;, if the signs of the ''a''&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; alternate, that is if
:&lt;math&gt;a_n=(-1)^n |a_n| \,&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''n'' or
:&lt;math&gt;a_n=(-1)^{n+1} |a_n| \,&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''n'', then we call it an ''&lt;b&gt;alternating&lt;/b&gt; series.''

The '''alternating series test''' states that such a series converges if
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty}a_n=0&lt;/math&gt;
and
:&lt;math&gt;\ |a_{n+1}| &lt; |a_n|&lt;/math&gt;
(that is, the magnitude of the terms is decreasing).

Note that this test ''cannot'' lead to the conclusion that the series diverges; if one cannot conclude that the series converges, this test is inconclusive, although other tests may, of course, be used to give a conclusion.

====Estimating the sum of an alternating series====

The absolute error that results in using a partial sum of an alternating series to estimate the final sum of the infinite series is smaller than the magnitude of the first omitted term.
:&lt;math&gt;\left| \sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n - \sum_{n=1}^m a_n \right| &lt; |a_{m+1}|&lt;/math&gt;

==Geometric series==
The geometric series can take either of the following forms
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty ar^n&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty ar^{n-1}&lt;/math&gt;
As you have seen at the start, the sum of the geometric series is
:&lt;math&gt;s=\lim_{n\to\infty} S_n =\lim_{n\to\infty}\frac{a(1-r^n)}{1-r}=\frac{a}{1-r}\quad\mbox{ for } |r| &lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;.

==Telescoping series==
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty (b_n - b_{n+1})&lt;/math&gt;

Expanding (or &quot;telescoping&quot;) this type of series is informative.  If we expand this series, we get:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^k (b_n - b_{n+1})= (b_0 - b_1) + (b_1 - b_2) + ... + (b_{k-1} - b_k)&lt;/math&gt;

Additive cancellation leaves:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^k (b_n - b_{n+1})= b_0 - b_k&lt;/math&gt;

Thus,

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^\infty (b_n - b_{n+1}) = 
\lim_{k \to \infty} \sum_{n=0}^k (b_n - b_{n+1}) =
\lim_{k \to \infty} (b_0 - b_k) = b_0 - \lim_{k \to \infty} b_k&lt;/math&gt;

and all that remains is to evaluate the limit.

There are other tests that can be used, but these tests are sufficient for all commonly encountered series.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This book, Introduction to Philosophy, was initiated by RMK (who also plans to complete it).

The original version of the book was begun on October 22, 2003, making it the first wikibook about philosophy. Of course, this is just an outline at the moment, but &quot;the journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step&quot;...

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;Philosophy&quot; is a word with numerous vastly differing definitions, ranging broadly and not always compatible with each other. Today, it is perhaps most often thought of as meaning an individual's set of guiding principles, mostly moral, that he refers to in planning out and living his life. However, philosophy as an intellectual or academic pursuit has little do with this, meaning rather something along the lines of: &quot;The directed search for knowledge and systems of knowledge that explain topical phenomena such as the nature of existence, the causes of existence, the nature and causes of an individual, the nature and causes of knowledge itself, and a million other things.&quot;

What these million other things are constitutes the essence, or ''feel'', of philosophy as a subject, and of what differentiates it from other kinds of directed research such as physics, biology, or even music -- all of which were at one point considered aspects of philosophy itself. As you read on, you'll develop a sense of these questions as they've evolved in the Western canon, and of how philosophy fits in with the entirety of human intellectual pursuits.

Western philosophy as we know it today is generally considered to have originated in Ancient Greece, from the people's cosmogonical or &quot;world-creation&quot; myths. Thales of Miletus brought back kernels of knowledge from Ancient Egypt, which over time the Greeks developed into the earliest philosophy that remains recognizably such today. It is not surprising, then, that the term &quot;philosophy&quot; finds its roots in the Greek language. &quot;Philo-&quot; stems from the Greek word ''philein'', meaning 'to love', and &quot;-sophy&quot; comes from the Greek word ''sophia'', or wisdom. '''Philosophy''', then, can be thought of as &quot;the love of wisdom&quot;.

Consequently, philosophers concern themselves with exploring some of the biggest questions that face humankind: What exists? What is real? What is the nature of the universe? Does God exist? Do humans have souls?  What is knowledge? What is truth? How should individuals govern themselves? What is the nature of consciousness? Like many other fields of inquiry, philosophical questions spring from a certain kind of curiosity about life and reality.
Much of philosophy confronts very abstract ideas and thus, unlike in other academic disciplines such as the sciences, philosophers cannot always rely on gathering empirical data through experimentation. Of course, there are numerous other techniques available to the philosopher, including formal logic, thought experiments, rational dissertation, colloquy, phenomenological analysis, and more.

[The pursuit of philosophical wisdom can be understood as a quest for two different kinds of wisdom. Aristotle characterized these as theoretical wisdom and practical wisdom. The first sort seeks understanding primarily for its own sake, whereas the latter is concerned with understanding in order to ''do''.  The distinction is not unlike those in other fields. The physicist attempts to understand matter and motion simply for the sake of extending the limits human knowledge, but the engineer attempts to understand matter and motion in order to ''make'' something useful. The philosopher who attempts to understand the metaphysical nature of the universe is concerned with a more theoretical area of philosophical inquiry, while his or her colleague who tries to understand the proper way for businesses to behave ethically, is pursuing a much more practical subject matter. Philosophy that concerns itself with these sorts of practical questions is usually called &quot;Applied Philosophy&quot;.]

Philosophy is perhaps unique in its lack of limitation regarding subject matter. Almost every conceivable idea has been or will be tackled by philosophy, and among those that aren't, most are areas of philosophy that matured sufficiently to break off from the discipline proper and form a new field of study: physics was once called &quot;natural philosophy.&quot; In addition, philosophers typically ask questions that touch on almost every other field of academic inquiry. In fact, one major role of philosophy is to provide the underpinning for just about every other field of study, everything from the rules governing research in that field to its relationship to the other fields of human endeavor. As a result, most universities offer courses in the &quot;philosophy of&quot; other academic disciplines, of interest to both philosophers and students of the respective field. Despite these far-ranging interests, there are some unifying features of philosophical inquiry...

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome MK, I hope you enjoy your work here as much as I do. I just left you some responses in the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|staff lounge]]. BTW, if you sign in with a user account the site tracks your edits for you so you can see which pages have changed, it alerts you when people have left you messages, etc. Plus you can set preferences, and upload images. --[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

Thanks! I am sure I will enjoy it, though it is likely to take me a very long time to complete my first project as I am working full-time in the IT department at my university, I am teaching philosophy at the same school and I have a computer consulting business of my own.  Nonetheless, I support this idea and will contribute what I can as time permits.  Thanks so much for your kind assistance. --[[User:RMK|RMK]]

If you don't mind, I have been so empetuous to add some text to the empty question: &quot;Why study philosophy?&quot;. If you do mind, please change or delete it - but then I'm curious why so... ( NicoBenschop 16jun04)</text>

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;A Textbook on Five Levels&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

The question arose early in the development of this textbook as to precisely who would be the target audience. Although intended to be a &quot;beginning&quot; textbook on German, many felt that the early lessons were too difficult for younger students with  very limited or no experience with German and, perhaps more importantly, limited skills in English grammar. For this reason a textbook on three levels was conceived. [[German/Level I|Beginning German]] ('''Level I''') puts more emphasis on building vocabulary around subject matter interesting and useful to young students.  [[German/Level II|Basic German]] ('''Level II''') emphasises grammar, and assumes a greater knowledge of English grammar more typical of an older high school or a college student. If you are just beginning to learn German or attempting to teach yourself, you may wish to try both approaches and see which works better for you, since some people require a strong structural approach to learning a new language while others find this &quot;structure&quot; only impedes progress by adding another layer of complexity. [[German/Level III|Intermediate German]] ('''Level III'''), which requires even more knowledge of English, is for college students, preferably for sophomores or juniors. With even more complex lessons, grammar and vocabulary comes [[German/Level IV|Advanced German]] ('''Level IV'''), which with the most complex and difficult parts of the German language, is for late college students (Seniors) and college graduates. The last level, which is a review level, but also has cultural facts and the history of the German language, is [[German/Level V|Reviewed German.]] ('''Level V'''). An existing, separate text, '''[[German/Grammar]]''', may eventually be merged into the lesson modules or developed into useful appendices as a grammar reference.  At present, however, German Grammar is an expanding, significant contribution to the textbook; it provides an important reference on German language grammar rules useful to the student working through any of the three levels.      

== The German Language ==

German (''Deutsch'') is a member of the western group of the [[w:Germanic language|Germanic language]]s. It is spoken primarily in Germany, Austria, the majority of Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, the Südtirol (South Tyrol) region of Italy, the Opole Voivodship of Poland, the eastern part of Belgium, parts of Romania, the Alsace (Elsass) region of France and parts of Denmark. Additionally, several former colonial possessions of these countries, such as Namibia in Africa, have sizable German-speaking populations. There are German-speaking minorities in several eastern European countries including Russia, and in the United States as well as countries in South America like Brazil, Argentina and Chile. Over 120 million people speak German as their native language. German is the third most popular foreign language taught worldwide, and the second most popular in Europe. Continue reading about the [[w:German language|German language]].

== German and English ==

If you are an English speaker unfamiliar with German, you may be surprised to learn that English and German are closely related languages and share many words that are very similar. Such words are called [[w:cognate|cognate]]s. This is particularly true for everyday words in English that are Anglo-Saxon (that is, Germanic) in origin. Consider the following list of English words followed by their German counterparts:

: arm          ~ ''der Arm''
: book         ~ ''das Buch''
: cat          ~ ''die Katze''
: father       ~ ''der Vater''

: finger       ~ ''der Finger''
: wagon        ~ ''der Wagen''
: house        ~ ''das Haus''

: hand         ~ ''die Hand''
: June         ~ ''der Juni''
: man          ~ ''der Mann''

: mother       ~ ''die Mutter''
: mouse        ~ ''die Maus''
: name         ~ ''der Name''

: son          ~ ''der Sohn''
: garden       ~ ''der Garten''

: lamp         ~ ''die Lampe''
: bush         ~ ''der Busch''
: baker        ~ ''der Bäcker''
: net          ~ ''das Netz''
: storm        ~ ''der Sturm''
: hat          ~ ''der Hut''
: fire         ~ ''das Feuer''
: grass        ~ ''das Gras''
: fish         ~ ''der Fisch''
: kindergarten ~ ''der Kindergarten''

Some German words have the same origin as their English counterparts but the meaning has changed:

: worry        &amp;ne; ''würgen'' (strangle)
: kind         &amp;ne; ''das Kind'' (child)

*'''Audio''': [[Media:English-german words.ogg|OGG]] (308KB) ~ ''Hear these words''

Of course, even words whose spelling is no different in English and German may be pronounced quite differently. But in reading German, you will see the connections between these languages, even in many of the &quot;small&quot; words (the above examples are all nouns). For example:

:This week, my father is with my brother in the city.
:''Diese Woche ist mein Vater mit meinem Bruder in der Stadt''.

*'''Audio''': [[Media:Example sentence.ogg|OGG]] (87KB) ~ ''Hear these sentences''

Note also the general similarity of sentence structure with English. The only real difference in the German is that the verb is moved forward in the sentence. However, there are many German sentences in which a verb form is the last word in the sentence.  

Unfortunately, while German is perhaps the easiest &quot;foreign&quot; language for an English speaker to learn, meanings of words that are spelled similarly are not always identical. These &quot;[[German/Appendices/False friends|false friends]]&quot; can be confusing for the beginner. Further, German is a more structured language than English, with a more complex grammar, and it will become apparent as you learn German that you will also learn more about English language structure than you might ever recall from your high school English classes. For a quick listing of similarities and differences between English and German, read the [[German/Level I/Introduction|Introduction to Level I]].

== Vocabulary and Grammar ==

In learning to read or speak any language with which you have minimal acquaintance (that is, are not a native speaker of), the two aspects to be mastered are vocabulary and grammar. Acquiring vocabulary is a &quot;simple&quot; matter of memorization. For the language(s) we learn as children, this process is so transparent that we have trouble conceiving of the importance of having a large vocabulary. By the age of conscious recognition of our communicating with others through speech, we have already learned the meaning of thousands of words. Even words we have trouble defining, we readily understand their use in conversation. This process can be &quot;reactivated,&quot; as it were, by immersion in a second language: a method of learning a new language by moving to a place where that language is spoken and having to get around and live without use of one's native tongue.

The student of German language, if not residing in a German-speaking environment, must put forth substantial effort to learning words, including their meaning, their pronunciation and their usage in common sentences. Be sure to &quot;learn&quot;—commit to memory—all of the vocabulary words in each lesson as they are presented. Early lessons have simple sentences because it is assumed that the student's vocabulary is limited. But throughout the text, more complex discourses (often as photo captions) are included to introduce the student to regular German in use. It may be helpful to translate these using a German-English dictionary (access to one is a must; see [[German/Appendices/Resources|Appendix 5]] for on-line options). Other sources of German, such as newspapers, magazines, web sites, etc., can also be useful in building vocabulary and developing a sense of how German words are put together. The [http://de.wikipedia.org/ German Wikipedia] provides an ever expanding source of German language articles that can be used for this purpose. Further, a German version of the Wikibooks project—a library of textbooks in German—is available at [http://de.wikibooks.org/ German Wikibooks].

German grammar is more complex than, but sufficiently similar to, English that &quot;reading&quot; German is possible with minimal vocabulary in the sense that the student should generally recognize the parts of a sentence. With a good dictionary or an online translator, an English speaker can usually translate a German sentence close to correctly. However, to accurately speak and understand German, you must learn how each word functions in a sentence. There are eight basic grammatical functions: '''case''', '''gender''', '''number''', '''tense''', '''person''', '''mood''', '''voice''', and '''comparison'''. How words &quot;signal&quot; these functions is an important aspect of learning a new language. English speakers should know all of these functions and the signals used in English, but it is often the situation that you know perfectly well how to speak English, without understanding much about word-functions and signals. For this reason, this textbook incorporates considerable detail on grammar, including both English and German grammar. The reference book ''[[English]]'' at ''Wikibooks'' may be consulted for additional help. When we say German is more complex than English, what we really mean is that the signals used in German are different from and more numerous than those used by English.

== Pronunciation ==

A [[German/Appendices/Alphabet|guide to the pronunciation]] of German is provided. You should become familiar with this page early on, and refer to it often. Nothing can replace learning a language from a native speaker, but the text is liberally sprinkled with audio files providing the student with valuable input from hearing spoken German. Analyze the spoken words carefully. The pronunciation guide can only closely, not exactly, convey how German words should be pronounced. And of course, German (like English) has a number of dialects distinguished by differences in pronunciation.

Help in the pronunciation of individual words can be found by accessing the sound files of either of the online dictionaries, links to which are given in the [[German/Appendices/Resources|German websites]] appendix.

== Layout of Lessons ==

This textbook is intended as a beginning course in the German language for English speakers. Early lessons emphasize conversational subjects and gradually introduce German grammatical concepts and rules. In addition, sound files accompany appropriate parts of each lesson. Although the '''basic lessons''' (''Grundlegende Lektionen'') are presented at about the (US) high school level, beginners (including those attempting to learn German outside of a course structure) are expected to work through several basic lessons up to an indicated point, when review is suggested along with additional study. The basic way lessons go to other lessons is very simple and direct:
* Lesson 1 &gt; 2 &gt; 3 &gt; 4 &gt; and on to the end of the text.

== Layout within Lessons ==

The following subheadings or categories are offered within the lessons (Level II and above):

# One or more conversation ('''''Gespräch''''') or story ('''''Geschichte''''') pieces in German alone to illustrate the language in use.
#Study material ('''''Lernen''''') in English and German to present lists of conceptually related words.
# One or more grammar ('''''Grammatik''''') lessons covering elements of German grammar, with illustrations drawn from the conversation, story, or study materials.
# A list of words ('''''Vokabeln''''') and phrases introduced in the lesson, above that point, usually in the conversation, story, or study presentations. Words and phrases are arranged alphabetically within groups, and the groups are presented in the following order: 1) nouns, 2) phrases, 3) verbs, and 4) all other words. A guide to pronunciation of the words presented is consolidated within [[German/Appendices/Alphabet|Appendix 1]]. However, in each ''Vokabeln'', nouns stressed on other than the first syllable (the general rule in German) are indicated by bolding of the stressed syllable (e.g., ''Biolo'''gie'''''). Note that the English translation of all German words in a ''Vokabeln'' is the best equivalent for the lesson example. The lesson ''Vokabeln'' is &lt;u&gt;not a dictionary&lt;/u&gt;, but a quick reference for translation purposes. For this reason, verbs are not translated into a typical English infinitive form with a preceding particle, &quot;to&quot;.  
# A list of additional, related words or phrases ('''''Andere Wörter'''''; advanced lessons only) that relate to, but are not included in, the vocabulary presented in the basic and advanced lessons.
# English sentences and other material to be translated by the student into German ('''''Übersetzung'''''). These are numbered and a matching answer sheet is linked to this category. The student should write out the German using material from the lesson (and previous lessons) before checking their work against the answer list.

== The Student and the Lesson ==

Each level of the text is designed to constitute a course of study in the German language. For any level selected, each lesson should be read thoroughly and mastered before moving on. Substantial text in German is included and the student should read all of it, not once, but multiple times. At Levels II and III, complete translations into English are included only in selected places. Most of this text must be translated by the student using his or her acquired vocabulary and the vocabulary presented at the bottom of each lesson. As the German text is read (preferably out loud), the student must succeed in gaining an understanding of the meaning of each sentence, and of the role each word plays in establishing that meaning. To the beginner, there will seem to be many words in a German sentence that are out of place or even redundant or unnecessary. These add subtleties to the language that will make sense eventually. But it is important to experience these subtleties from the very beginning.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;In mathematics, only the most important (yet basic) theorems are coined fundamental. If you see the word fundamental as part of the naming of a theorem, it means that theorem is of extreme importance.&quot;

I am afraid that we have one exception: the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.


Good point, the exception being that it's extremely hard, and hence not basic. But... by basic i dont mean easy, but fundamental. I'll fire up the thesaurus then

My mum tells me that when she did mathematics, 1 was considered a prime number. Was it? Is counting 1 as a non-prime more useful? Is her memory just at fault? *g* [[User:R3m0t|r3m0t]] 11:27, 23 Dec 2003 (UTC)

:::It is not considered a prime because it is more useful to do so. The fundamental theorem of arithmetic would have to be changed to say &quot;every number can be expressed as a unique product of non-unitary primes&quot; (where by non-unitary primes, I mean what we call a prime today), and the phrase &quot;prime number&quot; occurs much more often in mathematics than &quot;prime number or 1&quot;. --[[User:Taejo|Taejo]] ([[User talk:Taejo|talk]]) 14:36, 9 June 2008 (UTC)

::One need not express the fundamental theorem of arithmetic in an English syntax at all, as it is rather more cumbersome to translate into other languages, in comparison to pure mathematical expressions. I'm not very good at this, but let's give it a crack. If we express &quot;primeness&quot; as being a feature of Diophantine inequations, then it becomes a simple matter of what inequations are satisfied by what numbers. If x/y = n, then x cannot be prime. Working from this definition, it can be easily shown that both 0 and 1 are prime numbers, and that all the numbers commonly considered prime satisfy these inequations as well. As must be necessary, non-primes do '''not''' satisfy these inequations. That is, ({Diophantine}, n≠1) x/y≠n, where n is any number (except one), and x is the proposed prime. (If I haven't fully defined all the conditions, I apologize, but it's been awhile since I've worked on this.) --TheLastWordSword  --[[Special:Contributions/208.83.126.102|208.83.126.102]] ([[User talk:208.83.126.102|talk]]) 19:26, 27 October 2010 (UTC) EDIT: A second point is that the Sieve of Eratosthenes is not a mathematical proof of any sort, merely a rather rough algorithm. --[[Special:Contributions/208.83.126.102|208.83.126.102]] ([[User talk:208.83.126.102|talk]]) 19:35, 27 October 2010 (UTC)&lt;br /&gt;

I consider this chapter done (a first draft at least)! I guess it's appropriate at this time to... clap. Thanks to all those who contributed to this 22 page beast! It was hard work. [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]]

For problem 11(b), what exactly is your notation? Where you have &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-1}\equiv \frac{p-1}{2}!&lt;/math&gt;, you don't say what it's equivalent to. (There's no (mod ''n'') clause.) Furthermore, should the &quot;p=1 (mod 4)&quot; equation be written as an equivalence instead?

I'm not entirely sure about these, so I didn't make the edit. Can someone confirm or deny? [[User:Grendelkhan|Grendelkhan]] 17:16, 9 Feb 2004 (UTC)

:Thanks for the question. The editing is done. Where obvious I sometimes do use the two notations interchangably. But I'll change it in this case. [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 23:20, 9 Feb 2004 (UTC)

I do believe factorization is spelled wrong throughout the document....  Someone may like to fix that.

: It's not &quot;wrong&quot;. Some people spell it with an ''s'' and some with a ''z'' - they are variants, not misspellings. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 04:59, 21 Apr 2004 (UTC)

It might be a temporary thing, but there appears to be a bug in the formula rendering - the example for marking 5 as a prime in the &quot;Finding primes&quot; section does not appear to render. I found that removing the terminating // on the last line of the matrix definition causes the matrix to render correctly again - however (bizarrely) it causes a visible rendering error (in preview mode at least) when applied to any of the other matrixes.

For the life of me, I can't figure out the fifth modulo 11 problem. I don't see how adding or subtracting 11 is ever going to get me a multiple of i. Infact, after the 5th question, the page starts to become a giant nonsequiter for me (I'm sure the page is correct, it's just not clear to me). The question is unclear -- I'm not sure if it means find x if (x mod 11)^2 = -2 or if x^2 mod 11 = -2.

: I don't like the notation in the question. My interpretation of it is that it is asking you for all the numbers modulo 11, that when you square it, you get -2 = 9 (mod 11). So, x^2 = 9 normally you have 3 as a solution. But, 11 mod 11 is zero, so conceivably, 11+3 will also be a solution too, since we're basically &quot;adding zero&quot;. So 3+11 = 14 = 3 (mod 11), and you can consider -3 = 8 to be a solution too (since (-3)^2 = 9 normally).

Then in the division example it says x=3/5. Ok, sure. Then x = 3 * (1/5). Alright, still with you. Then x = 3 * 3. Uh, where the hell did that come from? 3*3 = 9. 3/5 = 0.6. Then, to really confuse the hell out of me, 3 * 3 becomes 2!

: Again, the notation (I've complained about it before, above). You can't really divide when talking about modular arithmetic because you can't always do it, and you don't get fractions. The ''multiplicative inverse'' of 5 mod 7 is the number you multiply 5 by modulo 7 to get 1. 3 * 5 = 1 (mod 7), so you can write &quot;1/5&quot; ('''which should really be written as 5&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;''') as 3. The rest should then be clear: get back to me if it isn't.

But I'm confused even before that. 1/5 = 0.2. 1/5 mod 7 is still 0.2. Why are we doing this funky stuff with x in the first place?

: See above. 1/5 is supposed to be the multiplicative inverse, not a fraction. We only work with numbers {0, 1, 2, 3, 4} modulo 5, we don't have fractions or decimals or whatever. If we want to &quot;divide&quot; numbers, we look for numbers we multiply to get 1 (like if we had real numbers, 1/5 is supposed to be the number we multiply 5 by to get 1, modulo 7, 3 is supposed to be the number we multiply 5 by to get 1).

Can someone please clarify here or in the module itself what is going on? I can get a 4 on my AP calc examination but this makes no sense to me ;)

[[User:dataangel|dataangel]]

: As I mentioned, get back to me if anything I told you still doesn't make sense. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 10:25, 13 Aug 2004 (UTC)

: It seems that my notation (or my uni lecturer's notation) have confused quite a lot of ppl. Just think of &quot;1/5&quot; as the number when multiplied by 5 will give 1, dont think of it as 0.2. I know that &quot;1/5&quot; will be confusing to those with prior exposure to higher mathematics but this book is for high school student and so i want to do it in notations familiar to them. Maybe i should clarify it in the book. [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 14:18, 14 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:: I know you want to use notation familiar to high school students, but you really need to use a different notation. The two operations aren't the same, and you're going to confuse people more if you do, even that high schooler above. But it's up to you. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 23:52, 14 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:: I think you can effectively use the &quot;1/5&quot; notation.  What's wrong with thinking it is 0.2?  What does 0.2 mean anyway?  It only ever means 2/10 which makes just as much sense in modulo 11 arithmetic as it does in the rationals.  You can &quot;divide&quot; in prime modulos because they are fields.  The important thing to recognize (and communicate) is that the canonical form for all numbers in &quot;modulo 11&quot; arithmetic comes from the list {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10}.  You get a lot of leeway for students to play around with the algebra and still get sensible answers, they just have to do the algebra correctly.

:: By the way, I have always liked the analogy of &quot;clock&quot; arithmetic as a way of explaining all the funny bits of Z&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;.  So image a clock with only 11 hours on the face (strange day!). How many hours would you have to wait from &quot;midnight&quot; before the clock showed 2 o'clock?  There are lots of equivalent answers.  Now DIVIDE that many hours into 10 equal pieces. You get lots of different numerical answers for &quot;how long&quot;, but they are all equivalent to 9 (mod 11).  Which only means that if you work a 9 hour shift 5 times in a row starting at midnight, the clock will read 1.  But if you work a 2/10 hour (do I dare call it 12 minute?) shift 5 times in a row starting at midnight the clock will still read 1. [[User:Thebhgg|beej]] 13:51, 20 May 2005 (UTC)

5^99 mod 11? I'm probably not thinking through this properly/missing something (it's been a while for me since I did any of this stuff), but isn't that a little difficult to do, even with something like Euler's theorem for help? [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 12:40, 23 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:I guess the question is a bit tricky. Just note that the inverse of 3 is 4. [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 07:55, 24 Aug 2004 (UTC)

:I think what students are supposed to see is that 5 is a generator, just like all the other elements in modulo 11 arithmetic.  If you can find which exponent i make 5&lt;sup&gt;i&lt;/sup&gt; = 1, then you can do normal arithmetic on the exponent.  In this case 5&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; = 1, so you figure 5&lt;sup&gt;99&lt;/sup&gt; = 5&lt;sup&gt;10 * 9 + 9&lt;/sup&gt;= (5&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; * 5&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; = (1)&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; * 5&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;.

hello everyone just reading through.  the discription of what the modular arithmatic is was a little confusing so I fixed it up a bit but the rest of the article is a bit hard to fallow through the modular arithmatic section.  I'm not exactly sure what the whole division and inversion section is saying.  the whole section on modular arthmetic brings up some un answered questions.  is there a real number version of modular arthimetic or is there only integers in modular arthimetic.  from there I kind of get lost.  good article though I like what I've read so far. --[[User:Stranger104|Stranger104]] 08:41, 16 Jun 2005 (UTC)

== Revision 1 ==

This chapter is the first chapter to be written. The material, despite others and my best effoects, remain somewhat chaotic and lacking focus. I have moved the much disputed (and confusing) part about division and inverses to Further Modular Arithmetic where it will received a rigorous treatment.
I have also tried to replace the somehwhat colloquiall language/tone with a formal one in most parts. Removal of the personality section on Arnold Ross has been agonised over many times, but the final decision is to remove it. [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 07:21, 6 August 2005 (UTC)

*Update*
Reorganised a bit, rewrote the inverses section after feedback receive, hope it's not as confusing as before, and that we won't get into arguments about technicalities this time. [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]] 08:05, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

Because Wikibooks encompasses many books, pages such as &quot;Table of Contents&quot; may often result where it is unclear which book it may belong to.  Thus, to help distinguish a page belonging to one book from a page belonging to another book, a series of naming conventions must be used.

Existing wikibooks that do not follow these conventions are highly recommended to move their pages appropriately so that they conform to these conventions.

== Naming conventions for new books ==
By convention, each module is associated with a book.  The associated book forms the first part of the module's title (for example, [[Cookbook:Rice]] is part of [[Cookbook]]).  The books are thus arranged in a hierarchical manner.

Currently, only two sets of conventions are permitted for new books, and it is suggested that a book be conformant solely to one of the two.  It is permissible, but not recommended, for a book to mix the two conventions.

=== General guidelines ===
* '''Do not abbreviate the name of the book in the title''' - For example, modules that are part of [[How To Build A Computer]] should always begin with &quot;How To Build A Computer&quot;, and never in an abbreviated form therein, such as &quot;HTBAC&quot;.
* '''Use descriptive titles throughout''' - Just because a page is solely within the scope of a book does not mean that titles can be generic beyond the first level.  It is recommended that titles at all levels should give a good hint to the content of the module.

=== The subpage convention ===
'''The subpage convention is recommended for new books.'''

The subpage convention, where titles are given as &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Name/Section]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, takes advantage of the subpage feature of MediaWiki to automatically create a hierarchical structure.  Thus, a page in a book's hierarchy will automatically be linked back to the book's main page (using tags like &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;__NOTOC__&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;).  This is handy for any book that has a linear or tree-like structure with a narrow, well-defined scope.

Examples of books using the subpage convention:
* [[Wikijunior Big Cats]]
* [[Wikijunior South America]]

=== The namespace convention ===
The namespace convention, where titles are given as &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Name:Section]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, has its titles made in the similar of the namespaces found in MediaWiki, with parts of titles being delimited by a colon.  This is best suited for books with a more general graph-like structure, or if the book covers a wider and less well-defined scope (for example, [[Cookbook]]).  However, back-links to the book's main page is not provided by default, and must be written manually to each page.  This, of course, allows for flexibility as to how these back-links are created and written.

Note that Wikibooks reserves the use of &quot;WB&quot; for its [[Wikibooks:Shortcuts|shortcuts]], &quot;Transwiki&quot; for Wikimedia's transwiki conventions, and the use of any module titled &quot;bookshelf&quot; for general book organization.

Examples of books using the namespace convention:
* [[Cookbook]]
* [[Programming]]
* [[Wikiversity]]

== Naming conventions for existing books ==
In general, the naming conventions of a book should be enforced over the entire book, and new additions to a book must follow existing book conventions.  If a book does not strictly conform to either of the two conventions above, it is advised that they should be made conformant to one of the two above.  Naming conventions that have been previously considered acceptable but have fallen in disuse include:

* The hyphen convention: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Name - Section]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
* The disambiguation convention: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Section (Name)]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, named for the convention used in Wikipedia for its [[w:Wikipedia:Disambiguation pages|disambiguation pages]]
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Name: Section]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Name / Section]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[Section]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, where there is no mention of the book name

== Naming conventions for templates, categories, images, and other media ==
For each book with the title ''Book Title'', the template subspace ''Template:Book Title'' and category subspace ''Category:Book Title'' is reserved for internal use by a book (for example, [[:Category:Wikibooks Pokédex:Normal Pokémon]] is an category internal to [[Wikibooks Pokédex]]).  All other templates and categories are reserved for either the Wikibooks proper, usage across multiple books, or future books.

It is recommended, but not a requirement, that images, and other media be named as per the module naming conventions.  As such, these pages should follow the conventions of their associated book.  The requirement for these pages to conform to naming conventions is less strict compared to modules as they often reside in the background.

In many cases these pages may span multiple books, in which case these conventions need not be followed.  Pages relating to the Wikibooks proper (such as policy pages) are also similarly exempt.
