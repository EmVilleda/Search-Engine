      <text xml:space="preserve">Hey PingPongBoy,

A very warm welcome to wikibooks ! I'm working 3 jobs right now and real busy but I will set aside time to help you as you need. I see your contribution of the intro to the Chemistry book ... its a start !

--[[User:Karl Wick|Karl Wick]]

If Karl isn't about, I'll be glad to help too. I saw your comment on slashdot and was wondering if you'd come and join our fun. [[User:Theresa knott|Theresa knott]] 22:19, 2 Feb 2004 (UTC)</text>

: Thanks!  I've been so busy with [http://recyclopedia.info Recyclopedia] recently that the Wiki Science textbook is lagging a bit.  I'll make it a bit better when I have a bit more time on my hands.

==Information Habitat==

G'day Chris

There's a proposal to move some problematic stuff from the English Wikipedia to the [[Wiki Science]] book you started. See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki:VfD-User_Information-Habitat_subpages this current deletion debate] and especially scroll down to the bottom of the page.

Obviously, I'd like your comments and those of other authors. 

I'm also a big Wiki fan, see my [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:Andrewa Wikipedia User page] which reads in part

''I'm excited about Wiki in general and the Wikipedia in particular. I suspect that Wiki is the fourth killer app for the internet, with usenet, email and WWW being the first three. No, I didn't forget ftp. We'll see.''

So who knows, I could even go from being a thorn in the side of this project to a contributor, assuming we can find it a home. Please get back to me. Better on my [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MediaWiki:VfD-User_Information-Habitat_subpages Wikipedia talk page] than the Wikibook one, although I will try to watch both for a little bit, or on the deletion debate page itself would be even better. [[User:Andrewa|Andrewa]] 20:53, 9 Apr 2004 (UTC)

:This is now well underway, but has gone to a Wikibook of its own instead (a much better solution), see [[Information_Ecology]]. [[User:Andrewa|Andrewa]] 17:44, 5 May 2004 (UTC)</text>

Physical changes in chemistry include phase changes and anything else that changes the way that matter is arranged in space. 

Examples of physical changes are: 
* breaking a stick 
* crushing ice
* melting ice
* stretching a rubber band
* boiling water

== Phase changes ==
The three basic phases of matter are [[Solids (General Chemistry)|solid]], [[Liquids (General Chemistry)|liquid]], and [[Gases (General Chemistry)|gas]]. (Under certain unusual conditions matter can transform into a phase called [[w:plasma|plasma]].)

A phase change is a change from one phase to another. The most common example is liquid water freezing into ice or evaporating into a gas. Phase changes result in different properties for the substance changing phases but the chemical identity of the material does not change. In the case of water, its molecules are always composed of two hydrogen atoms bonded to one oxygen atom. However, in frozen water the molecules are frozen into place in relation to each other in a structure called a crystal; in liquid water the molecules flow relative to each other; and water molecules in the gas phase are flying freely in space and seldom even contact each other.

Phase changes are controlled by temperature and pressure. By lowering the temperature of a gas it can be condensed into a liquid and then even into a solid. Heating a solid melts it into a liquid and then, with further heat, into a gas.gas solid liquid

==Appendix 3 - Voornaamwoorden ~ ''pronouns''==

Like English, Dutch has pronouns. These can mark '''number''', '''case''', '''gender''','''politeness''' and '''emphasis'''.

Pronouns can function either as substantives (nouns) or as adjectives. There is also a number of related adverbs that will be treated here. Adverbs are typically not considered pronouns in grammatical analysis, but they deserve mention when discussing the Dutch language because pronouns are often ''replaced'' by [[../Lesson 8|pronominal adverbs]].

===Persoonlijke voornaamwoorden ~ ''Personal pronouns''===

In this table personal pronouns are given in nominative, accusative and dative case. These cases signify the role the pronouns have in the sentence. For example: In &quot;I am hitting you&quot;, &quot;I&quot; is nominative (subject) and &quot;you&quot; is accusative (object). Also words with a preposition are in accusative case (&quot;you&quot; in &quot;I am looking at you&quot;). Dative case is special and tells us something is indirect object, as &quot;me&quot; in &quot;He gave me that&quot; or &quot;He built me a snowman&quot; or, with a preposition, &quot;He gave it to me&quot;.

|-
| South || '''gij''' || you || '''u''' || you
|-
| 3rd || || '''zij/ze''' || they || '''hen/hun'''*&lt;br&gt;'''ze'''
| them
|}

Remarks:
*Sometimes there are two forms (jij/je etc.), which can be interchanged most of the time. (See [[../Lesson 5|5]])
*Officially the plural 3rd person accusative form is '''hen'''. '''Hun''' is (officially) only used as a dative without preposition: &quot;''We hebben het hun verteld''&quot; (&quot;We told them about it&quot;). After a preposition '''hen''' should be used. This refers almost entirely to the written standard language and was artificially constructed by the grammarians of the past. In the spoken language ''hen'' is seldom heard. Even ''hun'' is increasingly replaced by ''ze'' as people tire of being told their use of ''hun'' is wrong by the schoolmasters. In the inanimate case the use of preposition+pronoun is rare, replacement by a pronominal adverb being preferred (See [[../Lesson 8|8]]).
*For inanimate objects personal and possessive pronouns are often [[../Lesson_4#Using_demonstrative_pronouns_instead_of_personal_pronouns|replaced]] by demonstrative pronouns.
*In the South -mostly Flanders- the gij-form is in regular use for the second person. It has its own verb endings. It adds a -t both in the present and the past: komen - gij kom'''t''' - gij '''''kwaamt'''''. In the North its use is limited to Biblical quotes like: ''gij zult niet stelen - thou shalt not steal''. Notice that ''u'' is used as object, ''without'' implying politeness.
 
====Bezittelijke voornaamwoorden ~ ''Possessive pronouns''====

Pssessive pronouns are essentially the adjectival forms of the personal pronouns.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;5&quot;
|-
| number || person || || Dutch || English
|-
| rowspan=&quot;6&quot; | singular || 1st || || '''mijn''' || my
|-
| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | 2nd || fam. || '''jouw/je'''
| your
|-
| polite || '''uw''' || your
|-
| rowspan=&quot;3&quot; | 3rd || m || '''zijn'''*3
| his
|-
| f || '''haar'''*3 || her
|-
| n || '''(zijn)'''*3 || its
|-
| rowspan=&quot;4&quot; | plural || 1st || || '''onze/ons''' || our
|-
| rowspan=&quot;2&quot; | 2nd || fam. || '''jullie'''
| your
|-
| polite || '''uw''' || your
|-
| 3rd || || '''hun''' || their
|}

Remarks:
#The difference between '''jouw''' and '''je''' is matter of emphasis or the lack thereof: &quot;''Dat is '''jouw''' huis.''&quot; vs. &quot;'''''Dat''' is je huis.''&quot; 
#'''Ons''' has an inflected form '''onze''' as most adjectives do (See [[../Lesson 2]]). Other possessives are seldom inflected in the modern language: ''Mijne Heren!'': ''Gentlemen!'', ''Hare Hoogheid'': ''Her Highness''. More regularly inflected forms are used when the pronoun is used as an independent noun: ''Met welke auto gaan we? De mijne of de jouwe?''. Jullie is never inflected, instead ''die van jullie'' is used.
# The neuter possessive pronoun ''zijn'' is very rare as Dutch usually opts for a construction involving a pronominal adverb like ''ervan''. (see [[../Lesson 8|8]]). The masculine and feminine forms are increasingly reserved for natural gender (persons, as in English) in other cases pronominal replacement is more and more the norm.

====Personal Adverb - ''er''====

Dutch has a somewhat curious personal locative adverb '''''er''''' that replaces ''het'' and ''ze'' particularly in inanimate cases (i.e. for things more so than for persons). It occurs as the locative part of many pronominal adverbs, such as :erin, erdoor, ervan etc. but it can also be used independently:

:er is koffie - there is coffee.
:er zijn mensen die dat lusten - there are people that like that

Notice that ''er'' is not considered the subject of these sentences (''koffie'' and ''mensen'' are the subject resp.)

===Aanwijzende voornaamwoorden -- Demonstrative pronouns===

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;5&quot;
!location!!neuter sg. !! all other !! English
|-
|close||dit||deze ||this, these
|-
|far||dat ||die|| that,those
|}

#Notice that the distinction dit-deze does '''''not''''' correspond to the distinction this-these. ''Deze'' is used in the plural but it also used in the singular for m/f words. (It replaces ''de''.)

Demonstrative pronouns are typically used as adjectives:

:Dit huis
:Deze auto

they can also be used independently:

:dit is een huis
:Zijn auto? Die heb ik gezien

They are more and more used to replace inanimate personal pronouns.

====Aanwijzende bijwoorden - demonstrative adverbs====

;temporal

Dutch has three demonstrative adverbs of time:

#past: toen -then
#: hij heeft toen een huis gekocht - he bought a house then
#present: nu - now
#: nu woont hij er - now he lves there
#future/conditional: dan - then
#: hij het dan verkopen - then he'll sell it

;modal

One modal demonstrative adverb is common:

: zo - so

Occasionally a more proximate one ''zus'' is used for contrast

: Dat doe je zus en zo - You do that this way and that.

;locative

Two locative adverbs are in common use:

#close by: hier - here
#far off: daar - there

Both of them are used as the locative part of demonstrative pronominal adverbs like: hierdoor, daarvan etc.

A third adverb is less common:

#remote: ginds, ginder, daarginds -yonder 

===Betrekkelijke voornaamwoorden -- Relative pronouns===

====Zelfstandig- substantive====

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;5&quot;
!antecedent!!neuter sg. !!all other!! English
|-
|after||dat||die || that/who
|-
|included||wat||wie|| the one that/who&lt;br&gt;whoever/that which
|}

Without ''antecedent'':

:Dit is het huis '''dat''' ik koop -this is the house that I buy
:Dit is de auto '''die''' ik koop - this is the car that I buy
:Dit is de vrouw '''die''' ik lief heb - the is the woman whom I love

With inclusion of antecedent.

:'''Wie''' mij steunt zal ik belonen - whoever supports me I shall reward
:Ik verkocht '''wat''' ik eerder gekocht had - I sold that which I had bought earlier.

There are a number of archaic forms that can be used with prepostitions:

:neuter:'''hetwelk''', '''hetgeen''', '''hetgene''', '''datgene''' : that which
:other: '''dewelke'''
:persons '''degene die''': he who, '''diegenen die''': those who

As in English the genitives '''wiens''' and '''wier''' (whose) can be used in relative clauses referring to persons:

: ik ontmoette de man wiens vrouw voor ons werkt - I met the man whose wife works for us.

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;5&quot;
!case!! masc sg.!!fem sg./plur!! English
|-
|genitive||wiens||wier || whose
|}

In inanimate cases the relative pronominal adverb '''waarvan''' is virtually mandatory.

====Bijvoeglijk - adjective====

{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;5&quot;
!neuter sg. !!all other!! English
|-
|welk||welke || which
|}

:ik weet welk boek hij gebruikt - I know which book he uses
:ik weet niet in welke steden trams rijden - I do not know in which cities streetcars are operated

====Bijwoordelijk - adverbial====

;locative

'''waar''' - where

:''Waar'' can be used to initiate a dependent clause:

:dit is de stad waar ik geboren ben - this is the town where I was born

''Waar'' is also used to form the relative pronominal adverbs like waarvan, waarvoor etc. that frequently replace relative pronouns.

==Gesprek 3-1==
Mam teaches her toddler, Jeroen to count:

:''Jeroen'': ook vijf!
:''Mam'': Ja, tel ze maar: zes, zeven, acht, negen en tien

==Leren 3 ~ Tellen van 1 tot 12==
In Dutch, as in English, there are both '''ordinal''' and '''cardinal''' numbers, and number formation is similar in that the first twelve numbers are unique. Above twelve, numbers are formed by combination. For example, 15 is ''vijftien'' and 16 is ''zestien''. Other numbers will be the subject of more advanced lessons.

Note in the table how ordinals are formed from the cardinals in Dutch by adding '''''-de'''''. 'Ten' becomes 'tenth' in English; '''''tien''''' become '''''tiende''''' in Dutch. As in English, there are several variants: ''eerste'', ''derde'', and ''achtste''.

Remark: '''een''' is used both as an indefinite article (''a'' or ''an'') and a number (''one''). One often puts accents on the e's when ''one'' is meant in case of ambiguity: '''&amp;eacute;&amp;eacute;n'''. There is also a difference in pronunciation: /ən/ ([[Wikipedia:en:schwa|schwa]]-n) for the article and /e:n/ (ayn) for the number.
&lt;!-- '''Audio''': [[media:Zahlen.ogg|OGG]] (48KB) --&gt;
===Eerst en laatst===
The ordinals are a special kind of adjectives. They always have the inflection -e. So, words like *zesd do not exist. The only exception is ''eerst''. As in English, it can be used as an adverb:

:Hij gaat ''eerst'' naar huis - he ''first'' goes home

Its opposite (antonym) is ''laatst'' as adverb and ''laatste'' as adjective:

:de laatste trein - the last train.

==Pronunciation drills 3-1. Your turn to say something- Uw beurt om iets te zeggen!!==
{{Dutch/Exercise|Listen and speak
|Repeat the pronunciation in the pauses:
#{{Audio|Nl-12345.ogg|listen to the numbers 5-4-3-2-1}}

A good trick is to do an exercise twice and repeat it after 20 minutes or so again. Then do it the next day again.

*''Charley'': I'd love to, but what time is it? (lit.: How late is it?)
*''Henry'': It is one o'clock
*''Charley'': Then I can still play until two o'clock.
*''Henry'': That's all right. We can play for another hour

[[Image:Nl-Dutch-grammatica-3-1.ogg|40px|noicon]]
Asking for the time is accomplished by the sentence: 
:''Hoe laat is het?'' (&quot;What time is it?&quot;, ''lit''. &quot;How late is it?&quot;).

The answer is:
: ''Het is ____ uur'' - &quot;It is ____ o'clock&quot;, substituting the correct cardinal value.

===Half===
The half hours are indicated differently in Dutch:

:het is half '''''twaalf''''' - '''''11''''':30
::it is half past ''eleven''

===Kwart===
:het is kwart voor zes - 5:45
:het is kwart over zes - 6:15

==Grammatica 3-2 ~ Some more word order: inversion==

We have seen that inversion of subject and verb is used to create a question:

:'''Het is''' twee uur 
:Hoe laat '''is het'''?

However, recall from the conversation that inversion happens for other reasons.

:...daarna ''breng je''... 
:...''op een middag komen ze''...

These are not questions, still there is inversion. The reason is that the adverb ''daarna'' or the adverbial expression ''op een middag'' was put before the ''subject'' + ''verb'' part for '''''emphasis'''''. This causes inversion. We could also have said:

:Jij brengt mij daarna op je motor naar huis.
:Zij komen elkaar op een middag tegen.

Notice that the verb loses final -t when using the informal second person jij or je in such cases as it does in questions:

:jij brengt - breng je

{{Dutch/Exercise|inversion for emphasis
| 
The following sentences end in an adverbial expression like ''in the morning''. Put this expression a the front of the sentence for emphasis. Be sure to use clitics when appropriate and not when not.

# wij voetballen niet ''op straat''.
# hij komt ''om twee uur''
# het gaat goed ''met je'' 
# het rode huis staat ''op de hoek''
# hij heet ''Jan van 't Hoff''
# wij brengen jou niet ''met de motor'' naar huis
|
# ''op straat'' voetballen we niet .
# ''om twee uur'' komt hij.
# met jou gaat het goed  
# ''op de hoek'' staat het rode huis  
# ''Jan van 't Hoff'' heet hij
# ''met de motor'' brengen we je niet naar huis
}}

==Grammatica 3-3 ~ Introduction to ''naamwoorden''==

Dutch grammar uses the word ''naamwoord'' (''lit.'' name-word) that does not translate well into English. ''Naamwoorden'' indicates a rather broad class of words, both independently used (like nouns) or used to specify another word (like adjectives). Dutch grammar is therefore structured a bit differently from the English one. Besides ''naamwoorden'' there are two other large classes of words in Dutch: ''werkwoorden'' (verbs) and ''bijwoorden'' (adverbs).

A '''[[Wikipedia:en:Noun|noun]]'''  is a fundamental part of speech, occurring in sentences in two different ways: as subjects (performers of action), or objects (recipients of action). As a generality, a noun is the name of a &quot;person, place, thing or concept&quot;. 

Nouns are classified into 
#proper nouns (''eigennamen''): e.g. &quot;Janet&quot;
#common nouns (''zelfstandige naamwoorden''): e.g. &quot;girl&quot;
#cardinals (''telwoorden''): e.g. one, two, three, etc.
#pronouns (''voornaamwoorden''): e.g. &quot;she&quot;, &quot;her&quot;

The latter group is often considered a separate class of words. They stand in for (pro-, voor-) nouns. Words like &quot;hij&quot; - &quot;he&quot; are known as personal pronouns (''persoonlijke voornaamwoorden'')

Dutch has its own grammatical nomenclature and to use dictionaries and grammars it is useful to know it.

Noun is rendered as ''zelfstandig naamwoord'' ('nameword that stands on itself'). An adjective is called ''bijvoeglijk naamwoord'' (nameword that can be added). ''Naamwoord'' is more general than noun. It derives from the Latin term ''nomen'': nomen substantivum (zelfstandig naamwoord) and nomen adiectivum (bijvoeglijk naamwoord).

Adjectives are usually added to nouns to further determine them:

:&quot;mooi&quot; weer
:&quot;beautiful&quot; weather

Some pronouns, e.g. possessive pronouns (''bezittelijk voornaamwoord'') are used as adjectives:

:&quot;mijn&quot; auto
:&quot;my&quot; car

A special class of adjectives is formed by the articles (''lidwoorden''):

:&quot;the&quot; car
:&quot;de&quot; auto

===Gender of Nouns===
We have seen evidence of word gender in the pronouns we have been encountering; notably 'he', 'she', and 'it' in English and '''''hij''''', '''''zij''''', and '''''het''''' in Dutch. We also saw that adjectives depend on gender in Dutch.

There are a few rules that help to determine a noun's gender, but mostly it must be learned as children do: word by word.

Noun gender is also reflected in the ''definite article''  It should always be learned as ''part of the noun'', as this is a good way to memorize gender.

===Definite Articles===
Definite articles are equivalent to an English 'the', and the two basic gender forms in Dutch are as follows:

:'''het''': neuter singular (pronounce /hEt/, &quot;h-eh-t&quot;)
:'''de''': (pronounce /də/) all other cases

====Animate nouns====

Much like in English there are three genders for animate nouns (people, pets etc.) and this shows up clearly in their personal pronouns: ''hij, zij and het''  (he, she and it) and their possessive pronouns ''zijn, haar and zijn'' (his, her, its):

:To say 'the man' in Dutch, you would say '''''de man''''', because ''man'' is a '''masculine''' noun.
::You refer to ''de man'' with ''hij'' (he): '''''Hij''' is een man''. ''Een man en '''zijn''' (his) hond''
:To say 'the woman' in Dutch, you would say '''''de vrouw''''', because ''vrouw'' is a '''feminine''' noun. 
::You would say: '''''Zij''' (she) is een vrouw''. ''Een vrouw en '''haar''' (her) werk''
:To say 'the calf' in Dutch, you would say '''het kalf''', because ''kalf'' is a '''neuter''' noun. 
::You would say: '''''Het''' (it) is een kalf''. ''Een kalf en '''zijn''' (its) stal''

However, ''zijn'' is not used much anymore to refer to a neuter word and we will see a different way of expressing &quot;its&quot; later.

In the plural the gender distinctions are absent: ''de mannen, de vrouwen, de kalveren'' are all referred to by ''zij'' (they) and ''hun'' (their).

As you see the definite article is the same for masculine and feminine, but it is not just definite articles, but also adjectives and pronouns that must match the gender of the noun they are related to.

====Inanimate nouns====

In the Netherlands (the North) the distinction between masculine and feminine was lost for ''inanimate'' nouns (things, concepts etc.) in the 17th century. The feminine and the masculine have merged into a ''common'' gender north of ''de grote riveren'' (the Great Rivers: the Meuse, the Rhine and its branches) almost entirely. Someone learning the language therefore best considers Dutch a '''''two-gender language''''' for anything but persons:

:the clock is ''de klok'', because it is ''common gender''
:the book is  ''het boek'', because it is ''neuter gender''

This does not hold for the South, where a &quot;de klok&quot; may still be referred to as &quot;zij&quot; (she), but it is acceptable standard Dutch to disregard the masculine-feminine distinction.

By contrast, the twofold split common-neuter is still very much alive in Dutch and this must be mastered by any beginner to learn the language well. Therefore, it is important when learning Dutch nouns to always learn them '''together''' with their correct '''definite article'''. That is:
:: Memorize the word for 'book' in Dutch as '''''het''' boek'', not simply ''boek''.
:: Memorize the word for 'clock' in Dutch as '''''de''' klok'', not simply ''klok''.

This is by far the most important thing you should do right now. The fine distinctions between the varieties of the language can wait.

====The reference problem====

As we saw above the personal pronouns (hij,zij,het) still show the three-gender distinction that Dutch inherited from its Indoeuropean ancestry. That makes it hard to use personal pronouns for an inanimate common gender word. Nowadays ''hij'' and ''zij'' are pretty much restricted to people or their pets, so they indicate ''natural'' rather than ''grammatical'' gender, certainly in the North. In the South ''de klok'' may still be called a ''she'', but Northerners avoid such references and so should you. Notice that you cannot resort to ''het'' (it) as done in English, because ''de klok'' is '''not''' neuter...

This leaves roughly two thirds of all inanimate nouns without a personal pronoun to refer them by. For possessive pronouns (his, her, its) a similar problem exists.

We shall see three common ways that speakers use to avoid this reference problem:

*[[Dutch/Lesson_4#Using_demonstrative_pronouns_instead_of_personal_pronouns|using demonstratives]] 
*[[Dutch/Lesson_8#Grammatica_8._Er_and_the_pronominal_adverbs|using pronominal adverbs]]
*[[Dutch/Lesson 7#Grammatica 7.2 Diminutives|using diminutives (always neuter)]]

These three aspects of the language play a more prominent role in Dutch than they do in English. One could say that the merger of m/f into common gender has triggered a number of shifts in the language, that for example German or English do not have and must be mastered to speak Dutch well.

===Rules for gender===

There are a few general (and helpful) rules for gender:

#Diminutives are neuter: de klok → het klokje
#Words in -ing, -heid, -teit, -te carry ''de''. (they are actually feminine, but do not worry about that).
#Loans usually retain their gender: (''Latin'') museum → het museum (both neuter).

Another helpful fact is that all genders behave the same in the plural, all use ''de'', ''die'', ''zij'' etc.

Apart from these general rules, nouns should be memorized '''''together with their definite article'''''. So, learn &quot;de klok&quot;, not just &quot;klok&quot; and &quot;het paard&quot; not just &quot;paard&quot;

===Double gender===

There is an interesting group of words for which the natural gender is in conflict with the grammatical gender, e.g. diminutives of people:

:The girl: ''het meisje''
:The (little) boy: ''het jongetje''

Grammatically they are neuter and their articles, adjectives and demonstratives follow the neuter pattern. However the personal and possessive pronouns follow the natural gender:

: Een mooi (n!) meisje en ''haar'' (f!) [[wikt:en:moeder|moeder]]
: Dat (n!) jongetje? Hij (m!) is niet hier

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sorry yo, but what use is Interlingua anyway? 

Reduce EU Budget? 
What should I do with my degree, then?

Improve communication?
Were the Esperanto/Anglic/... experiments not enough?

Should it be THE international language?
Don't we have English, already?

And try to get Americans (still more than 60% of internet users) to speak Interlingua, if you can!

And sorry, but it just sounds too... Latin - how about 5.something billion people speaking a non-latin language?

DS

:I'm no Interlingua supporter, and I probably shouldn't go off-topic like this here, but...
*Interlingua itself is spoken by very few. The only successful IAL has been Esperanto, with about 1 to 2 million speakers.
*I have no idea what your degree is, but unless you're a translator I don't see it affecting you greatly...
*The only &quot;widely&quot; spoken IAL is Esperanto. Its nearest follower, an old offshoot called Ido, has between 500 and 5000 speakers.
*Yes, an IAL of some sort should be the international language. It would be neutral, fair, and protect minority languages, of which hundreds are expected to perish this century if something isn't done. English is spoken by about 8.5% of the world's population - not quite international.
*The point of an IAL, to my mind, is that it should be very easy. Even Americans should have no problem learning one like Esperanto :)
*I doubt the five-billion figure you quoted there very much. But, you have to pick somewhere to take words from, otherwise you just start creating them, which helps no-one. One view is that it's fairer to have Latin-group speakers learning in one year and non-Latin-group speakers learning in two years than for the Latins to do nothing and the non-Latins to learn for ten years.
*&lt;shamelessplug&gt; May I suggest you see [[Esperanto]]? &lt;/shamelessplug&gt; -- [[User:Gabriel Beecham|Gabriel Beecham]] 01:09, 6 Apr 2004 (UTC)

But why not to learn [[Interlingua]] or give an opportunitiy to folks to learn it, at least?

::Wow...  Is this really the comment page for &quot;Introducing Interlingua&quot;?  I'm amazed at the two comments above.  They show a complete lack of understanding of what Interlingua is all about.  The article merely stated that Interlingua is a great option for speakers of one language (such as English) to learn another (such as most Romance languages).  It said nothing about forcing the world to speak this language, or that it should even be employed when Japanese people speak to Chinese people, etc.  Yes, we have an International language (English) and yes, we have a constructed language that its proponents hope will become the main second language of the world (Esperanto).  Interlingua claims to be neither.

::Instead, the biggest reason I'm learning Interlingua now is that I've always wanted to learn Spanish or Italian and such, and I've in fact tried to learn Spanish, but I gave it up because I just hated the unnecessary verb conjugations, including loads of irregular verbs.  Latin is even harder, with noun declension and such.  However, Interlingua is a cinch.  Thus, I've been able to focus on the vocabulary instead of the grammar, and have gotten much farther in it in a much shorter time than I normally would have.  I can also see so many similarities between English words and Romance language words that it borrowed, and which make up half of the English language.  Learning Interlingua helps me not only learn all of the Romance languages (I'm now much better at reading Spanish, for example), but also increases my English vocabulary, because many of these Romance language words are scientific and such.  This is the use that Interlingua was intended for.

::The fact is, Esperanto is an interesting language, but it won't help you learn Spanish.  Nor should it, for its purpose, which is different than Interlingua's.  Gabriel Beecham, above, wrote that we need to protect minority languages instead of trying to extinguish them.  I agree completely.  So that's why I don't understand why you're trying to put down Interlingua, when some people are interested in it.  Although I'm sure that Gabriel doesn't speak for the Esperanto movement, I must say that I thought that Esperanto's ideals were peace and understanding, not fighting amongst ourselves.  Yet Gabriel jumps in and insults a language that has no bearing on his life.  It's like saying &quot;Hungarian shouldn't be the world's official language!  Few people know it and it's not fair to non-Hungarians!&quot;  Well, duh.  But Hungarian is not trying to be the world's language, and neither is Interlingua.  But I do appreciate Interlingua for helping me out, and I do appreciate those who have given their time freely to help me learn it.  To the above commenters, I should also note that I AM an American (and not stupid as a brick, as you might believe), and I'm learning Interlingua (for my own happiness, and my own reasons, not so that I can communicate with you two), and that I have no plans to learn Esperanto, although I might some day.  I'm too busy also with Japanese and Chinese right now. --[[User:202.215.70.67|202.215.70.67]] 13:41, 26 August 2007 (UTC)</text>

Groundhog day

Writing some text into chemistry book. I want to learn chemistry by writing about it. I studied a little chemistry over 10 years ago but I anticipate needing to know it, along with quantum mechanics, and whole bunch of math. What fun.

__TOC__
We've got that large tabley thing set up in the conventions (It might be better placed under the board set up section). However that table would be a real headache to use repeatedly (its huge HTML code). The best solution I've seen yet is that chess board tex markup from wikisophia (see it here: http://wikisophia.org/wiki/Wikitex#Chess). However from my simple little tests that isn't supported yet here.

So for standard representation of chess boards, for now I recommend we just stick to simple to complex Ascii diagrams, using PNBRKQ/pnbrkq for black and white respectively. That should do until that sweet sweet wikitex project becomes more standard in the wikiworld.

: I hope you're not referring to algebraic notation, the virtual ''lingua franca'' of chess notation. Fine for ASCII showing the boards or whatever, but its important to teach writing chess as well... [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 03:59, 3 Feb 2004 (UTC)

: Why is uppercase for Black and lowercase for White? The standard convention is the opposite, e.g. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forsyth-Edwards_Notation Forsyth-Edwards_Notation]. --[[User:68.122.41.19|68.122.41.19]] 18:55, 26 Mar 2005 (UTC)

No (that former post was mine), the tex markup, just lets a tex backend generate a diagram of the chess set up. A very very nice looking diagram. As we'll it labels the move history, so its ideal for transcribing chess games.
[[User:WarrenWilkinson|WarrenWilkinson]] 21:53, 3 Feb 2004 (UTC)

: Problem is it uses ''long'' algebraic, not short! :C I like the rendering, but it means I have to sit there and by sight transcribe famous games if I want them to be rendered by WikiTeX! [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 22:22, 3 Feb 2004 (UTC)

::WikiTeX now supports SAN and PGN in addition to algebraic. [[User:Peter Danenberg|Peter Danenberg]] 11:28, 10 Mar 2005 (UTC)

I'm still not entirely sure what you mean. Do you mean it uses the notation like QP2-QP4, instead of like e4-e6? Or are you against having to reproduce a chess match in part to display a picture of the certain result? [[User:WarrenWilkinson|WarrenWilkinson]] 03:33, 4 Feb 2004 (UTC)
: long - b1-c3 , short - Nc3. The Wikisophia Chess markup handles moves ''only'' in long algebraic, and ''not'' short which all game records use, so in order to use the Wikisophia markup to show a game it has to be translated into long algebraic first which is a pain - the \move or \ply commands only does b1c3, for example. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 03:56, 4 Feb 2004 (UTC)

(Brainstorming) How about a special moves section that details moves like castling and ''en passant'' and where they apply.  Possibly also mention non-standard chess pieces and chess problems? -- [[User:Emperorbma|Emperorbma]] 19:12, 4 Feb 2004 (UTC)
: Yeah, I was just thinking where to slot it in... [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 20:59, 4 Feb 2004 (UTC)

I didn't know there were non-standard chess pieces. Do you mean chess varients? Or do other places play standard Chess with an alternate piece set? If its the former a section on chess varients may be appropriate, if the latter we should try to slot them into the actual document. Does anyone here know the names of different Chess notations? I'd like to include them, currently I've added the relative position, for lack of a better name, it looks like this

:'''1. QN1-QB3, ... ''' (1. B1-C3) (Queens Night to Bishop 3)

I've added that under the topic 'Alternate' Notation. Does anyone know its name, and/or the names of other notations?[[User:WarrenWilkinson|WarrenWilkinson]] 03:17, 6 Feb 2004 (UTC)

:: That's a European style notation, and is really rather ancient, and not many use it any more. Should we really include it here? (I'll find the name, in any case). There aren't really nonstandard ''chess'' pieces, but in chess ''variants'' you can have these. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 11:46, 6 Feb 2004 (UTC)

::Non-standard chess pieces... aka [[en:Fairy chess piece]]s. -- [[User:Emperorbma|Emperorbma]] 07:40, 8 Feb 2004 (UTC)

The alternate notation is called 'Descriptive Notation' and although it is not used much anymore it is worth knowing because there are a few books written in it which are worth reading (e.g. Irving Chernev's &quot;The Most Instructive Games of Chess Ever Played&quot;).

== Organizing the book ==

Hi, the chess book has been growing for a while, and it covers enough content to think about splitting it into several sub-pages. There are various ways of doing this, as discussed in [[Wikibooks:Hierarchy naming scheme]]. I would recommend having only a short introduction on the main page of chess, and a table of contents like
 [[Chess]]
 [[Chess/Conventions]]
 [[Chess/Basics]]
 [[Chess/Playing The Game]]
 [[Chess/Notating The Game]]
and so on. Avoid having red links or very short pages. A couple of chapters should be enough. Using subpages, each page gets an automatic link back to the main chess page. Have a look at [[Hamster Care]] or [[How To Build A Computer]] how it is done there, or look at the recent conversions [[User talk:Ojmorales0002#Organization of the Golden Bough]] or [[Talk:How To Build A Computer#Organizing the book]]. Let me know if you need help or if there are questions. --[[User:Andreas Ipp|Andreas]] 11:53, 20 Mar 2005 (UTC)

There is a section called 'Notating The Game'. Could it be renamed to 'Annotating The Game' because notating is not a real word, and the correct word is annotating
-- CRF - Chessplayer
:No, we can't. &quot;Notating&quot; is in fact a real word. However, you're right in that &quot;Notating&quot; is not the correct term, but &quot;annotating&quot; refers to making comments about the moves played in the game, giving variations, evaluating positions, etc. The correct term is &quot;scoring&quot;.
--[[User:Anonymouse|Anonymouse--nerd and proud of it]] ([[User talk:Anonymouse|talk]]) 11:52, 23 June 2008 (UTC)

:I was just going to suggest that but I see you were faster. :) I would break it using the existing top level headings:

== Maybe use template? ==

What do you think of using the template for chess boards (borrowed from the English Wikipedia), instead of the long table? Here is an example of its use, along with the old style:

::There is a nice project going on for a cross-wiki Chess diagram template.  See [[:meta:WikiProject_Chess]] for details.  I've copied the new &quot;standard&quot; template from Commons to WikiBooks.  The template is called Chess_diagram, and here's what it looks like:

== Chess variants ==

There is a VfD discussion that has an impact on this Wikibook at the moment.  Don't worry, we are not trying to delete this Wikibook, but there is a Wikibook that appears to be a chess variant, and perhaps its content could be modified and adapted to be included in this Wikibook.  See [[Wikibooks:Votes for deletion#NeoRandom Chess]] for further details.  The point here is that this Wikibook is inappropriate if left alone, but my opinion is that it should be included in this Wikibook.  If you (any reader who gets to this point) feel it perhaps should go elsewhere, speak your mind on the VfD page or &quot;forever hold your peace&quot;.  If there are any active participants on this Wikibook, I would invite you to join in the discussion.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 10:42, 20 August 2005 (UTC)

== Important notice ==

The Chess wikibook had separate chapters called Basic Openings and Opening Theory. The Opening Theory module covered the same broad subject as Basic Openings but using a significantly different approach. While Basic Openings was a linear chapter, Opening Theory aimed to be an opening explorer along the lines of this web site [http://www.eudesign.com/chessops]. In addition, Basic Openings was... basic, while Opening Theory had a theoretically unlimited depth.

'''I have made the former Opening Theory chapter of the Chess wikibook into a separate wikibook, called 'Opening theory in chess'.'''

My reasons for doing this centre on the fact that the Chess wikibook is meant to a) reach 100% completion eventually and b) be something that a reader can get through from cover to cover and which will provide a working knowledge of the basics of chess. The Opening Theory chapter was inconsistent with this because:

*Opening theory ''dwarfs'' the rest of chess literature. One needs only to look at the typical bookstall at a chess tournament to see this. It would take a long time and a lot of effort to create the definitive guide to chess openings, which would retard the completion of the Chess wikibook as a whole. Indeed, Chess is nearing completion, while Opening theory in chess is close to 0%.
*The Opening Theory chapter was intended to be open-ended and constantly evolving in breadth and depth, like the Cookbook, with the result that Chess could ''never'' be 100% complete. Better, to my mind, to have one complete and readable book with a link to another constantly evolving one 'for further information'. 
*The concepts behind opening theory get complicated and potentially off-putting to someone who simply wants to know a bit about chess.

I believe this complies with Wikibooks' no-forking policy because:
*The approaches used by the two books are completely different
*The content itself differs in scope and depth
*The minimal actual duplication of material is for the greater good of Wikibooks as I have explained above.

== Chess puzzles for one and all ==

I am preparing a set of chess puzzles from actual games and published problems for my students in a real-life chess class.  I have decided to use the Wiki software to make the chess diagrams.

The puzzles, with solutions given on a separate page, are available on my userpage.  At some later time, I intend to copy them into the chess book.  If anyone wishes to do it immediately, I have no objection, as long as I can keep the original copy in my userspace.

I hope everyone who wants to try the puzzles will enjoy them. [[User:Shalom|Shalom]] ([[User talk:Shalom|talk]]) 02:59, 7 December 2007 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Vietnamese creates comparatives and superlatives out of adjectives and adverbs simply by adding a word to the end. First of all, what are [[Wiktionary:comparative|comparatives]] and [[Wiktionary:superlative|superlatives]]? Comparatives are demonstrated in the following sentences:

:He is '''taller''' than I am.
:You have '''more''' than I do.

They simply express a comparison between two items. Superlatives are demonstrated in the following sentences:

:He is the '''tallest''' of the three.
:She brought the '''most''' cookies.

They express the outcome of a comparison between more than two items. (All of the items being compared, except for &quot;she,&quot; are implied in the second sentence.)

===Comparatives===
In Vietnamese, comparatives are formed by placing ''hơn'' after the adjective or adverb. For example:

:Nó cao '''hơn''' anh.
::''He is taller than I.'' (literally: ''He tall more me.'')
:Ông có '''hơn''' con.
::''You, sir, have more than I.'' (literally: ''You (sir) have more me.'')

''(More to come.)''

LPIC updated their exam objectives, I am updating TOC to match that. Many pages are renamed or merged to match new structure. Once done I hope to find some time to start updating chapters with up to date information.

:I created new TOC and moved most of the pages. Some of them are remaining but I do not think they will be used in this part of the book. I am going to create remove old TOC soon leaving small section with redundant pages, I hope content can be reused somewhere else.

I have switched to an alternative.  Wikibooks is nice, but the lag is a problem for me.  It is better after hardware upgrades and the download page seems to work now.  However I was not successful with installing the software locally.  The install script would not complete.  Instead I have started work on a similar project at http://orca.st.usm.edu/~seyfarth/wiki

If anyone wants to copy any of the orcawiki material to this wikibooks site, that is fine with me.  I will probably try to install wikibooks again when another release is available.  I could be happy with a wikibook setup with a local copy on orca so I can count on adequate performance.

== Page Merger ==
I did a history merge, which is better than a copy and paste history. Thanks for remembering to move the history though. In the future, when you need to move modules, use the ''merge'' tab at the top of the page. Alternatively, you can ask an admin to do it (ie. if a page already exists at the new location). Thanks! '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &amp;#124; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 12:30, 22 September 2007 (UTC)
:Thanks Mike although i have no merge option that i can see?[[User:Barry Sharpe|Barry]] 12:39, 22 September 2007 (UTC)
::Freudian slip. I wish there was a merge tab! I meant ''move'' tab. '''&amp;ndash; [[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/font&gt;]]''' &amp;#124; &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;font color=&quot;Indigo&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:48, 22 September 2007 (UTC)
:::Barry did move the modules. I think Barry was trying to merge two talk pages as part of a plan to reorganize this book. I guess I should of mentioned requesting a page merge when copy+pasting the contents of one page into another one. However this doesn't really work for partial attempts to merge two pages, while keeping the rest separate. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:18, 22 September 2007 (UTC)
::::This does now pose a question, would you rather i notified the administrators to perform the merge? As the existing pages in the book such as this one [[LPI_Linux_Certification/LPIC1_Exam_101/Hardware_&amp;_Architecture]] will need splitting and placing into the new layout. I am only to aware of how busy the admins are. [[User:Barry Sharpe|Barry]] 17:28, 22 September 2007 (UTC)
:::::I believe Mike.lifeguard thought you were trying to move a page, and had copy+pasted because you didn't know how to move pages, but what you were trying to do instead was combine two pages. When you plan to combine two pages, you need to copy+paste, because the other page already exists, and add {{tlx|now merged|what page to merge with}} to the page you copy and pasted from, which will allow any active administrators know you need two pages to be merged. A merger is required to preserve the contribution history of other contributors. When you split a page there shouldn't be anything else you need to do. I didn't think that the LPI 101 and 102 test objectives were going to be combined, so I didn't think to tell you what needed to be done when you want you combine two pages. Also since I'm mentioning it, in a more active book with active contributors you would probably want to use {{tlx|mergeto}} and {{tlx|mergefrom}} and discuss merging the pages first. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 18:17, 22 September 2007 (UTC)</text>

'''Bubble and Squeak''' is a traditional English vegetable dish made from the leftover vegetables from a Sunday roast.  The name is derived from the sound the dish makes while cooking.

==Ingredients==
*1 medium [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]], chopped (optional)
*1 tablespoon [[Cookbook:Oil and fat|fat or oil]]
*Various cooked [[Cookbook:Vegetable|vegetable]]s, [[Cookbook:Potato|potatoes]] and [[Cookbook:Cabbage|cabbage]], optionally [[Cookbook:Carrot|carrots]], [[Cookbook:Pea|peas]], and [[Cookbook:Brussels Sprout|Brussels sprouts]].

==Procedure==
#Start by frying a chopped [[Cookbook:Onion|onion]] in fat or oil. (if using)
#Chop the vegetables (which will have been boiled the previous day) together, and add to the pan.  
#Cook over a medium heat till the underside is golden brown and crispy, then turn it, scraping the crispy bits into the mix.  
#Repeat the turning and scraping a few times until browned and cooked through, then serve (often on crunchy toast).

'''Christmas pudding''' is the dessert traditionally served on [[Cookbook:Holiday Recipes#Christmas|Christmas]] day in the [[Cookbook:Cuisine of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] (especially England) and some other Commonwealth countries such as Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and Canada.  It is sometimes known as '''plum pudding''', though this can also refer to other kinds of boiled pudding involving a lot of dried fruit.
[[Image:Christmas-pudding-flames.jpg|thumb|right|450px|Christmas pudding being flamed with brandy]]
The pudding needs to be made and cooked well in advance, to allow the flavours to mix (and to save the cook labour on Christmas Day); it is merely reheated when it is to be eaten.

The following is a Sussex recipe for Christmas pudding that is known to have been in annual use for over 50 years without a break, and is believed to have been used largely unaltered since the late nineteenth century, despite the difficulties in gathering the ingredients during the rationing in force in the UK in two world wars.  All measurements are in imperial units (with metric measurements in brackets), generally meaning that volume measurements are 20% larger than with the Queen Anne units used in the USA.  Originally, twice or even four times these quantities would have been made.

(As an aside; Jane Grigson notes in her wonderful book &quot;English Food&quot; that Mrs Beeton's recipe for Steak and Kidney pudding was sent in by a correspondent from Sussex and mentions that by the 1850s, when Mrs Beeton was writing, that Sussex had been famous for its puddings for at least a century.  Mrs Grigson thus conjectured that steak and kidney pudding also had its origins in Sussex.  The most famous pudding indubitably linked to the county is Sussex Pond Pudding, the most magnificent of all suet puddings.)

==Ingredients==
To make '''two''' [[Cookbook:Pint|1-pint]] (0.56 litres) puddings ('''remember:''' use the same measurements throughout (imperial or metric))
*½ [[Cookbook:Pound|pound (lb)]] (225g) [[Cookbook:Raisin|raisin]]s
*¾ lb (340g) [[Cookbook:Currant|currant]]s
*½ lb (225g) [[Cookbook:Sultana|sultana]]s
*½ lb (225g) [[Cookbook:Sugar|sugar]] (or less)
*¾ lb (340g) shredded [[Cookbook:Suet|suet]] (can be vegetarian; see note below)
*½ lb (225g) [[Cookbook:Bread|breadcrumb]]s
*¼ lb (110g) crystallised peel
*2 [[Cookbook:Teaspoon|teaspoons (tsp)]] [[Cookbook:Cinnamon|cinnamon]]
*2 [[Cookbook:Ounce|oz]] (55g) [[Cookbook:Almond|almond]]s (chopped, but not too small)
*1/3 [[Cookbook:Cup|cup]] (about 60g) [[Cookbook:Flour|flour]]
*1/3 [[Cookbook:Pint|pint]] (about 190ml) [[Cookbook:Milk|milk]]
*3 large [[Cookbook:Egg|egg]]s (beaten)
*[[Cookbook:Brandy|Brandy]]
*Juice and rind of 1 [[Cookbook:Lemon|lemon]]
*1/3 of a [[Cookbook:Nutmeg|nutmeg]]

==Procedure==
#Mix and stir well.
#Place in pudding basins, and cover with cloths or buttered greaseproof paper, tied tightly in place with string.
#[[Cookbook:Steaming|Steam]] for 7 hours and keep till Christmas Day.
#To prepare for serving, steam for 2 hours.  Times can be reduced by using a [[Cookbook:Pressure cooker|pressure cooker]].

==Notes==

*Suet can be difficult to find in some countries, e.g. the USA.  Butter is an excellent substitute. To incorporate the butter in the mixture, melt it in a microwave or saucepan, and pour into your mixing bowl.  
*It was common practice to include small silver coins in the pudding mixture, which could be kept by the person whose serving included them.  The usual choice was a silver 3d piece (the threepence), or a sixpence.  However this practice fell away once real silver coins were not available, as it was believed that alloy coins would taint the pudding.

*Once turned out of its basin, the Christmas pudding is traditionally decorated with a spray of holly, then dowsed in brandy, flamed, and brought to the table ceremonially - where it should be greeted with a round of applause.  It is best eaten with [[Cookbook:Brandy Butter|brandy butter]], [[Cookbook:Cream|cream]] (lemon cream is excellent) or [[Cookbook:Custard|custard]].  Christmas puddings have very good keeping properties and many families keep one back from Christmas to be eaten at another celebration later in the year.

Some of the discussion from [[en:Talk:Christmas pudding]]

What is crystallized peel? Orange I presume. Rmhermen 17:27, Dec 18, 2003 (UTC)

mixed citrus, I think, but I'm not sure enough to do an article on it, which is certainly needed. It comes cut into cubes about .5cm. Standard item on the UK cook's shelf but I've never seen it anywhere else (not that I've looked very hard, it's not my personal favourite). seglea 17:39, 18 Dec 2003 (UTC). Also called &quot;candied peel&quot;. seglea

:That's right. Usual recipies have a mixture of [[Orange]], [[Lemon]] and [[Lime]] peel. Candying it requires the use of boiling sugar syrup and is not very hard. In my experience (and following my usual cooking philosophy) I have found that fresh peel is actually a little bit nicer in a Christmas Pudding, but I suspect not everyone would agree. Obviously the candied peel is sweeter. [[User:Francis Davey|Francis Davey]] 16:21, 5 December 2006 (UTC)

Restoring &quot;the dessert&quot; in the opening sentence. Of course it is not the only dessert ever served on Christmas day, but it is the only one that is traditionally served (which is what the article says), in the sense that anyone in England (I'm never sure about the Scots) would recognise it as the traditional thing to have, even if they hated the stuff and would never serve it themselves.
----

This recipe (less the &quot;Easy White Sauce&quot;) has been in the Matfield Green Kansas USA branch of the Mercer family for at least four generations. Because the family has largely been &quot;teetotalers&quot; since coming to Kansas, brandy was omitted from the recipe several generations ago. That is about to change. In 2006 the pudding will be served at our traditional family Christmas gathering in Wichita flaming, as in Dickens's &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;.

      <comment>&quot;iff&quot; is mathematical notation for &quot;if and only if&quot;.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Complex analysis''' is the study of functions of complex variables. Complex analysis is a widely used and powerful tool in certain areas of electrical engineering, and others.

Before we begin, you may want to review [[Algebra/Complex Numbers|Complex numbers]]

==Complex Numbers==
[[Algebra/Complex Numbers|Complex Numbers]]
==Complex Functions==

A function of a complex variable is a function that can take on complex values, as well as strictly real ones. For example, suppose f(z) = z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  This function sets up a correspondence between the complex number z and its square, z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, just like a function of a real variable, but with complex numbers.
Note that, for f(z) = z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, f(z) will be strictly real if z is strictly real. 

Generally we can write a function f(z) in the form f(z) = f(x+iy) = a(x,y) + ib(x,y), where a and b are real-valued functions.

== Limits and continuity ==

As with real-valued functions, we have concepts of limits and continuity with complex-valued functions also &amp;ndash; our usual delta-epsilon limit definition:

:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{z\to w}f(z)=L&lt;/math&gt; iff for each &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, there is a &lt;math&gt;\delta&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;|f(z)-L|&lt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;0&lt;|z-w|&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;. 

Note that &amp;epsilon; and &amp;delta; are real values.  This is implicit in the use of inequalities: only real values are &quot;greater than zero&quot;.

One difference between this definition of limit and the definition for real-valued functions is the meaning of the absolute value.  Here we mean the complex absolute value instead of the real-valued one.  Another difference is that of how ''z'' approaches ''w''.  For real-valued functions, we would only be concerned about ''z'' approaching ''w'' from the left, or from the right.  In a complex setting, ''z'' can approach ''w'' from any direction in the two-dimensional complex plane: along any line passing through ''w'', along a spiral centered at ''w'', etc.

For example, let &lt;math&gt;f(z)=z^2&lt;/math&gt;.  Suppose we want to show that the &lt;math&gt;\lim_{z\to i}f(z)=-1&lt;/math&gt;.  We can write ''z'' as &lt;math&gt;i+\gamma&lt;/math&gt; where we think of
''&amp;gamma;'' being a small complex quantity.  Note then that &lt;math&gt;z-i=\gamma&lt;/math&gt;.  Then, with ''L'' in our definition being -1, and ''w'' being i, we have
:&lt;math&gt;| f(z) - L | = | z^2 + 1 | = | (i + \gamma)^2 + 1 | = | 2i\gamma + \gamma;^2 |&lt;/math&gt;
By the triangle inequality, this last expression is less than
:&lt;math&gt;2 | \gamma | + | \gamma |^2&lt;/math&gt;
In order for this to be less than &amp;epsilon;, we can require that 
:&lt;math&gt;| \gamma | &lt; \frac{1}{2} \min( \frac{\epsilon}{2}, \sqrt{\epsilon})&lt;/math&gt;
Thus, for any &lt;math&gt;\epsilon &gt; 0&lt;/math&gt;,  if &lt;math&gt;\delta = \frac{1}{2} \min( \frac{\epsilon}{2}, \sqrt{\epsilon})&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;| z - i |&lt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;| f(z) - ( - 1) | &lt; \epsilon&lt;/math&gt;.
Hence, the limit of &lt;math&gt;f(z)=z^2&lt;/math&gt; as ''z'' approaches i is -1.

==Differentiation and Holomorphic Functions==

Since we have limits defined, we can go ahead to define the ''derivative'' of a complex function, in the usual way:
: &lt;math&gt; \lim_{\Delta z \rightarrow 0} {f(z+\Delta z)-f(z) \over \Delta z}&lt;/math&gt;
provided that the limit is the same no matter how &amp;Delta;''z'' approaches zero (since we are working now in the complex plane, we have more freedom!).

If such a limit exists for some value ''z'', or some set of values - a ''region'', we call the function ''holomorphic'' at that point or region. Continuity and being single-valued are necessary for being analytic; however, continuity and being single-valued are not sufficient for being analytic. 

Many elementary functions of complex values have the same derivatives as those for real functions: for example D ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 2''z''.

=== Problem set ===
Given the above, answer the following questions.
# Find the derivative of ''z''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; from the limit definition.
# Write ''e''&lt;sup&gt;''z''&lt;/sup&gt; in the form a(''x'', ''y'')+b(''x'', ''y'')i

==== Answers ====
1. &lt;math&gt; \lim_{\Delta z \rightarrow 0} {(z+\Delta z)^3-z^3 \over \Delta z} = 
           \lim_{\Delta z \rightarrow 0} 3z^2+3z\Delta z +{\Delta z}^2 = 3 z^2 ,&lt;/math&gt;

2. &lt;math&gt;\ e^z = e^{x+yi} = e^xe^{yi} = e^x(\cos(y)+i \sin(y)) = e^x \cos(y) + e^x \sin(y) i\,&lt;/math&gt;

==Cauchy-Riemann Equations==

We might wonder which sorts of complex functions are in fact differentiable. It would appear that the criterion for holomorphicity is much stricter than that of differentiability for real functions, and this is indeed the case. Suppose we have a complex function
: &lt;math&gt; f(z)=f(x+iy)=u(x,y)+i\; v(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;,
where ''u'' and ''v'' are real functions. Assume furthermore that ''u'' and ''v'' are differentiable functions in the real sense. Then we can let &lt;math&gt;\Delta z&lt;/math&gt; in the definition of differentiability approach 0 by varying only ''x'' or only ''y''. Therefore ''f'' can only be differentiable in the complex sense if
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases} \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial v}{\partial y} \\ \frac{\partial u}{\partial y} = -\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}.\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
In fact, if ''u'' and ''v'' are differentiable in the real sense and satisfy these two equations, then ''f'' is holomorphic. These two equations are known as the Cauchy-Riemann equations.

==Integration==

In single variable Calculus, integrals are typically evaluated between two real numbers

: &lt;math&gt;\int_{x_1}^{x_2} f(x) dx&lt;/math&gt;

On the real line, there is one way to get from &lt;math&gt;x_1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;x_2&lt;/math&gt;. In the complex plane, however, there are infinitely many different paths which can be taken between two points, &lt;math&gt;z_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z_1&lt;/math&gt;. For this reason, complex integration is always done over a path, rather than between two points.

Let &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; be a path in the complex plane parametrized by &lt;math&gt;z: [a,b] \to \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;f(z)&lt;/math&gt; be a complex-valued function. Then the contour integral is defined analogously to the line integral from multivariable calculus:

: &lt;math&gt;\int_{\gamma} f(z) dz = \int_a^b f(z(t)) z'(t) dt &lt;/math&gt;

'''Example''' Let &lt;math&gt;f(z) = z&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; be a line from '''0''' to '''1+i'''. This curve can be parametrized by &lt;math&gt;z(t) = t(1+i)&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; ranging from 0 to 1. Now we can compute

: &lt;math&gt;\int_{\gamma} f(z) dz = \int_0^1 (t(1+i)) (1+i) dt = \frac{(1+i)^2}{2} = i &lt;/math&gt;

Note that we also have

: &lt;math&gt;\int_{\gamma} f(z) dz = \frac{(1+i)^2}{2} - \frac{0^2}{2} = i &lt;/math&gt;

This indicates that complex antiderivatives can be used to simplify the evaluation of integrals, just as real antiderivatives are used to evaluate real integrals.

===Cauchy's Theorem===

Cauchy's theorem states that if a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is holomorphic in the closure of an open set &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; is a simple closed curve in &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, then

: &lt;math&gt; \int_{\gamma} f(z) dz = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

This can be understood in terms of Green's theorem, though this does not readily lead to a proof, since Green's theorem only applies under the assumption that f has continuous first partial derivatives...

====Contour Integration====
[[Image:ContourSinzz.gif|right|frame|Contour over which to perform the integration]]

Cauchy's theorem allows for the evaluation of many improper real integrals (improper here means that one of the limits of integration is infinite). As an example, consider

: &lt;math&gt; \int_0^{\infty} \frac{\sin x}{x} dx = \lim_{\epsilon \to 0, R \to \infty} \int_{\epsilon}^R \frac{\sin x}{x} dx &lt;/math&gt;

Since

: &lt;math&gt; \Im(e^{i z}) = \sin z&lt;/math&gt;

we consider

: &lt;math&gt; f(z) = \frac{e^{i z}}{z} &lt;/math&gt;

We now integrate over the indented semicircle contour, pictured above. We parametrize each segment of the contour as follows

: &lt;math&gt; \gamma_1(t) = t &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; t \in [-R, -\epsilon] &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \gamma_2(t) = t &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; t \in [\epsilon, R] &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \gamma_3(t) = \epsilon e^{i t} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t \in [0, \pi] &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \gamma_4(t) = R e^{i t} &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t \in [0, \pi] &lt;/math&gt;

By Cauchy's Theorem, the integral over the whole contour is zero. So,

: &lt;math&gt; 0 = \int_{\gamma} f(z) dz = \int_{\gamma_1} f(z) dz + \int_{\gamma_2} f(z) dz - \int_{\gamma_3} f(z) dz + \int_{\gamma_4} f(z) dz &lt;/math&gt;

We now handle each of these integrals separately.

: &lt;math&gt; \int_{\gamma_1} f(z) dz = \int_{-R}^{-\epsilon} \frac{e^{i z}}{z} dz = -\int_{\epsilon}^R \frac{e^{-i z}}{z} dz &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt; \int_{\gamma_2} f(z) dz = \int_{\epsilon}^{R} \frac{e^{i z}}{z} dz &lt;/math&gt;

Recalling the definition of the sine of a complex number,

: &lt;math&gt; \int_{\gamma_1} f(z) dz + \int_{\gamma_2} f(z) dz = \int_{\epsilon}^R \frac{e^{i z} - e^{-i z}}{z} dz = 2i \int_{\epsilon}^R \frac{\sin x}{x} dx &lt;/math&gt;

Now we evaluate the other two integrals

: &lt;math&gt; \int_{\gamma_3} f(z) dz = \int_0^{\pi} \frac{e^{- \epsilon e^{it}} i \epsilon e^{i t}}{\epsilon e^{i t}} dt = i \int_0^{\pi} e^{- \epsilon e^{it}} dt &lt;/math&gt;

As &lt;math&gt; \epsilon \to 0 &lt;/math&gt;, the integrand approaches one, so

: &lt;math&gt; \lim_{\epsilon \to 0} \int_{\gamma_3} f(z) dz = i \int_0^{\pi} dt = \pi i &lt;/math&gt;

The fourth integral is equal to zero, but this is somewhat more difficult to show. Its form is similar to that of the third segment:

: &lt;math&gt; \int_{\gamma_4} f(z) dz = \int_0^{\pi} e^{-R e^{it}} dt &lt;/math&gt;

This integrand is more difficult, since it need not approach zero everywhere. This difficulty can be overcome by splitting up the integral, but here we simply assume it to be zero.

Combining everything, we now have

: &lt;math&gt; \int_{\gamma} f(z) dz = 0 = 2 i \int_0^{\infty} \frac{\sin x}{x} dx - \pi i &lt;/math&gt;

Hence,

: &lt;math&gt; \int_0^{\infty} \frac{\sin x}{x} dx = \frac{\pi}{2} &lt;/math&gt;

===Cauchy's Integral Formula===

Cauchy's integral formula characterizes the behavior of holomorphics functions on a set based on their behavior on the boundary of that set. If &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is an open set with a piecewise smooth boundary and &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is holomorphic in &lt;math&gt;\bar{\Omega}&lt;/math&gt;, then

: &lt;math&gt; f(z) = \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \int_{\partial \Omega} \frac{f(\zeta) d\zeta}{\zeta-z} \ \ \  \forall z \in \Omega &lt;/math&gt;

This is a remarkable fact which has no counterpart in multivariable calculus. It says that if we know the values of a holomorphic function along a closed curve, then we know its values everywhere in the interior of the curve. 

Because &lt;math&gt;z \in \Omega&lt;/math&gt;, an open set, it follows that &lt;math&gt;\zeta-z \neq 0&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\zeta \in \partial \Omega&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the integrand in Cauchy's integral formula is infinitely differentiable with respect to z, and by repeatedly taking derivatives of both sides, we get

: &lt;math&gt;f^{(n)} (z) = \frac{n!}{2 \pi i} \int_{\partial\Omega} \frac{f(\zeta) d\zeta}{(\zeta-z)^{n+1}} \ \ \ \forall z \in \Omega, n \in \mathbb{N} &lt;/math&gt;

This result shows that holomorphicity is a much stronger requirement than differentiability. In the complex plane, if a function has just a single derivative in an open set, then it has infinitely many derivatives in that set.

===Corollaries of Cauchy's Theorem===

Cauchy's Theorem and integral formula have a number of powerful corollaries:

* '''Convergence of power series''' If a function is holomorphic in a disc, then its Taylor series converges in this disc.
* '''Liouville's Theorem''' If a function is bounded and holomorphic in all of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt; then it is equal to a constant.
* '''Fundamental Theorem of Algebra''' All polynomials of degree greater than zero with complex coefficients have a complex root. This is a simple corollary of Liouville's theorem.
* '''Equality of functions''' If two functions &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; are holomorphic on a connected, open set &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;f(z)=g(z)&lt;/math&gt; on any disc in this set, then &lt;math&gt;f(z)=g(z)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;z \in \Omega&lt;/math&gt;.
