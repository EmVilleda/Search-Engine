Hej/Miav/Hello/Meow/Aloha/?/Oi/Miado


Hey :) Thanks for picking up my arithmetic errors; my mental arithmetic is ''atrocious''! [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 21:10, 29 Sep 2003 (UTC)

Hi, nice job with all the puzzles! I'll see if I can find some more good and challenging ones. Btw: previously we first posted solution ideas to the talk page of a puzzle, but maybe it's better the way you did it and post directly to the solution page (incorrect / unclear solutions can always be edited later I guess). [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]

:Thanks. Only saw the talk pages with solution ideas, after making all the solution pages... Think the solutions are probably correct, although the elastic one may not exactly have been the intended solution... [[User:Cyp|Cyp]] 18:01, 18 Oct 2003 (UTC)

Hello, the changes you made to the recursion section of primes is incorrect. Maybe i didn't explain recursion properly, and i'll try again. [[User:Xiaodai|Xiaodai]]

:I'm suppose I'm not actually sure what the definition of recursion is exactly... But I don't understand what the difference between iteration, and the example given, is. [[User:Cyp|كсηפ Cyp]] 12:50, 26 Oct 2003 (UTC)

::To define recursion, you first have to define recursion :) [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]

*[[User:Cyp|Cyp]] - Oh well, why not... Not that I've actually had any need for admin stuff in the Wikibooks section yet, but maybe I will some day... [[User:Cyp|Cyp]] 16:27, 18 Oct 2003 (UTC)
** Support. Corrects my errors, adds good stuff :) [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 01:54, 19 Oct 2003 (UTC)
**Make it so! --[[User:Maveric149|mav]] 22:46, 20 Oct 2003 (UTC)

You are now a Wikibooks admin. --[[User:Maveric149|mav]]

I made a mistake in their creation.  One of them should have been under Aeropace Engineering, and actually there is already and astrodynamics one which is the same.

Hey, a lot of people are editing it wrong. Shouldn't you do something next time it happens? ( I took care of it.)--[[User:Nelson340|Nelson340]] 02:56, 19 Dec 2004 (UTC)

== [[Programming:Windows Programming]] ==

This book is in pretty lousy condition, and I would like to start a project soonish (within the next few weeks) to try and expand this book. I have started a basic outline [[User:Whiteknight/Windows Programming|on my user page]] to try and lay out the things that (I think) this book should cover. I see that you have been a contributer to this book in the past, and I would therefore like to get your input on the current outline, and see if there is anything that i should add, or anything that I should remove from it.

The outline can be found at [[User:Whiteknight/Windows Programming]]. --{{User Whiteknight Sig|Whiteknight}} 23:37, 12 December 2005 (UTC)

== De-Adminship vote. ==

A vote is being held to remove your sysop privileges.  The basis for this vote is lack of use of these privileges.  You may want to participate at [[Wikibooks:Requests_for_adminship#Cyp_.28_talk_.7C_email_.7C_contribs_.29]].  See also the discussion at [[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge#Removing_Sysop_Status]]. --[[User:JMRyan|JMRyan]] 23:13, 17 February 2006 (UTC)

== Your De-Adminship ==

Hello. I would like to inform you that you will have your sysop rights removed here on 1 Nov 2006 due to inactivity. If you would like to discuss the matter, please see [[WB:RFA]]. You can re-apply for adminship at a later date if you wish.

===Transverse and Longitudinal Waves===

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Tranlong.png|thumb|right|Example of displacements in transverse and longitudinal waves. The wave motion is to the right. The longitudinal and transverse waves are in phase.]] --&gt;

With the exception of light, waves are undulations in some material medium. For instance, waves on a slinky are either ''transverse'', in that the motion of the material of the slinky is perpendicular to the orientation of the slinky, if you vibrate the slinky like a rope, or they are ''longitudinal'', with material motion in the direction of the stretched slinky, if you treat it like a spring. (See image on right) Ocean waves are simultaneously transverse and longitudinal, the net effect being (nearly) circular undulations in the position of water parcels. The oscillations in neighboring parcels are phased such that a ''pattern'' moves across the ocean surface. Some media support only longitudinal waves, others support only transverse waves, while yet others support both types. Sound waves are purely longitudinal in gases and liquids, but can be either type in solids.

Mechanical transverse waves require a material medium and propogate by means of vibrations of the medium perpendicular to the direction of travel. Examples are water waves, ripples, seismic shear waves, and waves in stretched strings as above.

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[image:Emwave.png|thumb|left|The periodic undulation of Electric and Magnetic field strengths in an EM wave]] --&gt;

Electromagnetic (EM) waves (such as light) are also transverse waves but they do not require a medium and thus can pass through a vacuum ([[Waves/Waves in one Dimension|see intro]]).They consist of oscillating electric (E) and magnetic (B) fields which are perpendicular to the direction of propogation while also being mutually perpendicular. EM waves are a disturbance of space itself, which can be thought of as being stretched and therefore being elastic and having a tension. The B and E fields are in phase as shown on the left.

The fundamental S.I. unit of length (meter) is defined in terms of the speed of light in vacuum and the definition of the unit of time, the second. The previous definition was in terms of the wavelength of a particular color of light in the line spectrum of Krypton 86. The modern definition is more accurate as well as being the same to all observers regardless of their relative velocity.

Longitudinal waves propogate by means of vibrations or disturbances in the medium that are in the same direction that the wave travels. Examples are sound (as above), seismic shock waves, slinky springs and part of the motion in ocean waves. Sound waves are a series of high-pressure compressions and low-pressure rarefaction (for this reason, sound is sometimes called a ''pressure wave''). While it might be convenient to think of individual molecules vibrating back and forth around an equilibrium position (producing areas of high and low pressure), the individual molecules in a gas generally move randomly, and it is only in large numbers that this pattern is visible. In longitudinal waves, the convention is to describe displacement in the direction the wave is going (the direction of propagation) as positive, and displacement against that direction as negative.

&lt;!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:dispress.png|thumb|600px|center|Graph of Displacement vs Pressure]] --&gt;

The pressure and displacement of a molecule at a point are &lt;math&gt;90^o&lt;/math&gt; out of phase, so that, for example, when a molecule is farthest displaced it is in a normal pressure area, while molecules in compressions or rarefactions have displacement close to zero.

Torsional waves consist of a twisting disturbance moving through a medium such as a wire or a rod.

===Sine Waves===

A particularly simple kind of wave, the sine wave, is illustrated in figure 1.2. This has the mathematical form:
:&lt;math&gt;h(x) = h_0 \sin ( 2 \pi x / \lambda ) ,&lt;/math&gt; (2.1)

where
:''h'' is the ''displacement'' (which can be either longitudinal or transverse),
:&lt;math&gt;h_0&lt;/math&gt; is the maximum displacement, sometimes called the amplitude of the wave,
:&amp;lambda; is the wavelength.tory Physics fig 1.2.png|Figure 1.2: Sine wave]] --&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 1.2''': Definition sketch for a sine wave, showing the wavelength &amp;lambda; and the amplitude &lt;math&gt;h_0&lt;/math&gt; and the phase &amp;phi; at various points.
&lt;/div&gt;


So far we have only considered a sine wave as it appears at a particular time. All interesting waves move with time. The movement of a sine wave to the right a distance &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; may be accounted for by replacing &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; in the above formula by &lt;math&gt;x - d&lt;/math&gt;. If this movement occurs in time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, then the wave moves at velocity &lt;math&gt;c = d/t&lt;/math&gt;. Solving this for &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and substituting yields a formula for the displacement of a sine wave as a function of both distance &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and time &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt; h(x) = h_0 \sin [ 2 \pi (x - ct) / \lambda ] . &lt;/math&gt; (2.2)

The time for a wave to move one wavelength is called the period of the wave: &lt;math&gt;T = \lambda / c&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, we can also write
:&lt;math&gt;h(x) = h_0 \sin [ 2 \pi ( x / \lambda - t / T ) ] . &lt;/math&gt;(2.3)

Physicists actually like to write the equation for a sine wave in a slightly simpler form. Defining the wavenumber as &lt;math&gt;k = 2 \pi / \lambda&lt;/math&gt; and the angular frequency as &lt;math&gt;\omega = 2 \pi / T&lt;/math&gt;, we write
:&lt;math&gt; h(x) = h_0 \sin (kx - \omega t) . &lt;/math&gt;(2.4)

We normally think of the frequency of oscillatory motion as the number of cycles completed per second and is given by &lt;math&gt;f = 1/T&lt;/math&gt;. It is related to the angular frequency omega by &lt;math&gt;\omega = 2 \pi f&lt;/math&gt;. The angular frequency is used because it is directly analogous to the wavenumber, see above. Converting between the two is not difficult. Frequency is measured in units of hertz, abbreviated Hz; &lt;math&gt;1 \mbox{Hz} = 1 \mbox{ s}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; and angular frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is in units of radians per second.
(Not converting between frequency and angular frequency is a common mistake in many calculations)


The argument of the sine function is by definition an angle. We refer to this angle as the phase of the wave, &lt;math&gt;\phi = kx - \omega t&lt;/math&gt;. The difference in the phase of a wave at fixed time over a distance of one wavelength is &lt;math&gt;2 \pi&lt;/math&gt;, as is the difference in phase at fixed position over a time interval of one wave period.

As previously noted, we call &lt;math&gt;h_0&lt;/math&gt;, the maximum displacement of the wave, the amplitude. Often we are interested in the intensity of a wave, which is defined as the square of the amplitude, &lt;math&gt;I = h_0^2&lt;/math&gt;.

The wave speed we have defined above, &lt;math&gt;c = \lambda /T&lt;/math&gt;, is actually called the phase speed. Since &lt;math&gt;\lambda = 2 \pi /k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T = 2 \pi / \omega&lt;/math&gt;, we can write the phase speed in terms of the angular frequency and the wavenumber:
:&lt;math&gt;c = \frac{\omega}{k} \mbox{(phase speed)} . &lt;/math&gt; (2.5)

=== Types of Waves ===

In order to make the above material more concrete, we now examine the characteristics of various types of waves which may be observed in the real world. 
==== Ocean Surface Waves ====

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; [[image:Introductory Physics fig 1.3.png|Figure 1.3: Wave on an ocean depth]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 1.3''': Wave on an ocean of depth &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;. The wave is moving to the right and the particles of water at the surface move up and down as shown by the small vertical arrows. The particles move up, and gravity is the 'restoring' force. Water waves are also longitudinal, the water particles moving forward, then back.  The restoring forces are more complex, but involve the inertia of the mass of water surrounding. Think of water waves as superimposed transverse and longitudinal waves.  The net particle paths are nearly circular.  This is typical of waves that travel along the boundary (interface) between two substances, in this case water and air.
&lt;/div&gt;

These waves are manifested as undulations of the ocean surface as seen in figure 1.3. The speed of ocean waves is given by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;v = \left( \frac{g \tanh (kH)}{k} \right)^{1/2} , &lt;/math&gt; (2.6)

where &lt;math&gt;g = 9.8 \mbox{ m} \mbox{ s}^{-2}&lt;/math&gt; is a constant related to the strength of the Earth's gravity, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the depth of the ocean, and the hyperbolic tangent is defined as 2.7
:&lt;math&gt;\tanh (x) = \frac{e^x - e^{-x}}{e^x + e^{-x}} . &lt;/math&gt; (2.7) &lt;!-- what is k? --&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; [[image:Introductory Physics fig 1.4.png|Figure 1.4: Plot of tanh(x)]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 1.4''': Plot of the function &lt;math&gt;\tanh (x)&lt;/math&gt;. The dashed line shows our approximation &lt;math&gt;\tanh (x) \approx x&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\vert x\vert &lt;&lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;/div&gt;

As figure 1.4 shows, for very small x, we can approximate the hyperbolic tangent by &lt;math&gt;\tanh (x) \approx x&lt;/math&gt;, while for very large x it is positive 1 for positive x and negative 1 for negative x. This leads to two limits: Since &lt;math&gt;x = k H&lt;/math&gt;, the ''shallow water'' limit, which occurs when &lt;math&gt;kH &lt;&lt; 1&lt;/math&gt;, yields a wave speed of
:&lt;math&gt;v \approx (gH)^{1/2} , \mbox{(shallow water waves)} , &lt;/math&gt; (2.8)

while the ''deep water'' limit, which occurs when &lt;math&gt;kH &gt;&gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;, yields
:&lt;math&gt;v \approx (g/k)^{1/2} , \mbox{(deep water waves)} . &lt;/math&gt; (2.9)

Notice that the speed of shallow water waves depends only on the depth of the water and on &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;. In other words, all shallow water waves move at the same speed. 

On the other hand, deep water waves of longer wavelength (and hence smaller wavenumber) move more rapidly than those with shorter wavelength. Waves for which the wave speed varies with wavelength are called ''dispersive''. Thus, deep water waves are dispersive, while shallow water waves are non-dispersive.

For water waves with wavelengths of a few centimeters or less, surface tension becomes important to the dynamics of the waves. In the deep water case the wave speed at short wavelengths is actually given by the formula
:&lt;math&gt; c = (g/k + A k )^{1/2} &lt;/math&gt; (2.10)

where the constant &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is related to surface tension and depends on the surfaces involved. For an air-water interface near room temperature, &lt;math&gt;A \approx 74 \mbox{ cm}^3 \mbox{ s}^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Sound Waves ====

Sound is a longitudinal compression-expansion wave through matter. The wave speed is
:&lt;math&gt;c = ( \gamma R T_{abs} )^{1/2} &lt;/math&gt; (2.11)

where &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; are constants and &lt;math&gt;T_{abs}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''absolute temperature''. The absolute temperature is measured in Kelvins and is numerically given by
:&lt;math&gt;T_{abs} = T_C + 273.16^{\circ} &lt;/math&gt; (2.12)

where &lt;math&gt;T_C&lt;/math&gt; is the temperature in Celsius degrees. The angular frequency of sound waves is thus given by
:&lt;math&gt; \omega = ck = ( \gamma R T_{abs} )^{1/2} k . &lt;/math&gt; (2.13)

The speed of sound in air at normal temperatures is about &lt;math&gt;340 \mbox{ m} \mbox{ s}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Light ====

Light moves in a vacuum at a speed of &lt;math&gt;c_{vac} = 3 \times 10^8 \mbox{ m} \mbox{ s}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. In transparent materials it moves at a speed less than &lt;math&gt;c_{vac}&lt;/math&gt; by a factor &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; which is called the ''refractive index'' of the material:
:&lt;math&gt;c = c_{vac} / n . &lt;/math&gt;

Often the refractive index takes the form
:&lt;math&gt;n^2 \approx 1 + \frac{A}{1 - (k/k_R )^2} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the wavenumber and &lt;math&gt;k_R&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; are constants characteristic of the material. The angular frequency of light in a transparent medium is thus
:&lt;math&gt;\omega = kc = \frac{k c_{vac}}{n} \approx 
\frac{k c_{vac}}{\sqrt{1+A}}(1+ \frac{1}{2}\frac{A}{1+A}\frac{k^2}{k^2_R})&lt;/math&gt;

so the frequency increases slightly with increasing ''k''. Typically, when ''k'' is near ''k''&lt;sub&gt;''R''&lt;/sub&gt;, the material becomes opaque.

Ultimately, this is due to resonance between the light and the atoms of the materials.

=== Superposition Principle ===

It is found empirically that as long as the amplitudes of waves in most media are small, two waves in the same physical location don't interact with each other. Thus, for example, two waves moving in the opposite direction simply pass through each other without their shapes or amplitudes being changed. When superimposed, the total wave displacement is just the sum of the displacements of the individual waves. This is called the ''superposition principle''. At sufficiently large amplitude the superposition principle often breaks down -- interacting waves may scatter off of each other, lose amplitude, or change their form.

''Interference'' is a consequence of the superposition principle. When two or more waves are superimposed, the net wave displacement is just the algebraic sum of the displacements of the individual waves. Since these displacements can be positive or negative, the net displacement can either be greater or less than the individual wave displacements. The former case is called ''constructive interference'', while the latter is called ''destructive interference''. 

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; [[image:Introductory Physics fig 1.5.png|Figure 1.5: Superposition of two sine waves]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 1.5''': Superposition (lower panel) of two sine waves (shown individually in the upper panel) with equal amplitudes and wavenumbers &lt;math&gt;k_1 = 4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_2 = 5&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

Let us see what happens when we superimpose two sine waves with different wavenumbers. Figure 1.5 shows the superposition of two waves with wavenumbers &lt;math&gt;k_1 = 4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_2 = 5&lt;/math&gt;. Notice that the result is a wave with about the same wavelength as the two initial waves, but which varies in amplitude depending on whether the two sine waves are in or out of phase. When the waves are in phase, constructive interference is occurring, while destructive interference occurs where the waves are out of phase.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; [[image:Introductory Physics fig 1.6.png|Figure 1.6: Superposition of two sine waves]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 1.6''': Superposition of two sine waves with equal amplitudes and wavenumbers &lt;math&gt;k_1 = 10&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_2 = 11&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

What happens when the wavenumbers of the two sine waves are changed? Figure 1.6 shows the result when &lt;math&gt;k_1 = 10&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_2 = 11&lt;/math&gt;. Notice that though the wavelength of the resultant wave is decreased, the locations where the amplitude is maximum have the same separation in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; as in figure 1.5.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; [[image:Introductory Physics fig 1.7.png|Figure 1.7: Superposition of two sine waves]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 1.7''': Superposition of two sine waves with equal amplitudes and wavenumbers &lt;math&gt;k_1 = 10&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_2 = 12&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;

If we superimpose waves with &lt;math&gt;k_1 = 10&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_2 = 12&lt;/math&gt;, as is shown in figure 1.7, we see that the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; spacing of the regions of maximum amplitude has decreased by a factor of two. Thus, while the wavenumber of the resultant wave seems to be related to something like the ''average'' of the wavenumbers of the component waves, the spacing between regions of maximum wave amplitude appears to go inversely with the ''difference'' of the wavenumbers of the component waves. In other words, if &lt;math&gt;k_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt; are close together, the amplitude maxima are far apart and vice versa.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; [[image:Introductory Physics fig 1.8.png|Figure 1.8: Representation of the wavenumbers and amplitudes of two superimposed sine waves.]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 1.8''': Representation of the wavenumbers and amplitudes of two superimposed sine waves.&lt;/div&gt;

We can symbolically represent the sine waves that make up figures 1.5, 1.6, and 1.7 by a plot such as that shown in figure 1.8. The amplitudes and wavenumbers of each of the sine waves are indicated by vertical lines in this figure.

The regions of large wave amplitude are called wave packets. Wave packets will play a central role in what is to follow, so it is important that we acquire a good understanding of them. The wave packets produced by only two sine waves are not well separated along the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-axis. However, if we superimpose many waves, we can produce an isolated wave packet. For example, figure 1.9 shows the results of superimposing &lt;math&gt;20&lt;/math&gt; sine waves with wavenumbers &lt;math&gt;k = 0.4 m&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;m = 1,2, \ldots , 20&lt;/math&gt;, where the amplitudes of the waves are largest for wavenumbers near &lt;math&gt;k = 4&lt;/math&gt;. 

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; [[image:Introductory Physics fig 1.9.png|Figure 1.9: Superposition of twenty sine waves]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 1.9''': Superposition of twenty sine waves with &lt;math&gt;k_0 = 4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta k = 1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;

In particular, we assume that the amplitude of each sine wave is proportional to &lt;math&gt;\exp [-(k - k_0)^2 / \Delta k^2 ]&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;k_0 = 4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta k = 1&lt;/math&gt;. The amplitudes of each of the sine waves making up the wave packet in figure 1.9 are shown schematically in figure 1.10.


&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; [[image:Introductory Physics fig 1.10.png|Figure 1.10: Superposition of twenty sine waves]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 1.10''': Representation of the wavenumbers and amplitudes of 20 superimposed sine waves with &lt;math&gt;k_0 = 4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta k = 1&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;

The quantity &lt;math&gt;\Delta k&lt;/math&gt; controls the distribution of the sine waves being superimposed -- only those waves with a wavenumber &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; within approximately &lt;math&gt;\Delta k&lt;/math&gt; of the central wavenumber &lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt; of the wave packet, i. e., for &lt;math&gt;3 \le k \le 5&lt;/math&gt; in this case, contribute significantly to the sum. If &lt;math&gt;\Delta k&lt;/math&gt; is changed to &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;, so that wavenumbers in the range &lt;math&gt;2 \le k \le 6&lt;/math&gt; contribute significantly, the wavepacket becomes narrower, as is shown in figures 1.11 and 1.12.

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; [[image:Introductory Physics fig 1.11.png|Figure 1.11: Superposition of twenty sine waves]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 1.11''': Superposition of twenty sine waves with &lt;math&gt;k_0 = 4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta k = 2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; [[image:Introductory Physics fig 1.12.png|Figure 1.12: Superposition of twenty sine waves]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 1.12''': Representation of the wavenumbers and amplitudes of 20 superimposed sine waves with &lt;math&gt;k_0 = 4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta k = 2&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\Delta k&lt;/math&gt; is called the wavenumber spread of the wave packet, and it evidently plays a role similar to the difference in wavenumbers in the superposition of two sine waves -- the larger the wavenumber spread, the smaller the physical size of the wave packet. Furthermore, the wavenumber of the oscillations within the wave packet is given approximately by the central wavenumber.

We can better understand how wave packets work by mathematically analyzing the simple case of the superposition of two sine waves. Let us define &lt;math&gt;k_0 = (k_1 + k_2 )/2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;k_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_2&lt;/math&gt; are the wavenumbers of the component waves. Furthermore let us set &lt;math&gt;\Delta k = (k_2 - k_1 )/2&lt;/math&gt;. The quantities &lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta k&lt;/math&gt; are graphically illustrated in figure 1.8. We can write &lt;math&gt;k_1 = k_0 - \Delta k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k_2 = k_0 + \Delta k&lt;/math&gt; and use the trigonometric identity &lt;math&gt;\sin (a + b) = \sin (a) \cos (b) + \cos (a) \sin (b)&lt;/math&gt; to find
&lt;math&gt;\sin (k_1 x) + \sin (k_2 x) = \sin [(k_0 - \Delta k)x] + \sin [(k_0 + \Delta k)x]&lt;/math&gt;  
&lt;math&gt; = \sin (k_0 x) \cos (\Delta k x) - \cos (k_0 x) \sin(\Delta k x) +&lt;/math&gt;  
&lt;math&gt;\sin (k_0 x) \cos (\Delta k x) + \cos (k_0 x) \sin(\Delta k x) = 2 \sin (k_0 x) \cos ( \Delta k x) .&lt;/math&gt; (2.17)

The sine factor on the bottom line of the above equation produces the oscillations within the wave packet, and as speculated earlier, this oscillation has a wavenumber &lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt; equal to the average of the wavenumbers of the component waves. The cosine factor modulates this wave with a spacing between regions of maximum amplitude of
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta x = \pi / \Delta k . &lt;/math&gt; (2.18)

Thus, as we observed in the earlier examples, the length of the wave packet &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; is inversely related to the spread of the wavenumbers &lt;math&gt;\Delta k&lt;/math&gt; (which in this case is just the difference between the two wavenumbers) of the component waves. This relationship is central to the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics.

Suppose two sound waves of different frequency impinge on your ear at the same time. The displacement perceived by your ear is the superposition of these two waves, with time dependence
&lt;math&gt; A(t) = \sin ( \omega_1 t) + \sin ( \omega_2 t) = 2 \sin ( \omega_0 t) \cos ( \Delta \omega t) , &lt;/math&gt; (2.19)

where we now have &lt;math&gt;\omega_0 = ( \omega_1 + \omega_2 )/2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta \omega = ( \omega_2 - \omega_1 )/2&lt;/math&gt;. What you actually hear is a tone with angular frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt; which fades in and out with period
&lt;math&gt;T_{beat} = \pi / \Delta \omega = 2 \pi / ( \omega_2 - \omega_1 ) = 1 / ( f_2 - f_1 ) . &lt;/math&gt; (2.20)

The ''beat frequency'' is simply
&lt;math&gt; f_{beat} = 1/T_{beat} = f_2 - f_1 . &lt;/math&gt; (2.21)

Note how beats are the time analog of wave packets -- the mathematics are the same except that frequency replaces wavenumber and time replaces space.

=== Interferometers ===

An interferometer is a device which splits a beam of light into two sub-beams, shifts the phase of one sub-beam with respect to the other, and then superimposes the sub-beams so that they interfere constructively or destructively, depending on the magnitude of the phase shift between them. In this section we study the Michelson interferometer and interferometric effects in thin films. 

==== The Michelson Interferometer ====

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; [[image:Introductory Physics fig 1.13.png|Figure 1.13: Sketch of a Michelson interferometer.]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 1.13''': Sketch of a Michelson interferometer.&lt;/div&gt;

The American physicist Albert Michelson invented the optical interferometer illustrated in figure 1.13. The incoming beam is split into two beams by the half-silvered mirror. Each sub-beam reflects off of another mirror which returns it to the half-silvered mirror, where the two sub-beams recombine as shown. One of the reflecting mirrors is movable by a sensitive micrometer device, allowing the path length of the corresponding sub-beam, and hence the phase relationship between the two sub-beams, to be altered. As figure 1.13 shows, the difference in path length between the two sub-beams is &lt;math&gt;2x&lt;/math&gt; because the horizontal sub-beam traverses the path twice. Thus, constructive interference occurs when this path difference is an integral number of wavelengths, i. e.,
:&lt;math&gt; 2x = m \lambda , ~~ m = 0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \ldots \quad \mbox{(Michelson interferometer)} &lt;/math&gt; (2.22)

where &lt;math&gt;\lambda &lt;/math&gt; is the wavelength of the light and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is an integer. Note that &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; is the number of wavelengths that fits evenly into the distance &lt;math&gt;2x&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Thin Films ===

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; [[image:Introductory Physics fig 1.14.png|Figure 1.14: Plane light wave normally incident on a transparent thin film]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 1.14''': Plane light wave normally incident on a transparent thin film of thickness &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and index of refraction &lt;math&gt;n &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;. Partial reflection occurs at the front surface of the film, resulting in beam A, and at the rear surface, resulting in beam B. Much of the wave passes completely through the film, as with C.&lt;/div&gt;

One of the most revealing examples of interference occurs when light interacts with a thin film of transparent material such as a soap bubble. Figure 1.14 shows how a plane wave normally incident on the film is partially reflected by the front and rear surfaces. The waves reflected off the front and rear surfaces of the film interfere with each other. The interference can be either constructive or destructive depending on the phase difference between the two reflected waves.

If the wavelength of the incoming wave is &lt;math&gt;\lambda &lt;/math&gt;, one would naively expect constructive interference to occur between the A and B beams if &lt;math&gt;2d&lt;/math&gt; were an integral multiple of &lt;math&gt;\lambda &lt;/math&gt;.

Two factors complicate this picture. First, the wavelength inside the film is not &lt;math&gt;\lambda &lt;/math&gt;, but &lt;math&gt;\lambda /n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the index of refraction of the film. Constructive interference would then occur if &lt;math&gt;2d = m \lambda /n&lt;/math&gt;. Second, it turns out that an additional phase shift of half a wavelength occurs upon reflection when the wave is incident on material with a higher index of refraction than the medium in which the incident beam is immersed. This phase shift doesn't occur when light is reflected from a region with lower index of refraction than felt by the incident beam. Thus beam B doesn't acquire any additional phase shift upon reflection. As a consequence, constructive interference actually occurs when
:&lt;math&gt; 2d = (m + 1/2) \lambda /n , ~~ m = 0,1,2, \ldots \quad \mbox{(constructive interference)} &lt;/math&gt; (2.23)

while destructive interference results when
:&lt;math&gt; 2d = m \lambda /n , ~~ m = 0,1,2, \ldots \quad \mbox{(destructive interference)} . &lt;/math&gt; (2.24)

When we look at a soap bubble, we see bands of colors reflected back from a light source. What is the origin of these bands? Light from ordinary sources is generally a mixture of wavelengths ranging from roughly &lt;math&gt;\lambda = 4.5 \times 10^{-7} \mbox{ m}&lt;/math&gt; (violet light) to &lt;math&gt;\lambda = 6.5 \times 10^{-7} \mbox{ m}&lt;/math&gt; (red light). In between violet and red we also have blue, green, and yellow light, in that order. Because of the different wavelengths associated with different colors, it is clear that for a mixed light source we will have some colors interfering constructively while others interfere destructively. Those undergoing constructive interference will be visible in reflection, while those undergoing destructive interference will not.

Another factor enters as well. If the light is not normally incident on the film, the difference in the distances traveled between beams reflected off of the front and rear faces of the film will not be just twice the thickness of the film. To understand this case quantitatively, we need the concept of refraction, which will be developed later in the context of geometrical optics. However, it should be clear that different wavelengths will undergo constructive interference for different angles of incidence of the incoming light. Different portions of the thin film will in general be viewed at different angles, and will therefore exhibit different colors under reflection, resulting in the colorful patterns normally seen in soap bubbles.

=== Math Tutorial -- Derivatives ===

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; [[image:Introductory Physics fig 1.15.png|Figure 1.15: Estimation of the derivative]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 1.15''': Estimation of the derivative, which is the slope of the tangent line. When point B approaches point A, the slope of the line AB approaches the slope of the tangent to the curve at point A. &lt;/div&gt;

This section provides a quick introduction to the idea of the derivative. For a more detailed discussion and exploration of the differentiation and of Calculus, see [[Calculus]] and [[Calculus/Differentiation|Differentiation]]. 

Often we are interested in the slope of a line tangent to a function &lt;math&gt;y(x)&lt;/math&gt; at some value of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. This slope is called the derivative and is denoted &lt;math&gt;dy/dx&lt;/math&gt;. Since a tangent line to the function can be defined at any point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, the derivative itself is a function of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;:
:&lt;math&gt; g(x) = \frac{d y(x)}{dx} . &lt;/math&gt; (2.25)

As figure 1.15 illustrates, the slope of the tangent line at some point on the function may be approximated by the slope of a line connecting two points, A and B, set a finite distance apart on the curve:
:&lt;math&gt; \frac{dy}{dx} \approx \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x} . &lt;/math&gt; (2.26)

As B is moved closer to A, the approximation becomes better. In the limit when B moves infinitely close to A, it is exact.

== Table of Derivatives ==

Derivatives of some common functions are now given. In each case &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is a constant.

{{:Engineering Tables/Table of Derivatives}}

The product and chain rules are used to compute the derivatives of complex functions. For instance,

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx} ( \sin (x) \cos (x)) = \frac{d \sin (x)}{dx} \cos (x) + \sin (x) \frac{d \cos (x)}{dx} = \cos^2 (x) - \sin^2 (x) &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx} \log ( \sin (x) ) = \frac{1}{\sin (x)} \frac{d \sin (x)}{dx} = \frac{\cos (x)}{\sin (x)} . &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{1DWavesTOC}}
=== Group Velocity ===

We now ask the following question: How fast do wave packets move? Surprisingly, we often find that wave packets move at a speed very different from the phase speed, &lt;math&gt;c = \omega /k&lt;/math&gt;, of the wave composing the wave packet.

We shall find that the speed of motion of wave packets, referred to as the group velocity, is given by
: &lt;math&gt;u = \ 0.1 \mbox{m}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. The phase speed of deep ocean waves is &lt;math&gt;c = (g/k)^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;. However, since &lt;math&gt;c \equiv \omega /k&lt;/math&gt;, we find the frequency of deep ocean waves to be &lt;math&gt;\omega = (gk)^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;. The group velocity is therefore &lt;math&gt;u \equiv d \omega / dk = (g/k)^{1/2} / 2 = c/2&lt;/math&gt;. For the specified central wavenumber, we find that &lt;math&gt;u \approx (9.8 \mbox{ m} \mbox{ s}^{-2} / 0.1 \mbox{ m}^{-1} )^{1/2} / 2 \approx 5 \mbox{ m} \mbox{ s}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. By contrast, the phase speed of deep ocean waves with this wavelength is &lt;math&gt;c \approx 10 \mbox{ m} \mbox{ s}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

Dispersive waves are waves in which the phase speed varies with wavenumber. It is easy to show that dispersive waves have unequal phase and group velocities, while these velocities are equal for non-dispersive waves.

=== Derivation of Group Velocity Formula ===

We now derive equation (1.36). It is easiest to do this for the simplest wave packets, namely those constructed out of the superposition of just two sine waves. We will proceed by adding two waves with full space and time dependence:
:&lt;math&gt; A = \sin ( k_1 x - \omega_1 t ) + \sin ( k_2 x - \omega_2 t ) &lt;/math&gt; (2.37)

After algebraic and trigonometric manipulations familiar from earlier sections, we find
:&lt;math&gt; A = 2 \sin ( k_0 x - \omega_0 t ) \cos ( \Delta k x - \Delta \omega t ) , &lt;/math&gt; (2.38)

where as before we have &lt;math&gt;k_0 = (k_1 + k_2 )/2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\omega_0 = ( \omega_1 + \omega_2 )/2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\Delta k = (k_2 - k_1 )/2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\Delta \omega = ( \omega_2 - \omega_1 )/2&lt;/math&gt;. Again think of this as a sine wave of frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega_0&lt;/math&gt; and wavenumber &lt;math&gt;k_0&lt;/math&gt; modulated by a cosine function. In this case the modulation pattern moves with a speed so as to keep the argument of the cosine function constant:
:&lt;math&gt; \Delta k x - \Delta \omega t = const. &lt;/math&gt; (2.39)

Differentiating this with respect to &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; while holding &lt;math&gt;\Delta k&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta \omega&lt;/math&gt; constant yields
:&lt;math&gt; u \equiv \frac{dx}{dt} = \frac{\Delta \omega}{\Delta k} . &lt;/math&gt; (2.40)

In the limit in which the deltas become very small, this reduces to the derivative
:&lt;math&gt; u = \frac{d \omega}{d k} , &lt;/math&gt; (2.41)

which is the desired result.

=== Examples ===

We now illustrate some examples of phase speed and group velocity by showing the displacement resulting from the superposition of two sine waves, as given by equation (1.38), in the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; plane. This is an example of a spacetime diagram, of which we will see many examples latter on.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; [[Image:Introductory Physics fig 1.16.png|Figure 1.16: Net displacement of two sine waves]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 1.16''': Net displacement of the sum of two traveling sine waves plotted in the &lt;math&gt;x - t&lt;/math&gt; plane. The short vertical lines indicate where the displacement is large and positive, while the short horizontal lines indicate where it is large and negative. One wave has &lt;math&gt;k = 4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega = 4&lt;/math&gt;, while the other has &lt;math&gt;k = 5&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega = 5&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;\Delta k = 5 - 4 = 1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\Delta \omega = 5 - 4 = 1&lt;/math&gt; and we have &lt;math&gt;u = \Delta \omega / \Delta k = 1&lt;/math&gt;. Notice that the phase speed for the first sine wave is &lt;math&gt;c_1 = 4/4 = 1&lt;/math&gt; and for the second wave is &lt;math&gt;c_2 = 5/5 = 1&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;c_1 = c_2 = u&lt;/math&gt; in this case.&lt;/div&gt;

Figure 1.16 shows a non-dispersive case in which the phase speed equals the group velocity. The regions with vertical and horizontal hatching (short vertical or horizontal lines) indicate where the wave displacement is large and positive or large and negative. Large displacements indicate the location of wave packets. The positions of waves and wave packets at any given time may therefore be determined by drawing a horizontal line across the graph at the desired time and examining the variations in wave displacement along this line. The crests of the waves are indicated by regions of short vertical lines. Notice that as time increases, the crests move to the right. This corresponds to the motion of the waves within the wave packets. Note also that the wave packets, i. e., the broad regions of large positive and negative amplitudes, move to the right with increasing time as well.

Since velocity is distance moved &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; divided by elapsed time &lt;math&gt;\Delta t&lt;/math&gt;, the slope of a line in figure 1.16, &lt;math&gt;\Delta t / \Delta x&lt;/math&gt;, is one over the velocity of whatever that line represents. The slopes of lines representing crests (the slanted lines, not the short horizontal and vertical lines) are the same as the slopes of lines representing wave packets in this case, which indicates that the two move at the same velocity. Since the speed of movement of wave crests is the phase speed and the speed of movement of wave packets is the group velocity, the two velocities are equal and the non-dispersive nature of this case is confirmed.

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; [[Image:Introductory Physics fig 1.17.png|Figure 1.17: Net displacement of the sum of two traveling sine waves]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 1.17''': Net displacement of the sum of two traveling sine waves plotted in the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; plane. One wave has &lt;math&gt;k = 4.5&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega = 4&lt;/math&gt;, while the other has &lt;math&gt;k = 5.5&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega = 6&lt;/math&gt;. In this case &lt;math&gt;\Delta k = 5.5 - 4.5 = 1&lt;/math&gt; while &lt;math&gt;\Delta \omega = 6 - 4 = 2&lt;/math&gt;, so the group velocity is &lt;math&gt;u = \Delta \omega / \Delta k = 2/1 = 2&lt;/math&gt;. However, the phase speeds for the two waves are &lt;math&gt;c_1 = 4/4.5 = 0.889&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_2 = 6/5.5 = 1.091&lt;/math&gt;. The average of the two phase speeds is about &lt;math&gt;0.989&lt;/math&gt;, so the group velocity is about twice the average phase speed in this case. &lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;margin:0 0 1em 1em;text-align:center;&quot;&gt; [[Image:Introductory Physics fig 1.18.png|Figure 1.18: Net displacement of the sum of two traveling sine waves]]&lt;br&gt;
'''Figure 1.18''': Net displacement of the sum of two traveling sine waves plotted in the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-&lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; plane. One wave has &lt;math&gt;k = 4&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega = 5&lt;/math&gt;, while the other has &lt;math&gt;k = 5&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\omega = 4&lt;/math&gt;. Can you figure out the group velocity and the average phase speed in this case? Do these velocities match the apparent phase and group speeds in the figure? &lt;/div&gt;

Figure 1.17 shows a dispersive wave in which the group velocity is twice the phase speed, while figure 1.18 shows a case in which the group velocity is actually opposite in sign to the phase speed. See if you can confirm that the phase and group velocities seen in each figure correspond to the values for these quantities calculated from the specified frequencies and wavenumbers.

## If the wavelength of the microwaves is &lt;math&gt;\lambda &lt;/math&gt;, how far do you have to travel in your car for the interference between the two beams to go from constructive to destructive to constructive?
## If you are traveling toward the radar at speed &lt;math&gt;v = 30 \mbox{ m} \mbox{ s}^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, use the above result to determine the number of times per second constructive interference peaks will occur. Assume that &lt;math&gt;\lambda = 3 \mbox{ cm}&lt;/math&gt;.

# Suppose you know the wavelength of light passing through a Michelson interferometer high accuracy. Describe how you could use the interferometer to measure the length of a small piece of material.
# A Fabry-Perot interferometer (see figure 1.20) consists of two parallel half-silvered mirrors placed a distance &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; from each other as shown. The beam passing straight through interferes with the beam which reflects once off of both of the mirrored surfaces as shown. For wavelength &lt;math&gt;\lambda &lt;/math&gt;, what values of &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; result in constructive interference?
# A Fabry-Perot interferometer has spacing &lt;math&gt;d = 2 \mbox{ cm}&lt;/math&gt; between the glass plates, causing the direct and doubly reflected beams to interfere (see figure 1.20). As air is pumped out of the gap between the plates, the beams go through 23 cycles of constructive-destructive-constructive interference. If the wavelength of the light in the interfering beams is &lt;math&gt;5 \times 10^{-7} \mbox{ m}&lt;/math&gt;, determine the index of refraction of the air initially in the interferometer.

The wave is a physical phenomenon that is found in a variety of contexts, a perturbation in the medium. You undoubtedly know about ocean waves and have probably played with a stretched slinky toy, producing undulations which move rapidly along the slinky. Other examples of waves are sound, vibrations in solids, and light (photons have the particularity of sharing characteristics of both waves and particles).  

Despite the vast differences in these different types of waves, they all consist of a fluctuation around an equilibrium position caused by a restoring force, and can be described by the same types of mathematical equations.  Understanding these equations is a powerful tool because it will let you understand the basics of a wide variety of seemingly unrelated phenomena.  The purpose of this section is to describe the ''kinematics'' of waves, i.e., to provide tools for describing the form and motion of all waves irrespective of their underlying physical mechanisms.

In this chapter we learn first about the basic properties of waves and introduce the most common type of wave, called the sinusoidal(sine) wave. In fact just about any type of wave can be expressed as a combination of sine functions using a technique proposed by Charles Fourier.  Examples of waves seen in the real world are presented. We then learn about the superposition principle, which allows us to construct complex wave patterns by superimposing sine waves. Using these ideas, we discuss the related ideas of beats and interferometry. Finally, the ideas of wave packets and group velocity are introduced.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hi!
I am glad someone filled in the things I was missing on the Calculus:Functions page, but I had a few questions about things I wasn't sure about.  I might have modified some of them, but I wasn't sure ''why'' you did what you did, so I thought I might ask first:

*In the definition of a function you referred to the formal definition of function (set of ordered pairs).  Most people would completely miss the point, unless we went in more detail, which I don't think is wise.  What do you think?
*&quot;in the world of real numbers&quot; is another (less) obscure reference.  Anyone familar with complex numbers would understand what was meant without the parenthetical clause, but someone who wasn't familar wouldn't care.  Of course, that is no reason not to be precise, so leaving it in would still be appropriate.
*In the example of adding, subtracting, etc. the functions f and g, you wrote &quot;def&quot; before the subtraction example.  Why?  What do you mean?
*I like the continuity section.  I was going to wait until limits to introduce it, but you tied it in with graphing effectively.
*I had left out a * 0 = 0 intentionally, since it is not an axiom of field theory (it can be proved easily).  Of course, I never titled the list as &quot;axioms of field theory&quot;, but rather as arithematic truths -- and a * 0 = 0 is certainly true.  Anyone reading it not familar with field theory would not notice one way or another.  So I am split in whether I think it should be included or not.  On second thought, the whole Algebra section is mostly redundant -- the only commonly missed fact is the distributive property (anyone who doesn't know a + 0 = a or a * 1 = a shouldn't be taking Calculus).

Conincidentally, my name happens to be Eric as well.

Re: functions as ordered pairs -- Perhaps you're right. That little bit of information isn't necessary, as functions are rarely specified by giving a set of ordered pairs.

Re: complex numbers -- I hope people trying to take calculus have already been introduced to imaginary numbers in algebra or trig. Also, I remember that there is one method for solving differential equations that involves complex numbers (though I'm uncertain of the details), so if we think people won't know/remember them we should cover them in a review section (unless we are not covering that, but since there is a major section &quot;Advanced Calculus&quot; I assume we will be.)

Re: &quot;def&quot; -- It's just a typo. I meant nothing by it.

Re: continuity -- Thank you.

Re: a*0 -- Well, I thought a * 0 = 0 was an axiom, but apparently I misremembered. I definately agree that it should be removed.

About the Hello, World! Page, Sorry, I was being rude.  Sometimes I do get carried away.  I was probably just in a bad mood at the time.  For example: using endl is just a preference because I don't like it when I write a program, and nothing shows up on the screen until the program exits.  The return 0, is the only thing I really have a problem with.  Point: You are right about the not having to return 0.  Counter-Point: But since it is standard pratice not to rely on the system to free all of your ram you've allocated, should it also be right to rely on the system to return the 0?

Josh:[[User:Mrquick|Mrquick]] 23:13 29 Jul 2003 (UTC)

Well, I suppose that's a style issue, too. The implicit &quot;return 0;&quot; is guaranteed according to the C++ standard. You could say it's better to explictly state that there were no errors. Or you could say that by default we assume the program did not encounter errors.

About the [[calculus]] page: it didn't exist and was showing in red. See the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]]. Apparently the database got confused and marked it as a nonexistent page with a history. Thanks for reverting it. [[User:Geoffrey|Geoffrey]] 23:31, 11 Aug 2003 (UTC)

Hi Eric, sorry I didn't realize before that you've put up a new puzzle. I've moved it to our new subcategories under 'Arithmetic Puzzles'. [[User:ThomasStrohmann | Thomas]]</text>
