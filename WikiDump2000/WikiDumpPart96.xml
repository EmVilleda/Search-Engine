==ISFPs at work==
ISFPs like low key, low stress, aesthetically beautiful work environments that are fun. They like to work by themselves or in small groups cooperatively, but may not like being the leader and they have a harsh inner critic. They are gentle people and don't like to pressure others into deadlines unless necessary. When forced into a position of power, they may feel cornered and very uncomfortable making decisions.  Their favorite subjects might be music, cooking, painting, drawing, gardening, musical theatre, sculpting and helping others. They are often quite talented but often quiet about showing the world. Make work a game, and they'll work happily. Many ISFPs are attracted to fine arts, which they often have hidden talent in.

==ISFPs in relationships==
ISFPs are kind, modest, quietly generous people. They like people and make true blue friends, however it may take a while. Their partners need to respect the ISFPs need for the privacy they need to recharge themselves. They like to spend time with people one-on-one or with a small group of two or three others who understand them. When the ISFP gets to know you on a personal, one-on-one basis, they are warm, affectionate, a little more talkative and even humorous, telling jokes to make friends laugh. They share opinions only with people they know very well. ISFPs like to make people happy with a smile and a song, slapstick comedy or light practical joking (ice cube down the back). If nothing works, they think it is their fault and withdraw. They often make friends with those they feel will protect and stand up for them, and usually have a small group of close (often very outgoing) friends.  For love, they want someone patient who will be there for them and also stand up for them when they can't themselves, and whom they could speak their mind with without feeling foolish. However, they do not want someone to control them, as they value their freedom highly. They can be afraid of commitment at times. They take criticism personally, and feel at fault for people's reactions toward them. To show love, ISFPs would give you something they made themselves like a painting, some homemade cookies, a song dedicated to you or something they found that just happened to remind them of you. They like to be told how special and important they are to you, be specific and truthful. They aren't wordy people but can be eloquent and descriptive in their speech when they want to be.

==How to deal with an ISFP==
*Talk to them gently and in a soft voice
*Hug them often; they prefer actions rather than words to express love
*Ask them how they feel about things and what they would like to do
*Go with them on long leisurely walks alone together
*Let them have their space
*Play gentle games with them--they like competition but prefer co-op
*No horror films or anything too violent or dramatically sad. ISFPs like to be happy.
*Make work fun, or they won't want to do it at all.
*Let them have some me-time in which they can do anything they want
*Tell them how they're talented when they doubt themselves, which could be often
*They have an affinity for soft fabrics and long walks in natural settings away from large crowds
*They like flowers and often have a favorite kind; ask them

==INFPs at work==
INFPs love to work behind-the-scenes and support the group.  If they feel they are appreciated for their hard, considerate work, they often enjoy themselves immensely.  Because they are often socially unsure, many find jobs they can do from home.

==INFPs in relationships==
INFPs are very sensitive beings, and oftentimes the social scene feels extremely repressive and painful for them.  They want very much to be accepted and cared for, but sometimes they become so uncomfortable that they become very nervous and feel completely out of place.  Many try to express feelings of sadness and helplessness to those close to them for support.  For lovers, they often look for outgoing, strong,caring people who can help them feel a part of things and who they can give their love.

==How to deal with an INFP==

Because the INFP tends to extrovert their iNtuition (they can reveal out loud the possibilities that they are imagining when they imagine them) to the world yet at the same time introvert their Feeling decision-making (not reveal the values and processes they really hold), they can seem to others that the possibilities they suggest are really decisions.  Because they say things (possibilities) they don't necessarily believe, it is crucial to verify with them if some of their statements are truly decisions or judgements.

In order to help the INFP feel good about themselves, it is necessary to tell them verbally that you care about them.  They need a great deal of positive affirmation and can become very self-conscious and insecure and lost without it.  Some say that they 'can't do anything right' and feel very depressed and lonely.

In conflict, keep in mind that, if pressured, the INFP may try to change the subject and escape.  It is best to treat them very gently and lightly discuss the subject at hand without seeming angry or upset with them.  When they feel very cornered, their usually sweet exterior rapidly changes and they begin to lash out.  Do not take this behaviour harshly, for this happens only under very rare circumstances and when the INFP feels they have no other choice.  If they feel they have shared their feelings in a kind and loving environment without being criticized for them, they often feel quite content and calm.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{PersonalityTypeTOC}}

INTPs are introverts, meaning they tend to prefer relatively solitary lives. They are often uncomfortable in social gatherings, particularly large ones, which can leave them feeling somewhat drained. Although some may have many acquaintances, INTPs usually have only a few close friends, if any at all. However, this also means they tend to be nonchalant about their public image.

INTPs favor iNtuition over Sensing. As such, they tend to be more introspective than attentive to their surroundings. It is common for an INTP to daydream, or simply become lost in his or her thoughts. INTPs often enjoy contemplating interesting ideas, concepts, and possibilities due to iNtuition—their curiosity drives them. However, their senses are somewhat less refined than in other types. They may overlook details (INTPs are prone to &quot;careless errors&quot; in math), and are not often completely attuned to what is going on around them. An INTP deep in thought can be oblivious to all sorts of things, ranging from a missed meal to a cap being stolen from his or her head.

An INTP prefers Thinking over Feeling, meaning he or she tends to value logic over feelings. Although INTPs experience emotions as powerfully as other types, they almost always must see the logic behind them before acting on them. All decisions must have good reasons behind them, and INTPs rarely make good decisions without considerable thought. It is usually very important to an INTP to be as logically and grammatically accurate as possible. However, INTPs are somewhat inept at expressing feelings outwardly, sometimes causing misunderstandings. Sarcasm and cynicism are occasionally observed in INTPs.

Since INTPs have a Perceiving preference, they don't enjoy being limited by schedules or decisions. They tend to have bursts of creative energy, which can lead to extraordinary efforts, but the energy can also be short-lived. After the energy is expired, attention may be directed elsewhere, where energy may be regenerated. In other words, INTPs may have many interests due to their preference for perceiving, and these interests may come and go, or change altogether.

Being introverts, INTPs are usually very reserved.  Their iNtuition allows them to rapidly understand new concepts and to pursue a wide variety of interests. Their Thinking helps them to find the logic in a situation from an objective point of view. INTPs' Perceiving causes them to be open-ended; often thinking about a task is more rewarding than executing the task.

INTPs often feel like misfits and are not necessarily always appreciated.  Many INTPs complain of boredom, as the real world fails to measure up to the vivid experiences of their imaginations.

==INTPs at work==

Make good teachers, computer programmers, analysts, architects and scientists.

==INTPs in relationships==

INTPs face many tough hurdles in their relationships. Many INTPs do not focus on developing strong social skills, but even those who do will divert much of their energy into their solitary pursuits. Characterized best by the lonely adventurer, their adventures are rarely literal trips to the end of the earth (the territory of the SPs), but instead fantastic intellectual journeys.  

One study found that INTPs tend to marry other INTPs.  

==How to Interact with an INTP==

* Allow him or her time to make a decision.
* Realize that small talk is not very interesting to the INTP. However, a topic which ignites the INTP's imagination can spark a good discussion.
* Try not to be easily offended. Unless you have made an enemy of the INTP, chances are the comment was not meant to hurt you.
* Be prepared to encounter a strange sense of humor, a great curiosity, and an unusual train of thought.
* Use logic as persuasion; the INTP is likely to ignore emotional appeals.
* Hear him or her out. Most INTPs don't speak up often, and may get annoyed if ignored when they do.
* Know that the INTP's energy comes in bursts, so he or she may put off chores in favor of more interesting material and then accomplish the postponed work in an extraordinarily short amount of time.
* Be aware that the INTP is highly self-critical.

==ESFPs at work and school==
ESFPs see work as play. They like to whistle, drum, sing, talk or joke while they are doing work to keep what they are learning fun for them. This could cause teachers, mostly SJs, to feel that they are not paying attention. It could also be disturbing to people who like quiet when they think. ESFPs learn best when they are having fun. They also look at the person who is speaking to them as they can feel sound vibrations strongly. As they work they celebrate small accomplishments in what they are doing before moving on to the next, happy for what they have done, rather then being sad at what they still have to do. 
When they work with more logical things such as mathematics, they want to know how it relates to life right now. Preferring a hands-on approach, subjects like those can bore them. 
Their favorite subjects are ones that they have an interest in and ones that they can do things with and apply to the world around them. Music, drama, dance, competitive sports and computers are among many they like. They may also go into those areas when choosing their careers. Careers that may appeal to ESFPs are: actor, musician, stand up comedian, dancer, dance instructor, their favorite position in their sport of choice, gardener, painter, sculptor and chef. Sometimes though, it's hard for them to decide.

==ESFPs in relationships==
ESFPs are warm, loving, generous and sympathetic. They especially like physical affection such as hugs, kisses, petting on the head, massages, snuggles, tickles, and just being held. They show their love through those ways as well as surprising friends and loved ones with gifts. They want fun, variety, spontaneity, travel and adventure in their relationships and are usually not keen on settling down. This could be because of fear of rejection, commitment or because they found someone else. They like to keep things light and happy and not get into anything deep and lasting unless they are sure and have thought it out, which could take a while. This could cause their mates to express impatience which would make the ESFPs nervous and withdraw from them. ESFPs do not do well with anxiety, and are highly sensitive. When they can't make people smile with their charming ways and their playfulness, they feel bad as though it was their fault and leave.
When they are in their best mood, they are seen as bouncy, hyperactive and childlike. They go from one activity to another so they won't be bored. When feeling their worst, they are moody, likely to beat themselves up (physically and/or mentally), call themselves unintelligent, think nobody takes them seriously and feel better after a good cry.

==How to deal with an ESFP==
Explain things clearly, Appeal to their common sense, Do something they enjoy with them, Discuss things over a break in the action and then get right back into the fun, give them lots of tlc.

==ENTPs at work==

==ENTPs in relationships==

ENTP's love to be in relationships, and are very loyal, fantastic in bed, and great at managing life, but will not just be in a relationship just to be in a relationship. Entp's like to think they are the caretakers, and will do so for the most part, but for a true relationship with them, one needs to get past the strong exterior and nourish their underlying needs, which they may never tell you. Massage is a great way to get an ENTP comfortable. They are shy at first and never feel 100% accepted in social settings, although they tend to be the belle of the ball. They are interesting to talk to, and find the best friendship in those who have good conversation. ENTP friend are active, like going for walks, doing sports, going on adventures and trips. Love and relationships can be the best or the worst for an ENTP, as love can inspire and drive them, but can also drive them insane. Not feeling accepted can make an  ENTP shy away and hide. Happy mediums can and should be found in relationships. ENTP's get very invested in their work, ideas or passions. If something is bothering them, it never leaves their mind. If you've found an ENTP who gets inspired by you, hold on for a wild ride, your ENTP will be wildly successful and needs a sexy partner to come home to and escape with.

==ENTJs at work==
Quick to begin planning.  They constantly scope the area for logical problems to solve.  It triggers their bank of 'ideas', allowing them to associate and classify objects.  Mostly an intuitive creature, the raw 'idea', can be used, or it can receive further stimulus from Extraverted Sensing, and lastly. Introverted Feeling. 

A complicated, genius, logical, strategy, is born!  They intensely bury their efforts into the goal at hand, and tirelessly work against it.  Those working with them, soon recognize the ENTJ's competence and importance, and rely on it for many small issues.  The ENTJ is now needed.  With the deadline of a complex project at hand, they continue to pour in more effort, struggling against the clock, and seeking closure.  

Quick to stand up for any thing they find logical, they come off opinionated, aggressive, and highly extroverted at work.  Their identity doesn't matter in the work place.  Work matters.  Production matters.  Capital matters.  Their emotions don't matter!  If they push their limits, and establish a dominant role, as a person with high influence, they are &quot;winning the fight&quot;.  Promotions are looked at as 'positive re-enforcement'.  'Good job, you are so smart!' is liable to make an ENTJ feel like a little kid, which is not what you want to do.

As the deadline of the project gets close, they push for any extra addrenaline they can find in them.  Twenty-four hours a day is a common shift length.  All in time, to finish 2 days early, in the 3 month battle.

For that moment, they have the opportunity to seize the reward they deserve for their efforts!

In general, they are too intense for standard, procedure-based, punch in, punch out, work styles.  They would much rather take on a project, establishing an impossible goal, and obtain it, whenever he/she feels like working on it. 

They want to be heard, taken seriously, believed in, and trusted.  However, don't ask them for their &quot;fully detailed plans,&quot; - only they know what they truly mean.  When working in a team, he/she'll tell you what you need to know, just believe them and be ready to give information upon request.

==ENTJs in relationships==
-ENTJs have strong personalities, so they would also want to be in the company of people who have their own opinion and people who won't bring them down.

==How to deal with an ENTJ==
- Be assertive and stand up for your ideas

- Support your idea/argument with reasonable facts

- Be completely objective (do not bring in personal beliefs or fear their wrath)

- Be straightforward and never lie as to any ENTJ it shows a sign of weakness 

- Do not make them feel vulnerable or weak, they have trouble being open-hearted
 
- When it seems they are becoming angry, simply give them time to think before they come up with a more cooperative nature

- Acknowledge that they don't always assume that they are right but it's just their manner of speaking

- Never betray their trust (seriously don't) or else you are a goner

&lt;th&gt;C&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
# Dhritarashtra said: Assembled on the field of Dharma, O Sanjaya, on the field of the Kurus, eager to fight, what did my people and the Pandavas do?
# Sanjaya said: Then Duryodhana the prince, seeing the army of the Pandavas drawn up in battle array, approached his master and spoke these words:
# Behold, O Master, this great army of the sons of Pandu, arrayed by your wise pupil, the son of Drupada.
# Here are men of valour, mighty archers, the equals of Bhima and Arjuna - in battle Yuyudhana, Virata and Drupada, the maharathi.
# Dhrishtaketu, Chekitana and the valiant king of Kashi, aIso Purujit, Kuntibhoja and Shaibya, chief among men.
# Yudhamanyu, the brave; the valiant Uttamauja; also the son of Subhadra and the sons of Draupadi - all of them maharathis.
# Know well, O noblest of the twice- born, those who are pre-eminent among us. I speak to you of the leaders of my army that you may know them.
# Thyself and Bhishma and Karna and Kripa, victor in battle; Ashvatthama and Vikarna and also the son of Somadatta.
# And many other heroes there are, armed with various weapons, all skilled in warfare, who have risked their lives for me.
# Unlimited is that army of ours commanded by Bhishma, whereas this their army commanded by Bhima is limited.
# Therefore, stationed in your respective positions on all fronts, support Bhishma alone, all of you!
# The aged Kuru, the glorious grandsire (Bhishma), gave a loud roar like a lion and blew his conch, gladdening the heart of Duryodhana.
# Then quite suddenly conches, horns, kettledrums, tabors and drums blared forth, and the sound was tumultuous.
# Then, seated in a great chariot yoked to white horses, Madhava (Lord Krishna) and the son of Pandu (Arjuna) also blew their gIorious conches.
# Hrishikesha (Lord Krishna) blew Panchajanya, Dhananjaya (Arjuna) blew Devadatta, Bhima of powerful deeds blew his great conch Paundra.
# Prince Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, blew his conch Anantavijaya; Nakula and Sahadeva blew Sughosha and Manipushpaka.
# The King of Kashi, the great archer, and Shikhandi, the maharathi, Dhrishtadyumna and Virata and Satyaki, the unsubdued.
# Drupada, as well as the sons of Draupadi, and the mighty-armed son of Subhadra, O Lord of earth, all blew their different conches.
# That tumultuous uproar, reverberating through earth and sky, rent the hearts of Dhritarashtra's men.
# Then, seeing the sons of Dhritarashtra drawn up in battle order, as missiles where about to fly, the son of Pandu (Arjuna), whose banner bore the image of Hanuman, took up his bow.
# Then, O Lord of earth, he spoke these words to Hrishikesha (Lord Krishna): Draw up my chariot between the two armies, O Achyuta.
# So that I may observe those who stand here eager for battle and know with whom I should fight in this toil of war.
# Let me look on those who are assembled here ready to fight, eager to accomplish in battle what is dear to the evil-minded son of Dhritarashtra.
# Sanjaya said: O Bharata, thus invoked by Gudakesha (Arjuna), Hrishikesha (Lord Krishna), having drawn up the magnificent chariot between the two armies,
# Before Bhishma and Drona and all the rulers of the earth, said: Partha (Arjuna)! behold these Kurus gathered together.
# The son of Pritha (Arjuna) saw there before him uncles and grandfathers, teachers, maternal uncles, brothers, sons and grandsons and many friends as well.
# Fathers-in-law and well-wishers also in both the armies. Then that son of Kunti (Arjuna), seeing all these kinsmen thus present,
# Possessed by extreme compassion, spoke this in grief: Seeing these my kinsmen, O Krishna, gathered, eager to fight,
# My limbs fail and my mouth is parched, my body quivers and my hair stands on end.
# Gandiva (the bow) slips from my hand and even my skin burns all over; I am unable to stand and my mind seems to whirl.
# And I see adverse omens, O Keshava (Lord Krishna), nor can I see good from killing my kinsmen in battle.
# I desire not victory, O Krishna, nor a kingdom, nor pleasures. Of what avail will a kingdom be to us, or enjoyments, or even life, O Govinda?
# Those for whose sake we desire a kingdom, enjoyments and comforts are here on the battlefield, having resigned their lives and riches.
# Teachers, uncles, sons and likewise grandfathers, maternal uncles, fathers-in-law, grandsons, brothers-in-law and other kinsmen.
# O Madhusudana (Lord Krishna), these I do not wish to kill - though killed myself - even for the sake of sovereignty of the three worlds, how much less for this world.
# What happiness could come to us from slaying the sons of Dhritarashtra, O Janardana (Lord Krishna)? Only sin could come upon us through killing these aggressors.
# Therefore it would not be right for us to kill the sons of Dhritarashtra, our own kinsmen. How should we be happy after killing our own people, O Madhava?
# Although, their minds clouded by greed, they see no wrong in bringing destruction to the family and no sin in treachery to friends,
# How should we not know to turn away from this sin, we who clearly see the wrong in bringing destruction upon the family, O Janardana ?
# The age-old family dharmas are lost in the destruction of a family. Its dharma lost, adharma overtakes the entire family.
# When adharma prevails, O Krishna, the women of the family become corrupt, and with the corruption of women, O Varshneya, intermixture of castes arises.
# This intermixture leads only to hell, both for the family and its destroyers. Their forefathers fall as well, when the offerings of the Pindodaka cease.
# Through the wrongs done by the destroyers of the family in causing the intermixing of castes, the immemorial dharmas of caste and family become extinct.
# Men whose family dharmas have lapsed, so we have heard, O Janardana (Lord Krishna), necessarily live in hell.
# Alas! We are resolved to commit great sin in that we are prepared to slay our kinsmen out of greed for the pleasures of a kingdom.
# It were better for me if the sons of Dhritarashtra, weapons in hand, should slay me, unresisting and unarmed in battle.
# Sanjaya said: Having spoken thus at the time of battle, casting away arrows and bows, Arjuna sat down on the seat of the chariot, his mind overwhelmed with sorrow.&lt;/td&gt; 
&lt;td&gt; &lt;font color=blue&gt; 
# Dhritarashtra nói: Assembled on the field of Dharma, O Sanjaya, on the field of the Kurus, eager to fight, what did my people and the Pandavas do?
# Sanjaya nói:&lt;/font&gt; Then Duryodhana the prince, seeing the army of the Pandavas drawn up in battle array, approached his master and spoke these words:
# Behold, O Master, this great army of the sons of Pandu, arrayed by your wise pupil, the son of Drupada.
# Here are men of valour, mighty archers, the equals of Bhima and Arjuna - in battle Yuyudhana, Virata and Drupada, the maharathi.
# Dhrishtaketu, Chekitana and the valiant king of Kashi, aIso Purujit, Kuntibhoja and Shaibya, chief among men.
# Yudhamanyu, the brave; the valiant Uttamauja; also the son of Subhadra and the sons of Draupadi - all of them maharathis.
# Know well, O noblest of the twice- born, those who are pre-eminent among us. I speak to you of the leaders of my army that you may know them.
# Thyself and Bhishma and Karna and Kripa, victor in battle; Ashvatthama and Vikarna and also the son of Somadatta.
# And many other heroes there are, armed with various weapons, all skilled in warfare, who have risked their lives for me.
# Unlimited is that army of ours commanded by Bhishma, whereas this their army commanded by Bhima is limited.
# Therefore, stationed in your respective positions on all fronts, support Bhishma alone, all of you!
# The aged Kuru, the glorious grandsire (Bhishma), gave a loud roar like a lion and blew his conch, gladdening the heart of Duryodhana.
# Then quite suddenly conches, horns, kettledrums, tabors and drums blared forth, and the sound was tumultuous.
# Then, seated in a great chariot yoked to white horses, Madhava (Lord Krishna) and the son of Pandu (Arjuna) also blew their gIorious conches.&lt;font color=blue&gt; 
# Hrishikesha (Đấng Krishna)&lt;/font&gt; blew Panchajanya, Dhananjaya (Arjuna) blew Devadatta, Bhima of powerful deeds blew his great conch Paundra.
# Prince Yudhishthira, the son of Kunti, blew his conch Anantavijaya; Nakula and Sahadeva blew Sughosha and Manipushpaka.
# The King of Kashi, the great archer, and Shikhandi, the maharathi, Dhrishtadyumna and Virata and Satyaki, the unsubdued.
# Drupada, as well as the sons of Draupadi, and the mighty-armed son of Subhadra, O Lord of earth, all blew their different conches.
# That tumultuous uproar, reverberating through earth and sky, rent the hearts of Dhritarashtra's men.
# Then, seeing the sons of Dhritarashtra drawn up in battle order, as missiles where about to fly, the son of Pandu (Arjuna), whose banner bore the image of Hanuman, took up his bow.
# Then, O Lord of earth, he spoke these words to Hrishikesha (Lord Krishna): Draw up my chariot between the two armies, O Achyuta.
# So that I may observe those who stand here eager for battle and know with whom I should fight in this toil of war.
# Let me look on those who are assembled here ready to fight, eager to accomplish in battle what is dear to the evil-minded son of Dhritarashtra.&lt;font color=blue&gt; 
# Sanjaya nói:&lt;/font&gt; O Bharata, thus invoked by Gudakesha (Arjuna),&lt;font color=blue&gt; Hrishikesha (Đấng Krishna), sau khi&lt;/font&gt; drawn up the magnificent chariot between the two armies,
# Before Bhishma and Drona and all the rulers of the earth,&lt;font color=blue&gt; nói: Partha (Arjuna)! Coi bọn Kuru họp lại với nhau kìa.&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;th&gt;CHAPTER VI&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;&lt;font color=blue&gt;CHƯƠNG VI&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;
# Đấng ThiêngLiêng nói:&lt;/font&gt; He who performs action that ought to be done, without depending on the fruit of action, he is a sanyasi and he is a yogi; not he who is without fire and without activity.
# That which they call Sanyasa, know it to be Yoga, O son of Pandu, for no one becomes a yogi who has not relinquished the incentive of desire.
# Action is said to be the means for the man of thought wishing to ascend to Yoga; for the man who has ascended to Yoga, and for him alone, calmness is said to be the means.
# Only when a man does not cling to the objects of the senses or to actions, only when he has relinquished all incentive of desire, is he said to have ascended to Yoga.
# Let a man raise his self by his Self, let him not debase his Self; he alone, indeed, is his own friend, he alone his own enemy.
# He who has conquered his self by his Self alone is himself his own friend; but the Self of him who has not conquered his self will behave with enmity like a foe.
# For him who has conquered his self, who is deep in peace, the transcendent Self is steadfast in heat and cold, in pleasure and pain, in honour and disgrace.
# That yogi is said to be united who is contented in knowledge and experience, unshakeable, master of the senses, who is balanced in experiencing earth, stone or gold.
# Distinguished is he who is of even intellect among well-wishers, friends and foes, among the indifferent and the impartial, among hatefuI persons and among kinsmen, among the saints as well as the sinful.
# Let the yogi always collect himself remaining in seclusion, alone, his mind and body subdued, expecting nothing, without possessions,
# In a clean place, having set his seat firm, neither very high nor very low, having placed sacred grass, deerskin and cloth one upon the other.
# Seated there on the seat, having made the mind one-pointed, with the activity of the senses and thought subdued, let him practise Yoga for self-purification.
# Steady, keeping body, head and neck upright and still, having directed his gaze to the front of his nose, without looking in any direction,
# With his being deep in peace, freed from fear, settled in the vow of chastity, with mind subdued and thought given over to Me, let him sit united realizing Me as the Transcendent.
# Ever thus collecting himself, the yogi of disciplined mind attains to peace, the supreme liberation that abides in Me.
# Yoga, indeed, is not for him who eats too much nor for him who does not eat at all, O Arjuna; it is not for him who is too much given to sleep nor yet for him who keeps awake.
# For him who is moderate in food and recreation, moderate of effort in actions, moderate in sleep and waking, for him is the Yoga which destroys sorrow.
# When his mind, completely settled, is established in the Self alone, when he is free from craving for any pleasure, then is he said to be united.
# A lamp which does not flicker in a windless pIace, to such is compared the yogi of subdued thought practising Union with the Self.
# That (state) in which thought, settled through the practice of Yoga, retires, in which, seeing the Self by the Self alone, he finds contentment in the Self;
# Knowing that which is infinite joy and which, lying beyond the senses, is gained by the intellect, and wherein established, truly he does not waver;
# Having gained which he counts no other gain as higher, established in which he is not moved even by great sorrow;
# Let that disunion of the union with sorrow be known by the name of Yoga (Union). This Yoga should be practised with firm resolve and heart undismayed.
# Abandoning without reserve all desires from which the incentive (to action) is born, controlling the village of the senses on every side by the mind alone.
# Let him gradually retire through the intellect possessed of patience; having established the mind in the Self, let him not think at all.
# Whatever makes the fickle and unsteady mind wander forth, from that withdrawn, let him bring it under the sway of the Self alone.[[User:Vuara/VI.27|
# For supreme happiness comes to the yogi whose mind is deep in peace, in whom the spur to activity is stilled, who is without blemish and has become one with Brahman.]]
# Ever thus collecting himself, the yogi, freed from blemish, with ease attains contact with Brahman, which is infinite joy.
# He whose self is established in Yoga, whose vision everywhere is even, sees the Self in all beings, and all beings in the Self.
# He who sees Me everywhere, and sees everything in Me, I am not lost to him nor is he lost to Me.
# Established in Unity, he who worships Me abiding in all beings, in whatever way he lives, that yogi lives in Me.
# He who sees everything with an even vision by comparison with the Self, be it pleasure or pain, he is deemed the highest yogi, O Arjuna.
# Arjuna said: This Yoga described by Thee as characterized by evenness, O Madhusudana, I do not see its steady endurance, because of wavering.
# For wavering is the mind, O Krishna, turbulent, powerful and unyielding; I consider it as difficult to control as the wind.
# The Blessed Lord said: No doubt, O mighty-armed, the mind is hard to control, it is wavering, but by practice and non-attachment it is held, O son of Kunti.
# For an undisciplined man, Yoga is hard to achieve, so I consider; but it can be gained through proper means by the man of endeavour who is disciplined.
# Arjuna said: What goal does he reach, O Krishna, who is not perfected in Yoga, being endowed with faith, yet lacking effort, his mind strayed from Yoga?
# Deluded on the path to Brahman, O mighty-armed, without foothold and fallen from both, does he not perish like a broken cloud?
# Thou art able to dispel this doubt of mine completely, O Krishna. Truly, there is none save Thee who can dispel this doubt.
# The Blessed Lord said: O Partha, there is no destruction for him in this world or hereafter; for none who acts uprightly, My son, goes the way of misfortune.
# Having attained the worlds of the righteous and dwelt there for countless years, he that strayed from Yoga is born in the house of the pure and illustrious.
# Or he is born in an actual family of yogis endowed with wisdom, though such a birth as this on earth is more difficult to attain.
# There he regains that level of Union reached by the intellect in his former body, and by virtue of this, O joy of the Kurus, he strives yet more for perfection.
# By that former practice itself he is irresistibly borne on. Even the aspirant to Yoga passes beyond the Veda.
# But the yogi who strives with zeal, purified of all sin and perfected through many births, thereupon reaches the transcendent goal.
# A yogi is superior to the austere; he is deemed superior even to men of knowledge. A yogi is superior to men of action. Therefore be a yogi, O Arjuna.
# And of all yogis, I hold him most fully united who worships Me with faith, his inmost Self absorbed in Me.&lt;/td&gt;

# Arjuna nói:&lt;/font&gt; What goal does he reach, O Krishna, who is not perfected in Yoga, being endowed with faith, yet lacking effort, his mind strayed from Yoga?
# Deluded on the path to Brahman, O mighty-armed, without foothold and fallen from both, does he not perish like a broken cloud?
# Thou art able to dispel this doubt of mine completely, O Krishna. Truly, there is none save Thee who can dispel this doubt. &lt;font color=blue&gt;
# Đấng ThiêngLiêng nói:&lt;/font&gt; O Partha, there is no destruction for him in this world or hereafter; for none who acts uprightly, My son, goes the way of misfortune.
# Having attained the worlds of the righteous and dwelt there for countless years, he that strayed from Yoga is born in the house of the pure and illustrious.
# Or he is born in an actual family of yogis endowed with wisdom, though such a birth as this on earth is more difficult to attain.
# There he regains that level of Union reached by the intellect in his former body, and by virtue of this, O joy of the Kurus, he strives yet more for perfection.
# By that former practice itself he is irresistibly borne on. Even the aspirant to Yoga passes beyond the Veda.
# But the yogi who strives with zeal, purified of all sin and perfected through many births, thereupon reaches the transcendent goal.
# A yogi is superior to the austere; he is deemed superior even to men of knowledge. A yogi is superior to men of action. Therefore be a yogi, O Arjuna.
# And of all yogis, I hold him most fully united who worships Me with faith, his inmost Self absorbed in Me. &lt;/td&gt;</text>

# Arjuna said: Thou praisest, O Krishna, renunciation of action and Yoga (of action) at the same time. Tell me decisively which is the better of these two.
# The Blessed Lord said: Both renunciation and the Yoga of action lead to the supreme good. But of the two, the Yoga of action is superior to the renunciation of action.
# Know him to be ever a man of renunciation who neither hates nor desires; free from the pairs of opposites, he is easily released from bondage, O mighty-armed.
# The ignorant, and not the wise, speak of the path of knowledge (Sankhya) and the path of action (Yoga) as different. He who is properly established even in one gains the fruit of both.
# The state attained by men on the path of knowledge is also reached by those on the path of action. He who sees Sankhya and Yoga to be one, verily he sees.
# Renunciation is indeed hard to attain without Yoga, O mighty-armed. The sage who is intent on Yoga comes to Brahman without long delay.
# Intent on Yoga, pure of spirit, he who has fully mastered himself and has conquered the senses, whose self has become the Self of all beings, he is not involved even while he acts.
# {Verses 8, 9 together}
# One who is in Union with the Divine and who knows the Truth will maintain 'l do not act at all'. In seeing, hearing, touching, smelling, eating, walking, sleeping, breathing, speaking, letting go, seizing and even in opening and closing the eyes, he holds simply that the senses act among the objects of sense.
# He who acts giving over all actions to the universal Being, abandoning attachment, is untouched by sin as a lotus leaf by water.
# By means of the body, by the mind, by the intellect and even by the senses alone, yogis, abandoning attachment, perform action for self-purification.
# He who is united with the Divine, having abandoned the fruit of action, attains to lasting peace. He who is not united with the Divine, who is spurred by desire, being attached to the fruit of action, is firmly bound.
# Having renounced all action by the mind, the dweller in the body rests in happiness, in the city of nine gates, neither acting nor causing action to be done.
# The Lord creates neither the authorship of action nor the action of beings; nor does He create the link between (the doer), the action and its fruit Nature carries this out.
# The all-pervading Intelligence does not accept the sin or even the merit of anyone. Wisdom is veiled by ignorance. Thereby creatures are deluded.
# But in those in whom that ignorance is destroyed by wisdom, wisdom, like the sun, illumines That which is transcendent.
# Their intellect rooted in That, their being established in That, intent on That, wholly devoted to That, cleansed of all impurities by wisdom, they attain to a state from which there is no return.
# In a brahmin endowed with learning and humility, in a cow, in an elephant, in a dog and even in one who has lost his caste, the enlightened perceive the Same.
# Even here, in this life, the universe is conquered by those whose mind is established in equanimity. FIawless, indeed, and equally present everywhere is Brahman. Therefore they are established in Brahman.
# He who neither greatly rejoices on obtaining what is dear to him, nor grieves much on obtaining what is unpleasant, whose intellect is steady, who is free from delusion, he is a knower of Brahman, established in Brahman.
# He whose self is untouched by externaI contacts knows that happiness which is in the Self. His self joined in Union with Brahman, he enjoys eternal happiness.
# All pleasures born of contact are only sources of sorrow; they have a beginning and an end, O son of Kunti. The enlightened man does not rejoice in them.
# He who is able, even here, before liberation from the body, to resist the excitement born of desire and anger, is united with the Divine. He is a happy man.
# He whose happiness is within, whose contentment is within, whose sight is all within, that yogi, being one with Brahman, attains eternal freedom in divine consciousness.
# The seers, whose sins are destroyed, whose doubts are dispelled, who are self-controlled and take delight in doing good to all creatures, attain eternal freedom in divine consciousness.
# Disciplined men, freed from desire and anger, who have disciplined their thoughts and have realized the Self, find eternal freedom in divine consciousness everywhere.
# Having left external contacts outside; with the vision within the eyebrows; having balanced the ingoing and outgoing breaths that flow through the nostrils,
# The sage, whose senses, mind and intellect are controlled, whose aim is liberation, from whom desire, fear and anger have departed, is indeed for ever free.
# Having known Me as the enjoyer of yagyas and austerities, as the great Lord of all the world, as the friend of all beings, he attains to peace.</text>

# The Blessed Lord said: I proclaimed this imperishable Yoga to Vivaswat, Vivasvat declared it to Manu and Manu told it to Ikshvaku.
# Thus having received it one from another, the royal sages knew it. With the long lapse of time, O scorcher of enemies, this Yoga has been lost to the world.
# This same age-old Yoga, which is indeed the supreme secret, I have today declared to you because you are my devotee and friend.
# Arjuna said: Later was Thy birth and earlier the birth of Vivasvat: how am I to understand this saying that Thou didst proclaim it in the beginning ?
# The Blessed Lord said: Many births have passed for Me and for you also, O Arjuna. I know them all but you know them not, O scorcher of enemies.
# Though I am unborn and of imperishable nature, though Lord of all beings, yet remaining in My own nature I take birth through My own power of creation.
# Whenever dharma is in decay and adharma flourishes, O Bharata, then I create Myself.
# To protect the righteous and destroy the wicked, to establish dharma firmly, I take birth age after age.
# My birth and My activity are divine. He who knows this in very essence, on leaving the body is not reborn. He comes to Me, O Arjuna. 
# Freed from attachment, fear and anger, absorbed in Me, taking refuge in Me, purified by the austerity of wisdom, many have come to My Being.
# As men approach Me, so do I favour them; in all ways, O Partha, men follow My path.
# Those who desire fulfilment of actions here on earth make offerings to the gods, for success born of action comes quickly in the world of men.
# The fourfold order was created by Me according to the division of gunas and actions. Though I am its author, know Me to be the non-doer, immutable.
# Actions do not involve Me, nor have I any longing for the fruit of action. He who truly knows Me thus is not bound by actions.
# Having known this, even the ancient seekers of liberation performed action; therefore, do you perform action as did the ancients in olden days.
# What is action, what inaction? Even the wise are bewildered here. I shall expound to you that action, knowing which you will be freed from evil.
# Action, indeed, should be understood, wrong action should also be understood and inaction should be understood as well. Unfathomable is the course of action.
# He who in action sees inaction and in inaction sees action is wise among men. He is unifed, he has accomplished all action.
# He whose every undertaking is free from desire and the incentive thereof, whose action is burnt up in the fire of knowledge, him the knowers of Reality call wise.
# Having cast off attachment to the fruit of action, ever contented, depending on nothing, even though fully engaged in action he does not act at all.
# Expecting nothing, his heart and mind disciplined, having relinquished all possessions, performing action by the body alone, he incurs no sin.
# Satisfied with whatever comes unasked, beyond the pairs of opposites, free from envy, balanced in success and failure, even acting he is not bound.
# He who is freed from attachment, liberated, whose mind is established in wisdom, who acts for the sake of yagya, his action is entirely dissolved.
# Brahman is the act of offering. Brahman the oblation poured by Brahman into fire that is Brahman. To Brahman alone must he go who is fixed in Brahman through action.
# Some yogis perform yagya merely by worshipping the gods, others by offering the yagya itself into the fire that is Brahman.
# Some offer hearing and other senses in the fires of control; some offer sound and other objects of the senses in the fires of the senses.
# Others offer all the activities of the senses and of the life-breath in the fire of Yoga, which is self-control kindled by enlightenment.
# Some likewise perform yagya by means of material possessions, by austerity and by the practice of Yoga; while other aspirants of rigid vows offer as yagya their scriptual learning and knowledge.
# Others again, who are devoted to breathing exercises, pour the inward into the outward breath and the outward into the inward, having restrained the course of inhalation and exhalation.
# Yet others, restricting their food, offer breaths into breaths. All these indeed are knowers of yagya, and through yagya their sins are cast away.
# Eating the remains of the yagya, which is nectar, they reach the eternal Brahman. This world, O best of Kurus, is not for him who offers no yagya, much less the world hereafter.
# In this way yagyas of many kinds are set forth in the words of the Veda. Know them all as born of action. Thus knowing you will find release.
# Better than the yagya through material means is the yagya of knowledge, O scorcher of enemies. All action without exception, O Partha, culminates in knowledge.
# Know this: through homage, repeated inquiry and service, the men of knowledge who have experienced Reality will teach you knowledge.
# Knowing this, O son of Pandu, you will no more fall into such delusion; for through this you will see all beings in your Self and also in Me.
# Even if you were the most sinful of all sinners, you would cross over all evil by the raft of knowledge alone.
# As a blazing fire turns fuel to ashes, so does the fire of knowledge turn all actions into ashes.
# Truly there is in this world nothing so purifying as knowledge; he who is perfected in Yoga, of himself in time finds this within himself.
# He gains knowledge who is possessed of faith, is active of purpose and has subdued the senses. Having gained knowledge, swiftly he comes to the supreme peace.
# But the man who is without knowledge, without faith and of a doubting nature perishes. For the doubting mind there is neither this world nor another nor any happiness.
# He who has renounced action by virtue of Yoga, O winner of wealth, whose doubts are rent asunder by knowledge, who is possessed of the Self, him actions do not bind.
# Therefore, having cut asunder with the sword of knowledge this doubt of yours born of ignorance and rooted in the heart, resort to Yoga. Stand up, O Bharata!

      <text xml:space="preserve">CHAPTER III


# Arjuna said: If Thou considerest knowledge superior to action, O Janardana, why dost Thou spur me to this terrible deed, O Keshava?
# With these apparently opposed statements Thou dost, as it were, bewilder my intelligence. So, having made Thy decision, tell me the one by which I may reach the highest good.
# The Blessed Lord said: As expounded by Me of old, O blameless one, there are in this world two paths: the Yoga of knowledge for men of contemplation and the Yoga of action for men of action.
# Not by abstaining from action does a man achieve non-action; nor by mere renunciation does he attain to perfection.
# No one, indeed, can exist even for an instant without performing action; for everyone is helplessly driven to activity by the gunas born of Nature.
# He who sits, restraining the organs of action, and dwelling in his mind on the objects of sense, self-deluded, he is said to be a hypocrite.
# But he who, controlling the senses by the mind, without attachment engages the organs of action in the Yoga of action, he excels, O Arjuna.
# Do your allotted duty. Action is indeed superior to inaction. Even the survival of your body would not be possible without action.
# Excepting actions performed for yagya, this world is in bondage to action. For the sake of yagya engage in action free from attachment.
# In the beginning, having created men along with yagya, the Lord of Creation said: By this yagya shall ye prosper and this shall bring forth the fulfilment of desires.
# Through yagya you sustain the gods and those gods will sustain you. By sustaining one another, you will attain the highest good.
# Satisfied by the yagya, the gods will certainly bestow the enjoyments you desire. But he who enjoys their gifts without offering to them is merely a thief.
# The righteous, who eat the remains of the yagya, are freed from all sins. But the unrighteous, who prepare food for themselves alone, truly, they eat sin.
# From food creatures come into being; from rain is produced food; from yagya comes forth rain and yagya is born of action.
# Know action to be born of Brahma (the Veda). Brahma springs from the Imperishable. Therefore the all-pervading Brahma is ever established in yagya.
# He who in this life does not follow the wheel thus set revolving, whose life is sinful, whose contentment lies in the senses, he lives in vain, O Partha.
# But the man whose delight is in the Self alone, who is content in the Self, who rejoices only in the Self, for him there is no action that he need do.
# Neither has he any profit to gain in this life from the actions he has done or from the actions he has not done; nor is there any living creature on whom he need rely for any purpose.
# Therefore, remaining unattached, always do the action worthy of performance. Engaging in action truly unattached, man attains to the Supreme.
# By action alone, indeed, Janaka and others gained perfection. Moreover, even looking to the welfare of the world, you should perform action.
# Whatsoever a great man does, the very same is aIso done by other men. Whatever the standard he sets, the world follows it.
# ln the three worlds there is no action which I need do, O Partha; nor is there for Me anything worth achieving unattained; even so I am engaged in action.
# What if I did not continue unwearyingly in activity, O Partha? Men in every way follow My example.
# If I did not engage in action, these worlds would perish and I would be the cause of confusion and of the destruction of these people.
# As the unwise act out of their attachment to action, O Bharata, so should the wise act, but without any attachment, desiring the welfare of the world.
# Let not the wise man create a division in the minds of the ignorant, who are attached to action. Established in Being, he should direct them to perform all actions, duly engaging in them himself.
# Actions are in every case performed by the gunas of Nature. He whose mind is deluded by the sense of 'I' holds 'l am the doer'.
# But he who knows the truth about the divisions of the gunas and their actions, O mighty-armed, knowing that it is the gunas which act upon the gunas, remains unattached.
# Those deluded by the gunas of Nature are attached to the actions of the gunas. Let not him who knows the whole disturb the ignorant who know only the part.
# Surrendering all actions to Me by maintaining your consciousness in the Self, freed from longing and the sense of 'mine', fight, delivered from the fever (of delusion).
# Those men who are possessed of faith, who do not find fault and always follow this teaching of Mine, they too are liberated from action.
# But those who find fault and do not follow My teaching: know them to be deluded about all knowledge, doomed and senseless.
# Creatures follow their own nature. Even the enlightened man acts according to his own nature. What can restraint accomplish?
# The attachment and aversion of each sense are located in the object of that sense; let no man come under their sway, for both indeed are enemies besetting his path.
# Because one can perform it, one's own dharma (though) lesser in merit, is better than the dharma of another. Better is death in one's own dharma: the dharma of another brings danger.
# Arjuna said: What is it that impels a man to commit sin, even involuntarily, as if driven by force, O Varshneya?
# The Blessed Lord said: It is desire, it is anger, born of rajo-guna, all-consuming and most evil. Know this to be the enemy here on earth.
# As fire is covered by smoke, as a mirror by dust, as an embryo is covered by the amnion, so is This covered by that.
# Wisdom is veiled by this insatiable flame of desire which is the constant enemy of the wise, O son of Kunti.
# The senses, the mind and the intellect are said to be its seat. Overshadowing wisdom by means of these, it deludes the dweller in the body.
# Therefore, having first organized the senses, O best of Bharatas, shake off this evil, the destroyer of knowledge and realization.
# The senses, they say, are subtle; more subtle than the senses is mind; yet finer than mind is intellect; that which is beyond even the intellect is he.
# Thus, having known him who is beyond the intellect, having stilled the self by the Self, O mighty-armed, slay the enemy in the form of desire, difficult to subdue.</text>

&lt;th&gt;CHAPTER II&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;CHƯƠNG II&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
# Sanjaya said: To him thus overcome by compassion, full of sorrow, his eyes distressed and filled with tears, Madhusudana (Lord Krishna) spoke these words:
# The Blessed Lord said: Whence has this blemish, alien to honourable men, causing disgrace and opposed to heaven, come upon you, Arjuna, at this untimely hour?
# Partha! Yield not to unmanliness. It is unworthy of you. Shake off this paltry faintheartedness. Stand up, O scorcher of enemies!
# Arjuna said: How shall I fight Bhishma and Drona with arrows on the battlefield, O Madhusudana? Worthy of reverence are they, O slayer of enemies!
# It is surely better to live even on alms in this world than to slay these noble-minded masters; for though they are desirous of gain, having killed them I should enjoy only blood-stained pleasures in this world.
# We do not know which is better for us: that we should conquer them or they should conquer us. The sons of Dhritarashta stand face to face with us. If we killed them we should not wish to live.
# My nature smitten with the taint of weakness, confused in mind about dharma, I pray Thee, tell me decisively what is good for me. I am Thy disciple; teach me for I have taken refuge in Thee.
# Indeed I do not see what could dispel the grief that dries up my senses, though I should obtain an unrivalled and prosperous kingdom on earth and even lordship of the gods.
# Sanjaya said: Gudakesha, oppressor of the foe, having spoken thus to Hrishikesha, said to Govinda (Lord Krishna): 'I will not fight' and fell silent.
# To him, O Bhavata (Dhritarashtra), sorrowing in the midst of the two armies, Hrishikesha smilingly spoke these words:
# The Blessed Lord said: You grieve for those for whom there should be no grief, yet speak as do the wise. Wise men grieve neither for the dead nor for the living.
# There never was a time when I was not, nor you, nor these rulers of men. Nor will there ever be a time when all of us shall cease to be.
# As the dweller in this body passes into childhood, youth and age, so also does he pass into another body. This does not bewilder the wise.
# Contacts (of the senses) with their objects, O son of Kunti, give rise to (the experience of) cold and heat, pleasure and pain. Transient, they come and go. Bear them patiently, O Bharata!
# That man indeed whom these (contacts) do not disturb, who is even-minded in pleasure and pain, steadfast, he is fit for immortality, O best of men!
# The unreal has no being; the real never ceases to be. The final truth about them both has thus been perceived by the seers of ultimate Reality.
# Know That to be indeed indestructible by which all this is pervaded. None can work the destruction of this immutable Being.
# These bodies are known to have an end; the dweller in the body is eternal, imperishable, infinite. Therefore, O Bharata, fight!
# He who understands him to be the slayer, and he who takes him to be the slain, both fail to perceive the truth. He neither slays nor is slain.
# He is never born, nor does he ever die; nor once having been, does he cease to be. Unborn, eternal, everlasting, ancient, he is not slain when the body is slain.
# One who knows him to be indestructible, everlasting, unborn, undying, how can that man, O Partha, slay or cause anyone to slay ?
# As a man casting off worn-out garments takes other new ones, so the dweller in the body casting off worn-out bodies takes others that are new.
# Weapons cannot cleave him, nor fire burn him; water cannot wet him, nor wind dry him away.
# He is uncleavable; he cannot be burned; he cannot be wetted, nor yet can he be dried. He is eternal, all-pervading, stable, immovable, ever the same.
# He is declared to be unmanifest, unthinkable, unchangeable; therefore knowing him as such you should not grieve.
# Even if you think of him as constantly taking birth and constantly dying, even then, O mighty-armed, you should not grieve like this.
# Certain indeed is death for the born and certain is birth for the dead; therefore over the inevitable you should not grieve.
# Creatures are unmanifest in the beginning, manifest in the middle state and unmanifest again at the end, Oh Bharata! What grief is there in this?
# One sees him as a wonder, another likewise speaks of him as a wonder, and as a wonder another hears of him. Yet even on (seeing, speaking and hearing) some do not understand him.
# He who dwells in the body of everyone is eternal and invulnerable, O Bharata; therefore you should not grieve for any creature whatsoever.
# Even if you consider your own dharma you should not waver, for there is nothing better for a kshatriya than a battle in accord with dharma.
# Happy are the kshatriyas, O Partha, who find, unsought, such a battle - an open door to heaven.
# Now, if you do not engage in this battle, which is in accord with dharma, then casting away your own dharma and good fame, you will incur sin.
# Moreover men will ever tell of your disgrace, and to a man of honour ill fame is worse than death.
# The great warriors will think you fled from battle out of fear, and they who held you in esteem will belittle you.
# Your enemies will speak many ill words of you and will deride your strength. What greater pain than this!
# Slain, you will reach heaven; victorious, you will enjoy the earth. Therefore, O son of Kunti, stand up, resolved to fight!
# Having gained equanimity in pleasure and pain, in gain and loss, in victory and defeat, then come out to fight. Thus you will not incur sin.
# This which has been set before you is understanding in terms of Sankhya; hear it now in terms of Yoga. Your intellect established through it, O Partha, you will cast away the binding influence of action.
# In this (Yoga) no effort is lost and no obstacle exists. Even a little of this dharma delivers from great fear.
# In this Yoga, O joy of the Kurus, the resolute intellect is one-pointed, but many-branched and endlessly diverse are the intellects of the irresolute.
# The undiscerning who are engrossed in the letter of the Veda, O Partha, and declare that there is nothing else, speak flowery words.
# Filled with desires, with heaven as their goal, (their words) proclaim birth as the reward of action and prescribe many special rites for the attainment of enjoyment and power.
# The resolute state of intellect does not arise in the mind of those who are deeply attached to enjoyment and power and whose thought is captivated by those (flowery words).
# The Vedas' concern is with the three gunas. Be without the three gunas, O Arjuna, freed from duality, ever firm in purity, independent of possessions, possessed of the Self.
# To the enlightened brahmin all the Vedas are of no more use then is a small well in a place flooded with water on every side.
# You have control over action alone, never over its fruits. Live not for the fruits of action, nor attach yourself to inaction.
# Established in Yoga, O winner of wealth, perform actions having abandoned attachment and having become balanced in success and failure, for balance of mind is called Yoga.
# Far away, indeed, from the balanced intellect is the action devoid of greatness, O winner of wealth. Take refuge in the intellect. Pitiful are those who live for the fruits (of action).
# He whose intellect is united (with the Self) casts off both good and evil even here. Therefore, devote yourself to Yoga. Yoga is skill in action.
# The wise, their intellect truly united with the Self, having renounced the fruits born of their actions and being liberated from the bonds of birth, arrive at a state devoid of suffering.
# When your intellect crosses the mire of delusion, then will you gain indifference to what has been heard and what is yet to be heard.
# When your intellect, bewildered by Vedic texts, shall stand unshaken, steadfast in the Self, then will you attain to Yoga.
# Arjuna said: What are the signs of a man whose intellect is steady, who is absorbed in the Self, O Keshava? How does the man of steady intellect speak, how does he sit, how does he walk?
# The Blessed Lord said: When a man completely casts off all desires that have gone (deep) into the mind, O Partha, when he is satisfied in the Self through the Self alone, then is he said to be of steady intellect.
# He whose mind is unshaken in the midst of sorrows, who amongst pleasures is free from longing, from whom attachment, fear and anger have departed, he is said to be a sage of steady intellect.
# He who has no undue fondness towards anything, who neither exults nor recoils on gaining what is good or bad, his intellect is established.
# And when such a man withdraws his senses from their objects, as a tortoise draws in its limbs from all sides, his intellect is established.
# The objects of sense turn away from him who does not feed upon them, but the taste for them persists. On seeing the Supreme even this taste ceases.
# The turbulent senses, O son of Kunti, forcibly carry away the mind even of a discerning man who endeavours (to control them).
# Having brought them all under control, let him sit united, looking to Me as Supreme; for his intellect is established whose senses are subdued.
# Pondering on objects of the senses, a man develops attachment for them; from attachment springs up desire, and desire gives rise to anger.
# From anger arises delusion; from delusion unsteadiness of memory; from unsteadiness of memory destruction of intellect; through the destruction of the intellect he perishes.
# But he who is self-disciplined, who moves among the objects of the senses with the senses freed from attachment and aversion and under his own control, he attains to 'grace'.
# In 'grace' is born an end to all his sorrows. Indeed the intellect of the man of exalted consciousness soon becomes firmly established.
# He who is not established has no intellect, nor has he any steady thought. The man without steady thought has no peace; for one without peace how can there be happiness?
# When a man's mind is governed by any of the wandering senses, his intellect is carried away by it as a ship by the wind on water.
# Therefore he whose senses are all withdrawn from their objects, O mighty-armed, his intellect is established.
# That which is night for all beings, therein the self-controlled is awake. That wherein beings are awake is night for the sage who sees.
# He whom all desires enter as waters enter the ever-full and unmoved sea attains peace, and not he who cherishes desires.
# When a man acts without longing, having relinquished all desires, free from the sense of 'I' and 'mine', he attains to peace.
# This is the state of Brahman, O Partha. Having attained it, a man is not deluded. Established in that, even at the last moment, he attains eternal freedom in divine consciousness.&lt;/td&gt;

# Sanjaya nói:&lt;/font&gt; To him thus overcome by compassion, full of sorrow, his eyes distressed and filled with tears, &lt;font color=blue&gt;Madhusudana (Đấng Krishna) nói những lời này:
# Đấng ThiêngLiêng nói:&lt;/font&gt; Whence has this blemish, alien to honourable men, causing disgrace and opposed to heaven, come upon you, Arjuna, at this untimely hour?
# Partha! Yield not to unmanliness. It is unworthy of you. Shake off this paltry faintheartedness. Stand up, O scorcher of enemies!
# Arjuna said: How shall I fight Bhishma and Drona with arrows on the battlefield, O Madhusudana? Worthy of reverence are they, O slayer of enemies!
# It is surely better to live even on alms in this world than to slay these noble-minded masters; for though they are desirous of gain, having killed them I should enjoy only blood-stained pleasures in this world.
# We do not know which is better for us: that we should conquer them or they should conquer us. The sons of Dhritarashta stand face to face with us. If we killed them we should not wish to live.
# My nature smitten with the taint of weakness, confused in mind about dharma, I pray Thee, tell me decisively what is good for me. I am Thy disciple; teach me for I have taken refuge in Thee.
# Indeed I do not see what could dispel the grief that dries up my senses, though I should obtain an unrivalled and prosperous kingdom on earth and even lordship of the gods.&lt;font color=blue&gt;
# Sanjaya nói:&lt;/font&gt; Gudakesha, oppressor of the foe, having spoken thus to Hrishikesha, said to Govinda (&lt;font color=blue&gt;Đấng Krishna&lt;/font&gt;): 'I will not fight' and fell silent.
# To him, O Bhavata (Dhritarashtra), sorrowing in the midst of the two armies, &lt;font color=blue&gt;Hrishikesha mỉmcười nói những lời này:
# Đấng ThiêngLiêng nói: Ngươi tiếcthương cho những ai không nên thươngtiếc, vậy mà nói như là thôngthái lắm. Những người minhtriết không có tiếcthương cho người sống mà cũng khôngcho kẻ chết.
# Không baogiờ mà ta không có ở đây, ngươi cũngvậy, và các quânquan vuachúa này cũngvậy. Cũng như không có baogiờ tấtcả mọingười chúngta sẽ hết cómặt ở đây.&lt;/font&gt;
# As the dweller in this body passes into childhood, youth and age, so also does he pass into another body. This does not bewilder the wise.
# Contacts (of the senses) with their objects, O son of Kunti, give rise to (the experience of) cold and heat, pleasure and pain. Transient, they come and go. Bear them patiently, O Bharata!
# That man indeed whom these (contacts) do not disturb, who is even-minded in pleasure and pain, steadfast, he is fit for immortality, O best of men!
# The unreal has no being; the real never ceases to be. The final truth about them both has thus been perceived by the seers of ultimate Reality.
# Know That to be indeed indestructible by which all this is pervaded. None can work the destruction of this immutable Being.
# These bodies are known to have an end; the dweller in the body is eternal, imperishable, infinite. Therefore, O Bharata, fight!
# He who understands him to be the slayer, and he who takes him to be the slain, both fail to perceive the truth. He neither slays nor is slain.
# He is never born, nor does he ever die; nor once having been, does he cease to be. Unborn, eternal, everlasting, ancient, he is not slain when the body is slain.
