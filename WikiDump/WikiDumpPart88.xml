      <text xml:space="preserve">==What is PsycholARTSical? ==


This wikibook is an ongoing collaboration between students at the University of Toronto’s Teacher’s College, '''OISE''' (The Ontario Institute for Studies of Education). [http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/oise]

At OISE, teacher candidates are divided into groupings called cohorts.  Each cohort is defined by an area of focus interest.  The students working on this wikibook belong to &lt;u&gt;SP8: The Arts&lt;/u&gt; cohort.

One of the core classes at OISE is '''“Pychological Foundations of Learning and Development.”''' 
This course examines key principles of psychology which educators may utilize to teach more effectively.

Our course instructor, Michel Ferrari, encouraged us to use WikiBooks as a venue to discuss the theoretical principles outlined in our core textbook, &lt;u&gt;Educational Psychology (3rd Canadian Edition)&lt;/u&gt;, and to associate our new knowledge with our classroom experiences.

The title of this wikibook reflects our cohort's dual interest in Psychology and the Arts.  Several names for this project were suggested and put to vote; The most popular choices were “PsycholARTSical” and “Psyched About The Arts”. Ultimately, a compromise was made, and we opted to use the second title as a sub-heading.  

To quote the philosophy of an erudite band of soldiers, “Now you know, ''and knowing is half the battle''.” [http://www.joeheadquarters.com/joeendings.shtml]

==General Information &amp; Organizational Issues==
Welcome everyone to PsycholARTSical. 

This section will help ease your Wikibook experience by explaining how WikiBook will be used in the context of our class.

=== Posting to our WikiBook===

'''What content do I post? and where?'''

Consider our Wikibook to read as a book of dialogues that respond to the chapter read.
The book will engage with concepts and theories from the readings with supporting evidence from our experiences. 


'''What differentiates the Wikibook and the [[Talk:PsycholARTSical: Psyched about the arts|Discussion]]?'''

*Wikibook is where our weekly responses go:
:Everyone should respond to one or more concepts in the chapter read that week.  If you have your own practicum experience ''which proves a fact or theory'' mentioned in the course textbook, feel free to include it here.  Be sure to include page number citations to the textbook (or other sources) when appropriate.

*Discussion is where the editorial comments go: 
:If you feel that changes need to be made to a particular section (e.g. I think this section is getting repettitve . . . or, I'm not sure everything in this section is is relevant . . . or, I really think this paragraph would work well in this other section . . .), post it here.  

Post your signature after each posting to the Wikibook and the discussion board.

Remember the total is 300 words per week for your responses.

=== &lt;u&gt;'''How to Format Your Responses'''&lt;/u&gt; ===

Posting responses under each sub-heading will keep it organized for our editors.

If you wish to start a sub-heading, simply enter 3 equals signs, your title, then 3 more equals signs.

Try to include your response in an appropriate section.


'''Formatting''': 

*When you create an opinion posting, please position an asterix (*) at the start of your entry.
:This will create a marker that will help differentiate your post from the next person's.

:Use a colon (:) at the beginning of each successive paragraph, to indent your text, and keep things alligned within your posting.


::::(SIDEBAR) If you want to include a &quot;sidebar&quot; to someone else's comment, use multiple colons to indent your response.
::::--FakeSignature123


:Similarly, if you want to use bullets to create a list, indent it.
::::* Here is a fine example
::::* Of a list

:At the end of your posting, include your signature.  It is easier to find signatures if they are all formatted similarly.
:Your signature should be positioned on a new line, and preceded by a colon.
:--[[User:Mjcaskenette|Mjcaskenette]] ([[User talk:Mjcaskenette|talk]]) 19:59, 23 January 2008 (UTC)


* If everything is indented this way, it will be alot easier to differentiate one posting from another, and keep things from looking like one huge mass of text.
:In addition, we should try to leave a couple of lines between each person's contribution.

=== &lt;u&gt;'''Role of the Editors'''&lt;/u&gt; ===


The editors are the group of people chosen each week to review all of the changes that have occurred that week.

Editors also monitor for spelling, grammar and content errors, fixing information where necessary. 

Editors do not need to edit the discussion material, only the Wikibook. 

They do need to summarize both in the weekly presentation.

There is an &quot;Ask the Editors&quot; section on the discussion board.

== Assignment guidelines ==

There has been concern expressed by some in the class that more structure is needed to guide work on your assignments.

First let me assure you all that I have been following comments and decisions about how to structure the Wiki-Book very closely and am completely satisfied with how it is developing; on its present course it will generate a good group mark for the class.  

This is certainly a matter of a teaching style that may not satisfy everyone, but my aim is to provide only the minimum guidance needed to allow you to develop the project to your joint satisfaction.  Perhaps I have not made a point of emphasizing this, but all of my comments each week about the report on the status of the Wiki-Book are my feedback to class on my assessment of the state of the project.

In Week 2 (first report) I expressed concern that the book was only a summary of the Woolfolk chapter and that many of the best ideas were taking place in the discussion.  This was the consensus of the class yesterday (Week 3) and a decision was made to integrate ideas and examples into the book, keeping a dialogic format that has been very successful in the discussion page, with the discussion page reserved for editorial comments or questions that step outside the issues relating to the book.  I think this is an excellent decision and addresses the concerns I raised in Week 2, to the extent that your discussion also specifically refers to the key ideas for each identified section of the chapter.

With this as a general frame, let me specify more clearly what I expect of the project overall, and from each individual contributor to it.
[Reactions and discussion of any aspects what follows that you would like to discuss generally, please post to the discussion page.  If you would like to speak to me privately about something, either email me your comments, or speak to me after class.]

*  The Wiki-Book has 2 parts:


'''*  Part 1: Discussion of the key theoretical ideas in Woolfolk et al chapter under discussion for that week, as illustrated by examples from your own experience in schools in Ontario. (c. 300 words)'''

Criteria for evaluating contributions:

*  '''Breadth''': An entry that addresses a very narrow issue (e.g., “I disagree with the notion of ‘seductive details’ raised on page xx of Chapter 10” will receive a poor mark for breadth [5/10]). Those that address a general theme in the chapter (e.g., “The entire chapter on motivation seems to favor task-mastery approaches, but I think it is important to introduce students to competition and the need to meet externally set criteria for quality performance.” will receive top marks for this criteria [10/10]).  A good mark will be given to comments that address topics in a text section in a targeted way, “The issue of intrinsic vs. extrinsic motivation is an important one for teachers to consider when designing assignments and assessments for their students. For example, I let students write their own exam questions and that motivated them to really determine what mattered most in the lesson.” [8/10].


*  '''Depth.'''  Depth refers to the depth of consideration and scholarship that is reflected in an entry.  This may include adding additional information or additional details about ideas discussed in the text. (e.g., “Carol Dweck’s [2000] Mindsets has a great chapter to use in you classroom describing these functions of the brain.” [10/10]).  Depth will also be accorded for a careful critique of the ideas in the Woolfolk and colleagues book itself either by considering what is said within a chapter or across chapters, or in light of your own classroom experience—if that experience is relevant.  (Many of the examples here of Breadth and Integration would also have received a very good mark for depth 8/10]).


*  '''Integration.'''  Integration refers to efforts to unite across ideas presented separately in the text either within chapters (e.g., Perceived self-efficacy in students with an identified learning disability may be a product of learned helplessness) or across chapters (e.g., “Classroom management techniques that suggest rewarding students for good behavior use Skinnerian principles of operant conditioning, but they depart from his ideas in recommending that those who disobey be punished.” [10/10]) as opposed to comments that stand alone, but integrate practical experience with one idea in the text (e.g., “In my practicum, I used a token economy and it was a disaster, because kids didn’t like using tokens.” [8/10].  A low mark for integration will be given to entries that involve stand alone comments that to not relate the text to experience or to other text. (“According to Bandura, children learn not just by reinforcement or praise, but also by observing others who they identify with.” [4/10, for integration, ]


*  '''Effort.'''  Putting anything at all into the Wiki-book, or simply editing your own previous entries to improve spelling or grammar, or moving them to integrate them better into the existing text. [10/10 for and 300 words or the equivalent]


Each of these aspects will be assessed independently for 10% of the total of 40 %.  

For Individual Contributions, these criteria will be applied to all contributions before and after the practicum, marks will be calculated across all entries as a set, excluding 1 week in each set (your weakest week). In other words, ''you need not demonstrate breadth, depth, and integration in each and every entry, but at some point in each set you need to show them''.  Marks will be based on your strongest examples of each category for that set.

For the Group Mark, all 4 criteria will be applied to the project as a whole.  An Interim mark will be given right before the practicum to show my assessment of the state of the project.  The final mark will be given one week after the last day of class.

NOTE: Contributions that enhance the overall breadth, depth or coherence of the Wiki-book will also receive high marks: For example,  editorial contributions that help integrate or coordinate the weekly contributions of others [integration] or that combine or sequence far flung entries on the same theme (perhaps by adding a summary of main ideas that apply to several stories, or to a thread of discussion in a chapter section to allow greater depth of coverage [depth], will also be considered critical both to your individual scores, and to the book as a whole.

NOTE: Summaries of the key points of the chapter are still worthwhile and can also be an important contribution, especially if they help introduce or interpret or link stories or experiences from that section that are presented and discussed; such summaries can also show depth, breadth and integration.


*  '''Part 2 of the Wiki-Book (based on Class Presentations).'''

The purpose of Part 2 is to integrate information from all relevant chapters in the Wookfolk book that we address in the course (and summarized and discussed in Part 1 of the book, above) and show their relevance to a specific teacher resource you have selected as interesting and important for teachers interested in your theme. 

(If you have difficulty finding something, or questions about whether a particular resource is suitable, please contact me.)

Groups:

'''1. Personal Development: Classroom Community + Character Development''' - Feb. 7

So: working in groups you have established, select a representative program that addresses your area that you think would be a good resource for teachers. 
Prepare a Wiki-book (Part 2) contribution (3000-6000 words; figures and references can be extra).  The most successful contribution will describe the following:

:*  '''1. WHAT:''' Describe the selected resource and the developmental or learning assumptions that underlie it, based on the ideas in the Woolfolk book (500 words) (5%)
:*  '''2. WHY:''' Discuss the developmental or learning theories on which it is based. Specify why you picked those theories and whether the document mentions the theories or you inferred that it was based on them, based on the ideas in the Woolfolk chapters (500-1000 words) (5%)
:*  '''3. WHO.''' Indicate the type of child to which it would apply (300 words)
:*  '''4.IMPROVEMENTS:''' Describe how it could be improved based on one or more developmental theories. Provide at least two suggestions for improvement of the program; for each suggestion, specify the developmental or learning theory on which you are basing the suggestion, based on the ideas in the Woolfolk book (1000-2000 words) (5%)
:*  '''5. HOW:''' Develop a lesson plan based on this program. (1000-2000 words), showing how you think teachers could use it to accomplish (5%)

'''NOTE:''' This project should involve no more than:

(a)	Finding a program or resource that you think is good from the OISE Library;
(b)	Reading your Wiki-Book and Woolfolk book and incorporating whatever ideas help you answer 1-5 above.

== Basics ==

=== How do I declare a variable? ===
As a functional language, Clojure discourages the use of variables in the classic sense of a place that holds a mutable value. If it takes more thought initially to construct solutions that don't need variables, please try to expend the effort - it will repay you many times over.
e.g.:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
 int i;
 int sum;
 for (i=1;i&lt;=100;i++,sum+=i);
&lt;/source&gt;

Can be written without variables in Clojure as
&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 (apply + (range 1 100))
&lt;/source&gt;
Clojure does support variables but you should read about them fully before using them to understand their semantics. If you are really stuck and want a quick solution, you can use def:
&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
(def a 5)
(def a 6)
&lt;/source&gt;
But this is not recommended and is only suggested as a workaround until you can more fully explore Clojure.

Clojure also supports variable as a name for an immutable value - meaning you can't change it later. These are created by binding the value to a name, and always have a lexical scope over which the name can be used. Function parameters are one such example, and should be familiar from other languages.

There are a number of clojure constructs that also create temporary bindings (some of them more than once). The simplest is let:
&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 (let [a 5, b 6]    ; Comma is optional and treated as a whitespace
   (+ a b))

 (let [fact100 (factorial 100)]
    (* fact100 fact100))
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Given a list of keys and a list of values how do I create a map? ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 (zipmap [:a :b :c] [1 2 3])
 ;; ⇒ {:c 3, :b 2, :a 1}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== How can I loop through something and produce a result collection of a different size? ===
Suppose I need to process the lines of a text file, and every now and then (based on the line contents)
create an object and add it to a list of results. (e.g. a simple parsing of a text file). For example
maybe every 5 or 6 lines there is a blank line and I use that to create an object based on the previous lines.
Because the number of lines is different I can't use map or anything functional, so it seems.
Is with-local-vars required, or is there some more elegant way?
&lt;hr&gt;
The following code searches through a set of lines and returns matching lines.  The def lines simply gives us a collection to work with.  The for statement iterates through the &quot;lines&quot; and assigns each entry to &quot;line&quot;.  For each line, the :when clause is called.  If that returns true, then the body of the for is executed, in this case, simply return line.  The results are put into a sequence, same as the map function but only containing the matching elements.
&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 (def lines [&quot;aa&quot; &quot;bb&quot; &quot;cc&quot; &quot;dd&quot;])
 (for [line lines :when (= &quot;bb&quot; line)] line)
 ;; ⇒ (&quot;bb&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;
The [http://richhickey.github.com/clojure/clojure.core-api.html#clojure.core/filter filter function] accomplishes a similar thing

&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 (filter #{&quot;bb&quot;} lines)
 ;; ⇒ (&quot;bb&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

=== How to create a Clojure library locally and use it with Leiningen? ===

==== Create a Clojure library ====

With Leiningen, to create a library, foo:

&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
lein new foo
Generating a project called foo based on the 'default' template.
To see other templates (app, lein plugin, etc), try `lein help new`.
&lt;/source&gt;

With the default project.clj:
&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
(defproject foo &quot;0.1.0-SNAPSHOT&quot;
  :description &quot;FIXME: write description&quot;
  :url &quot;http://example.com/FIXME&quot;
  :license {:name &quot;Eclipse Public License&quot;
            :url &quot;http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html&quot;}
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure &quot;1.5.1&quot;]])
&lt;/source&gt;

Note by Leiningen's terminology, &quot;foo&quot; is name of the artifact, &quot;0.1.0-SNAPSHOT&quot; is the version number. 

Go to the root directory of the newly created project, foo. Implement functions. Install the library. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
lein install
Created D:\yushen\dev\foo\target\foo-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
Wrote D:\yushen\dev\foo\pom.xml
Installed jar and pom into local repo.
&lt;/source&gt;

The above worked with Leiningen 2.4.2.

==== Use the library ====

Set up the project, try-foo
&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
lein new try-foo
Generating a project called foo based on the 'default' template.
To see other templates (app, lein plugin, etc), try `lein help new`.
&lt;/source&gt;

Customize the project.clj file, to express dependency to the library foo

&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
(defproject try-foo &quot;0.1.0-SNAPSHOT&quot;
  :description &quot;FIXME: write description&quot;
  :url &quot;http://example.com/FIXME&quot;
  :license {:name &quot;Eclipse Public License&quot;
            :url &quot;http://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-v10.html&quot;}
  :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure &quot;1.5.1&quot;]
                 [foo &quot;0.1.0-SNAPSHOT&quot;]])
&lt;/source&gt;

then open a repl connected to the project, 

&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
(use 'foo.core)

(foo &quot;Hi&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

The library should be ready for use.

== Gotchas ==

=== Why doesn't contains? do what I expect on vectors and lists ===
Sequential lookup is not an important operation. Clojure includes sets 
and maps, and if you are going to be looking things up you should be 
using them. contains? maps to java.util.Set.contains. The fact that 
java.util.Collection also has contains is, IMO, a mistake, as you 
really can't write code to an interface with dramatically varying 
performance characteristics. 
So, lookups in sets and maps take priority and get the best name - 
contains? 
People write naive programs that do linear lookups with contains() in 
other languages, and get correspondingly bad n-squared performance - 
that's not an argument for encouraging that in Clojure. If they get an 
explanation of why it's a bad idea, and how to use sets and maps, 
that's fine.

=== Why are some lazy sequences a little eager? (chunked sequences) ===

You might have noticed something a little unexpected when using side-effects with some lazy sequences:
&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 (first (for [i (range 10)] (prn i)))
 ;; =&gt; 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9
&lt;/source&gt;

See [http://blog.fogus.me/2010/01/22/de-chunkifying-sequences-in-clojure/ De-chunkifying sequences in Clojure]

== Networking ==

=== How do I fetch web pages and make HTTP requests? ===

For the simple case of GETing a document into a string you can simply pass a URL to clojure.contrib.duck-streams/slurp*:

&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
(use 'clojure.contrib.duck-streams)
(slurp*  &quot;http://www.example.org/&quot;)
;; ⇒ &quot;&lt;HTML&gt;\r\n&lt;HEAD&gt;\r\n  &lt;TITLE&gt;Example Web Page&lt;/TITLE&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

For more advanced usage, including other request types like POST you may find the [http://github.com/technomancy/clojure-http-client clojure-http-client] library useful.  Finally you can of course use (.openConnection) on a Java [http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/net/URL.html URL object] directly.

== Java interop ==

=== How can I lookup what methods a Java object contains ===
You can use the clojure-contrib &quot;show&quot;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
(use '[clojure.contrib.repl-utils :only (show)])
(show Object)
;; ⇒
;; ===  public java.lang.Object  ===
;; [ 0] &lt;init&gt; ()
;; [ 1] equals : boolean (Object)
;; [ 2] getClass : Class ()
;; [ 3] hashCode : int ()
;; [ 4] notify : void ()
;; [ 5] notifyAll : void ()
;; [ 6] toString : String ()
;; [ 7] wait : void ()
;; [ 8] wait : void (long)
;; [ 9] wait : void (long,int)
&lt;/source&gt;

Or if you don't want to use &quot;clojure.contrib&quot; then the following should do some of the work:
&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 (map #(.getName %) (.getMethods Object))
 ;; ⇒ (&quot;wait&quot; &quot;wait&quot; &quot;wait&quot; &quot;hashCode&quot; &quot;getClass&quot; &quot;equals&quot; &quot;toString&quot; &quot;notify&quot; &quot;notifyAll&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

=== How can I convert a Java HashMap to a Clojure map? ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;clojure&quot;&gt;
 (doto (new java.util.HashMap) (.put &quot;a&quot; 1) (.put &quot;b&quot; 2))
 ;; ⇒ #&lt;HashMap {b=2, a=1}&gt;
 (def hm (doto (new java.util.HashMap) (.put &quot;a&quot; 1) (.put &quot;b&quot; 2))) 
 hm
 ;; ⇒ #&lt;HashMap {b=2, a=1}&gt;
 (def h (into {} hm))
 h
 ;; ⇒ {&quot;a&quot; 1, &quot;b&quot; 2}
 (h &quot;a&quot;)
 ;; 1
&lt;/source&gt;

== Clojure philosophy ==

=== Is Clojure object-oriented? ===

Clojure is not object-oriented (at least in the traditional sense).  One of the core premises of Clojure is that conflating state and identity in the traditional OO way is a bad idea, particularly in the face of concurrency.  [http://clojure.org/state On state and identity] and Rich Hickey's [http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Are-We-There-Yet-Rich-Hickey Are we there yet?] talk explain some of the thinking behind this.

Also see Stuart Halloway's [http://thinkrelevance.com/blog/2009/08/12/rifle-oriented-programming-with-clojure-2.html Rifle-Oriented Programming] article which explains some of Clojure's answers to the concerns of object-oriented programming.

Of course, just because the language doesn't encourage it doesn't mean it is impossible to write object-oriented code in Clojure -- it may be necessary to some extent to inter-operate with Java code.  However, traditional OO-style programming is non-idiomatic in Clojure and not encouraged.

== Emacs and Clojure ==

=== I've installed paredit.el but it doesn't work for curly braces! {} ===

Make sure you're using paredit [http://mumble.net/~campbell/emacs/paredit-beta.el version 22 (beta)]

=== Where does swank-clojure (SLIME) look for Clojure's jars? ===

When you start it with M-x slime, it will add all jars under check ~/.clojure and ~/.swank-clojure to your classpath.  You will need at least clojure.jar, clojure-contrib.jar and swank-clojure.jar.  You can download pre-built Clojure and Contrib jars from [http://build.clojure.org/releases/ build.clojure.org] and swank-clojure.jar from [http://clojars.org/repo/swank-clojure/swank-clojure/ Clojars].

When you use M-x swank-clojure-project and specify a directory swank-clojure will add the following entries to the classpath:

* src/
* classes/
* lib/*.jar

You will need to manually add the clojure, contrib and swank-clojure jar versions you wish to use to the lib directory or use a dependency fetching tool such as Leiningen or Maven.

=== Slime hangs with the message: Polling &quot;/tmp/slime.####&quot;.. (Abort with `M-x slime-abort-connection'.) ===

You're probably missing swank-clojure.jar.  See the previous question.

== The JVM and Clojure ==

=== What versions of Java are supported? ===

Clojure currently targets Java 5 (and later versions).

=== What versions of Java have been tested? ===

Clojure 1.0 and 1.1 are both routinely used by many people on various versions of:

* Sun's JRE 1.5.0 and 1.6.0
* OpenJDK 1.5.0 and 1.6.0
* IBM J9
It is also known to run on:

* JamVM with Classpath

== Basic definitions ==
Let &lt;math&gt;L/k&lt;/math&gt; be a field extension; i.e., &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is a subfield of a field &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; has a ''k''-algebra structure; in particular, a vector space structure. A ''transcendental element'' is an element that is not integral; in other words, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is ''transcendental'' over &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;k[x]&lt;/math&gt; is (isomorphic to) the polynomial ring in one variable. The situation can be phrased more abstract as follows. Given an element ''x'' in an extension &lt;math&gt;L/k&lt;/math&gt; and an indeterminate &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, we have the exact sequence:
:&lt;math&gt;0 \to \mathfrak p \to k[t] \to k[x] \to 0&lt;/math&gt;
by letting &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto t&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak p&lt;/math&gt; the kernel of that map. Thus, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is transcendental over &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak p = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;k[t]&lt;/math&gt; is a PID, when nonzero, &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak p&lt;/math&gt; is generated by a nonzero polynomial called the ''minimal polynomial'' of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, which must be irreducible since &lt;math&gt;k[x]&lt;/math&gt; is a domain and so &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak p&lt;/math&gt; is prime. (Note that if we replace &lt;math&gt;k[t]&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;k[t, s]&lt;/math&gt;, say, then it is no longer a PID; therefore the kernel is no longer principal. So, in general, if a subset &lt;math&gt;S \subset L&lt;/math&gt; is such that &lt;math&gt;k[S]&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial ring where members of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; are variables, then &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''algebraically independent''; By convention, the empty set is algebraically independent, just as it is linearly independent.) Finally, as a custom, we call an integral field extension an ''algebraic extension''.

When &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; has finite dimension over &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, the extension is called ''finite extension''. Every finite extension is algebraic. Indeed, if &lt;math&gt;x \in L&lt;/math&gt; is transcendental over &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;k[x]&lt;/math&gt; is a &quot;polynomial ring&quot; and therefore is an infinite-dimensional subspace of &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; and ''L'' must be infinite-dimensional as well.

{{Basic algebra/theorem
|theorem=Exercise
|label=
|claim=A complex number is called an algebraic number if it is integral over &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Q}&lt;/math&gt;. The set of all algebraic numbers is countable.}}

A field is called ''algebraically closed'' if it admits no nontrivial algebraic field extension. (A field is always an algebraic extension of itself, a trivial extension.) More concretely, a field is algebraically closed if every root of a polynomial over that field is already in that field. It follows from the Axiom of Choice (actually equivalent to it) that every field is a subfield of some algebraically closed field.

== Separable extensions ==
A field extension &lt;math&gt;L/k&lt;/math&gt; is said to be separable if it is separable as ''k''-algebra; i.e., &lt;math&gt;L \otimes_k F&lt;/math&gt; is reduced for all field extension &lt;math&gt;E/k&lt;/math&gt;. The next theorem assures that this is equivalent to the classical definition.

{{Basic algebra/theorem
|theorem=Theorem
|label=
|claim=A field &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is a separable algebraic over &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; if and only if every irreducible polynomial has distinct roots (i.e., &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and its derivative &lt;math&gt;f'&lt;/math&gt; have no common root.)
|proof=}}

For the remainder of the section, &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; denotes the characteristic exponent of a field; (i.e., &lt;math&gt;p = 1&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{char}(k) = 0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;p = \operatorname{char}(k)&lt;/math&gt; otherwise.) If the injection
:&lt;math&gt;x \mapsto x^p: k \to k&lt;/math&gt;
is actually surjective (therefore, an automorphism), then a field is called ''perfect''. Examples: Fields of characteristic zero and finite fields are perfect. Imperfect fields are therefore rather rare; they appear in algebraic geometry, a topic in later chapters. We let &lt;math&gt;k_p&lt;/math&gt; be the union of &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; adjoined with &lt;math&gt;p^e&lt;/math&gt;-th roots of elements in &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; over all positive integers &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;k_p&lt;/math&gt; is then called the ''perfect closure'' since there is no strictly smaller subfield of &lt;math&gt;k_p&lt;/math&gt; that is perfect.

{{Basic algebra/theorem
|theorem=Proposition
|label=
|claim=A &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-algebra &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is separable if and only if &lt;math&gt;A \otimes_k k_p&lt;/math&gt; is reduced.}}

{{Basic algebra/theorem
|theorem=Proposition
|label=
|claim=The following are equivalent.
* (i) A field is perfect.
* (ii) Every finite extension is separable.
* (iii) Every extension is separable.
|proof=Suppose (ii) is false; it is then necessary that &lt;math&gt;p &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt; and . Finally, if (iii) is false, then there is an extension &lt;math&gt;L/k&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;L \otimes_k k_p&lt;/math&gt; is not reduced. Since &lt;math&gt;k_p&lt;/math&gt; is algebraic over &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; by construction, it has a finite extension &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;L \otimes_k F&lt;/math&gt; is not reduced. This &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt; falsifies (ii).}}

In particular, any extension of a perfect field is perfect.

== Separable extensions ==
Let &lt;math&gt;L/K&lt;/math&gt; be a field extension, and &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; be the characteristic exponent of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; (i.e., &lt;math&gt;p=1&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; has characteristic zero; otherwise, &lt;math&gt;p = \operatorname{char} k&lt;/math&gt;.) &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''separable'' over &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;L \otimes_K K^{p^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt; is a domain. A maximal separable extension &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''separable closure'' and denoted by &lt;math&gt;k_s&lt;/math&gt;.

A field is said to be ''perfect'' if its separable closure is algebraically closed. A field is said to be ''purely inseparable'' if it equals its separable closure. (As the reader would notice, the terminology so far is quite confusing; but it is historical.)

|claim=A field is perfect if and only if either (i) its characteristic is zero or (ii) &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto x^p&lt;/math&gt; is an automorphism of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;
|proof=First suppose &lt;math&gt;p = 0&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; be an irreducible polynomial. If &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f'&lt;/math&gt; have a common root, then, since &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is irreducible, &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; must divide &lt;math&gt;f'&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;f' = 0&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;\deg f' &lt; \deg f&lt;/math&gt;. On the other hand, if &lt;math&gt;f(t) = a_0 + a_1 t + ... + a_n t^n&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;f'(t) = a_1 + 2 a_2 t + ... + n a_n t^{n-1} \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;.
Thus, a field of characteristic is perfect.}}

'''A. Theorem''' ''A ﬁeld extension &lt;math&gt;L/K&lt;/math&gt; is algebraic if and only if it is the direct limit of its ﬁnite subextensions.''

A field extension &lt;math&gt;K/F&lt;/math&gt; is said to be ''Galois'' if
:&lt;math&gt;K^{\operatorname{Aut}(K/F)} = F.&lt;/math&gt;
Here, we used the notation of invariance:
:&lt;math&gt;K^G = \{ x \in K | \sigma(x) = x, \forall \sigma \in G \}&lt;/math&gt;
(In particular, when &lt;math&gt;K/F&lt;/math&gt; is a finite extension, &lt;math&gt;K/F&lt;/math&gt; is a Galois extension if and only if &lt;math&gt;|\operatorname{Aut}(K/F)| = [K : F]&lt;/math&gt;.) When &lt;math&gt;K/F&lt;/math&gt; is Galois, we set &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Gal}(K/F)  = \operatorname{Aut}(K/F)&lt;/math&gt;, and call &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Gal}(K/F)&lt;/math&gt; the ''Galois group'' of &lt;math&gt;K/F&lt;/math&gt;.

'''A. Theorem''' ''A field extension &lt;math&gt;K/F&lt;/math&gt; is Galois if and only if it is normal and separable.''

== Integrally closed domain ==

A domain is said to be ''integrally closed'' if &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; equals the integral closure of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; in the field of fractions.

{{Basic algebra/theorem
|label=
|theorem=Proposition
|claim=GCD domains and valuation domains are integrally closed.
|proof=Suppose &lt;math&gt;r/s&lt;/math&gt; is integral over &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;; i.e.,
:&lt;math&gt;(r/s)^n + a_{n-1}(r/s)^{n-1} + ... + a_1(r/s) + a_0 = 0&lt;/math&gt;.
We may assume &lt;math&gt;(r, s) = 1&lt;/math&gt;. It follows:
:&lt;math&gt;r^n = - a_{n-1} r s + ... + a_1 r s^{n-1} + a_0 s^n&lt;/math&gt;.
and so &lt;math&gt;s | r^n&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;(r^n, s) = 1&lt;/math&gt; by Lemma {{Analysis of Rings and Manifolds/ref|GCD prop}}, we have that &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; is a unit in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, and thus &lt;math&gt;r/s \in A&lt;/math&gt;. The case of valuation domains is very similar.}}

{{Basic algebra/theorem
|label=
|theorem=Proposition
|claim=&quot;integrally closed&quot; is a local property.}}

{{Basic algebra/theorem
|label=
|theorem=Proposition
|claim=Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be a domain. The following are equivalent.
# Every finitely generated submodule of a projective &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;-module is projective.
# Every finitely generated nonzero ideal of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is invertible.
# &lt;math&gt;A_{\mathfrak p}&lt;/math&gt; is a valuation domain for every prime ideal &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak p \triangleleft A&lt;/math&gt;.
# Every overring of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is the intersection of localizations of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;.
# Every overring of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is integrally closed.}}

A domain satisfying any/all of the equivalent conditions in the proposition is called the ''Prüfer domain''. A notherian Prüfer domain is called a ''Dedekind domain''.

{{Basic algebra/theorem
|label=minimal poly coeff
|theorem=Proposition
|claim=Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be an integrally closed domain, and &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; a finite extension of &lt;math&gt;A_{(0)}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;x \in L&lt;/math&gt; is integral over &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; if and only if its minimal polynomial in &lt;math&gt;K[X]&lt;/math&gt; is in &lt;math&gt;A[X]&lt;/math&gt;.}}

A ''Dedekind domain'' is a domain whose proper ideals are products of prime ideals.

'''A. Theorem''' ''Every UFD that is a Dedekind domain is a principal ideal domain.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak p&lt;/math&gt; be a prime ideal. We may assume &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak p&lt;/math&gt; is nonzero; thus, it contains a nonzero element &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. We may assume that &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is irreducible; thus, prime by unique factorization. If &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak p&lt;/math&gt; is prime, then we have &lt;math&gt;(x) = \mathfrak p&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, every prime ideal is principal. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

'''Theorem''' ''Let ''A'' be an integral domain. Then ''A'' is a Dedekind domain if and only if:''
*''(i) A is integrally closed.''
*''(ii) A is noetherian, and''
*''(iii) Every prime ideal is maximal.''

'''A. Theorem''' ''Let ''A'' be a Dedekind domain with fraction field ''K''. Let L be a finite degree field extension of K and denote by S the integral closure of R in L. Then S is itself a Dedekind domain.''

'''A Lemma''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be an integral domain. Then &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a Dedekind domain if and only if every localization of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a discrete valuation ring.''

'''Lemma''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be a noetherian ring. Then every ideal contains a product of nonzero prime ideals.''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be the set of all ideals that do not contain a product of nonzero prime ideals. If the lemma is false, &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is nonempty. Since &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is noetherian, &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; has a maximal element &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{i}&lt;/math&gt;. Note that &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{i}&lt;/math&gt; is not prime; thus, there are &lt;math&gt;a, b&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;ab \in \mathfrak{i}&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;a \not\in \mathfrak{a}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b \not\in \mathfrak{i}&lt;/math&gt;. Now, &lt;math&gt;(\mathfrak i + (a))(\mathfrak i + (b)) \subset \mathfrak{i}&lt;/math&gt;. Since both &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak i + (a)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak i + (b)&lt;/math&gt; are strictly larger than &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak{i}&lt;/math&gt;, which is maximal in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak i + (a)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak i + (b)&lt;/math&gt; are both not in &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and both contain products of prime ideals. Hence, &lt;math&gt;\mathfrak i&lt;/math&gt; contains a product of prime ideals. &lt;math&gt;\square&lt;/math&gt;

A local principal ideal domain is called a ''discrete valuation ring''. A typical example is a localization of a Dedekind domain.

==Introduction==
Halos are a neat effect. Instead of giving a colour/texture to the faces of a mesh, like normal Surface materials do, the Halo material ignores the faces and renders representations of the vertices instead. This can produce all kinds of ethereal, even ghostly, fantasy effects, of objects that look like they’re made out of light rather than ordinary solid matter.

A halo material can also produce a ''flare'' effect. This is the “lens flare” that happens when a physical camera is aimed at a very bright light source; the spillage of light bouncing around inside the optics produces coloured rings and other interesting artifacts on top of the image. This has become such an accepted part of photography that computer graphics programs like Blender, which do not suffer the imperfections of physical lenses, go to a great deal of trouble to offer a realistic flare effect.

This tutorial will show you how to create an image representing a flare effect in a picture of the Sun.

== Setting The Scene ==

Open a new default Blender document. Get rid of the default cube. Insert a new UV Sphere mesh in its place, and set the number of segments and rings to 24 each. Also set Smooth shading. This will be your Sun. Create a new material for it, set the Diffuse colour to a suitable yellow. Under the Shading panel in the material settings, look for the “Emit:” slider and give it a value of 1.0 to make it look bright. Since the Sun emits its own light, you don’t need the separate default light, so get rid of that.

Go to the World properties tab [[File:Blender255WorldContextButton.png]]. In the “World” panel at the top, click on the colour swatch labelled “Horizon” and assign a nice deep blue colour for your sky.

If you do a render now, you should see your bright yellow orb, but without any flare effect.

== Adding The Flare ==

Now add a new Circle mesh; the default 16 vertices should be enough. By default it lies in the X-Y plane, which again is fine. Move it along the Y-axis a little closer to the camera (negative-Y direction), until it lies outside your Sun sphere, but still close to it. Scale its size down by 0.5. (It will probably be invisible when first created, because it is initially inside your Sun sphere, but it will be initially selected, so you can immediately press {{B3D:N2P/Do|GKEY}} {{B3D:N2P/Do|YKEY}} and start moving the mouse without pressing any buttons, and make it appear from inside the Sun). Create a new material for it, and set the type to Halo.

In the Halo panel in the Material settings, increase the size to 3.0—this is the size of the fuzzy image that is rendered around each vertex, and this value is sufficient for them all to run together into a continuous ring. Reduce the Alpha to 0.05 to avoid overpowering the image with the halo effect.

Go further down the halo Material settings, and find the Flare panel. Check the title box to enable this. Set the number of Subflares to, say, 8 (this controls the number of separate halo reflections that will be generated, though you probably won’t be able to distinguish that many). Set the Boost to 10 to make the subhalos brighter than the original parent halo.

The Seed value in the Flare panel controls the particular flare pattern that you see; each number produces a different effect. I chose the value 3 for this example.

'''Where did the circle go?''' Like any object with a halo material, the circle object can be quite hard to see when it’s not selected. If you lose track of it, there are a couple of ways to find it again:
* Select everything with {{B3D:N2P/Do|AKEY}}. Now you can look for the ring of dots and {{B3D:N2P/Do|RMB}} on it to select it exclusively.
* Use the {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|outliner}} window at the upper right. You should see it listed here under its default name of “Circle”; click with {{B3D:N2P/Do|LMB}} to select it, and you should see the ring of dots appear in the 3D view.
If the circle object is still inside the Sun, then wireframe {{B3D:N2P/Do|ZKEY}} or bounding-box view modes may be helpful to find it again.

== The Final Result ==

Now hit {{B3D:N2P/Do|F12}} to render, and you should see something like this (the flare effect may not appear immediately with the rest of the image, give it a few more seconds to appear):

[[File:HaloFlareSunExample.png|800px]]

'''Exercises:''' Try different positions for the circle mesh; move it near to the Sun (even partly in it), far from it, move it around to different sides. How does this affect the flare pattern? Also try changing the size of the circle mesh.

Chinese herbs do not grow in China only. If you find the right climate and soil type, you can grow many of those herbs overseas. For instance, American Ginseng is grown in Wisconsin State.

The raw herbs available in retail have the following natural features:
* Part of a plant: root, leave, seed, flowers, branch, etc.
* Unprocessed except being cut, sliced, and cleansed of dirt.
* Dried because the dried form weighs less and can be stored longer.
* Some herbs can be eaten after boiling because they turn soft.
* Most herbs cannot be eaten for they remain very coarse after boiling.
* Herbs in general don't taste good. Most taste bitter and earthly. Some taste neutral. A few taste even sweet.
* Inexpensive except for a few like Ren Shen 人參, Chuan Bei Mu 川貝母, or Dong Qong Xia Cao 冬虫夏草.


== Herbal tea ==
How do people take the raw herbs? Raw herbs are usually taken orally by extracting the essence out of them. The natural way being practiced since ancient time is to boil and brew the herbal package in water to get a dark brown solution called herb tea that never tastes good. One hour of brewing should be good enough. Then you drink one or two cups a day. Honey or sugar may be added to make it taste less bad. The herbal package can be conveniently modified by changing some ingredients to make it work for you. So an herbal package is really tailor-made for you only.


== Tablet form ==
Raw herbs can be made into tablet forms by companies and sold as herbal formulas. Although convenient to swallow, tablets cannot be tailor-made for you. Like Western drugs, they are mass-produced for everybody in the world with similar health problems. When an herbal tablet you bought does not work for you, you just have to toss it and buy another one. 


== Capsule form ==
Raw herbs can be made into capsules at home. All you need is a tailor-made package of raw herbs. Turn it into fine powder with a powerful grinder, and put the powder into empty gel capsules. When you swallow the capsules, your digestive system has to extract the essence out of the raw herb powder. Whereas if you drink the herb tea, the essence extraction is already done after brewing. The herbal solution will readily be absorbed by your body. Furthermore, the herb tea has a history spanning over two thousand years. How many years of history does the tablet or capsule have besides offering convenience?


== Healing properties ==
* Herbs have natural healing effects on organs, blood, and various unhealthy conditions.
* In contrast to Western pharmaceuticals, which are mainly designed to fix or suppress certain health conditions, herbs have additional enhancing and strengthening values on the body.
* Due to their strengthening and enhancing values, herbs can also be used for preventive measures.
* The herbal effects are natural and mild, with little adverse side effects.
* Each herb has multiple effects on the body, in addition to one major effect.
* Herbs don't work singly because the effects of one herb are too gentle.
* The effects of herbs rely on synergies because of their overlapping multiple effects. Therefore, an herbal package of different herbs put together can deliver a much greater effect than a single herb of equal weight.
* How to create synergy for an herbal package is an essential knowledge and experience that distinguish a good herbalist from a mediocre one.

== Notes ==
 
(1)The terms used here reflect typical TCM usage (as translated literally from individual Chinese characters), and may not reflect their meanings in TCM, namely, meanings that are normative, figurative or metaphorical when read in context. The meanings of these terms are therefore different from that in common English usage. In particular, they are not to be used for purposes of self-diagnosis, much less for self-medication. For example, &quot;Xia Huo&quot; means &quot;To reduce fire&quot;, but &quot;fire&quot; here does not refer to combustion involving oxygen. Even within TCM, there are various meanings of &quot;fire&quot;, and it can refer to &quot;real&quot; or &quot;false&quot; fire. The 3 herbs mentioned above cannot be used to reduce &quot;false fire&quot;, or fires of yin deficiency in the zhang organs.

(2) An example of the non-literal use of transliterated characters is &quot;long gu&quot; which literally means &quot;dragon bones&quot;. This term cannot possible refer to Chinese dragons, since they do not exist. However, one can easily buy &quot;long gu&quot; from any TCM herbal shop. Another term that cannot be taken literally is &quot;di long&quot; which literally means &quot;earth dragon&quot;.

(3) Although the above herbs are common in TCM prescriptions, they cannot be purchased if we refer only to their Latin names. One likely reason is that TCM pharmacists rarely, if ever, use the Latin names of the herbs. The Chinese names, or the transliterated names (pinyin) should be used instead. For example, if we ask for &quot;flos Lonicerae&quot; we will almost certainly get a blank look. However, if we ask for &quot;Jin Yin Hua&quot; or	'''金银花''' we will connect immediately, even though the pharmacist may speak any of the large number of Chinese dialects (such as Cantonese, where the herb is known as &quot;Kum Gen Fa&quot;, or Golden Silver Flower, in Hong Kong). Wherever possible, use the written form (金银花) to avoid miscommunication and/or mis-pronunciation, since there is no dialect form of the written language.

(4) There are a large number of synonyms of the herb names, in both Chinese, English and Latin. This makes it even more essential to use the written form of the Chinese names to ensure accuracy.

(5) Some herbs are prone to adulteration, substitution, or both. For example, Ling Zhi Cao (Cordyceps) can be substituted with an inactive form of the herb. If an extract is first made with water, the herb will be tasteless when dried and re-used/recycled. On the other hand, the genuine Ling Zhi tastes bitter, but few consumers would know the difference, especially if the herb is mixed in a prescription and boiled together with other herbs. The pharmacists themselves may not be aware, as some may trust their suppliers implicitly, and do not conduct regular testing.

(6) Animal-based &quot;herbs&quot; are prone to substitution or adulteration, including Xiong Dan (bear bile / gall bladder) which looks very much like Niu Dan (bovine bile /gall bladder) when the gall bladder is dried, although Niu Dan is far less bitter in taste. Some are simply unavailable because they are banned in many countries. These include tiger parts, such as Hu Gu (tiger bone) which is substituted by bobcat bone, and Chuan San Jia (scales of the pangolin) which has no animal-based substitute. Niu Huang (bovine gallstone) is unavailable in many Western countries and Singapore because of its potential impact on pregnant women, although Niu Huang Pills with about 2% of Niu Huang are available in many Asian countries.</text>

[[Image:Bromine.png|thumb|Bromine's symbol on the Periodic Table]]
{{clear}}
==What does it look, feel, taste, or smell like?==
Bromine is a toxic, reddish-brown liquid at room temperature.

==How was it discovered?==
Bromine was discovered independently by Antoine Balard and Carl Jacob Löwig in 1825 and 1826.  Balard produced it from seaweed ash and Löwig isolated bromine from a mineral water spring near his home.

==Where did its name come from?==
The name &quot;bromine&quot; comes from the word ''brôme'', which derives from the Greek βρωμος (stench.)
&lt;div style=&quot;float:right; border:2px solid #000000; width:250px; margin-left:0.2em; padding:0.4em; background-color:#f0f0ff&quot;&gt;
'''Did You Know?'''
* Bromine is an ingredient in the rare purple dye shellfish, or Tyrian, purple, the cost of which was what made the color purple synonymous with royalty. After fluorine, bromine is the most reactive element.
&lt;/div&gt;

==Where is it found?==
Bromine exists exclusively as bromide salts in the Earth's crust, and as the bromide ion in seawater.

==What are its uses?==
Bromine compounds are used as flame retardants, pesticides, and as additives in leaded gasoline.

==Is it dangerous?==
Yes, it is toxic.  Bromine should not make any contact with skin.  When it contacts skin, bromine produces painful sores.  Inhalation may lead to death.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Once upon a time, a poor man lived in a little house. It was winter time and snow was falling silently. One day after work, the young man was walking home in the snow when he heard a strange groaning noise. Wondering where this sound was coming from, he walked towards it into surrounding fields. What he found was a crane moaning and groaning. It's wing had been pierced by an arrow. The young man felt sad for the bird and pulled the arrow out. The crane now free, flew away and vanished in the sky.

The young man returned home. He was poor and lonely and his life was miserable. Nobody even visited him. But on that night, very late, someone came and knocked at the door. He was wondering who would call on him so late on a snowy evening. When he opened the door, how great was his surprise when he saw that his visitor was a lovely young woman! She was lost and begged him to let her stay the night. She stayed next night too. And the night after.

Finally, the young man asked this nice girl to marry him, and she agreed. They were happy, in spite of being very poor. The neighborhood was also delighted with their happiness. Nevertheless, winter was long and cold and one day it came that there was neither food nor money left to go on living. So the young woman made up her mind to weave a piece of cloth and asked her husband to prepare a loom for her in a room at the back of the house.

Before she started weaving, she said to him, &quot;You shall not come and peep in.&quot; The husband promised that he would not. The young woman then shut herself in the room, and started weaving. The young man waited for one day and a night, and then for two days and two nights. His wife was still weaving and weaving without a break. At the end of the third day the bride wan and exhausted, brought in her work. It was the most gorgeous, wonderful piece of cloth one can dream of. The young man traveled to the nearest town to sell it, and as it was a very precious and rare piece of cloth, he was able to sell it for a great amount of money.

Thanks to this money, they were able to live peacefully for a while. But winter was not yet over and one more time there was no more food or money left over. Therefore the bride decided to weave one more piece of cloth. She warned her husband again not to peep in and started working. Two days and two nights went by, and it was not over yet on. The night of the fourth day the bride appeared, more tired and wan and produced a piece of cloth much more gorgeous and beautiful than the first one. The young man left for the nearest town and sold this magnificent piece of cloth for an amount of money he would have never dreamt of.

His wife made him happy and thanks to the weaving his life was not miserable anymore, but the young man came to wish he had more and more money. Moreover, the neighbors were harassing him with questions about his wife and her weaving. They thought it very queer that she could weave such gorgeous pieces of cloth without even buying a single thread. The young man too was wondering how she managed. Wanting money so much, he asked his wife for another piece of cloth. The bride did not see the point of earning so much money, but finally she reluctantly agreed to weave one more piece of cloth.

&quot;You shall not come and peep in&quot;, she reminded him of his promise and went to work. But the young man grew impatient and inquisitive; he wanted so much to find out what was going on. He forgot about his promise, crept to the little room where his wife was weaving and gently, opened the door a crack. The scene he saw made him gasp. Instead of his wife, a crane was there, tearing out one after the other its feathers and weaving a beautiful piece of cloth out of them. The young man finally understood how his wife could weave such pieces of cloth. But then the bird noticed his peeping in and changed back to its human form.

The bride then told her story to the astonished young man. She was the crane he had once saved from death. She had returned taking the form of a young woman in order to pay him back for his generosity. To weave those pieces of cloth she had bruised her own body. But since the young man failed to keep his promise and now he knew the truth about her, they were not allowed to live together anymore. The young man was deeply sorry that he had failed to keep his promise because of his foolish wish for money, but there was no way to change things and they had to part. The young woman became one more time a crane, and flew away.

      <text xml:space="preserve">AN old bamboo-cutter was going home through the shades of evening. Far away among the stalks of the feathery bamboo he saw a soft light. He went nearer to see what it was, and found it came from within one of the stalks.

He opened the bamboo stalk carefully, and found a tiny baby girl. She was only a few inches tall, but as beautiful as a fairy. Indeed he wondered if she were not really a fairy.

He carried her home and told his wife how he had found her. They were very glad for they had no child, so they loved her as their own. In a few years she had grown to be a young woman. She was as sweet and kind as she was beautiful. A soft light always seemed to follow her.

When the time came to name her they called her The Bamboo Princess, because she was found among the bamboo, and because she was more beautiful than any princess.

People heard of how beautiful she was, and many peeped through the hedge at the edge of the garden in hopes of seeing her. All who saw her thought she was so lovely that they came back for another glimpse.

Among those who came often to the hedge were five princes. Each one thought The Bamboo Princess the most beautiful woman he had ever seen, and each wished her for his wife.

So each of the five wrote to the father of the princess asking to marry her. It so happened that all five letters were brought to the old man at the same time.

The old man did not know which one to choose, nor what to do. He was afraid, too, that if he chose one of the princes, the other four would be angry. But the princess had a plan. &quot;Have them all come here,&quot; she said, &quot;then we can choose better.&quot;

On a certain day the five princes came to the house of the bamboo-cutter. They were very glad to have another chance to see her, and each one thought he would be the one she would marry.The princess did not wish to marry any of them. She wanted stay with her dear father and mother. She wished to take care of them as long as they lived. So she gave each one something to do which was impossible.

The first she asked to go to India and find the great stone bowl of Buddha. The second one was to bring her a branch from the jeweled trees that grew on the floating mountain of Horai.

The third prince asked what he might do to show his love. The princess said that he might bring her a robe made from the skins of the fire rats.

She asked the fourth to bring a jewel from the neck of the sea dragon, and the fifth prince offered to bring her the shell which the swallows keep hidden in their nests.

The princes hurried away, each anxious to be the first to return, and so marry the beautiful Bamboo Princess.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Once upon a time there lived an old man and an old woman. The old man, who had a kind heart, kept a young sparrow, which he tenderly nurtured. But the dame was a cross-grained old thing; and one day, when the sparrow had pecked at some paste with which she was going to starch her linen, she flew into a great rage, and cut the sparrow's tongue and let it loose.

When the old man came home from the hills and found that the bird had flown, he asked what had become of it; so the old woman answered that she had cut its tongue and let it go, because it had stolen her starching-paste. Now the old man, hearing this cruel tale, was sorely grieved, and thought to himself: &quot;Alas! Where can my bird be gone? Poor thing! Poor little tongue-cut sparrow! Where is your home now?&quot; and he wandered far and wide, seeking for his pet, and crying: &quot;Mr. Sparrow! Mr. Sparrow! Where are you living?&quot;

One day, at the foot of a certain mountain, the old man fell in with the lost bird; and when they had congratulated one another on their mutual safety, the sparrow led the old man to his home, and, having introduced him to his wife and chicks, set before him all sorts of dainties, and entertained him hospitably.

&quot;Please partake of our humble fare,&quot; said the sparrow. Poor as it is, you are very welcome.&quot;

&quot;What a polite sparrow!&quot; answered the old man, who remained for a long time as the sparrow's guest, and was daily feasted right royally. At last the old man said that he must take his leave and return home; and the bird, offering him two wicker baskets, begged him to carry them with him as a parting present. One of the baskets was heavy, and the other was light; so the old man, saying that as he was feeble and stricken in years he would only accept the light one, shouldered it, and trudged off home, leaving the sparrow family disconsolate at parting from him.

When the old man got home, the dame grew very angry, and began to scold him saying: &quot;Well, and pray where have you been this many a day? A pretty thing, indeed, to be gadding about at your time of life!&quot;

&quot;Oh!&quot; replied he, &quot;I have been on a visit to the sparrows; and when I came away, they gave me this wicker basket as a parting gift.&quot; Then they opened the basket to see what was inside, and, lo and behold, it was full of gold and silver and precious things. When the old woman, who was as greedy as she was cross, saw all the riches displayed before her, she changed her scolding strain, and could not contain herself for joy.

&quot;I'll go and call upon the sparrows, too,&quot; said she, &quot;and get a pretty present.&quot; So she asked the old man the way to the sparrows' house, and set forth on her journey.

Following his direction, she at last met the tongue-cut sparrow, and exclaimed: &quot;Well met! Well met, Mr. Sparrow! I have been looking forward to the pleasure of seeing you.&quot; So she tried to flatter and cajole the sparrow by soft speeches.

The bird could not but invite the dame to its home; but it took no pains to feast her, and said nothing about a parting gift. She, however, was not to be put off; so she asked for something to carry away with her in remembrance of her visit. The sparrow accordingly produced two baskets, as before, and the greedy old woman, choosing the heavier of the two, carried it off with her. But when she opened the basket to see what was inside, all sorts of hobgoblins and elves sprang out of it, and began to torment her.

But the old man adopted a son, and his family grew rich and prosperous. What a happy old man!

Duplicated code is recognized as bad practice in software for lots of reasons, not least of which is that it requires more work to maintain. If you have the same algorithm operating twice on different pieces of data you can put the algorithm in a function and pass in the data to avoid having to duplicate the code. However, sometimes you find cases where the code itself changes, but two or more places still have significant chunks of duplicated boilerplate code. A typical example might be logging:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def multiply(a, b):
    result = a * b
    log(&quot;multiply has been called&quot;)
    return result

def add(a, b):
    result = a + b
    log(&quot;add has been called&quot;)
    return result
&lt;/source&gt;

In a case like this, it's not obvious how to factor out the duplication. We can follow our earlier pattern of moving the common code to a function, but calling the function with different data is not enough to produce the different behavior we want (add or multiply). Instead, we have to pass a ''function'' to the common function. This involves a function that operates on a function, known as a ''higher-order function''.

Decorator in Python is a syntax sugar for high-level function.

Minimal example of property decorator:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; class Foo(object):
...     @property
...     def bar(self):
...         return 'baz'
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; F = Foo()
&gt;&gt;&gt; print F.bar
baz
&lt;/source&gt;

The above example is really just a syntax sugar for codes like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; class Foo(object):
...     def bar(self):
...         return 'baz'
...     bar = property(bar)
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; F = Foo()
&gt;&gt;&gt; print F.bar
baz
&lt;/source&gt;

Minimal Example of generic decorator:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; def decorator(f):
...     def called(*args, **kargs):
...         print 'A function is called somewhere'
...         return f(*args, **kargs)
...     return called
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; class Foo(object):
...     @decorator
...     def bar(self):
...         return 'baz'
...
&gt;&gt;&gt; F = Foo()
&gt;&gt;&gt; print F.bar()
A function is called somewhere
baz
&lt;/source&gt;

A good use for the decorators is to allow you to refactor your code so that common features can be moved into decorators. Consider for example, that you would like to trace all calls to some functions and print out the values of all the parameters of the functions for each invocation. 
Now you can implement this in a decorator as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#define the Trace class that will be 
#invoked using decorators
class Trace(object):
    def __init__(self, f):
        self.f =f

    def __call__(self, *args, **kwargs):
        print &quot;entering function &quot; + self.f.__name__
        i=0
        for arg in args:
            print &quot;arg {0}: {1}&quot;.format(i, arg)
            i =i+1
            
        return self.f(*args, **kwargs)
&lt;/source&gt;

Then you can use the decorator on any function that you defined by:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;

@Trace
def sum(a, b):
    print &quot;inside sum&quot;
    return a + b

&lt;/source&gt;

On running this code you would see output like
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; sum(3,2)
entering function sum
arg 0: 3
arg 1: 2
inside sum
&lt;/source&gt;

Alternately, instead of creating the decorator as a class, you could have used a function as well. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def Trace(f):
    def my_f(*args, **kwargs):
        print &quot;entering &quot; +  f.__name__
        result= f(*args, **kwargs)
        print &quot;exiting &quot; +  f.__name__
        return result
    my_f.__name = f.__name__
    my_f.__doc__ = f.__doc__
    return my_f

#An example of the trace decorator
@Trace
def sum(a, b):
    print &quot;inside sum&quot;
    return a + b

#if you run this you should see
&gt;&gt;&gt; sum(3,2)
entering sum
inside sum
exiting sum
5
&lt;/source&gt;
Remember it is good practice to return the function or a sensible 
decorated replacement for the function so that decorators can be chained.

Exercises 21 through 25 had low quality examples, lacking essential parts of a program, so I replaced them.

:Thanks for all the work, I will attempt to give some more visibility to the exercise part of the book, I'm thinking in splitting the exercises by sections, rethinking the navigations, I like the ability to hide the responses but don't know if it works on a printed version, probably two front ends will be required) so that all can be &quot;merged&quot; with the theoretical sections, and general print version, enabling the creation of a exercise companion book and reutilizes the now defunct TOC2 page (giving it also an independent print version) is also an idea...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 21:48, 16 December 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Most watches with domed, round crystals (known as plexis in some areas) use a crystal lift to remove and replace the crystal.  Note that some watches use a different attachment method--if the watch has a bezel ring, a lift will not work.  

A crystal lift is a tool that evenly compresses the rim of a plastic crystal to allow it to fit in a watch bezel. 
[[Image:CrystalLift0906.jpg|center|thumb|Crystal Lift]]

To remove a crystal, adjust the knob of the tool so the fingers are slightly larger than the crystal. Make sure the fingers are grasping only the crystal, and not the bezel.  
[[Image:Crystal_lift0898.jpg‎|center|thumb]]
Slowly tighten the screw, while gently pulling the watch case away from the crystal.  First the crystal will become loose.  With another partial turn of the screw, the case will easily snap off the crystal.  Be careful that you control the case so nothing touches the dial or hands when it comes loose.  
[[Image:CrystalLift0901.jpg‎ ‎|center|thumb]]
The crystal will be attached to the lift in the proper position to re-insert.  If you will be replacing the same crystal, you may want to leave it in the lift.  

If you need to remove the crystal from the lift, unscrew the knob.  

To replace a crystal, you will need a jig to properly position the crystal in the lift, with enough of the rim sticking out to fit in the case.  There are different types of jigs. One version has an adjustable slide, you place the crystal in the jig and close the slide, then grasp the crystal with the lift fingers resting on the slide.  This type has multiple concentric steps.  

[[Image:CrystalLift0902.jpg‎ ‎|center|thumb]]  

Find the step that most closely matches the size of the crystal and place it inside. The fingers of the lift will rest on the next step up.  

[[Image:CrystalLift0903.jpg‎ ‎|left|thumb]]
[[Image:CrystalLift0907.jpg‎ ‎|center|thumb]].

Tighten the tool enough so that it securely grasps the crystal. 
 
[[Image:CrystalLift0908.jpg‎ ‎|center|thumb]]

Place on the bezel of the watch, and tighten slowly until it snaps in place.  

[[Image:CrystalLift0909.jpg‎ ‎|center|thumb]]

Once it snaps in place, unscrew the knob until the tool releases.

 |description=Books in this subject area deal with the '''[[w:D (programming language)|D programming language]]''': an object-oriented, imperative, multi-paradigm system programming language originated as a re-engineering of C++, but even though it is predominantly influenced by that language, it is not a variant of it. D has redesigned some C++ features and has been influenced by concepts used in other programming languages, such as Java, C# and Eiffel.

[[Image:Touch switch schematic.jpg‎|frame|Schematic showing active ''high'' and active ''low'' configuration]]

A simple touch switch can be constructed from a momentary SPST (single-pole single-throw) switch.  A wire extension can be added to the switch lever to act as an “antenna”, “feeler”, “whisker”,  etc.

[[Image:limit switch with feeler extension.jpg|200px|frame|A switch, with an ''“antenna”'' extension attached, and wired with a series resistor
]]

The switch can be wired in such a way that when the state of the switch changes, either a “high” (a digital logic 1) is sent to the micro controller or a “low” (digital logic 0) is sent to the micro controller – depending on the application.  The wiring diagram for active high, and active low are shown in figures 1 and 2, respectively.

[[Image:simple whisker switch.jpg|frame|Simple ''whisker'' type switch]]
Another even simpler and cheaper method of touch sensor construction is with 2 pieces of wire.  The first, the ''base'', is L-shaped with a small loop at one end. The second wire, the ''whisker'' is passed through the loop on the end of the ''base'' wire.  Under normal or ''inactive'' conditions, the whisker wire does ''not'' make contact with the loop – thus creating an ''open circuit''.  Only when the whisker wire ''bumps'' into an object, is the circuit complete.  This circuit could be made to be either active-high or active-low using the schematics shown in figures 1 and 2, by simply replacing the switch contacts with the base and whisker wires.

Other types of touch sensors include simple momentary push-button switches.

== Advantages ==

*Binary – interfaces easily with all microcontrollers
*Low cost
*Simple to construct and to connect
*Simple to operate – either the switch ''is active'', or it is ''not''
*Reliable

== Disadvantages ==
*Tactile – object must be “touched” to know it exists
*Low range
*Less accurate for acquiring range data – you only know that there is an object there within the motion range of the switch – not exactly how far it is, or exactly where the sensed object’s XY position is relative to the robots position

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;Kaixo eta ongi etorri!

Hello and Welcome!&lt;/big&gt;


This is the Wikibooks open-source Basque language course. The Basque language is reputed to be one of the trickiest to learn. Unlike the tonal languages of Asia or Africa, or the Caucasian languages with their mammoth numbers of consonants and vowels, Basque is not a difficult language to pronounce. That is, if you speak English (presumably you speak some, if you are using this course), there are few sounds in Basque that will trip you up. Those that are unique to the language, at least compared to its neighbours or to English, are not overly difficult to acquire. That should at least give you a bit of courage in continuing with your study of the language!

So what is it about Basque that makes it so difficult? Well, for starters, Basque is a language isolate. That is, there are no proven relatives of Basque, in the way that Spanish and Italian or English and German or even Gaelic and Pashto are related. This complicates learning new words in Basque. If they are borrowings from Spanish or French (or English), then they are pretty easy to remember; if not, then they can be extremely difficult to learn en masse. Consider, as an example, some of the words related to the kitchen, which is called '''sukaldea''' in Basque: '''aizto''' is a knife; '''sardeska''' is a fork; '''koilara''' is a spoon; and '''labe''' is an oven. Not everything seems positively foreign; those who speak a Romance language will recognize '''baso''' for glass and '''plateru''' for plate. The trick, at first, is to take it slowly. Whereas you might expect to be able to assimilate 800 words or so in the first two or three months of learning Spanish, German or Russian, this is a rather high bar to set for yourself with Basque. Later on, acquiring vocabulary is made easier through a bit of analysis. Basque is called an agglutinative language, meaning it likes to use suffixes, prefixes and infixes, so new words are frequently formed by adding a common tag onto the end or the beginning or in the middle of a simpler word.

Speaking of suffixes, a second point of complication comes from the fact that Basque is synthetic, rather than analytic. In other words, Basque uses case endings to denote relationships between words, much like in the Slavic languages or German. The difference is that Basque has plenty more cases than Greek's puny four or Russian's measly six. Sometimes these are essentially postpositions, sort of like English's prepositions, but added to the end of a word: '''mendira''' to the mountain = ''mendi'' mountain + ''-ra'' to the. Other times, suffixes will denote concepts more difficult to translate directly into English. Unfortunately, the large number of suffixes makes it difficult to construct even simple sentences without tackling the issue head on, but taken slowly they can be learned fairly quickly.

Finally, verbs, which are the truly difficult part of the language. In general, Indo-European languages (i.e. most languages spoken in Europe, except Basque, Finnish, Hungarian, Estonian, Turkish and some small minority languages) change their verbs according to person (I, you, he/she, we, they); tense (present, past, future); and mood (indicative, subjunctive, optative, imperative). Sometimes different forms of conjugations are used if a verb is transitive (it can have a direct object) or intransitive (it can't). Basque does all of these things, and then some. For starters, unlike in Indo-European languages, Basque doesn't just change the end of the verb, it changes the beginning too. It also has a few more moods (ex. the potential) and, finally, Basque has a complex system of denoting subject, direct object and indirect object - all of which are crammed into the verb itself. That's the bad news. The good news is that only about 10 or 12 verbs actually conjugate in Basque - all the others go into one type of participle or another (past, present, future) and leave the conjugating to an auxiliary that is either '''izan''' ''to be'' or '''ukan''' ''to have''. You need to learn all their forms to be able to read a book or an article, but not to have a basic conversation.

Clearly, Basque is not a language to learn for those who want something quick and easy. Basque is a complex idiom, and is beautiful because of its complexity. Study of the language is a great starting part for those interested in just how creative humans can be with respect to language.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Most students are well versed at forming opinions on just about anything that they experience in life.  The skill students lack is the ability to effectively support their opinions.   Although they have no problem reaching the conclusion that the food served in the cafeteria is good, they have a hard time expressing why they like it.  Helping students understand and effectively support their opinions should be one focus for teaching the Evaluation essay.  In addition, the process of evaluation enhances students' ability to determine which scholarly / informational sources are reliable. 


&lt;h2&gt;Objectives&lt;/h2&gt;

1. Students will develop the ability to create and apply objective criteria for use in evaluation.

2. Students will demonstrate the ability to write effective thesis statements.

3. Students will support their thesis statements with textual evidence and information from outside sources.


&lt;h2&gt;Lesson Plans&lt;/h2&gt;

This lesson plan is designed for a 4 credit class that meets twice a week (approximately 1:40 per meeting).  It has also been designed with the belief that the students have already been introduced to writing thesis statements.

The goal of this lesson is two-fold.  First, the students will practice establishing criteria by back-tracking through an evaluation to discover their preconceived criteria for evaluating films.  Second, students will practice supporting their conclusions by using evidence from the film.

Inform the students that they will watch and evaluate the film Plan 9 from Outer Space.  This film is generally considered to be one of the worst films ever made, but the students don’t need to know that.  Simply show the film.

Following the film (there should be 15-20 minutes left of the class) ask the students to indicate by show of hands who thought the film was good, and who thought the film was bad.  Then have them jot down their reasons for reaching their conclusions.  After giving the class a few minutes to write down their ideas have them share, first the people who liked the film (there won’t be many), then those who did not.  Write the reasons the students give on the board, and once there have been a good number of reasons given have the class categorize the reasons.  

Once the list is completed (the end of class should be approaching), instruct the class to a write thesis statement expressing their evaluation of the film.  Then they should outline an essay using the criteria that they feel are most important and the evidence that is appropriate for each criterion.

      <comment>Replacing Mars_Science_Laboratory_mockup_comparison_.jpg with [[File:Mars_Science_Laboratory_mockup_comparison.jpg]] (by [[commons:User:Steinsplitter|Steinsplitter]] because: Robot: Removing space(s) before file extension).</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The definition of hazardous is involving or exposing one to risk.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hazardous &quot;Merriam-Webster: hazardous&quot;].
Retrieved on 2008-12-01.
&lt;/ref&gt;
Some examples of hazardous environments would be nuclear reactors, outside earth’s atmosphere, and even behind enemy lines in war. Robots help humans in many different ways; mostly being able to do task that could be harmful toward the average human being. So in society, robots perform important tasks that your average human being can not perform because of being to dangerous or harmful to their health.

== Mars Pathfinder ==
[[File:Marspathrov.jpg|thumb| Sojourner, the Mars Pathfinder rover]]
[[File:Sojourner side view.gif|thumb| Sojourner, the Mars Pathfinder rover]]
[[File:Sojourner.gif|thumb| Sojourner, the Mars Pathfinder rover]]

[[File:Sojourner on Mars PIA01122.jpg|thumb| Sojourner on Mars]]
[[File:Pathfinder01.jpg|thumb| Sojourner taking an X-ray measurement of Yogi.]]
In space robot have been use as rovers that travel to a distant planets and take data from its surroundings, such as Mars Pathfinder. Using a rover is cheaper than sending humans into space. One of the missions was to “demonstrate a simple, low-cost system, at fixed price for placing a science payload on the surface of Mars at 1/15 the Viking price tag” (jpl.nasa). This is cheaper because going to Mars for humans would require the space shuttle to carry food, oxygen, be able to stand the extreme temperature differences, and especially, be safe enough to carry humans.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www-robotics.jpl.nasa.gov/ California Institute of Technology: Jet Propulsion Laboratory: Robotics Section].
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hubble Telescope ==
Another robot that is in space right now is the Hubble Telescope. The Hubble telescopes purpose is to provide “unprecedented deep and clear views of the Universe, ranging from our own solar system to extremely remote fledgling galaxies forming not long after the Big Bang 13.7 billion years ago” (hubble). This robot takes clear photos of the solar system. This is a great example of hazardous environment because the Hubble has been taking pictures since 1990 and aside of a few repairs, it has lasted a lot longer than was originally expected to last.
[http://www.sc.gov/NR/rdonlyres/93C9CEAE-361E-4F3B-B4C4-CEDD151A6321/2769/FloatingHubble.jpg]

== Pioneer ==
Another application is in nuclear environments such as the aftermath of Chernobyl which a disaster that was cause by a nuclear reactor that released a large amount of radioactivity into the environment followed power explosion which destroyed the reactor. The Pioneer is a robot that was built to withstand the radioactive environment in order to deploy sensors, sampling payloads, map the environment in 3D, and cut and retrieve samples of structural materials. A robot has to be used because of rugged terrain, high radiation, and complete darkness (frc.ri.cmu).
[http://www.frc.ri.cmu.edu/projects/pioneer/pics/PioneerAtUnit4.jpg]

== pipeline inspection ==

A variety of robots and robot-like devices are used to inspect pipelines.
Some of them visually inspect more-or-less empty pipelines or pipelines full of clear water.
Others use &quot;fingers&quot; to mechanically feel the interior shape of the pipeline, sensing interior pitting; or magnetically measure the thickness of the pipeline, indirectly sensing exterior pitting; or use other kinds of sensors while inspecting pipelines full of oil/sewage/etc.
Most pipelines have at least one characteristic making robots more practical than direct human inspection:
too narrow for an adult human to squeeze through, and too long to inspect the entire length from the ends; or
filled with some unpleasant substance, or
filled with some opaque substance,
or some combination.

A common form of locomotion in a pipeline is to passively let the pressure of the product in the pipeline sweep the robot downstream.

Active locomotion is necessary when the pipe is empty or the robot needs to travel upstream.
A robot can move through pipes using peristaltic locomotion,&lt;ref&gt;

wheels,&lt;ref&gt;
Kyle Sherer.
[http://www.gizmag.com/sintefs-pipe-inspection-robot/9549/ &quot;Scientists developing intelligent pipe-inspection robot&quot;]
&lt;/ref&gt;
or a variety of other locomotion techniques.

== Talon Sword ==
Robots are also used in war. From unmanned aerial vehicles or UAV to ground gunned vehicles, they are used because they put the soldiers out of the way of the bullets. The Talon Sword is used as a military ground robot that ranges from reconnaissance to weapons delivery. “The suitcase-portable robot [Talon Sword] is controlled through a two-way RF or F/O line from a portable or wearable Operator Control Unit (OCU) that provides continuous data and video feedback for precise vehicle positioning” (globalsecurity). This makes it easier for the soldier to operate out of range.
[http://xirdal.lmu.de/xirdalium/xpix/talon_swords.png]

== Predator ==
Another robot used in the military is the Predator. The Predator is a UAV that was developed originally in 1996 and main purpose is to be used in armed reconnaissance, airborne surveillance, and target acquisition (af.mil). 
[http://www.defenseindustrydaily.com/images/AIR_UAV_MQ-1_Predator_lg.jpg]

== Conclusion ==
A major reason for robots is the fact that they can go more places than a human can. They are efficient and in most case get the job done that a human can not. And even though a robot that is built to perform in these hazardous environments cost anywhere from a couple hundred thousand to a couple hundred million, no robot cost is worth more than a human’s life.

      <comment>/* Arrange layers */ Upper case</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">To assemble two (or more) images, simply create a new, transparent image of the required size, then open the images you want to add as layers and arrange them as desired.

== Result and example images ==

In this tutorial, we will create an image that look like this:

[[File:GIMP_two_dinosaurs.png]]

We use http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dinosaur_comic_left.png and http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Dinosaur_comic_right.png as sources for the image, so the tutorial will assume that they can be opened by GIMP.

== Creating the canvas ==
[[Image:GIMP_new_image_248_139_2.6.png|thumb|150px|left|The ''New Image'' dialog]]
[[Image:GIMP_empty_image_248_139_2.6.png|thumb|250px|right|This is how your GIMP image window should look like now]]
First, we create an empty image where we can arrange the other images as needed.  For this purpose we use the ''File &gt; New...'' menu entry.  Since the original images are both 124×139 pixels big, we make the new image 248×139 pixels large.  Since we don't want to assume anything about the images' colors, we choose to fill the new image with transparency only.

Your image window should now look more or less as displayed on the right.

== Importing the images ==
To import the images, simply open them as layers (''File &gt; Open as Layers...'').  You should now have the opened images as layers somewhere on the main canvas, possibly hiding under each other.  In any case, the layers dialog should show them all.

Of course you could also add image data with Copy&amp;Paste.  First copy whatever you want and then paste it with ''Edit &gt; Paste As &gt; New Layer''.

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:GIMP open as layers menu 2.6.png|''File &gt; Open as Layers...''
File:GIMP image window dinosaur 2.6.png|Only one dinosaur head is visible, the other one is hidden below.
File:GIMP layers dialog two dinosaurs 2.6.png|All the needed images are shown in the layers dialog.
&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Arrange layers ==

Now the only thing left to do is to arrange the layers as needed.  For this we use the [[GIMP/Move Tool | move tool]] to move them around until they fit nicely. The result should look more or less as the image below:

[[File:GIMP two dinosaurs windows 2.6.png|The two dinosaur heads now look at each other.]]

Finished! Now you just need to save the image.

&amp;#123;&amp;#123;[[{{ #ifeq: {{SUBJECTSPACE}} | {{ns:template}} | {{PAGENAME}} | {{FULLPAGENAME}} }}]]&amp;#125;&amp;#125;&amp;#32;&amp;mdash; makes a userbox for users to provide information about themselves on their user page. This version has {{ #switch: {{lc:{{{layout|l}}}}}
| 2 = two ''ID'' boxes, one on each side of the main ''Info'' area.
| r = an ''Info'' box on the left and a smaller ''ID'' area on the right.
| #default = an ''ID'' box on the left and a larger ''Info'' area on the right. }}

This template was [[{{#ifeq:{{CONTENTLANGUAGE}}.{{ns:project}}|en.Wikipedia||w:}}Fork (software development)|forked]] from the [[{{#ifeq:{{CONTENTLANGUAGE}}.{{ns:project}}|en.Wikipedia||w:}}Template:Userbox|Userbox]] template on the English Wikipedia, which has different usage examples and has changed since. Additionally, this template has been enhanced to be more compatible and functional across multiple wikis. Most userboxes developed for one wiki should continue to work as-is (or with just a few tweaks) on other wikis if this template is used.

One big difference is that this template uses [[m:Help:Parser function|parser functions]] to combine three templates ([[{{ns:user}}:Willscrlt/UBX/Userbox|Userbox]], [[{{ns:user}}:Willscrlt/UBX/Userbox-r|Userbox-r]], and [[{{ns:user}}:Willscrlt/UBX/Userbox-2|Userbox-2]]) into a single template. It does this by adding one additional attribute: &lt;code&gt;'''layout='''&lt;/code&gt;. The possible values are 'l' ''(the default)'' for a userbox with the smaller ID box (usually for logos) on the left (standard Userbox layout), 'r' for the reverse (Userbox-r layout), and '2' for a userbox an ID box on both ends (Userbox-2 layout). If this doesn't make sense, don't worry about it. I've created my own versions of each of these templates, so you can just use them and ignore the &lt;code&gt;layout=&lt;/code&gt; attribute if you prefer.

''This is version '''2.1.0 (Userbox{{#ifeq:{{lc:{{{layout|l}}}}} | l || -{{{layout}}} }})''' of my custom template. The most current version is available from my [[{{#ifeq:{{CONTENTLANGUAGE}}.{{ns:project}}|en.Wikipedia||w:}}{{ns:user}}:Willscrlt/UBX/Userbox{{#ifeq:{{lc:{{{layout|l}}}}} | l || -{{{layout}}} }}|English Wikipedia]] account.''

== Usage ==
===Compact form===
For simple userboxes, the compact form is simple, fast, and easy to understand. The numerical labels shown below ('1=', '2=', etc.) are optional unless your data includes any equal signs ('='). If you do not use labels, you must enter the values in the proper order. All attributes are optional, but you may not skip any attributes prior to the one you want to specify. It is the '''order''' of the attributes that is important when omitting labels, and skipping attributes messes up the order and breaks the template. To avoid all those limitations, simply include the numerical labels or the extended labels from the Extended form below.

This form is convenient, but considered deprecated on many Wiki projects. The standard Userbox template here may not support this form in the future, and the order of the attributes may change.

{{ #switch: {{lc:{{{layout|}}}}}
| 2 = &amp;#32;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{ #ifeq: {{SUBJECTSPACE}} | {{ns:template}} | {{PAGENAME}} | {{FULLPAGENAME}} }}
 {{!}}1= id1 background color ''(defaults to '#DDD', a light gray)''
 {{!}}2= info background color ''(defaults to '#EEE', a lighter gray)''
 {{!}}3= id1 text or image ''(defaults to 'id1')''
 {{!}}4= info text ''(defaults to 'info')''
 {{!}}5= id2 text or image ''(defaults to 'id2')''
 {{!}}6= border color ''(defaults to id1 bg color if set or '#999', med gray)''
 {{!}}7= id2 background color ''(defaults to id1 bg color)''
 &lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
| #default = &amp;#32;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{ #ifeq: {{SUBJECTSPACE}} | {{ns:template}} | {{PAGENAME}} | {{FULLPAGENAME}} }}
 {{!}}1= id background color ''(defaults to '#DDD', a light gray)''
 {{!}}2= info background color ''(defaults to '#EEE', a lighter gray)''
 {{!}}3= id text or image ''(defaults to 'id')''
 {{!}}4= info text ''(defaults to 'info')''
 {{!}}5= id text size in points ''(defaults to '8', 8pts)''
 &lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
}}

===Extended form===
Using the extended form gives you much more control, but you must spell and capitalize the labels exactly as shown. All attributes are optional and may appear in any order. You may mix numerical and extended labels, but extended labels take precedence over numerical ones.

This form uses the labels found on many Wiki projects. The default values may be significantly different from project to project, and not all projects offer all of these attributes.

&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; float:right; margin-left:12pt;&quot;&gt;__TOC__&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:left;&quot; /&gt;

==Purpose==
&amp;#123;&amp;#123;[[{{ #ifeq: {{SUBJECTSPACE}} | {{ns:template}} | {{PAGENAME}} | {{FULLPAGENAME}} }}]]&amp;#125;&amp;#125;&amp;#32;&amp;mdash; makes a userbox for users to provide information about themselves on their user page. This version has {{ #switch: {{lc:{{{layout|l}}}}}
| 2 = two ''ID'' boxes, one on each side of the main ''Info'' area.
| r = an ''Info'' box on the left and a smaller ''ID'' area on the right.
| #default = an ''ID'' box on the left and a larger ''Info'' area on the right. }}

This template was [[{{#ifeq:{{CONTENTLANGUAGE}}.{{ns:project}}|en.Wikipedia||w:}}Fork (software development)|forked]] from the [[{{#ifeq:{{CONTENTLANGUAGE}}.{{ns:project}}|en.Wikipedia||w:}}Template:Userbox|Userbox]] template on the English Wikipedia, which has different usage examples and has changed since. Additionally, this template has been enhanced to be more compatible and functional across multiple wikis. Most userboxes developed for one wiki should continue to work as-is (or with just a few tweaks) on other wikis if this template is used.

One big difference is that this template uses [[m:Help:Parser function|parser functions]] to combine three templates ([[{{ns:user}}:Willscrlt/UBX/Userbox|Userbox]], [[{{ns:user}}:Willscrlt/UBX/Userbox-r|Userbox-r]], and [[{{ns:user}}:Willscrlt/UBX/Userbox-2|Userbox-2]]) into a single template. It does this by adding one additional attribute: &lt;code&gt;'''layout='''&lt;/code&gt;. The possible values are 'l' ''(the default)'' for a userbox with the smaller ID box (usually for logos) on the left (standard Userbox layout), 'r' for the reverse (Userbox-r layout), and '2' for a userbox an ID box on both ends (Userbox-2 layout). If this doesn't make sense, don't worry about it. I've created my own versions of each of these templates, so you can just use them and ignore the &lt;code&gt;layout=&lt;/code&gt; attribute if you prefer.

''This is version '''2.1.0 (Userbox{{#ifeq:{{lc:{{{layout|l}}}}} | l || -{{{layout}}} }})''' of my custom template. The most current version is available from my [[{{#ifeq:{{CONTENTLANGUAGE}}.{{ns:project}}|en.Wikipedia||w:}}{{ns:user}}:Willscrlt/UBX/Userbox{{#ifeq:{{lc:{{{layout|l}}}}} | l || -{{{layout}}} }}|English Wikipedia]] account.''

== Usage ==
===Compact form===
For simple userboxes, the compact form is simple, fast, and easy to understand. The numerical labels shown below ('1=', '2=', etc.) are optional unless your data includes any equal signs ('='). If you do not use labels, you must enter the values in the proper order. All attributes are optional, but you may not skip any attributes prior to the one you want to specify. It is the '''order''' of the attributes that is important when omitting labels, and skipping attributes messes up the order and breaks the template. To avoid all those limitations, simply include the numerical labels or the extended labels from the Extended form below.

This form is convenient, but considered deprecated on many Wiki projects. The standard Userbox template here may not support this form in the future, and the order of the attributes may change.

{{ #switch: {{lc:{{{layout|}}}}}
| 2 = &amp;#32;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{ #ifeq: {{SUBJECTSPACE}} | {{ns:template}} | {{PAGENAME}} | {{FULLPAGENAME}} }}
 {{!}}1= id1 background color ''(defaults to '#DDD', a light gray)''
 {{!}}2= info background color ''(defaults to '#EEE', a lighter gray)''
 {{!}}3= id1 text or image ''(defaults to 'id1')''
 {{!}}4= info text ''(defaults to 'info')''
 {{!}}5= id2 text or image ''(defaults to 'id2')''
 {{!}}6= border color ''(defaults to id1 bg color if set or '#999', med gray)''
 {{!}}7= id2 background color ''(defaults to id1 bg color)''
 &lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
| #default = &amp;#32;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{ #ifeq: {{SUBJECTSPACE}} | {{ns:template}} | {{PAGENAME}} | {{FULLPAGENAME}} }}
 {{!}}1= id background color ''(defaults to '#DDD', a light gray)''
 {{!}}2= info background color ''(defaults to '#EEE', a lighter gray)''
 {{!}}3= id text or image ''(defaults to 'id')''
 {{!}}4= info text ''(defaults to 'info')''
 {{!}}5= id text size in points ''(defaults to '8', 8pts)''
 &lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
}}

===Extended form===
Using the extended form gives you much more control, but you must spell and capitalize the labels exactly as shown. All attributes are optional and may appear in any order. You may mix numerical and extended labels, but extended labels take precedence over numerical ones.

This form uses the labels found on many Wiki projects. The default values may be significantly different from project to project, and not all projects offer all of these attributes.

&lt;div style=&quot;clear:both; float:right; margin-left:12pt;&quot;&gt;__TOC__&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;br style=&quot;clear:left;&quot; /&gt;

==Purpose==
&amp;#123;&amp;#123;[[{{ #ifeq: {{SUBJECTSPACE}} | {{ns:template}} | {{PAGENAME}} | {{FULLPAGENAME}} }}]]&amp;#125;&amp;#125;&amp;#32;&amp;mdash; makes a userbox for users to provide information about themselves on their user page. This version has {{ #switch: {{lc:{{{layout|l}}}}}
| 2 = two ''ID'' boxes, one on each side of the main ''Info'' area.
| r = an ''Info'' box on the left and a smaller ''ID'' area on the right.
| #default = an ''ID'' box on the left and a larger ''Info'' area on the right. }}

This template was [[{{#ifeq:{{CONTENTLANGUAGE}}.{{ns:project}}|en.Wikipedia||w:}}Fork (software development)|forked]] from the [[{{#ifeq:{{CONTENTLANGUAGE}}.{{ns:project}}|en.Wikipedia||w:}}Template:Userbox|Userbox]] template on the English Wikipedia, which has different usage examples and has changed since. Additionally, this template has been enhanced to be more compatible and functional across multiple wikis. Most userboxes developed for one wiki should continue to work as-is (or with just a few tweaks) on other wikis if this template is used.

One big difference is that this template uses [[m:Help:Parser function|parser functions]] to combine three templates ([[{{ns:user}}:Willscrlt/UBX/Userbox|Userbox]], [[{{ns:user}}:Willscrlt/UBX/Userbox-r|Userbox-r]], and [[{{ns:user}}:Willscrlt/UBX/Userbox-2|Userbox-2]]) into a single template. It does this by adding one additional attribute: &lt;code&gt;'''layout='''&lt;/code&gt;. The possible values are 'l' ''(the default)'' for a userbox with the smaller ID box (usually for logos) on the left (standard Userbox layout), 'r' for the reverse (Userbox-r layout), and '2' for a userbox an ID box on both ends (Userbox-2 layout). If this doesn't make sense, don't worry about it. I've created my own versions of each of these templates, so you can just use them and ignore the &lt;code&gt;layout=&lt;/code&gt; attribute if you prefer.

''This is version '''2.1.0 (Userbox{{#ifeq:{{lc:{{{layout|l}}}}} | l || -{{{layout}}} }})''' of my custom template. The most current version is available from my [[{{#ifeq:{{CONTENTLANGUAGE}}.{{ns:project}}|en.Wikipedia||w:}}{{ns:user}}:Willscrlt/UBX/Userbox{{#ifeq:{{lc:{{{layout|l}}}}} | l || -{{{layout}}} }}|English Wikipedia]] account.''

== Usage ==
===Compact form===
For simple userboxes, the compact form is simple, fast, and easy to understand. The numerical labels shown below ('1=', '2=', etc.) are optional unless your data includes any equal signs ('='). If you do not use labels, you must enter the values in the proper order. All attributes are optional, but you may not skip any attributes prior to the one you want to specify. It is the '''order''' of the attributes that is important when omitting labels, and skipping attributes messes up the order and breaks the template. To avoid all those limitations, simply include the numerical labels or the extended labels from the Extended form below.

This form is convenient, but considered deprecated on many Wiki projects. The standard Userbox template here may not support this form in the future, and the order of the attributes may change.

{{ #switch: {{lc:{{{layout|}}}}}
| 2 = &amp;#32;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{ #ifeq: {{SUBJECTSPACE}} | {{ns:template}} | {{PAGENAME}} | {{FULLPAGENAME}} }}
 {{!}}1= id1 background color ''(defaults to '#DDD', a light gray)''
 {{!}}2= info background color ''(defaults to '#EEE', a lighter gray)''
 {{!}}3= id1 text or image ''(defaults to 'id1')''
 {{!}}4= info text ''(defaults to 'info')''
 {{!}}5= id2 text or image ''(defaults to 'id2')''
 {{!}}6= border color ''(defaults to id1 bg color if set or '#999', med gray)''
 {{!}}7= id2 background color ''(defaults to id1 bg color)''
 &lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
| #default = &amp;#32;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;{{ #ifeq: {{SUBJECTSPACE}} | {{ns:template}} | {{PAGENAME}} | {{FULLPAGENAME}} }}
 {{!}}1= id background color ''(defaults to '#DDD', a light gray)''
 {{!}}2= info background color ''(defaults to '#EEE', a lighter gray)''
 {{!}}3= id text or image ''(defaults to 'id')''
 {{!}}4= info text ''(defaults to 'info')''
 {{!}}5= id text size in points ''(defaults to '8', 8pts)''
 &lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
}}

===Extended form===
Using the extended form gives you much more control, but you must spell and capitalize the labels exactly as shown. All attributes are optional and may appear in any order. You may mix numerical and extended labels, but extended labels take precedence over numerical ones.

This form uses the labels found on many Wiki projects. The default values may be significantly different from project to project, and not all projects offer all of these attributes.

== [[The GIMP]] ==
Hi,

So first welcome to the Wikibooks! Thank you for your edits to the [[The GIMP]] book. I'd just like to tell, you few things about the book, as there's no manual of style currently for it, but it should change soon. As you may noticed in other articles, all pages are categorized into [[:Category:The GIMP]]. To do so add &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:The GIMP]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; at the bottom of the page. Also current images have a general style of naming, like [[:File:The-GIMP_Toolbox.png|here]]. There's no need to write the file dimensions, or version of The GIMP. Also when it comes to licensing, screenshots are not something you own. You should use [[Template:free screenshot|this]] template. For all GIMP screenshots you should use '''GPL''' as the first option. For images that have parts that are your own work, add a second license for that. If image is not your work, but a derived work, use same license as the original author used. Also it is not own work, but derived work. There's no need to tell the date, as it may change in any time. And for the screenshots, there's no need for the description. Also images should be categorized. Always look trough the category, as there may be an image like that already. And the tutorials do not need to have many images. One or two may be enough. So these are some basic tips, I hope it didn't scared you ;-). Happy editing and be [[WB:BOLD|bold]]!.

:Hi, 
:thank you for the nice welcome and your advises.
:Before I move images to new names, maybe the whole book should be renamed, but I'll continue that discussion of the front page's talk page. As for the amount of images in tutorials: The number of &quot;dumb&quot; questions on irc says that there can never be enough images :) especially for beginners' tutorials. 
:--[[User:Rubik-wuerfel|Rubik-wuerfel]] ([[User talk:Rubik-wuerfel|talk]]) 21:28, 17 December 2008 (UTC)

::Well, the book is not going to be renamed. There's too many articles, and a redirect is enough. The images can't be moved so leave them as they are, this doesn't really matter. Just the licensing and other things should be more like in [[:File:GIMP_new_image_248_139_2.6.png|here]], when it comes to screenshots. And well, then I'm not up to date with the current info. But that's probably true, just making a gallery of the images is a bit... too much. So again happy editing!

'''A Chronological Survey''' is ultimately intended to serve as the companion and 
reference volume to a larger work entitled [[Introduction to Stratigraphy and Sedimentation]]. The Survey will explore the environmental conditions that existed 
during each Geologic time period from the Cambrian to the present, and will select 
one or more localities for each time period to examine in detail. We will not cover
the Precambrian at this time, but may add chapters on that later. 

Together, these works are a massive undertaking that will require much time to 
complete. The primary author welcomes contributions from others!

== Business Rule Mining - Best Practices ==

Below is a general approach towards the semantic capture of technical rules and their abstraction into business rules. 

=== Preparatory Steps ===

A series of preparatory help to avoid protracted rules mining exercises, ensure that rules are valuable to the business, and speed the process of creating ‘business’ and not simply ‘technical’ rules. These steps are recommended to build the right organizational framework and to align rule mining with business priorities.


'''1. Project Goals and Desired Output''' 

It is important to define the goals and outputs of the rules mining activity.  This will vary depending on the business priorities of organizations.  For some, the goal may be to address inflexibility or high downtime in a highly valuable and customized application.  This may lead to the decision to move to a SOA-enabled packaged application.  

Depending on the goal there will be two primary outcomes that can be derived from a rules mining activity: 

''Documentation''
In some cases, the goal may be to develop business-centric documentation of program code segments. This documentation, valuable as reference for other analysts and subject matter experts, may also be used to decorate high-level design models for the modernized, to-be applications. It would not normally result in executable business rules or inputs into development environments.

''Business Rules''
In other cases, the exact semantic behavior of edits and calculations in applications needs to be captured as true business rules. The captured semantics will be used as a basis for, and perhaps even directly fed into, target development environments.  The outcome of this step will drive decisions regarding technology adoption, resource planning, and the best methods to apply for either type of rule mining. 


'''2. Rule Mining Technology Selection'''

''Largely Manual Approach''
A low-cost, low-value application of technology for rule mining is the documentation of rules in word processing or spreadsheet applications. This approach will not help address the most resource-intensive portions of rule mining – like analyzing application behavior and locating rules within source code segments.

''Runtime Simulation''
Runtime simulation technologies that facilitate the capture of user behavior into processes and rules can help from a behavioral aspect. Their main drawback is that they are limited to those test scenarios actually performed within a given time frame – potentially missing out on critical exceptions not usually performed. 

''Scanning Tools''
Text scanning tools that locate patterns within sources can accelerate the capture of rules based upon fixed patterns within source code (e.g. showing all moves to a variable). These tools typically generate a large number of false positives and tend to lead to technical rather than business rules.

''Repository-Based Rule Mining Tools''
Repository-based technologies that recompile the sources and build a syntactic parse tree can offer the highest value in rule mining. The most advanced automatically detect rules using semantic analysis, e.g. each statement upstream from a point of interest variable and which potentially impacts its value, is mined as a candidate rule.

Rule mining tools may also offer rule management and auditing capabilities, facilitating project workflow and rule maintenance activities by reviewers. They are also able to retain rule traceability to originating sources even when those undergo change (as they often do in a live environment).

Considering the above, the tradeoff of a low-cost approach to rule mining will be in higher manual effort and lower quality of results. This may be acceptable in one-off, small-scale documentation scenarios, but less likely to be so in enterprise level modernization efforts.


'''3. Time and Resources Allocation'''

Project goals and choice of technology will impact resource allocation. All too often, expectations from the business side are to receive a precisely modeled set of business rules derived from the application semantics, without realizing the complexity of such an effort. On the IT side, practitioners without experience in rules mining or familiarity with the application subject matter are ill-equipped to offer reliable estimates.

An iterative approach toward time and resource estimation may be adopted. Mining rules for a representative sub-set of the application over the first few weeks provides insights into the methods that work best for selected applications, as well as a yardstick by which the overall effort can be estimated.


'''4. Business Processes Mapping and Alignment'''
 
The logic mined is important because of its business context.  After all, logic is a subset of an overarching business process.  Mined rules will make sense only when placed into context within the associated process.  For example, assigning a prospective customer to an income bracket based upon her zip code might have different significance in credit approval and marketing campaign processes (witness insurance companies advertising that they will only look at past behavior and not credit ratings to set premiums). 

Further, viewing applications in a business process context is important in order to identify priorities for rules mining activities.  An enterprise commonly views itself in terms of its processes – registering a new customer, underwriting a policy, receiving payment, registering a claim, depositing funds into an account and so on. Some of these processes are of critical importance to the organization, while others are simply commodity functionality.  Some processes may be meeting service level agreements set by line of business executives, and others not.  Where modernization activities will focus will vary based on this calculus. 

Once the business processes have been modeled, application elements that support the chosen processes are identified. Historically, these applications were organized in silos, making the high-level match a straightforward step. At a more granular level, however, a monolithic order management application may handle customer enrollment, credit approval, order entry, and order fulfillment. If an organization is only interested in mining rules for the customer enrollment and order entry components, a mapping exercise between processes and their supporting application portfolio elements will be beneficial.

With repository-based software, application objects are registered and syntactic and semantic relationships within them are automatically captured. 

Cases of overlap are noted, where a program or data store serves multiple business processes. 

&lt;u&gt;Example – Customer Orders&lt;/u&gt;

In Figure 1 below, the Customer Master, Order Master, and Inventory data stores are within the scope for rule mining despite the fact that they support additional processes outside of the scope. Similarly, the Customer Handling program is monolithic and includes logic for Credit Approval, outside of the scope of this effort.

'''Figure 1: Business Process Mapping to Application Objects'''

[[Image: BR_Mining_Figure1.JPG| Figure 1: Business Process Mapping to Application Objects]]


'''5. Application Analysis'''

In the previous steps, an application has been inventoried and it has been understood, at a high level, where the required business processes of interest reside within application artifacts.   The next task will be to decompose the application into its constituent logical elements.  A key factor continues to be contextualization.  Elements of the application that are not relevant to organizational priorities are excluded.  This scoping via context allows us to also see the ‘boundaries’ of rules and their associated impacts.  

&lt;u&gt;Application Decomposition&lt;/u&gt;

In this step, the application is further decomposed into its detailed components. The goal is to have a sufficiently detailed collection of artifacts to serve as input to the rule mining step.

Here too, technology can help. Repository-based software can create a parse tree of detailed application objects and their relationships. This information is then presented in multiple graphical and textual views, synchronized with each other to facilitate context-sensitive analysis. 

For example, a context view will display all data field declarations, procedures, and procedure calls within a program in a compressed and outlined mode. A detailed source code view will display code segments corresponding to the context view, allowing for quick navigation through the program via the context view. Traversal through the context view will enable a user to gain quick insights into a program's structure and complexity. 

Other views available at the detailed program level include diagrammatic control flow between paragraphs, logic flowcharts within paragraphs, execution paths and runtime simulators for chosen conditional outcomes. Such tools are used to gain detailed insights into an application prior to actually starting the rule mining phase. 

Without the benefit of automated parsing tools, value can still be gained by conducting a manual inspection and walkthrough of application artifacts.


&lt;u&gt;Identification of Exclusions&lt;/u&gt;

In the process of reviewing and analyzing an application, elements not to be included in the scope of rule mining, for functional and technical reasons, are marked. These may include standard utilities, reports, system routines and out-of-scope business processes. In the example from Figure 1, this would include the artifacts related to Credit Approval and Order Fulfillment, out of scope due to their nature as commodity, standardized business processes.

The identification of exclusions illustrates a benefit to be derived from the up-front business contextualization steps described above. If they had not been conducted, a &quot;broad sweep&quot; approach would have resulted in a higher investment at the rule mining and SME review stages, where rules from the commodity business processes would first have been mined and then later discarded as irrelevant.


'''6. Glossary Creation''' 

A major challenge with mining rules from applications is that it can be difficult to navigate the various variables and naming conventions within.  These conventions have often a tenuous link to business terminology, and can make understanding the logic from a business perspective difficult.

A best practice is to refine these technical terms to create more a more business-centric view.  This can be achieved through glossary of application objects and related business terms.  Objects could be data fields, paragraphs, programs, data sources, and other application objects of interest.  

Sources of information for a glossary of terms can be business documentation, data dictionaries, database schemas, user notifications, and even source code comments.

Automated rule mining tools offer a facility to propagate values for repeating patterns (commonly called ‘tokens’) within your application.  For instance, the token 'ACCT-' may be replaced everywhere by 'Account-'. A tool would then use the glossary business names to replace technical terminology in the automated construction of candidate rules.


'''7. Rules Composition and Hierarchy Definition'''

The desired rules format is established in advance. The same rule to set an order discount may take alternate forms, such as 

(i) Declarative form: &quot;Each applicant who is a senior AAA member from California receives a 5% discount.&quot;

(ii) If-Then-Else form: If an applicant is a senior, then if she is an AAA member, then if she resides in California, assign a 5% discount.

(iii) As an entry in a decision table: 

'''Figure 2: Entry in Decision Table'''

[[Image: BR_Mining_Figure 2.JPG| Figure 2: Entry in Decision Table]]


It can be useful to attach to a mined rule additional informational and workflow attributes, such as:

* Reviewer text annotations
* Rule type (I/O, calculation, validation, security)
* Audit status (approved, not approved)
* Workflow status (extracted, working, accepted, rejected)
* Transition (valid, requires modification, duplicate, complete)
* Reviewer Identity 
* Program derived from
* Code segment location (start, end)
* Code segment text
* Input and output data elements


A rule will also be placed within a hierarchy. All rules representing a decision or executing under a given set of conditions may be grouped into a Rule Set. Rule Sets will be grouped into higher level activity nodes reflecting the business processes they currently participate in.

If you are planning to populate an executable Business Rules Management System (BRMS), you will want to define a schema that is easily transferable into the specific target environment chosen. If the target environment is not yet known, refer to available business rule standards. 
&lt;ref&gt; See [http://www.businessrulesgroup.org/brmanifesto.html Business Rules Manifesto]. &lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/domain_spec_catalog.htm#SBVR SBVR (Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules)], adopted by OMG in 2005, is a meta-model for developing semantic models of business vocabularies and business rules. &lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt; Also see [[http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/br_pm_spec_catalog.htm OMG's PRR (Production Rule Representation) specification]. &lt;/ref&gt; 


'''8. Rule Mining Workflow'''

Enterprise rule mining is usually a multi-step process involving practitioners with disparate skill sets – including consultants, developers, architects, analysts, and subject matter experts. Often key personnel will be distracted by other projects and it is therefore crucial that a common workflow be defined and documented.

Following the guidelines provided further in this document, a high-level workflow may appear as:

'''Figure 3: Sample Rule Mining Workflow'''

[[Image: BR_Mining_Figure 3.JPG| Figure 3: Sample Rule Mining Workflow]]


Each step should be defined in detail, following an adopted methodology, project scope and constraints and rule mining technology usage.  There may be multiple iterations of the first few steps until the rules are in an approved, final format.

=== Rule Mining Steps ===

'''9. Mining of Candidate Rules'''

At this point rules are mined from the application artifacts mapped to the scope of the business processes identified in previous steps. Rule mining tools help you assure that excluded artifacts are not included in scope by enabling the organization of an application into sub-groupings. Rules will be mined for a sub-grouping and not for the entire application.

The specific rule mining approach taken is primarily driven by application patterns and the desired output. 

&lt;u&gt;Top-Down Approach&lt;/u&gt;

A top-down, or process-oriented approach starts from an examination of the user interface in an online application, or from the job flow in a batch application. 

In an online application, a transaction may be invoked by a user selecting a menu option or entering a value to the screen. The fields that define the message or event that is sent from the screen to the interfacing application are identified. Each field in the triggering message may be considered a seed field for rule mining.

Using a seed field as a starting point, all of the downstream data impacts to the field including all conditional permutations are documented. Each data transformation (move into another field or calculation), represents a candidate business rule to be captured.

Rule mining software tools assists in this task by visualizing a data impact path forward for each seed field to each point where it is either populated by new values or used as input to other fields via comparisons, value propagation and calculations. At each such point, the tool can be used to document the underlying business rules. Automated rule detection methods can also be applied to capture each screen field edit as a candidate rule. 

In a batch application, the concept is similar. Part of a job flow, e.g. a Job Control Language  or group thereof that realizes a business process is identified, and all rules within individual programs relevant to that process are mined.


Figure 4: Top-Down Rule Mining

[[Image: BR_Mining_Figure 4.JPG| Figure 4: Top-Down Rule Mining]]



In Figure 4 above, note the format of the resulting &quot;Derived Candidate Rules&quot;. Automatically detected from a Cobol program, they resemble its constructs, with variable names replaced by the Glossary definitions. These will later undergo review and transformation to a more businesslike form.  While this example is demonstrated for a Cobol application, advanced mining tools may apply to a broad array of languages from PL/ and Natural to  Visual Basic and Java.

&lt;u&gt;Bottom-Up Approach&lt;/u&gt;

A bottom-up, or data-oriented approach starts from an examination of system outputs – data sent to files (both batch and online), screens and output messages (online only).

Following this approach, rules are captured by starting from an interesting data point and identifying all logic impacting that point. For example, an Order Discount field is impacted by discounts calculated upstream from it, depending on the customer's location of residence.

'''Figure 5: Bottom-Up Rule Mining'''

[[Image: BR_Mining_Figure 5.JPG| Figure 5: Bottom-Up Rule Mining]]


Rule mining technologies are particularly well suited to this approach. Through visual inspection or a repository query, data outputs of interest can be quickly identified. Then, automated rule detection routines are able to capture a candidate rule for each statement that impacts the point of interest. Because of the pre-organization into contextualized sub-groupings mentioned above, the search results will be constrained by the subset of business processes deemed relevant for rule mining.

Inspection of relevant  DBMS tables may also produce rules embedded in keys and any data rules for referential integrity and value constraints.  Once all data points of interest have been covered, all application logic of interest oriented toward existing outputs has essentially been mined.

&lt;u&gt;Hybrid Approach&lt;/u&gt;

A hybrid approach combines the two approaches described above:
* The first step is a top-down oriented capture of the relevant transactions;
* For each transaction, bottom-up rule mining is performed, including only data outputs that have not yet been already mined for another transaction.

The benefit of this approach is to extend the coverage of rule mining while avoiding repetition. 

Relating to the examples shown in Figures 4 and 5 above, following a strictly top-down approach resulted in repetitive efforts for the Quantity and Price fields since they both traversed identical downstream data impacts. Coverage was also partial since not all of the rules for Customer Discount were discovered. 

Let’s consider an extended case involving both Order Entry and Proposal Issuance processes.  Adopting an exclusive bottom-up approach would have also resulted in repetition, mining rules for upstream data impacts that &quot;hit&quot; multiple outputs (e.g. customer discount rules). Using the hybrid approach, we would first mine rules from all outputs of the order transaction, then only outputs of the proposal transaction particular to it.

'''10. Candidate Rules Verification'''

At this point, after mining candidate rules from your application, verification and correction is a necessary step to ensure the correctness and completeness of the rules.

The candidate rules are examined for:

''Accuracy''
Does each rule correctly reflect the underlying application behavior? If automated rule detection technology has been used, a rule at the point of interest (seed field) will be preceded by rules upstream from it, possibly with triggers, control conditions, and automatic rule set groupings. Each one of them (or a chosen subset) is reviewed for accuracy and corrections are made where needed, until the results are deemed satisfactory. 

''Redundancy''
Does a rule or rule set appear twice for the same application process? This can occur when rules are mined separately for two separate outputs that share upstream functionality.  Or it can be a result of simple oversight like multiple team members inadvertently mining rules from the same code base. A rule attribute is used to mark duplication.

Another form of redundancy occurs when semantically identical rules were mined separately and with different names from different processes (e.g. Order Detail and Proposal). This will be dealt with in the next step, when you transform candidate rules to business rules format. 

''Completeness''
Beyond predefined exceptions, has all of the application functionality been covered? A rule coverage report, matching mined rule sources to overall sources, can provide the answer.

''Relevance''
Can each mined rule be considered a candidate business rule? Although this is not yet the SME review step, there may be certain constructs that, upon inspection, are clearly irrelevant and should not be included in the scope of rules for review. Security verification rules, housekeeping routines and out-of-scope operations may all fall into this category. Indicate relevance on one of the rule attributes.


'''11. Transformation of Candidate Rules to Business Rules Format'''

In the previous steps, candidate rules have been mined and reviewed, reflecting legacy application behavior. These rules closely follow the application's procedural flow and operations.

A transformational step is now required, to convert candidate rules to actual business rules ready for review. This step is conducted either by application experts, rule architects, or subject matter experts. After review and conversion, the business rules captured reflect the current, as-is state to serve as a baseline or comparison to the target environment.


&lt;u&gt;Reformatting to Business Rule Notation&lt;/u&gt;

If the candidate rules were constructed manually, they may already be in the chosen business rules format. In other cases, they may have been captured in a technical format (like cut and paste from source code) and will require some modification and regrouping.

If an automated rule detection tool was used, the resulting candidate rules may somewhat resemble business rules, by using the glossary definitions to place business names within rule names, data elements and controlling conditions. However, even after the rule verification step, most of the approved candidate rules will need to be adapted to conform to a chosen business rule notation.

Figure 7: Business Rule Transformation

[[Image: BR_Mining_Figure 6.JPG| Figure 7: Business Rule Transformation]]


&lt;u&gt;Fact Modeling and Rule Normalization&lt;/u&gt;
Due to their procedural nature, legacy applications tend to lock business logic into process-specific silos. However, true business rules are independent of process and should be maintained as such.

In our example, rules for the Order Detail Entry and Proposal Entry events have been separately mined and placed in Rule sets. Are they all unique? Upon further examination, most of the logic in them is identical by design. Analyzing the results from a business perspective, there is commonality between portions of any customer document – whether Order or Proposal.

From a tooling perspective, at this point it may make sense to switch over to a Business Rule Management System, importing the mined rules from the rule mining tool as described in the Integration section below.

Using a BRMS or a visual modeling tool, a Fact Model reflecting the significant business entities and their interrelationships discovered in your existing applications is constructed. These will link to the mined business rules and serve as a baseline for the to-be rules model.

In our example, part of the Fact Model would be:

[[Image: BR_Mining_Figure 7A.JPG| Fact Model Representation]]


Once this is done, the business rules are normalized to represent the desired business level semantics:

[[Image: BR_Mining_Figure 7B.JPG| Business Semantics]]



…whereby the Customer Document Handling rules apply to both Orders and Proposals.

&lt;u&gt;Grouping and Sequencing&lt;/u&gt;

At this point, the generated rule grouping and sequencing are considered. One point of attention is the triggering relationships between rules and other rules and rule sets. Since candidate rules are often derived from a 3rd generation language application (like Cobol or PL/I), they are automatically sequenced in a procedural manner. Transformation to a declarative mode will eliminate procedural elements that are non-business in nature. 

As shown in Figure 8 below, declarative relationships that reflect true business requirements will be modeled as triggers between rules and other rules or rule sets. In the majority of BRMS] environments, a single rule may trigger multiple rules and rule sets, where the sequencing of each triggered rule or rule set is pre-compiled or resolved only at runtime.

'''Figure 8: As-is Business Rule Model (Event-driven)'''

[[Image: BR_Mining_Figure 8.JPG| Figure 8: As-is Business Rule Model (Event-driven)]]

=== Subject Matter Expert Review and Approval ===
Once mined rules have been transformed into business rules, they are handed over to subject matter experts (SMEs) and / or business analysts for review and approval. 

Normally, SMEs will not make major changes to the rules at this point. Rule mining tools may include rule attribution capabilities to aid the SMEs and enable them to mark up the business rules as 

* Approved or rejected;
* Reclassified to another category;
* Annotated with additional information in textual description attributes.

Rule mining tools also often offer web portals with a functional focus on predefined SME activities. This can greatly accelerate the review and approval process.


'''12. Reports Production'''

Business rule reports are created in either hardcopy or digital formats. Rule mining tools produce reports and diagrams depicting detailed or summary rule information within your chosen context: hierarchy level, grouping, search result. These reports serve both as reference in the review steps and as documentation of record.


'''13. Integration with a Target Environment'''

Depending upon the adopted modernization strategy, integration requirements with other environments will vary.

&lt;u&gt;Business Rule Development &lt;/u&gt;

Redevelopment with a business rule approach will typically leverage a BRMS authoring environment. These tools typically include XML import capabilities, which will be used to define an &quot;as-is&quot; business rule space, allowing rule developers to selectively re-use candidate rules deemed relevant for the target environment.  This will provide valuable (and sometimes crucial) traceability from newly deployed rules back to their legacy origins.


&lt;u&gt;Conventional Development&lt;/u&gt;

This approach typically involves building Java and .NET applications with comprehensive developer toolkits. Often, UML models will be used to define logical application views prior to actual code generation. 

In these environments, mined business rules can be attached as behaviors in UML classes that leverage them. For example, an Order_Invoice class including Order_Discount as an attribute, may also include Calculate_Order_Discount as a class behavior. This behavior can be derived (and potentially imported) from the mined business rule performing the same function.


&lt;u&gt;BPM&lt;/u&gt;

Process Management Business Process Management (BPM) tools facilitate process model creation and linkage to underlying rules and executable services. They also include the ability to define workflow rules (using BPEL) to govern the manual and automated transitions between activity nodes. 

In this context, each activity node may be realized by business rules. Many-to-many relationships may exist between rule sets and supported activities. Populating BPM processes with their relevant mined &quot;as-is&quot; business rules can &quot;close the loop&quot; for business analysts and significantly advance IT / business alignment goals.


&lt;u&gt;Requirements Management&lt;/u&gt;

Vendor offerings also include requirement tools that enable the definition of high level use cases, detailed flowcharts and activities for effective application development and management.  In these environments, mined business rules can be imported and attached as either core requirements or as textual annotations to activity nodes.


&lt;u&gt;SOA Enablement&lt;u&gt;

Service enablement of existing applications involves code refactoring and deployment as service capsules. The rule mining step can be invaluable in locating fine-grained services within source code and serving up the required service components. For example, the results of automatic rule detection for the calculation of an order discount will include all code segments leading up to the final calculation. By creating a component slice with that code (and its dependents) only, the order discount calculation can be redeployed as a service. 


'''14. Proactive Rules Management'''

We expect most applications to continue and maintained for many years into the future. Having mined rules from them, it is crucial that they continue to be updated and kept synchronized with future application changes.  Rule mining tools offer maintenance and management capabilities, including 

* Automatic alignment of rules with their original code segments even when they have moved as a result of overall source code changes;
* Audit trails for manual rule changes;
* &quot;Changer&quot; routines allowing for individual or mass changes, post- rule mining.


=== Conclusion ===
A well-defined approach to business rule mining will allow for business contextualization early on in the process. Not only will the contextualization step help frame mined rules correctly, it will also reduce the rule mining investment to focus only on critical and dynamic business processes of interest. Regardless of the application modernization strategy adopted, the best practices and tool-assisted approaches described here will help you achieve your goals at a lower cost, with less repetition and higher quality results.

==Introduction==

'''S'''edimentary landforms are prominent in every region of the United States. Each time period has at least one exposure that typifies the environment that existed when these deposits were formed. Most sedimentary deposits were laid in water, but there are also subaerial forms of sedimentation, including most notably the aeolian (wind-blown) sand and loess deposits of the Great Plains. In general, sediments of recent time will be unconsolidated, while those of older times tend to be well cemented. Each sedimentary layer represents an episode of deposition. A local succession of sedimentary beds can be read like the pages in a book, giving information about the environment at that locality at that time. The normal sequence is from oldest at the bottom to youngest at the top, but folding and faulting can and often does obscure this relationship.

Sedimentary units composed of beds that bear a stratigraphic relationship to one another are designated '''formations'''. There may be few or many individual beds within a formation, and these may be divided into '''members'''. Sometimes a single rock unit is sufficiently prominent to stand alone as a stratigraphic unit, in which case it will be named for the rock type. (Example: the Bolsa Quartzite). Stratigraphic units may grade vertically from one to another without visible break, or they may be ''unconformable'' upon one another. Unconformities and disconformities may be erosional or angular in nature. Erosional unconformities represent a time when the unit was exposed to the actions of weathering, either because the land was uplifted or the sea level declined. Structural (angular) breaks may represent tilting, faulting, slumping, or other mechanisms that caused a hiatus in deposition. These are usually obvious in marine sediments, but may be difficult to distinguish in cross-bedded aeolian sandstones.

Sediments, like all rock types, can undergo metamorphism. Heat and pressure produced either by deep burial or tectonic events can cause the solution and recrystallization of mineral grains, and drastically alter the appearance of the rocks. Thus sandstones may become very hard quartzites, mudstones become shales and slates, limestones become marble or dolomite. Igneous activity far below can send hot fluids and gases up through the layers, sometimes producing commercially valuable ore deposits. For purposes of this survey, metamorphosed sediments are still sediments, even though they may properly fall into the category of metamorphic rocks. 

Fossils are the special feature of sediments. Fossils rarely survive any great degree of metamorphism, so they are found only in the unaltered sediments. Shales and limestones are the most abundant fossil sources, but other sediments occasionally yield good specimens. In this book, fossils will be briefly described when they constitute a significant feature of the period or the locality.

While each chapter of this book will cover the time period for which it is named, it must be kept in mind that the geologic column is a continuum. With the possible exception of the famed KT Boundary, the time periods graded rather slowly from one to the other, such that it may be difficult to distinguish the &quot;boundary&quot; in any given cross-section. In addition, the example localities presented here must not be taken as representative of the global (or even regional) conditions of the time. These events were localized to a specific set of conditions, and wide differences are likely as one travels to distant areas. With that, let us proceed to open the book and read the last 540 million years of Earth's history.

Below is a general approach towards the semantic capture of technical rules and their abstraction into business rules. 

=== Preparatory Steps ===

A series of preparatory help to avoid protracted rules mining exercises, ensure that rules are valuable to the business, and speed the process of creating ‘business’ and not simply ‘technical’ rules. These steps are recommended to build the right organizational framework and to align rule mining with business priorities.


'''1. Project Goals and Desired Output''' 

It is important to define the goals and outputs of the rules mining activity.  This will vary depending on the business priorities of organizations.  For some, the goal may be to address inflexibility or high downtime in a highly valuable and customized application.  This may lead to the decision to move to a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-Oriented_Architecture SOA] -enabled packaged application.  

Depending on the goal there will be two primary outcomes that can be derived from a rules mining activity: 

''Documentation''
In some cases, the goal may be to develop business-centric documentation of program code segments. This documentation, valuable as reference for other analysts and subject matter experts, may also be used to decorate high-level design models for the modernized, to-be applications. It would not normally result in executable business rules or inputs into development environments.

''Business Rules''
In other cases, the exact semantic behavior of edits and calculations in applications needs to be captured as true business rules. The captured semantics will be used as a basis for, and perhaps even directly fed into, target development environments.  The outcome of this step will drive decisions regarding technology adoption, resource planning, and the best methods to apply for either type of rule mining. 


'''2. Rule Mining Technology Selection'''

''Largely Manual Approach''
A low-cost, low-value application of technology for rule mining is the documentation of rules in word processing or spreadsheet applications. This approach will not help address the most resource-intensive portions of rule mining – like analyzing application behavior and locating rules within source code segments.

''Runtime Simulation''
Runtime simulation technologies that facilitate the capture of user behavior into processes and rules can help from a behavioral aspect. Their main drawback is that they are limited to those test scenarios actually performed within a given time frame – potentially missing out on critical exceptions not usually performed. 

''Scanning Tools''
Text scanning tools that locate patterns within sources can accelerate the capture of rules based upon fixed patterns within source code (e.g. showing all moves to a variable). These tools typically generate a large number of false positives and tend to lead to technical rather than business rules.

''Repository-Based Rule Mining Tools''
Repository-based technologies that recompile the sources and build a syntactic parse tree can offer the highest value in rule mining. The most advanced automatically detect rules using semantic analysis, e.g. each statement upstream from a point of interest variable and which potentially impacts its value, is mined as a candidate rule.

Rule mining tools may also offer rule management and auditing capabilities, facilitating project workflow and rule maintenance activities by reviewers. They are also able to retain rule traceability to originating sources even when those undergo change (as they often do in a live environment).

Considering the above, the tradeoff of a low-cost approach to rule mining will be in higher manual effort and lower quality of results. This may be acceptable in one-off, small-scale documentation scenarios, but less likely to be so in enterprise level modernization efforts.


'''3. Time and Resources Allocation'''

Project goals and choice of technology will impact resource allocation. All too often, expectations from the business side are to receive a precisely modeled set of business rules derived from the application semantics, without realizing the complexity of such an effort. On the IT side, practitioners without experience in rules mining or familiarity with the application subject matter are ill-equipped to offer reliable estimates.

An iterative approach toward time and resource estimation may be adopted. Mining rules for a representative sub-set of the application over the first few weeks provides insights into the methods that work best for selected applications, as well as a yardstick by which the overall effort can be estimated.


'''4. Business Processes Mapping and Alignment'''
 
The logic mined is important because of its business context.  After all, logic is a subset of an overarching business process.  Mined rules will make sense only when placed into context within the associated process.  For example, assigning a prospective customer to an income bracket based upon her zip code might have different significance in credit approval and marketing campaign processes (witness insurance companies advertising that they will only look at past behavior and not credit ratings to set premiums). 

Further, viewing applications in a business process context is important in order to identify priorities for rules mining activities.  An enterprise commonly views itself in terms of its processes – registering a new customer, underwriting a policy, receiving payment, registering a claim, depositing funds into an account and so on. Some of these processes are of critical importance to the organization, while others are simply commodity functionality.  Some processes may be meeting service level agreements set by line of business executives, and others not.  Where modernization activities will focus will vary based on this calculus. 

Once the business processes have been modeled, application elements that support the chosen processes are identified. Historically, these applications were organized in silos, making the high-level match a straightforward step. At a more granular level, however, a monolithic order management application may handle customer enrollment, credit approval, order entry, and order fulfillment. If an organization is only interested in mining rules for the customer enrollment and order entry components, a mapping exercise between processes and their supporting application portfolio elements will be beneficial.

With repository-based software, application objects are registered and syntactic and semantic relationships within them are automatically captured. 

Cases of overlap are noted, where a program or data store serves multiple business processes. 

&lt;u&gt;Example – Customer Orders&lt;/u&gt;

In Figure 1 below, the Customer Master, Order Master, and Inventory data stores are within the scope for rule mining despite the fact that they support additional processes outside of the scope. Similarly, the Customer Handling program is monolithic and includes logic for Credit Approval, outside of the scope of this effort.

'''Figure 1: Business Process Mapping to Application Objects'''

[[Image: BR_Mining_Figure1.JPG| Figure 1: Business Process Mapping to Application Objects]]


'''5. Application Analysis'''

In the previous steps, an application has been inventoried and it has been understood, at a high level, where the required business processes of interest reside within application artifacts.   The next task will be to decompose the application into its constituent logical elements.  A key factor continues to be contextualization.  Elements of the application that are not relevant to organizational priorities are excluded.  This scoping via context allows us to also see the ‘boundaries’ of rules and their associated impacts.  

&lt;u&gt;Application Decomposition&lt;/u&gt;

In this step, the application is further decomposed into its detailed components. The goal is to have a sufficiently detailed collection of artifacts to serve as input to the rule mining step.

Here too, technology can help. Repository-based software can create a parse tree of detailed application objects and their relationships. This information is then presented in multiple graphical and textual views, synchronized with each other to facilitate context-sensitive analysis. 

For example, a context view will display all data field declarations, procedures, and procedure calls within a program in a compressed and outlined mode. A detailed source code view will display code segments corresponding to the context view, allowing for quick navigation through the program via the context view. Traversal through the context view will enable a user to gain quick insights into a program's structure and complexity. 

Other views available at the detailed program level include diagrammatic control flow between paragraphs, logic flowcharts within paragraphs, execution paths and runtime simulators for chosen conditional outcomes. Such tools are used to gain detailed insights into an application prior to actually starting the rule mining phase. 

Without the benefit of automated parsing tools, value can still be gained by conducting a manual inspection and walkthrough of application artifacts.


&lt;u&gt;Identification of Exclusions&lt;/u&gt;

In the process of reviewing and analyzing an application, elements not to be included in the scope of rule mining, for functional and technical reasons, are marked. These may include standard utilities, reports, system routines and out-of-scope business processes. In the example from Figure 1, this would include the artifacts related to Credit Approval and Order Fulfillment, out of scope due to their nature as commodity, standardized business processes.

The identification of exclusions illustrates a benefit to be derived from the up-front business contextualization steps described above. If they had not been conducted, a &quot;broad sweep&quot; approach would have resulted in a higher investment at the rule mining and SME review stages, where rules from the commodity business processes would first have been mined and then later discarded as irrelevant.


'''6. Glossary Creation''' 

A major challenge with mining rules from applications is that it can be difficult to navigate the various variables and naming conventions within.  These conventions have often a tenuous link to business terminology, and can make understanding the logic from a business perspective difficult.

A best practice is to refine these technical terms to create more a more business-centric view.  This can be achieved through glossary of application objects and related business terms.  Objects could be data fields, paragraphs, programs, data sources, and other application objects of interest.  

Sources of information for a glossary of terms can be business documentation, data dictionaries, database schemas, user notifications, and even source code comments.

Automated rule mining tools offer a facility to propagate values for repeating patterns (commonly called ‘tokens’) within your application.  For instance, the token 'ACCT-' may be replaced everywhere by 'Account-'. A tool would then use the glossary business names to replace technical terminology in the automated construction of candidate rules.


'''7. Rules Composition and Hierarchy Definition'''

The desired rules format is established in advance. The same rule to set an order discount may take alternate forms, such as 

(i) Declarative form: &quot;Each applicant who is a senior [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Automobile_Association AAA] member from California receives a 5% discount.&quot;

(ii) If-Then-Else form: If an applicant is a senior, then if she is an AAA member, then if she resides in California, assign a 5% discount.

(iii) As an entry in a decision table: 

'''Figure 2: Entry in Decision Table'''

[[Image: BR_Mining_Figure 2.JPG| Figure 2: Entry in Decision Table]]


It can be useful to attach to a mined rule additional informational and workflow attributes, such as:

* Reviewer text annotations
* Rule type (I/O, calculation, validation, security)
* Audit status (approved, not approved)
* Workflow status (extracted, working, accepted, rejected)
* Transition (valid, requires modification, duplicate, complete)
* Reviewer Identity 
* Program derived from
* Code segment location (start, end)
* Code segment text
* Input and output data elements


A rule will also be placed within a hierarchy. All rules representing a decision or executing under a given set of conditions may be grouped into a Rule Set. Rule Sets will be grouped into higher level activity nodes reflecting the business processes they currently participate in.

If you are planning to populate an executable Business Rules Management System (BRMS), you will want to define a schema that is easily transferable into the specific target environment chosen. If the target environment is not yet known, refer to available business rule standards. 
&lt;ref&gt; See [http://www.businessrulesgroup.org/brmanifesto.html Business Rules Manifesto]. &lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/domain_spec_catalog.htm#SBVR SBVR (Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Business Rules)], adopted by OMG in 2005, is a meta-model for developing semantic models of business vocabularies and business rules. &lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt; Also see [http://www.omg.org/technology/documents/br_pm_spec_catalog.htm OMG's PRR (Production Rule Representation) specification]. &lt;/ref&gt; 


'''8. Rule Mining Workflow'''

Enterprise rule mining is usually a multi-step process involving practitioners with disparate skill sets – including consultants, developers, architects, analysts, and subject matter experts. Often key personnel will be distracted by other projects and it is therefore crucial that a common workflow be defined and documented.

Following the guidelines provided further in this document, a high-level workflow may appear as:

'''Figure 3: Sample Rule Mining Workflow'''

[[Image: BR_Mining_Figure 3.JPG| Figure 3: Sample Rule Mining Workflow]]


Each step should be defined in detail, following an adopted methodology, project scope and constraints and rule mining technology usage.  There may be multiple iterations of the first few steps until the rules are in an approved, final format.

=== Rule Mining Steps ===

'''9. Mining of Candidate Rules'''

At this point rules are mined from the application artifacts mapped to the scope of the business processes identified in previous steps. Rule mining tools help you assure that excluded artifacts are not included in scope by enabling the organization of an application into sub-groupings. Rules will be mined for a sub-grouping and not for the entire application.

The specific rule mining approach taken is primarily driven by application patterns and the desired output. 

&lt;u&gt;Top-Down Approach&lt;/u&gt;

A top-down, or process-oriented approach starts from an examination of the user interface in an online application, or from the job flow in a batch application. 

In an online application, a transaction may be invoked by a user selecting a menu option or entering a value to the screen. The fields that define the message or event that is sent from the screen to the interfacing application are identified. Each field in the triggering message may be considered a seed field for rule mining.

Using a seed field as a starting point, all of the downstream data impacts to the field including all conditional permutations are documented. Each data transformation (move into another field or calculation), represents a candidate business rule to be captured.

Rule mining software tools assists in this task by visualizing a data impact path forward for each seed field to each point where it is either populated by new values or used as input to other fields via comparisons, value propagation and calculations. At each such point, the tool can be used to document the underlying business rules. Automated rule detection methods can also be applied to capture each screen field edit as a candidate rule. 

In a batch application, the concept is similar. Part of a job flow, e.g. a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_Control_Language JCL] or group thereof that realizes a business process is identified, and all rules within individual programs relevant to that process are mined.


Figure 4: Top-Down Rule Mining

[[Image: BR_Mining_Figure 4.JPG| Figure 4: Top-Down Rule Mining]]



In Figure 4 above, note the format of the resulting &quot;Derived Candidate Rules&quot;. Automatically detected from a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobol Cobol] program, they resemble its constructs, with variable names replaced by the Glossary definitions. These will later undergo review and transformation to a more businesslike form.  While this example is demonstrated for a Cobol application, advanced mining tools may apply to a broad array of languages from [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PL/I PL/I] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATURAL Natural] to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual Basic Visual Basic] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_language Java].

&lt;u&gt;Bottom-Up Approach&lt;/u&gt;

A bottom-up, or data-oriented approach starts from an examination of system outputs – data sent to files (both batch and online), screens and output messages (online only).

Following this approach, rules are captured by starting from an interesting data point and identifying all logic impacting that point. For example, an Order Discount field is impacted by discounts calculated upstream from it, depending on the customer's location of residence.

'''Figure 5: Bottom-Up Rule Mining'''

[[Image: BR_Mining_Figure 5.JPG| Figure 5: Bottom-Up Rule Mining]]


Rule mining technologies are particularly well suited to this approach. Through visual inspection or a repository query, data outputs of interest can be quickly indentified. Then, automated rule detection routines are able to capture a candidate rule for each statement that impacts the point of interest. Because of the pre-organization into contextualized sub-groupings mentioned above, the search results will be constrained by the subset of business processes deemed relevant for rule mining.

Inspection of relevant [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBMS DBMS] tables may also produce rules embedded in keys and any data rules for referential integrity and value constraints.  Once all data points of interest have been covered, all application logic of interest oriented toward existing outputs has essentially been mined.

&lt;u&gt;Hybrid Approach&lt;/u&gt;

A hybrid approach combines the two approaches described above:
* The first step is a top-down oriented capture of the relevant transactions;
* For each transaction, bottom-up rule mining is performed, including only data outputs that have not yet been already mined for another transaction.

The benefit of this approach is to extend the coverage of rule mining while avoiding repetition. 

Relating to the examples shown in Figures 4 and 5 above, following a strictly top-down approach resulted in repetitive efforts for the Quantity and Price fields since they both traversed identical downstream data impacts. Coverage was also partial since not all of the rules for Customer Discount were discovered. 

Let’s consider an extended case involving both Order Entry and Proposal Issuance processes.  Adopting an exclusive bottom-up approach would have also resulted in repetition, mining rules for upstream data impacts that &quot;hit&quot; multiple outputs (e.g. customer discount rules). Using the hybrid approach, we would first mine rules from all outputs of the order transaction, then only outputs of the proposal transaction particular to it.

'''Figure 6: Hybrid Rule Mining'''

[[Image: BR_Mining_Figure 6.JPG| Figure 6: Hybrid Rule Mining]]


'''10. Candidate Rules Verification'''

At this point, after mining candidate rules from your application, verification and correction is a necessary step to ensure the correctness and completeness of the rules.

The candidate rules are examined for:

''Accuracy''
Does each rule correctly reflect the underlying application behavior? If automated rule detection technology has been used, a rule at the point of interest (seed field) will be preceded by rules upstream from it, possibly with triggers, control conditions, and automatic rule set groupings. Each one of them (or a chosen subset) is reviewed for accuracy and corrections are made where needed, until the results are deemed satisfactory. 

''Redundancy''
Does a rule or rule set appear twice for the same application process? This can occur when rules are mined separately for two separate outputs that share upstream functionality.  Or it can be a result of simple oversight like multiple team members inadvertently mining rules from the same code base. A rule attribute is used to mark duplication.

Another form of redundancy occurs when semantically identical rules were mined separately and with different names from different processes (e.g. Order Detail and Proposal). This will be dealt with in the next step, when you transform candidate rules to business rules format. 

''Completeness''
Beyond predefined exceptions, has all of the application functionality been covered? A rule coverage report, matching mined rule sources to overall sources, can provide the answer.

''Relevance''
Can each mined rule be considered a candidate business rule? Although this is not yet the SME review step, there may be certain constructs that, upon inspection, are clearly irrelevant and should not be included in the scope of rules for review. Security verification rules, housekeeping routines and out-of-scope operations may all fall into this category. Indicate relevance on one of the rule attributes.


'''11. Transformation of Candidate Rules to Business Rules Format'''

In the previous steps, candidate rules have been mined and reviewed, reflecting legacy application behavior. These rules closely follow the application's procedural flow and operations.

A transformational step is now required, to convert candidate rules to actual business rules ready for review. This step is conducted either by application experts, rule architects, or subject matter experts. After review and conversion, the business rules captured reflect the current, as-is state to serve as a baseline or comparison to the target environment.


&lt;u&gt;Reformatting to Business Rule Notation&lt;/u&gt;

If the candidate rules were constructed manually, they may already be in the chosen business rules format. In other cases, they may have been captured in a technical format (like cut and paste from source code) and will require some modification and regrouping.

If an automated rule detection tool was used, the resulting candidate rules may somewhat resemble business rules, by using the glossary definitions to place business names within rule names, data elements and controlling conditions. However, even after the rule verification step, most of the approved candidate rules will need to be adapted to conform to a chosen business rule notation.

Figure 7: Business Rule Transformation

[[Image: BR_Mining_Figure 6.JPG| Figure 7: Business Rule Transformation]]


&lt;u&gt;Fact Modeling and Rule Normalization&lt;/u&gt;
Due to their procedural nature, legacy applications tend to lock business logic into process-specific silos. However, true business rules are independent of process and should be maintained as such.

In our example, rules for the Order Detail Entry and Proposal Entry events have been separately mined and placed in Rule sets. Are they all unique? Upon further examination, most of the logic in them is identical by design. Analyzing the results from a business perspective, there is commonality between portions of any customer document – whether Order or Proposal.

From a tooling perspective, at this point it may make sense to switch over to a Business Rule Management System ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRMS BRMS]), importing the mined rules from the rule mining tool as described in the Integration section below.

Using a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRMS BRMS] or a visual modeling tool, a Fact Model reflecting the significant business entities and their interrelationships discovered in your existing applications is constructed. These will link to the mined business rules and serve as a baseline for the to-be rules model.

In our example, part of the Fact Model would be:

[[Image: BR_Mining_Figure 7A.JPG| Fact Model Representation]]


Once this is done, the business rules are normalized to represent the desired business level semantics:

[[Image: BR_Mining_Figure 7B.JPG| Business Semantics]]



…whereby the Customer Document Handling rules apply to both Orders and Proposals.

&lt;u&gt;Grouping and Sequencing&lt;/u&gt;

At this point, the generated rule grouping and sequencing are considered. One point of attention is the triggering relationships between rules and other rules and rule sets. Since candidate rules are often derived from a 3rd generation language application (like Cobol or PL/I), they are automatically sequenced in a procedural manner. Transformation to a declarative mode will eliminate procedural elements that are non-business in nature. 

As shown in Figure 8 below, declarative relationships that reflect true business requirements will be modeled as triggers between rules and other rules or rule sets. In the majority of [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRMS BRMS] environments, a single rule may trigger multiple rules and rule sets, where the sequencing of each triggered rule or rule set is pre-compiled or resolved only at runtime.

'''Figure 8: As-is Business Rule Model (Event-driven)'''

[[Image: BR_Mining_Figure 8.JPG| Figure 8: As-is Business Rule Model (Event-driven)]]

=== Subject Matter Expert Review and Approval ===

Once mined rules have been transformed into business rules, they are handed over to subject matter experts (SMEs) and / or business analysts for review and approval. 

Normally, SMEs will not make major changes to the rules at this point. Rule mining tools may include rule attribution capabilities to aid the SMEs and enable them to mark up the business rules as 

* Approved or rejected;
* Reclassified to another category;
* Annotated with additional information in textual description attributes.

Rule mining tools also often offer web portals with a functional focus on predefined SME activities. This can greatly accelerate the review and approval process.


'''12. Reports Production'''

Business rule reports are created in either hardcopy or digital formats. Rule mining tools produce reports and diagrams depicting detailed or summary rule information within your chosen context: hierarchy level, grouping, search result. These reports serve both as reference in the review steps and as documentation of record.


'''13. Integration with a Target Environment'''

Depending upon the adopted modernization strategy, integration requirements with other environments will vary.


&lt;u&gt;Business Rule Development &lt;/u&gt;

Redevelopment with a business rule approach will typically leverage a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BRMS BRMS] authoring environment. These tools typically include [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XML XML] import capabilities, which will be used to define an &quot;as-is&quot; business rule space, allowing rule developers to selectively re-use candidate rules deemed relevant for the target environment.  This will provide valuable (and sometimes crucial) traceability from newly deployed rules back to their legacy origins.


&lt;u&gt;Conventional Development&lt;/u&gt;

This approach typically involves building [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_language Java] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microsoft_.NET_Framework .NET] applications with comprehensive developer toolkits. Often, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_Modeling_Language UML] models will be used to define logical application views prior to actual code generation. 

In these environments, mined business rules can be attached as behaviors in UML classes that leverage them. For example, an Order_Invoice class including Order_Discount as an attribute, may also include Calculate_Order_Discount as a class behavior. This behavior can be derived (and potentially imported) from the mined business rule performing the same function.


&lt;u&gt;BPM&lt;/u&gt;

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business Process Management Business Process Management] (BPM) tools facilitate process model creation and linkage to underlying rules and executable services. They also include the ability to define workflow rules (using [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BPEL BPEL]) to govern the manual and automated transitions between activity nodes. 

In this context, each activity node may be realized by business rules. Many-to-many relationships may exist between rule sets and supported activities. Populating BPM processes with their relevant mined &quot;as-is&quot; business rules can &quot;close the loop&quot; for business analysts and significantly advance IT / business alignment goals.


&lt;u&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Requirements_management Requirements Management]&lt;/u&gt;

Vendor offerings also include requirement tools that enable the definition of high level use cases, detailed flowcharts and activities for effective application development and management.  In these environments, mined business rules can be imported and attached as either core requirements or as textual annotations to activity nodes.


&lt;u&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Service-Oriented_Architecture SOA] Enablement&lt;u&gt;

Service enablement of existing applications involves code refactoring and deployment as service capsules. The rule mining step can be invaluable in locating fine-grained services within source code and serving up the required service components. For example, the results of automatic rule detection for the calculation of an order discount will include all code segments leading up to the final calculation. By creating a component slice with that code (and its dependents) only, the order discount calculation can be redeployed as a service. 


'''14. Proactive Rules Management'''

We expect most applications to continue and maintained for many years into the future. Having mined rules from them, it is crucial that they continue to be updated and kept synchronized with future application changes.  Rule mining tools offer maintenance and management capabilities, including 

* Automatic alignment of rules with their original code segments even when they have moved as a result of overall source code changes;
* Audit trails for manual rule changes;
* &quot;Changer&quot; routines allowing for individual or mass changes, post- rule mining.

=== Conclusion ===

A well-defined approach to business rule mining will allow for business contextualization early on in the process. Not only will the contextualization step help frame mined rules correctly, it will also reduce the rule mining investment to focus only on critical and dynamic business processes of interest. Regardless of the application modernization strategy adopted, the best practices and tool-assisted approaches described here will help you achieve your goals at a lower cost, with less repetition and higher quality results.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ah, welcome to the wiki on the wonderful IOP. Note that all of these stem from personal experience and advice. If anybody feels the need to add anything, feel free to do so.

==Things You Should Know

The IOP is an excellent, easy way to get a 6 or 7. It also provides you with a gateway to do something creative, and explore interesting aspects of literature. As I found out, it's also a way to start learning how to really analyze literature well and love doing it. As geeky as that may sound!

Of course, you've got to work on it, but it won't be too hard. We're here to help, kid. ;)

Let's begin, shall we?

==Step 1==

'''Decide on your Material'''

Are you using a poem, a novel, an extract of a novel, two different pieces of literature?

It's best to pick the literature that really sparked your interest, and one that you will like to work on. Don't always go for the easiest choice - because it's not going to get your audience or your teacher involved and that's going to reflect on your grades. 

==Step 2==

'''Get Analyzing'''

Before you do anything else, you have to analyze your literature first. Why, you ask? Because once you study it well, you'll know the topic you're going to choose and what type of activity will suit it best. 

Use other sources when working, try to look at SparkNotes and other websites for information. 

So how do we analyze it? 

If you're using a poem, short extract, or short story, follow these steps VERY carefully. Hopefully, if you're covering a novel as a whole, or even two whole novels, you've already covered this step the first time you read it. If not, follow it now!

You should be spending a very long time on this step, perhaps a few days, so you really nail it. 

===A) Understand it===

Because you're working with a short extract or short poem, read it and read it well.  Look for anything interesting that you see, or something that seems to really stand out. Write down anything you notice. If you see a persistent idea, make sure you take a note of that.

The key idea in this step is that you UNDERSTAND exactly what this piece of literature is talking about, what it's saying. Understand the surface, and better yet, see what the words mean - the themes or underlying concepts. This is very important because it's going to help you with the next step. 

===B) Identify Tone, Language, Structure, Literary Features and Themes===

Tone is the author's opinion and take on the topic. It is different from mood. Tone influences mood. Tone comes from the author, and mood is received by the audience. Tone can be found through the literary features, language, and structure.

Language: is it flowery, detailed, descriptive, simple, vulgar, etc? Does it use lots of imagery? What is the significance of the author's diction (word choice)? 

Structure: How is it written? Is it one large sentence with no stops in between? How many stanzas? How many paragraphs? 

Literary features: refer to the &quot;How to Write a Poetry Commentary&quot; section of [[IB English/Commentary]]. We're talking here about alliteration, imagery, figurative language, paradoxes, etc.

Once you've identified all of this, try to figure why the author has used them, what it MEANS as a collective. '''WHY has the author used this? What is the significance?''' Most probably, all these literary features are used to create an effect on the reader, and enforce a certain theme.

===C) Annotate===

Annotating is excellent, and those little colored stickies are even better! Write down everything that you noticed about the above: literary features and themes. Trust me, knowing the books that the IB chooses, your literature could be - and should be - FILLED with annotations. You'll get better at this as you practice.

You might be thinking that annotations aren't important. Trust me, they are. After you've identified all those literary features and themes, and then go off to eat dinner and sleep away until the next day, you're going to forget lots of crucial details about The Great Gatsby or Wuthering Heights or Great Expectations. Annotating saves time and also lets you see things visually which helps so much really.

== Documentation ==
A [[Template:DropBox|DropBox]] whose contents are transcluded from elsewhere. This is useful for maintaining the contents of text boxes in a set of subpages. A relative link is is passed to this template and it is automatically [[transcluded]] as the contents of the box. When writing a book, this separates the contents of each information box from the main page: usually a desirable feature.

The contents of the box can be accessed directly by using the v d e (view, discuss, edit) links in the box title.

=== Parameters ===

;header
: The heading for the box (e.g. Box 1.1). This can also be taken from the 1st unnamed parameter.
;Box contents are specified by one of the following
:;relpath
:: A relative path to the content of the box. This can also be taken from the 2nd unnamed parameter.
:;abspath
:: Instead of a relative path, use an absolute path (this currently does not give the correct link to the discussion page)
:;tplname
:: Instead of the relative or absolute paths, give a template name, e.g. Lorem
==== Conventional css parameters ====
;fw1
:the font-weight for the heading
;fw2
:the font-weight for the body
;bg
:the background-color for the enclosing box
;bg1
:the background-color for the heading 
;bg2
:the background-color for the body
;ta1
:the text-align for the heading (default center)
;ta2
:the text-align for the body (default left)
;float
:should the box be floated? (left, right, or none)
;width
: the width of the box, e.g. 33%

==== Special parameters ====
;hidden
: set this to any string (e.g. hidden=true) to have the box hidden by default
;headType
: allows you to set the box header to (say) &quot;h4&quot;, which means it will be included in the table of contents

=== Examples ===
Also see [[Template:DropBox#Examples]] for examples of other possible stylings.

The simplest example. In this documentation we can transclude [[Template:Lorem]] using a relative link, because the documentation is aslo in the template namespace. In most cases, you will probably want to transclude a page in the same namespace as your book, so you will want to use a relative link.
&lt;pre&gt;{{TranscludeBox|Box 1.1|../Lorem}}&lt;/pre&gt;
or we could be more verbose, and give the parameter name
&lt;pre&gt;{{TranscludeBox|Box 1.1|relpath=../Lorem}}&lt;/pre&gt;
{{TranscludeBox|Box 1.1|../Lorem}}

If we want to transclude a template in a page that is outside the Template namespace, we can't use a relative link, so we have to specify tplname rather than relpath. 
&lt;pre&gt;{{TranscludeBox|Box 1.2|tplname=Lorem}}&lt;/pre&gt;
{{TranscludeBox|Box 1.2|tplname=Lorem}}

An example where the headType has been set. Note that if the title is an unnamed parameter, make sure it is not followed by a carriage return, otherwise it will not appear in the TOC.
&lt;pre&gt;{{TranscludeBox|Box 1.3|../Lorem|headType=h4}}&lt;/pre&gt;
{{TranscludeBox|Box 1.3|../Lorem|headType=h4}}

{{TranscludeBox|Box 1.4|../Lorem|
headType=h4|
bg=#BBBBFF|
bg1=#BBBBFF|
bg2=white|
float=right|
width=33%}}
A more realistic example, rendered as (hopefully) seen on the right
&lt;pre&gt;{{TranscludeBox|Box 1.4|../Lorem|
headType=h4|
bg=#BBBBFF|
bg1=#BBBBFF|
bg2=white|
float=right|
width=33%}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Gperiod|image=|o2=12.5|co2=4500|temp=21|sea level = Rising steadily from 30m to 90m}}

'''T'''he Cambrian is the first period of the Paleozoic era of the Phanerozoic eon. The beginning of Cambrian time coincides with a mass extinction event that depleted late Precambrian life forms and made way for a virtual explosion of new life. It is thought that the Ediacaran period, which closed Precambrian time, saw the emergence of Earth from a long and bitter ice age. Melting ice and warming temperatures encouraged the growth of algae and other oxygen producing organisms. The atmospheric oxygen content, which had been as low as 8% during the Ediacaran, increased to 12.5%. At the same time, volcanic gases were pumping carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, creating a greenhouse effect that reinforced the warming trend.

The Cambrian climate on the global scale was much warmer than we see today. Other than some primitive algal and lichen species, there were no land plants and certainly no land animals. But life in the warm, shallow seas was abundant and diversified. The Cambrian was characterized by transgressive-regressive episodes during which the sea levels repeatedly shifted. It is thought that this resulted from a combination of rapid continental drift and the melting of the last remnants of the previous ice caps.

One cannot talk about Cambrian life forms without mentioning the famed Burgess Shale ([[w:Burgess_shale|Wikipedia article]]), but strictly speaking, the bulk of that locality lies in Canada. We will therefore confine our locality discussion to the Sauk Transgression, as typified in the lowermost sedimentary formations of the Grand Canyon in Arizona.

During Cambrian time, shallow epeiric seas covered large portions of the continent. The general trend was toward increasing depth and areal extent of these seas, but there were also numerous episodes of ''retreating'' seas as land masses were uplifted by tectonic forces. The '''Sauk Sequence''' is, therefore, typically interfingered with units grading laterally into each other, and sequence repetitions are abundantly present. For any given shoreline position, the sequence nearest shore consists of light colored sands, silts, and muds, sometimes containing thin limestone bands. Farther out, pure limestones and dolomites accumulated. Then, in the deeper waters farther offshore, dark colored silts, muds and sands, and impure limestone beds that contain chert are found. It is important to realize that these interlaced facies do not represent different ''times'' of deposition, but merely different environments. Thus, in the basal layers of the Grand Canyon, we see the Lower Cambrian ''Tapeats Sandstone'' being deposited near shore, grading to the eastward into the ''Bright Angel Shale'', which in turn grades into the ''Muav Limestone''. The Bright Angel Shale is a classic example of a formation that represents different intervals of deposition at different places. Because the trend of Sauk transgression in this region was from west to east, the Bright Angel Shale follows this path laterally with respect to time. Thus, in the westernmost exposures, the Bright Angel Shale is partly of Lower Cambrian age, while the easternmost exposures are entirely Middle Cambrian. 

[[File:Grand Canyon geologic column.jpg|thumb|Grand Canyon Geologic Section]]

The transition from sandstone to shale to carbonates is the classic signature of a transgressive event. Regressive events may show the reverse sequence, if the regression was also a slow event. (Some regressions were the result of rapid crustal movements, and did not allow time for the sedimentation to occur). If an uplifted region became exposed to erosion at any time, there may also be missing sequences and a visible unconformity in the bedding.

Late Cambrian sedimentation patterns shifted more toward carbonate sequences, indicative of stabilizing sea levels and somewhat deeper waters. Stromatolitic algal limestone reefs became common, which means that shorelines had stabilized as well. There is no stratigraphic boundary between the Cambrian and the overlying Ordovician periods. The two are distinguished entirely by means of the fossil assemblages. The Cambrian climate trends therefore continued unchanged into the Ordovician period.

In the diagram at right, unit 3a is the Tapeats Sandstone, lying unconfromably upon the Precambrian granite and schist. Unit 3b, which is softer and thus forms an erosional slope, is the Bright Angel Shale. Finally, unit 3c is the Muav Limestone. Together, this sequence is called the '''Tonto Group'''.

[[File:Asaphiscuswheelerii.jpg|thumb|A Cambrian trilobite]]

Trilobite '''fossils''' are the most famous specimens from the Cambrian period. However, the Archaeocyathids ([[w:Archeocyathids|Wikipedia article]]) and Brachiopods ([[w:Brachiopods|Wikipedia article]]) are, by far, the more useful groups, being marker species for the period. The Archaeocyathids first appear at the Ediacaran-Cambrian boundary, and became extinct by the Middle Cambrian. The Brachiopods appeared in both articulated and inarticulated forms, but only the inarticulated forms were ''abundant'' in the Cambrian. The articulated species dominate after the Cambrian-Ordovician boundary. Thus, these two fossil species can be used to date a Cambrian formation. Although all the major invertebrate phyla appear during the Cambrian, nearly all Cambrian macrofossils belong to the three groups mentioned. Other large life forms appear to have been rare, or not to have fossilized well. 

The Cambrian period introduced such a rapid expansion of life forms that it has been called the '''Cambrian Explosion''' ([[w:Cambrian_explosion|Wikipedia article]]). The seemingly sudden proliferation of diverse species is something of a mystery, but interpretation is difficult due to a limited supply of evidence, incomplete fossil records, and the lack of chemical traces left in Cambrian rocks.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Computer programming''' (often shortened to '''programming''' or '''coding''') is the process of designing, writing, testing, debugging / troubleshooting, and maintaining the source code of computer programs. This source code is written in a programming language. The purpose of programming is to create a program that exhibits a certain desired behaviour. The process of writing source code often requires expertise in many different subjects, including knowledge of the application domain, specialized algorithms and formal logic.

==Definition==
Hoc and Nguyen-Xuan define computer programming as &quot;the process of transforming a mental plan in familiar terms into one compatible with the computer.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Hoc, J.-M. and Nguyen-Xuan, A. Language semantics, mental models and analogy. J.-M. Hoc et al., Eds. Psychology of Programming. Academic Press. London, 1990, 139–156, cited through [http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1015864.1015888 Brad A. Myers , John F. Pane , Andy Ko, Natural programming languages and environments, Communications of the ACM, v.47 n.9, September 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; Said another way, programming is the craft of transforming requirements into something that a computer can execute.

==Overview==
Within software engineering, programming (the ''implementation'') is regarded as one phase in a software development process.

There is an ongoing debate on the extent to which the writing of programs is an art, a craft or an engineering discipline.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Paul Graham |year=2003 |url=http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html |title=Hackers and Painters |accessdate=2006-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In general, good programming is considered to be the measured application of all three, with the goal of producing an efficient and evolvable software solution (the criteria for &quot;efficient&quot; and &quot;evolvable&quot; vary considerably). The discipline differs from many other technical professions in that programmers, in general, do not need to be licensed or pass any standardized (or governmentally regulated) certification tests in order to call themselves &quot;programmers&quot; or even &quot;software engineers.&quot; However, representing oneself as a &quot;Professional Software Engineer&quot; without a license from an accredited institution is illegal in many parts of the world. However, because the discipline covers many areas, which may or may not include critical applications, it is debatable whether licensing is required for the profession as a whole.  In most cases, the discipline is self-governed by the entities which require the programming, and sometimes very strict environments are defined (e.g. United States Air Force use of AdaCore and security clearance).

Another ongoing debate is the extent to which the programming language used in writing computer programs affects the form that the final program takes. This debate is analogous to that surrounding the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis &lt;ref&gt;Kenneth E. Iverson, the originator of the APL programming language, believed that the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis applied to computer languages (without actually mentioning the hypothesis by name).  His Turing award lecture, &quot;Notation as a tool of thought&quot;, was devoted to this theme, arguing that more powerful notations aided thinking about computer algorithms. Iverson K.E.,&quot;[http://elliscave.com/APL_J/tool.pdf Notation as a tool of thought]&quot;, ''Communications of the ACM'', 23: 444-465 (August 1980).&lt;/ref&gt; in linguistics, which postulates that a particular spoken language's nature influences the habitual thought of its speakers. Different language patterns yield different patterns of thought. This idea challenges the possibility of representing the world perfectly with language, because it acknowledges that the mechanisms of any language condition the thoughts of its speaker community.

One system employed in these devices was the use of pegs and cams placed into a wooden drum at specific locations. which would sequentially trigger levers that in turn operated percussion instruments. The output of this device was a small drummer playing various rhythms and drum patterns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shef.ac.uk/marcoms/eview/articles58/robot.html A 13th Century Programmable Robot], University of Sheffield&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Museum of Music: A History of Mechanical Instruments|first=Charles B.|last=Fowler|journal=Music Educators Journal|volume=54|issue=2|date=October 1967|pages=45–49|doi=10.2307/3391092|url=http://jstor.org/stable/3391092|publisher=Music Educators Journal, Vol. 54, No. 2|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jacquard Loom, which Joseph Marie Jacquard developed in 1801, uses a series of pasteboard cards with holes punched in them. The hole pattern represented the pattern that the loom had to follow in weaving cloth. The loom could produce entirely different weaves using different sets of cards. Charles Babbage adopted the use of punched cards around 1830 to control his Analytical Engine. The synthesis of numerical calculation, predetermined operation and output, along with a way to organize and input instructions in a manner relatively easy for humans to conceive and produce, led to the modern development of computer programming. Development of computer programming accelerated through the Industrial Revolution.

In the late 1880s, Herman Hollerith invented the recording of data on a medium that could then be read by a machine.  Prior uses of machine readable media, above, had been for control, not data.  &quot;After some initial trials with paper tape, he settled on punched cards...&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/acis/history/hollerith.html |title=Columbia University Computing History - Herman Hollerith |publisher=Columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To process these punched cards, first known as &quot;Hollerith cards&quot; he invented the tabulator, and the keypunch machines. These three inventions were the foundation of the modern information processing industry.  In 1896 he founded the ''Tabulating Machine Company'' (which later became the core of IBM). The addition of a control panel (plugboard) to his 1906 Type I Tabulator allowed it to do different jobs without having to be physically rebuilt. By the late 1940s, there were a variety of plug-board programmable machines, called unit record equipment, to perform data-processing tasks (card reading). Early computer programmers used plug-boards for the variety of complex calculations requested of the newly invented machines.
[[Image:PunchCardDecks.agr.jpg|thumb|left|Data and instructions could be stored on external punched cards, which were kept in order and arranged in program decks.]]

The invention of the von Neumann architecture allowed computer programs to be stored in computer memory. Early programs had to be painstakingly crafted using the instructions (elementary operations) of the particular machine, often in binary notation. Every model of computer would likely use different instructions (machine language) to do the same task. Later, assembly languages were developed that let the programmer specify each instruction in a text format, entering abbreviations for each operation code instead of a number and specifying addresses in symbolic form (e.g., ADD X, TOTAL). Entering a program in assembly language is usually more convenient, faster, and less prone to human error than using machine language, but because an assembly language is little more than a different notation for a machine language, any two machines with different instruction sets also have different assembly languages.

In 1954, FORTRAN was invented; it was the first high level programming language to have a functional implementation, as opposed to just a design on paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=12:10 p.m. ET |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17704662/ |title=Fortran creator John Backus dies - Tech and gadgets- msnbc.com |publisher=MSNBC |date=2007-03-20 |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.grin.edu/~rebelsky/Courses/CS302/99S/Outlines/outline.02.html |title=CSC-302 99S : Class 02: A Brief History of Programming Languages |publisher=Math.grin.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; (A high-level language is, in very general terms, any programming language that allows the programmer to write programs in terms that are more abstract than assembly language instructions, i.e. at a level of abstraction &quot;higher&quot; than that of an assembly language.)  It allowed programmers to specify calculations by entering a formula directly (e.g. {{nowrap|Y &amp;#0061; X*2 + 5*X + 9}}). The program text, or ''source'', is converted into machine instructions using a special program called a compiler, which translates the FORTRAN program into machine language.  In fact, the name FORTRAN stands for &quot;Formula Translation&quot;.  Many other languages were developed, including some for commercial programming, such as COBOL. Programs were mostly still entered using punched cards or paper tape. (See computer programming in the punch card era). By the late 1960s, data storage devices and computer terminals became inexpensive enough that programs could be created by typing directly into the computers. Text editors were developed that allowed changes and corrections to be made much more easily than with punched cards. (Usually, an error in punching a card meant that the card had to be discarded and a new one punched to replace it.)

As time has progressed, computers have made giant leaps in the area of processing power. This has brought about newer programming languages that are more abstracted from the underlying hardware. Although these high-level languages usually incur greater overhead, the increase in speed of modern computers has made the use of these languages much more practical than in the past. These increasingly abstracted languages typically are easier to learn and allow the programmer to develop applications much more efficiently and with less source code. However, high-level languages are still impractical for a few programs, such as those where low-level hardware control is necessary or where maximum processing speed is vital.

Throughout the second half of the twentieth century, programming was an attractive career in most developed countries. Some forms of programming have been increasingly subject to offshore outsourcing (importing software and services from other countries, usually at a lower wage), making programming career decisions in developed countries more complicated, while increasing economic opportunities in less developed areas. It is unclear how far this trend will continue and how deeply it will impact programmer wages and opportunities. {{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}

==Modern programming==
===Quality requirements===
Whatever the approach to software development may be, the final program must satisfy some fundamental properties. The following properties are among the most relevant:
*'''Efficiency'''/'''performance''': the amount of system resources a program consumes (processor time, memory space, slow devices such as disks, network bandwidth and to some extent even user interaction): the less, the better. This also includes correct disposal of some resources, such as cleaning up temporary files and lack of memory leaks.
*'''Reliability''': how often the results of a program are correct. This depends on conceptual correctness of algorithms, and minimization of programming mistakes, such as mistakes in resource management (e.g., buffer overflows and race conditions) and logic errors (such as division by zero or off-by-one errors).
*'''Robustness''': how well a program anticipates problems not due to programmer error. This includes situations such as incorrect, inappropriate or corrupt data, unavailability of needed resources such as memory, operating system services and network connections, and user error.
*'''Usability''': the ergonomics of a program: the ease with which a person can use the program for its intended purpose, or in some cases even unanticipated purposes. Such issues can make or break its success even regardless of other issues. This involves a wide range of textual, graphical and sometimes hardware elements that improve the clarity, intuitiveness, cohesiveness and completeness of a program's user interface.
*'''Portability''': the range of computer hardware and operating system platforms on which the source code of a program can be compiled/interpreted and run. This depends on differences in the programming facilities provided by the different platforms, including hardware and operating system resources, expected behaviour of the hardware and operating system, and availability of platform specific compilers (and sometimes libraries) for the language of the source code
*'''Maintainability''': the ease with which a program can be modified by its present or future developers in order to make improvements or customizations, fix bugs and security holes, or adapt it to new environments. Good practices during initial development make the difference in this regard. This quality may not be directly apparent to the end user but it can significantly affect the fate of a program over the long term.

===Algorithmic complexity===
The academic field and the engineering practice of computer programming are both largely concerned with discovering and implementing the most efficient algorithms for a given class of problem. For this purpose, algorithms are classified into ''orders'' using so-called Big O notation, ''O(n)'', which expresses resource use, such as execution time or memory consumption, in terms of the size of an input. Expert programmers are familiar with a variety of well-established algorithms and their respective complexities and use this knowledge to choose algorithms that are best suited to the circumstances.

===Methodologies===
The first step in most formal software development projects is requirements analysis, followed by testing to determine value modeling, implementation, and failure elimination (debugging).
There exist a lot of differing approaches for each of those tasks. One approach popular for requirements analysis is Use Case analysis. Nowadays many programmers use forms of Agile software development where the various stages of formal software development are more integrated together into short cycles that take a few weeks rather than years. There are many approaches to the Software development process

Popular modeling techniques include Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) and Model-Driven Architecture (MDA). The Unified Modeling Language (UML) is a notation used for both the OOAD and MDA.

A similar technique used for database design is Entity-Relationship Modeling (ER Modeling).

Implementation techniques include imperative languages (object-oriented or procedural), functional languages, and logic languages.

===Measuring language usage===
It is very difficult to determine what are the most popular of modern programming languages. Some languages are very popular for particular kinds of applications (e.g., COBOL is still strong in the corporate data center, often on large mainframes, FORTRAN in engineering applications, scripting languages in web development, and C in embedded applications), while some languages are regularly used to write many different kinds of applications.

Methods of measuring programming language popularity include: counting the number of job advertisements that mention the language,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerweekly.com/Articles/2007/09/11/226631/sslcomputer-weekly-it-salary-survey-finance-boom-drives-it-job.htm Survey of Job advertisements mentioning a given language]&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; the number of books teaching the language that are sold (this overestimates the importance of newer languages), and estimates of the number of existing lines of code written in the language (this underestimates the number of users of business languages such as COBOL).

===Debugging===
[[Image:H96566k.jpg|thumbnail|250px|A bug, which was debugged in 1947.]]
Debugging is a very important task in the software development process, because an incorrect program can have significant consequences for its users. Some languages are more prone to some kinds of faults because their specification does not require compilers to perform as much checking as other languages. Use of a static analysis tool can help detect some possible problems.

Debugging is often done with IDEs like Eclipse, Kdevelop, NetBeans, and Visual Studio. Standalone debuggers like gdb are also used, and these often provide less of a visual environment, usually using a command line.

==Programming languages==
Different programming languages support different styles of programming (called ''programming paradigms''). The choice of language used is subject to many considerations, such as company policy, suitability to task, availability of third-party packages, or individual preference. Ideally, the programming language best suited for the task at hand will be selected. Trade-offs from this ideal involve finding enough programmers who know the language to build a team, the availability of compilers for that language, and the efficiency with which programs written in a given language execute. Languages form an approximate spectrum from &quot;low-level&quot; to &quot;high-level&quot;; &quot;low-level&quot; languages are typically more machine-oriented and faster to execute, whereas &quot;high-level&quot; languages are more abstract and easier to use but execute less quickly.

Allen Downey, in his book ''How To Think Like A Computer Scientist'', writes:

:The details look different in different languages, but a few basic instructions appear in just about every language:
:*'''input''': Get data from the keyboard, a file, or some other device.
:*'''output''': Display data on the screen or send data to a file or other device.
:*'''arithmetic''': Perform basic arithmetical operations like addition and multiplication.
:*'''conditional execution''': Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate sequence of statements.
:*'''repetition''': Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.

Many computer languages provide a mechanism to call functions provided by libraries. Provided the functions in a library follow the appropriate run time conventions (e.g., method of passing arguments), then these functions may be written in any other language.

==Programmers==
Computer programmers are those who write computer software. Their jobs usually involve:
*Coding
*Compilation
*Debugging
*Documentation
*Integration
*Maintenance
*Requirements analysis
*Software architecture
*Software testing
*Specification

==Why Lego?==
Legos have become a popular robotics resource, primarily as an educational tool, but also as building materials for fast and easy prototyping.  Legos are specifically designed for ease of use, with snap together parts and pre-placed holes.  This makes them ideally suited for use in projects where reconfiguration is necessary.  With a basic kit of parts, many different robotic machines and mechanisms can be created, tested, modified, disassembled and recreated easily without any damage to the building materials.  The pieces are also standardized, so designs can be easily documented and rebuilt.  Because of the popularity of Legos, there is also a huge wealth of third party resources available – hardware, software, instructional material, and challenges.

==History==
The origins of the [[w:Lego_Mindstorms|Lego Mindstorms]] Robotics kits trace back to [[w:Seymour_Papert|Seymour Papert’s]] book ''Mindstorms: Children, Computers, and Powerful Ideas'', in which Papert proposed that rather than using computers to provide exercises for children – “the computer programming the child”, the situation should be reversed and the child given control – “the child programs the computer”.  Papert thought that in this way, the child would gain a more active role in building his own knowledge in response to a recognizable personal purpose rather than simply listening to explanations. After co-founding the MIT Artificial Intelligence Lab, Papert developed the programming language “[[w:Logo_(programming_language)|Logo]]” as a tool to enable children to use simple instructions to control robotic ‘turtles’.

In the mid-1980’s, while working at the MIT Media Lab, Mitchel Resnick and Steve Ocko created a control box to interface Logo with Lego Technic elements along with motors lights and sensors.  This setup was marketed as “LEGO TC Logo” and became a popular educational tool and marked the beginning of a partnership between Lego and the MIT Logo researchers.  A second version was released in 1993 as the “Control Lab”&lt;ref&gt;Education and Technology: An Encyclopedia, By Ann Kovalchick, Kara Dawson, 2004, pgs 421-426
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the mid-1990’s, MIT Media Lab researcher Fred Martin developed the MIT programmable brick.  This brick was programmed using a Logo based software but was not required to be connected to the computer with wires and so was able to be more mobile.  This design was the basis for the Lego RCX brick, released in 1998.   The Lego RCX was the first of the Lego Mindstorms products, which are named after the Papert book.  Mindstorms robotics kits quickly became an extremely popular educational resource, being used for robotics classes and competitions around the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://el.media.mit.edu/logo-foundation/pubs/logoupdate/v7n1/v7n1-pbrick.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the NXT became the successor to the RCX.  The NXT has an extra sensor port and Bluetooth communication and the basic kit adds an ultrasonic sensor as well as built-in rotation sensors on all the motors.

==Standard Components==
{{Wikipedia|Lego_Mindstorms}}
The RCX kits come with the following standard components as well as a variety of building pieces:
*2 Motors
*1 Light Sensor
*2 Lamps
*Built in IR Communication
The following Lego accessories are available for the RCX:
*Rotation Sensor
*Temperature Sensor
*Sound Sensor

The NXT kits come with the following standard components as well as a variety of building pieces:
*3 Servo Motors (with built-in rotation sensors)
*1 Light Sensor
*1 Touch Sensor
*1 Ultrasonic Sensor
*1 Sound Sensor
*Built in Bluetooth Communication
The NXT kit also comes with adaptors that allow any of the RCX components to be used with the NXT.

==Programming Options==
There are many options available for programming the Mindstorms bricks.  The standard NXT kits may be purchased with either the NXT-G or Robolab programming software.  Both are LabVIEW based visual programming languages – Robolab allows more advanced programming, and NXT-G is a bit more beginner-friendly.  There are also many other programming languages available.

===NXT-G===
NXT-G (Windows, Mac)
*Pros
**Easy to quickly create simple programs
**Programming flow is easy to see
**Included in standard kit
*Cons
**Somewhat limited capabilities
**Integers only – floating point numbers not supported
**Each basic math operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) requires a separate block
**Comparatively slow execution speeds
**High memory usage.

===Robolab===
Robolab (Windows, Mac)
*Pros
**Fairly easy to use
**Fairly advanced programming possible
**Very similar to LabVIEW environment
**Included in standard educational kit
*Cons
**Block connections can become confusing
**No good method for creating block set functions for reuse

===RobotC===
[http://www.robotc.net RobotC](Windows)
*Pros
**Fast execution
**Advanced programming
*Cons
**Text based language is harder for beginners

== Introduction to Rural Hall Elementary School ==
Rural Hall Elementary School is a school serving children in Kindergarten through fifth grade located in Rural Hall, North Carolina, a small town about 12 miles away from Winston-Salem, NC (http://maps.google.com/maps?hl=en&amp;um=1&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=rural+hall+elementary&amp;fb=1&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=local_group&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=image).  There are approximately 570 students and 61 teachers at the school, giving the school a 1:9 teacher-student ratio (http://www.publicschoolreview.com/school_ov/school_id/59377).  65% of the students are Caucasian, 28% of the students are African-American, 7% are Latino, and 1% are Asian (http://www.publicschoolreview.com/school_ov/school_id/59377).  Of the entire student population, 32% are eligible for free lunch and 9% are eligible for reduced lunch (http://www.publicschoolreview.com/school_ov/school_id/59377).
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

== School Theme: Communications with Distance Learning ==
Rural Hall Elementary School’s mission is: “Educators, parents, and community will provide the optimum educational experiences to all children by focusing on maximum time for quality teaching and learning while developing lifelong learners and citizens of good character” (http://winstonsalem.nc.schoolwebpages.com/education/school/school.php?sectionid=110&amp;sc_id=1182882870).  Rural Hall has adopted the school-wide theme of “communications with distance learning” as the primary means by which to achieve their mission.  “Telecommunications is bringing sharp changes to the educational world by electronically bringing into immediate contact many of those in education who were formerly isolated from each other by sheer geographical separation” (Taylor, 1991, p. 1), which makes implementation of a distance learning program particularly relevant and beneficial for students in small towns such as Rural Hall.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The “communications with distance learning” project began when Rural Hall was awarded $10,000 of “‘theme’ money” from the Forsyth County school system to implement an idea developed by the school that would supplement and enhance the school’s curriculum (McDermon, 2005, p. 2).  The school used this money to purchase a Polycom Viewstation FX, which was put together with two large televisions and the school’s T-1 fiber optic line in order to conduct “IP-based video conferencing using H.323 technology” (McDermon, 2005, p. 1).
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Although videoconferencing is central to Rural Hall’s “communications with distance learning” theme, distance learning has been meaningfully implemented across academic and extra-curricular disciplines through a wide variety of mediums, including many free or inexpensive technology platforms.  
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

== “Ten Ways to Boost Learning with Technology” ==
The State Educational Technology Directors Association (SETDA) recently released ten recommendations to support and enhance education through technology (Stansbury, 2008, p. 1).  These recommendations are: 
# Ensure that technology tools and resources are used continuously and seamlessly for instruction, collaboration, and assessment.
# Expose all students (pre-K through 12th grade) to STEM [science, technology, engineering, and mathematics] fields and careers.
# Make ongoing, sustainable professional development available to all teachers.
# Use virtual learning opportunities for teachers to further their professional development, such as through online communities and education portals.
# Incorporate innovative, consistent, and timely assessments into daily instruction.
# Strengthen the home-school connection by using technology to communicate with parents on student progress.
# Provide the necessary resources so that every community has the infrastructure to support learning with technology, including assessments and virtual learning.
# Obtain societal support for education that uses technology from all stakeholders--students, parents, teachers, state and district administrators, business leaders, legislators, and local community members.
# Provide federal leadership to support states and districts regarding technology's role in school reform by passing the ATTAIN Act.
# Increase available funding for the e-Rate so that schools can acquire telecommunication services, internet access, internal connections, and maintenance of those connections.
(Stansbury, 2008, p. 1)
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Some of the mediums utilized by Rural Hall to incorporate technology throughout the school community and curriculum in order to boost instruction and learning outcomes include: 
*	School Web Site
*	Classroom Web Pages
*	PBWiki
*	YouTube and TeacherTube
*	Videoconferencing

*	Links to related Wikis
&lt;br /&gt;

==YouTube and TeacherTube==
YouTube and TeacherTube are utilized throughout Rural Hall to host videos that fall into two broad categories: class/student-produced videos and technology how-to videos.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Class/student produced videos (http://ruralhallschool.pbwiki.com/Student+and+Classroom+Videos)&lt;br /&gt;
Topics include:
**	Electing the United States President
**	Fractions
**	Patterns
**	Historic figures
&lt;br /&gt;
Technology how-to videos (http://ruralhallschool.pbwiki.com/Technology+Movies--how+to)
&lt;br /&gt;Topics include:
**	Blogs
**	Excel
**	Google docs
**	Online photosharing
**	Phishing scams
**	Social networking
**	Social bookmarking
**	Twitter
**	Web search strategies
**	Wiki 
**	Video RSS feeds
Telecommunication allows teachers to “communicate with colleagues in schools around the country or even the world, soliciting help and sharing insights on vital topics in which none of their physically immediate fellow teachers are either interested or expert” (Taylor, 1991, p. 1).  Including links to technology how-to videos is especially important for supporting teachers as they learn new forms of technology and strive to implement these new forms of technology in their classrooms in meaningful, efficient ways.  
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

==Videoconferencing==
In the Rural Hall Elementary School &quot;Distance Learning Blog,&quot; a teacher wrote:
“Our K-5 public school does IP videoconferencing. This is a unique opportunity for our students to take a trip to a museum 100 miles away in a few seconds. Once there, they spend time with a scientist or other instructional expert and ask questions while discovering answers for themselves with materials and manipulatives sent to our school. Then they return to their classroom to continue with their school day. This saves time, money, and offers exceptional instruction to students.” (http://rhes_distance_learning.blogspot.com/)
Rural Hall’s interactive videoconference schedule includes virtual field trips with the following organizations:
*	International Wolf Center  
*	NASA Digital Learning Network 
*	NC Museum of History 
*	NC Museum of Natural Sciences 
*	NC School of Science &amp; Mathematics (NCSSM)
*	NC Wildlife Resources Distance Learning   
*	Projects - Megaconference Jr., Read Around the Planet
*	Sea Trek 
*	Smithsonian American Art Museum
Utilizing videoconferencing to take students on virtual fieldtrips and interact with scientists and other experts gives students broadened experiences and understanding of curriculum content, experiences that they likely would not get otherwise while living in a small town such as Rural Hall.  &quot;Excellent material substance and appropriate topical focus is often enhanced through presentation by a world-class expert, incorporating insights and presentational gifts rarely encountered by most students, even in the best of schools&quot; (Taylor, 1991, p. 3).
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

==Podcasts==
The types of podcasts produced by students and teachers at Rural Hall include: 
*	Regular child-produced news broadcasts
*	Visiting experts
*	Speeches from student council candidate speeches
*	Student research and presentations
*	Student-produced poetry performances
*	School song
(http://web.mac.com/mcdermon1/Site/RHES/RHES.html)
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

==Blogging==
Blogging is utilized by both teachers and students at Rural Hall Elementary School.  Students typically blog about information they have learned through their videoconference virtual field trips.  For example, students blogged about information they learned through a research project on Belize, a collaboration between Rural Hall Elementary School, North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences, and the Educators of Excellence Fund (http://belizetrek.blogspot.com/).
Blogging is also used by teachers to share their experiences with the use of technology in the classroom.  One teacher wrote: “Just like our students, we need to keep learning new things/skills; besides keeping us updated, it continues to remind us how puzzling, confusing, and frustrating students can feel when approaching new material. It keeps us honest as we work with students understanding a new concept” (http://techquest4teachers.blogspot.com/).
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

==Conclusion==
Overall, Rural Hall Elementary School provides an excellent example of successful implementation of distance learning at the elementary school level.  Technology coordinators can use Rural Hall as a model when designing their own distance learning program.  Although the project started with a large grant from the county school system, much of the technology implemented for the school’s distance learning theme is available at low or no cost to the general public.  In addition, all forms of technology utilized by Rural Hall are both child and teacher friendly, and the school has provided an abundance of information and resources to teachers as they embark upon their journey to implement technology across all subjects and grade levels.  
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
A suggestion for improved implementation of the “communication with distance learning” theme is to streamline and condense some of the information and technologies utilized in the program.  Many of the same links, resources, and content are available in multiple places (such as on the school website, the PBWiki, and in blogs).  Almost all pages created by the school are easy to navigate; however, the plethora of sites and links available, combined with the multiple postings of certain content, can sometimes make navigation difficult.  Condensing pages and streamlining the technology used may help to make Rural Hall’s distance learning project even more successful.
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
With telecommunications, “students can now regularly communicate electronically with other students, other teachers, and even various experts, all in far away places, enlarging their interpretation of both their studies and the world at large by a far broader set of perspectives on both than traditional classroom alone could ever provide.” (Taylor, 1991, p. 1).  Through the communications with distance learning project, Rural Hall Elementary School has successfully implemented a comprehensive technology program that is integrated throughout all subject areas and grade-levels, enriching the experiences and broadening the worldview of its students.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Problem 1 ==


{| WIDTH=&quot;80%&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFEE; border: solid 1px #FFC92E; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |
Let &lt;math&gt; A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n }, b \in \mathbb{R}^m, \!\, &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; p \in \mathbb{R}^n&lt;/math&gt;, with &lt;math&gt; m&gt;n \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt; \delta \!\,&lt;/math&gt; be a scalar.  Show how the constrained least squares problem,


:&lt;math&gt; \mbox{minimize } \|b-Ax\|_2 \quad \quad \mbox{ subject to } p^Tx=\delta &lt;/math&gt;


can be reduced to solving a related unconstrained least squares problem.  The algorithm should start by finding a Householder transformation &lt;math&gt;H \!\,&lt;/math&gt; such that

:&lt;math&gt; Hp=\|p\|_2 e_1 &lt;/math&gt;


and setting

:&lt;math&gt; y=Hx \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

|}

== Solution 1 ==
Since &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Householder_transformation Householder Matrices]&lt;/span&gt; are orthogonal and hermitian (i.e. symmetric if the matrix is real), we have


&lt;math&gt;y = Hx \Rightarrow x = H^Ty = Hy&lt;/math&gt;


Then the constraint can be written


&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
p^Tx             &amp;= \delta \\
p^T(H^Ty)        &amp;= \delta \\
(Hp)^Ty          &amp;= \delta \\
(\|p\|_2e_1)^Ty  &amp;= \delta \\
\|p\|_2e_1^Ty    &amp;= \delta \\
y_1              &amp;= \frac{\delta}{\|p\|_2}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;


Hence, the first entry of the column vector &lt;math&gt;y \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y_1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;(a scalar), represents our constraint.


Now we want to show that we can write &lt;math&gt; \|Ax-b\|_2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; as a related unconstrained problem.  Substituting for &lt;math&gt;x\!\,&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;Ax\!\,&lt;/math&gt; we get,


&lt;math&gt;Ax = AHy\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Let &lt;math&gt; AH = B = \begin{bmatrix}B_1 &amp; \hat{B}\end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; B_1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is the first column of &lt;math&gt; B \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\hat{B}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; are the remaining columns.

Since,


:&lt;math&gt; y = \begin{bmatrix}y_1 \\ \hat{y}\end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;


block matrix multiplication yields,


&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
AHy   &amp;=By \\ 
      &amp;=\begin{bmatrix}B_1 &amp; \hat{B}\end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix}y_1 \\ \hat{y}\end{bmatrix} \\
      &amp;= y_1B_1 + \hat{B}\hat{y} 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;


So   &lt;math&gt;\min_y \|b - AHy\|_2 = \min_{\hat{y}}\|b - y_1B_1 - \hat{B}\hat{y}\|_2&lt;/math&gt; , which is unconstrained.

== Solution 2a ==
Substituting into this equation the pairs &lt;math&gt;x_i,\,y_i,\; i=1,2,3,\, &lt;/math&gt; gives rise to the following matrix equation:


:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}

&lt;/math&gt;


Where A is the &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vandermonde_matrix Vandermonde matrix]&lt;/span&gt;, which is know to be non-singular. This proves existence and uniqueness of the coefficients &lt;math&gt;c_1,\, c_2,\, c_3 &lt;/math&gt;.

Now, substituting the pairs &lt;math&gt;x_i,\,y_i,\; i=1,2,3,\, &lt;/math&gt; gives:

Consider the unique set of points &lt;math&gt;x_1=1,\ x_2=-1,\ x_3=0.\ &lt;/math&gt;

The system reduces to

Let &lt;math&gt;\!\,Q&lt;/math&gt; be some other '''symmetric'''&lt;ref&gt;Omitted on the actual exam. This made the problem ambiguous and the word symmetric should have been included.

In light of this fact, CG can be used to solve the system &lt;math&gt;Q^{-1}Ax=Q^{-1}b\,\!&lt;/math&gt; in an appropriate manner. Specify this algorithm and identify any extra costs required that would not be present with &lt;math&gt;Q=I\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

 Choose &lt;math&gt;\!\,x_0&lt;/math&gt;

One additional cost is computing &lt;math&gt;Q^{-1}\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.  

Another one-time cost is multiplying &lt;math&gt;Q^{-1}A\,\!&lt;/math&gt; which has cost &lt;math&gt;n^3\,\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q^{-1}b\,\!&lt;/math&gt; which has cost &lt;math&gt;n^2\,\!&lt;/math&gt;.

Use any facts you know about the conjugate gradient method to identify properties of &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; that would be desirable for computing the solution &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; efficiently.

|}

==Solution 3c==
We want &lt;math&gt;Q^{-1}A\!\,&lt;/math&gt; to have eigenvalues whose values are close together. This accelerates convergence.  Furthermore, if there are only &lt;math&gt;k\!\,&lt;/math&gt; distinct eigenvalues, the algorithm will terminate in &lt;math&gt;k\!\,&lt;/math&gt; steps.

Consider the system &lt;math&gt; Ax=b \,\!&lt;/math&gt;. The GMRES method starts with a point &lt;math&gt;\,\! x_0&lt;/math&gt; and normalizes the residual &lt;math&gt;\,\! r_0=b-Ax_0&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;\,\! v_1=\frac{r_0}{\nu}&lt;/math&gt; has 2-norm one.  It then constructs orthonormal Krylov bases &lt;math&gt;\,\! V_k=(v_1 \, v_2 \, \cdots v_m)&lt;/math&gt; satisfying

:&lt;math&gt;\,\! AV_k=V_{k+1} H_k &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\,\! H_k&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;\,\! (k+1)\times k&lt;/math&gt; upper Hessenberg matrix.  One then looks for an approximation to &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle x&lt;/math&gt; of the form 

:&lt;math&gt;\,\! x(c)=x_0+V_k c&lt;/math&gt;

choosing &lt;math&gt;\,\! c_k&lt;/math&gt; so that &lt;math&gt;\,\! \| r(c) \|= \|b-Ax(c)\|&lt;/math&gt; is minimized, where &lt;math&gt;\,\! \| \cdot \|&lt;/math&gt; is the usual Euclidean norm.

Suppose we choose to solve the least squares problem in part a for &lt;math&gt;c_k\!\,&lt;/math&gt; by the method of orthogonal triangularization (QR).  What is the order of the floating point operation for this method. Give reasons.
|}

== Solution 1b ==
We would like to transform &lt;math&gt;H_k\!\,&lt;/math&gt;, a &lt;math&gt;(k+1)\times k\!\,&lt;/math&gt; upper Hessenberg matrix, into QR form. 

The cost is on the order of &lt;math&gt;4k^2+\frac{1}{2}k^2=4.5k^2&lt;/math&gt; from the cost of Given's Rotations and backsolving.

=== Given's Rotations Cost===
We need &lt;math&gt;k\!\,&lt;/math&gt; Given's Rotation multiplies to zero out each of the &lt;math&gt;k\!\,&lt;/math&gt; subdiagonal entries and hence transform &lt;math&gt;H_k\!\,&lt;/math&gt; into upper triangular form &lt;math&gt;R\!\,&lt;/math&gt;,

Each successive Given's Rotations multiply on an upper Hessenberg matrix requires four fewer multiplies because each previous subdiagonal entry has been zeroed out by a Given's Rotation multiply.

Hence the cost of &lt;math&gt;k\!\,&lt;/math&gt; Given's Rotations multiplies is
:&lt;math&gt;
4k+4(k-1)+\ldots+4\cdot 1 &lt; 4k \cdot k = 4k^2 
&lt;/math&gt;

===Back Solving Cost===
&lt;math&gt;R \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;(k+1)\times k\!\,&lt;/math&gt; upper triangular matrix with last row zero.  Hence, we need to backsolve &lt;math&gt;k\!\,&lt;/math&gt; upper triangular rows.

:&lt;math&gt;1+2+\ldots+k=\frac{k(k+1)}{2}= \frac{k^2}{2}+\frac{k}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

{b-a}{n}\!\,&lt;/math&gt;, and give a formula for the error &lt;math&gt;I(f)-Q_{T,n}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; that is in a form suitable for extrapolation.

|}

== Solution 2a ==

The composite trapezoidal rule is

:&lt;math&gt; Q_{T,n}(f)=\frac{h}{2}(f(a)+f(b))+h \sum_{k=1}^{n-1} f(x_k) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

The error is 

:&lt;math&gt; I(f)-Q_{T,n}(f)=-\frac{(b-a)f^{\prime\prime}(\xi)}{12}h^2 &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \xi \in [a,b] \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

===Derivation of Composite Trapezoidal Error ===

The local error, the error on one interval, is 
:&lt;math&gt; -\frac{h^3}{12}f^{\prime\prime}(\eta) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Observe that 

:&lt;math&gt; n \min_{ \eta \in [a,b]} f^{\prime \prime} (\eta_i) \leq \sum_{i=1}^n f^{\prime\prime}(\eta_i) \leq n \max_{\eta \in [a,b]} f^{\prime \prime} (\eta_i) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

which implies

:&lt;math&gt; \min_{ \eta \in [a,b]} f^{\prime \prime} (\eta_i) \leq \sum_{i=1}^n \frac{f^{\prime\prime}(\eta_i)}{n} \leq \max_{\eta \in [a,b]} f^{\prime \prime} (\eta_i) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

Hence, the Intermediate Value Theorem implies there exists a &lt;math&gt; \xi \in [a,b]\!\,&lt;/math&gt; such that
:&lt;math&gt; f^{\prime\prime}(\xi)=\sum_{i=1}^n \frac{f^{\prime\prime}(\eta_i)}{n} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Multiplying both sides of the equation by &lt;math&gt;n \!\,&lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt; n f^{\prime\prime}(\xi)=\sum_{i=1}^n f^{\prime\prime}(\eta_i) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

Using this relationship, we have

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
I(f)-Q_{T,n}(f)	&amp;= \sum_{i=1}^n I_i(f)-Q_i(f) \\
	&amp;= \sum_{i=1}^n \left[-\frac{h^3}{12}f^{\prime \prime}(\eta_i) \right] \\
 	&amp;= -\frac{h^3}{12} f^{\prime \prime}(\xi) n \\
	&amp;= -\frac{h^3}{12} f^{\prime \prime}(\xi) (\frac{b-a}{h}) \\
	&amp;= -\frac{h^2}{12} f^{\prime \prime}(\xi) (b-a) 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Derivation of Local Error===

The error in polynomial interpolation can be found by using the following theorem:

  Assume &lt;math&gt;f^{n+1}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; exists on &lt;math&gt;[a,b]\!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_n | x \in [a,b] \}.  \!\,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;P_n\!\,&lt;/math&gt; interpolates &lt;math&gt;f\!\,&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt;\{x_j\}_{j=0}^n\!\,&lt;/math&gt;.  
  Then there is a &lt;math&gt;\xi_x\!\,&lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt;\xi\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is dependent on &lt;math&gt;x\!\,&lt;/math&gt;) such that 
  
  &lt;math&gt; f(x)-p_n(x)= \frac{(x-x_0)(x-x_1)...(x-x_n)}{(n+1)!}f^{(n+1)}(\xi_x) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;
  
  where &lt;math&gt;\xi_x\!\,&lt;/math&gt; lies in &lt;math&gt;(m,M)\!\,&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;m=\min\{x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_n,X\}\!\,&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;M=\max\{x_0,x_1,\ldots,x_n,X\}\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

Applying the theorem yields,

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)-p_1(x) =(x-a)(x-b)\frac{f^{\prime\prime}(\xi_x)}{2} &lt;/math&gt;

Hence,

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
E(f)   &amp;= \int_a^b f(x)-p_1(x)dx \\
       &amp;= \int_a^b\underbrace{\underbrace{(x-a)}_{&gt;0}\underbrace{(x-b)}_{&lt;0}}_{w(x)}\frac{f^{\prime\prime}(\xi_x)}{2}dx
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;


Since &lt;math&gt;a\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is the start of the interval, &lt;math&gt; x-a \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is always positive.  Conversely, since &lt;math&gt;b\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is the end of the interval, &lt;math&gt; x-b \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is always negative.  Hence, &lt;math&gt; w(x) &lt; 0\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is always of one sign. Hence from the &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mean_value_theorem#Mean_value_theorems_for_integration mean value theorem of integration]&lt;/span&gt;, there exists a &lt;math&gt; \zeta \in [a,b] \!\, &lt;/math&gt; such that


:&lt;math&gt; E(f)= \frac{f^{\prime \prime}(\zeta)}{2}\int_a^b (x-a)(x-b) dx \!\, &lt;/math&gt;


Note that &lt;math&gt; f^{\prime \prime}(\zeta) &lt;/math&gt; is a constant and does not depend on &lt;math&gt; x \!\, &lt;/math&gt;.

Integrating &lt;math&gt;\int_a^b (x-a)(x-b) dx \!\, &lt;/math&gt;, yields,


&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
  E(f) &amp;= \frac{f^{\prime \prime}(\zeta)}{2}\left(-\frac{(b-a)}{6}\right) \\
       &amp;= -\frac{f^{\prime \prime}(\zeta)(b-a)}{12}\!\, 
\end{align}

Use the error formula to derive a new quadrature rule obtained by performing one step of extrapolation on the composite trapezoidal rule. What is this rule, and how does its error depend on &lt;math&gt;h\!\,&lt;/math&gt;? You may assume here that &lt;math&gt;f\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is as smooth as you need it to be.

INTRODUCTION TO APPLIED NUMERICAL ANALYSIS by RICHARD HAMMING pg 178

The error for the composite trapezoidal rule at &lt;math&gt;n\!\,&lt;/math&gt; points in &lt;math&gt;[a,b]\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is


&lt;math&gt;E_{n} = I(f) - Q_{T,n} = \frac{-(b-a)h^2}{12} + \mathcal{O}(h^3)\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


With &lt;math&gt;2n\!\,&lt;/math&gt; points, there are twice as many intervals, but the intervals are half as wide.  Hence, the error for the composite trapezoidal rule at &lt;math&gt;2n\!\,&lt;/math&gt; points in &lt;math&gt;[a,b]\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is 


&lt;math&gt;E_{2n} = I(f) - Q_{T,2n} = 2\cdot\frac{-(b-a)(\frac{h}{2})^2}{12} + \mathcal{O}(h^3) = \frac{-(b-a)h^2}{24} + \mathcal{O}(h^3)\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


We can eliminate the &lt;math&gt;h^2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; term by choosing using an appropriate linear combination of &lt;math&gt;E_n\!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_{2n}\!\,&lt;/math&gt;. This gives a new error rule with &lt;math&gt;h^3 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;error.



&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}

E_{n} - 2E_{2n} &amp;= \frac{-(b-a)h^2}{12} - 2\cdot\frac{-(b-a)h^2}{24} + \mathcal{O}(h^3) \\
&amp;= \mathcal{O}(h^3)

\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;


Substituting our equations for &lt;math&gt;E_n\!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_{2n}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; on the left had side gives


&lt;math&gt;I(f) - Q_{T,n} - 2I(f) - 2Q_{T,2n} = \mathcal{O}(h^3)\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;I(f) = 2Q_{T,2n} - Q_{T,n} + \mathcal{O}(h^3)\!\,&lt;/math&gt;




If we call our new rule &lt;math&gt;\hat{Q}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; we have


&lt;math&gt;\hat{Q} = 2Q_{T,2n} - Q_{T,n}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; whose error is on the order of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(h^3)\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

specify the orthogonal matrix &lt;math&gt;Q_k \!\,&lt;/math&gt; used to perform this step when Givens rotations are used.  The matrix should be described in terms of the entries of the shifted matrix.

|}

==Solution 3a==

Let &lt;math&gt;\tilde{A}_k \!\,&lt;/math&gt; be the &lt;math&gt;\sigma_k \!\,&lt;/math&gt;-shifted matrix of &lt;math&gt;A_k \!\,&lt;/math&gt; i.e.


:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{A}_k=A_k-\sigma_kI= \begin{bmatrix}
  a_{11}-\sigma_k      &amp; a_{12}      \\
  a_{21}      &amp; a_{22}-\sigma_k      
\end{bmatrix},
&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;Q_k^T \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is an orthogonal 2x2 Given's rotations matrix. &lt;math&gt;Q_k^T  \!\,&lt;/math&gt;'s entries are chosen such that when &lt;math&gt;Q_k^T \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is pre-multiplied against the 2x2 matrix &lt;math&gt;\tilde{A}_k \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Q_k^T\!\,&lt;/math&gt; will zero out the (2,1) entry of &lt;math&gt;\tilde{A}_k \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and scale &lt;math&gt;\tilde{A}_k \!\,&lt;/math&gt;'s remaining three entries i.e. 


:&lt;math&gt;Q_k^T \tilde{A}_k= \begin{bmatrix}
  *      &amp;  *      \\
  0      &amp;  *      
\end{bmatrix}=R_k
&lt;/math&gt;


where &lt;math&gt;*\!\,&lt;/math&gt; denotes calculable scalar values we are not interested in and &lt;math&gt; R_k \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is our desired upper triangular matrix sought by the QR algorithm.


Since &lt;math&gt;Q_k^T \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is orthogonal, the above equation implies


&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
Q_k^T \tilde{A}_k &amp;=R_k \\
Q_kQ_k^T \tilde{A}_k &amp;= Q_kR_k \\
\tilde{A}_k &amp;=Q_kR_k
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;


The Given's rotation &lt;math&gt;Q_k^T\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is given by


:&lt;math&gt; Q_k^T =\begin{bmatrix}
  c &amp; s \\
  -s &amp; c 
\end{bmatrix} 
&lt;/math&gt;


where


&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
c   &amp;=  \frac{a_{11}-\sigma_k}{r} \\
s   &amp;=  \frac{a_{21}}{r} \\
r   &amp;=  \sqrt{(a_{11}-\sigma_k)^2+a_{21}^2}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;


Taking the transpose of &lt;math&gt;Q_k^T\!\,&lt;/math&gt; yields 


:&lt;math&gt; Q_k =\begin{bmatrix}
  c &amp; -s \\
  s &amp; c

What does this suggest about the convergence rate of the QR iteration?

|}

==Solution 3b==
From hypothesis and part (a),


&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
A_{k+1}  &amp;= R_kQ_k+\sigma_kI \\
         &amp;= \begin{bmatrix} 
             * &amp; * \\
             0 &amp; r_{22}
            \end{bmatrix} 
            \begin{bmatrix} 
             c &amp; -s \\
             s &amp; c
            \end{bmatrix} + 
            \begin{bmatrix} 
             \sigma_k &amp; 0 \\
             0        &amp; \sigma_k
            \end{bmatrix}  
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;


Let &lt;math&gt;A_{k+1}(2,1) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; be the (2,1) entry of &lt;math&gt;A_k \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.  Using the above equation, we can find &lt;math&gt;A_{k+1}(2,1) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; by finding the inner product of the second row of &lt;math&gt;R_k \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and first column &lt;math&gt;Q_k \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and adding the (2,1) entry of &lt;math&gt;\sigma_k I \!\,&lt;/math&gt; i.e.


&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
A_{k+1}(2,1) &amp;= (0 \cdot c + r_{22} \cdot s) + 0 \\
             &amp;= r_{22}s
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;


We need to find the value of &lt;math&gt;r_{22} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; so we need to calculate &lt;math&gt; R_k \!\, &lt;/math&gt;.


From hypothesis and the orthogonality of &lt;math&gt;Q_k\!\,&lt;/math&gt;, we have


&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
A_k-\sigma_kI           &amp;=  Q_kR_k\\
Q_k^T(A_k-\sigma_kI)    &amp;=  Q_k^TQ_kR_k\\
Q_k^T(A_k-\sigma_kI)    &amp;=  R_k\\
R_k                     &amp;=Q_k^T(A_k-\sigma_kI)   \\
                        &amp;=\begin{bmatrix}
                        c  &amp;  s \\
                       -s  &amp;  c 
                        \end{bmatrix}
                        \begin{bmatrix}
                        a_{11}-\sigma_k &amp; a_{12} \\
                          \delta        &amp; a_{22}-\sigma_k 
                        \end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;


From &lt;math&gt;R_k \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, we can find its (2,2) entry &lt;math&gt; r_22 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; by using inner products.


:&lt;math&gt; r_{22}=-s \cdot a_{12} + c \cdot (a_{22}-\sigma_k) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Now that we have &lt;math&gt; r_{22} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; we can calculate &lt;math&gt; A_{k+1}(2,1) \!\, &lt;/math&gt; by using appropriate substitutions


&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
A_{k+1}(2,1)   &amp;=  r_{22} \cdot s \\
               &amp;= (-s  a_{12} + c (a_{22}-\sigma_k))s \\
               &amp;= -s^2  a_{12} + cs (a_{22}-\sigma_k) \\
               &amp;= \frac{-\delta^2a_{12}}{(a_{11}-\sigma_k)^2+\delta^2}+\frac{(a_{11}-\sigma_k)(a_{22}-\sigma_k)\delta}{(a_{11}-\sigma_k)^2+\delta^2} \\
               &amp;=\frac{-\delta^2a_{12}+\delta(a_{11}-\sigma_k)(a_{22}-\sigma_k)}{(a_{11}-\sigma_k)^2+\delta^2} \\
               &amp;\approx  \frac{-\delta^2a_{12}+\delta(a_{11}-\sigma_k)(a_{22}-\sigma_k)}{(a_{11}-\sigma_k)^2}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;


since &lt;math&gt;\delta \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is a small number.


Let our shift &lt;math&gt; \sigma_k = a_{22} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.  Then the above equation yields,



&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
A_{k+1}(2,1)  &amp;\approx  \frac{-\delta^2a_{12}+\delta(a_{11}-\sigma_k)(a_{22}-\sigma_k)}{(a_{11}-\sigma_k)^2} \\
              &amp;\approx  \frac{-\delta^2a_{12}+\delta(a_{11}-a_{22})(a_{22}-a_{22})}{(a_{11}-a_{22})^2} \\
              &amp;=\frac{-\delta^2a_{12}}{(a_{11}-a_{22})^2}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;


Hence,


&lt;math&gt; 

\begin{align}
|A_{k+1}(2,1)| &amp;\approx \left|\frac{\delta^2a_{12}}{(a_{11}-a_{22})^2} \right| \\
               &amp;\leq |\delta^2|   
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;    


since &lt;math&gt; |a_{12}| \leq (a_{11}-a_{22})^2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Hence we have shown that &lt;math&gt;A_{k+1}(2,1) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is of order &lt;math&gt; \delta^2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


If &lt;math&gt; \delta \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is small, the QR convergence rate will be quadratic.

Let &lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2,\ldots,x_n&lt;/math&gt; be distinct real numbers, and consider the matrix 

:&lt;math&gt;
V=\left( \begin{array}{ccccc}
1 &amp; x_1 &amp; x_1^2 &amp; \cdots &amp; x_1^{n-1} \\
1 &amp; x_2 &amp; x_2^2 &amp; \cdots &amp; x_2^{n-1} \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
1 &amp; x_n &amp; x_n^2 &amp; \cdots &amp; x_n^{n-1} \\
\end{array}
\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

Prove that &lt;math&gt;V^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; can be expressed as 

:&lt;math&gt;
V^{-1}=\left( \begin{array}{c}
\\
\\
\alpha^{(1)},\alpha^{(2)},\alpha^{(3)},\cdots,\alpha^{(n)} \\
\\
\\
\end{array}
\right)
&lt;/math&gt;

where the column vector &lt;math&gt;\alpha^{(j)}=(\alpha_1^{(j)},\alpha_2^{(j)},\cdots,\alpha_n^{(j)})^T&lt;/math&gt; generates a polynomial 

:&lt;math&gt;
p_j(x)=\sum_{i=1}^n\alpha_i^{(j)}x^{i-1}

satisfying 

:&lt;math&gt;
p_j(x)=\frac{\prod_{i=1,i\neq j}^n(x-x_i)}{\prod_{i=1,i\neq j}^n (x_j-x_i)}
&lt;/math&gt;

You may cite anything you know about polynomial interpolation to justify that &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is nonsingular.

==Solution 1==
We want to show that 


:&lt;math&gt;\,\! VV^{-1} =  I&lt;/math&gt; 


or equivalently the &lt;math&gt;\,\!i&lt;/math&gt;th, &lt;math&gt;\,\!j&lt;/math&gt;th entry of &lt;math&gt;\,\!VV^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\,\! 1&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\,\!i=j&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\,\! 0&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;\,\!i \neq j &lt;/math&gt; i.e.

:&lt;math&gt;
\{VV^{-1}\}_{ij}=\delta_{ij}=\left\{ \begin{array}{cc}
1 &amp; \mbox{ if } i=j \\
0 &amp; \mbox{ if } i\neq j
\end{array}\right.
&lt;/math&gt;

First notice that 

:&lt;math&gt;\,\!
\{VV^{-1}\}_{ij} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 + x_i^1+x_i^2+\cdots+x_i^{n-1} \end{bmatrix} 
\begin{bmatrix} 
\alpha_1^{(j)} \\ 
\alpha_2^{(j)} \\
\vdots \\
\alpha_n^{(j)}
\end{bmatrix}
=\sum_{k=1}^n\alpha_k^{(j)}x_i^{k-1}
&lt;/math&gt;

Also notice that 

:&lt;math&gt;\,\!
p_j(x_i)=\sum_{k=1}^n\alpha_k^{(j)}x_i^{k-1}=\delta_{ij}
&lt;/math&gt;

Hence,

:&lt;math&gt;\,\! 
\{VV^{-1}\}_{ij}=p_j(x_i)=\delta_{ij}

==Solution 2==


===Shifted Inverse Power Method ===

Let

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\tilde{A} &amp;=(A-\sigma I)^{-1} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Then,

:&lt;math&gt;
\tilde{\lambda_i} =\frac{1}{|\lambda_i-\sigma|}  &lt;/math&gt; 

which implies 

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{\lambda_j} &gt; \tilde{\lambda}_i \mbox{ for all } i\neq j   &lt;/math&gt;

Since shifting the eigenvalues and inverting the matrix does not affect the eigenvectors,

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{A}v_i =\tilde{\lambda_i} v_i \quad \quad i=1,2,\ldots,n &lt;/math&gt;


Assume &lt;math&gt;\| v_i \| =1&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;\!\, i&lt;/math&gt;.  Generate &lt;math&gt;w_0,w_1,w_2, \ldots&lt;/math&gt; to find &lt;math&gt;\,\!v_j&lt;/math&gt;.  Start with arbitrary &lt;math&gt;\,\!w_0&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\,\!\| w_0 \|=1&lt;/math&gt;.  


 For &lt;math&gt;\,\!k=0,1,2,\ldots&lt;/math&gt;
   &lt;math&gt;\,\!\hat{w}_{k+1} = \tilde{A} w_k&lt;/math&gt;
   &lt;math&gt;\,\!w_{k+1}=\frac{\hat{w}_{k+1}}{\| \hat{w}_{k+1} \|}&lt;/math&gt;
   &lt;math&gt; \lambda_j^{(k+1)}=\frac{(\hat{w}_{k+1},w_k)}{(w_k,w_k)}=\frac{(\tilde{A}w_k,w_k)}{(w_k,w_k)} &lt;/math&gt; (Rayleigh quotient)
 End




===Convergence of Power Method===
If &lt;math&gt;\,\! | \lambda_1 | &gt; |\lambda_i|&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;\!\, i \neq 1&lt;/math&gt;, then  &lt;math&gt;\,\! A^k w_0&lt;/math&gt; will be dominated by &lt;math&gt;\,\! v_1&lt;/math&gt;.


Since &lt;math&gt; v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n &lt;/math&gt; are linearly independent, they form a basis of &lt;math&gt;R^n\,\!&lt;/math&gt;. Hence,

:&lt;math&gt;w_0 =\alpha_1v_1+\alpha_2v_2+\ldots+\alpha_nv_n \,\!&lt;/math&gt;


From the definition of eigenvectors,
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
Aw_0 &amp;=\alpha_1 \lambda_1 v_1 + \alpha_2 \lambda_2 v_2 + \ldots +\alpha_n\lambda_n v_n\\
A^2 w_0 &amp;= \alpha_1 \lambda^2_1 v_1 + \alpha_2 \lambda_2^2 v_2 + \ldots + \alpha_n\lambda_n^2 v_n\\
&amp;\vdots \\
A^k w_0 &amp;= \alpha_1 \lambda^k_1 v_1 + \alpha_2 \lambda_k^2 v_2 + \ldots + \alpha_n\lambda_n^k v_n\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;


To find a general form of &lt;math&gt;w_k \,\!&lt;/math&gt;, the approximate eigenvector at the kth step,  examine a few steps of the algorithm:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\hat{w}_1  &amp;=A w_0  \\
w_1        &amp;=\frac{\hat{w}_1}{\| \hat{w}_1 \|}=\frac{Aw_0}{\|A w_0\|} \\
\hat{w}_2  &amp;=Aw_1=\frac{A^2 w_0}{\| A w_0 \|} \\
 w_2       &amp;= \frac{\hat{w}_2}{\|\hat{w}_2\|}=\frac{\frac{A^2w_0}{\|Aw_0\|}}{\frac{\|A^2w_0\|}{\|Aw_0\|}}=\frac{A^2w_0}{\|A^2w_0\|} \\
\hat{w}_3  &amp;=\frac{A^3w_0}{\|A^2 w_0\|} \\
w_3        &amp;=\frac{\frac{A^3w_0}{\|A^2w_0\|}}{\frac{\|A^3w_0\|}{\|A^2w_0\|}}=\frac{A^3w_0}{\|A^3w_0\|} \\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;


From induction,

:&lt;math&gt; w_k  = \frac{A^kw_0}{\|A^kw_0\|} &lt;/math&gt;

Hence,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
w_k &amp;= \frac{A^kw_0}{\|A^kw_0\|} \\
    &amp;= \frac{\alpha_1 \lambda_1^kv_1+\alpha_2\lambda_2^kv_2+\ldots+\alpha_n\lambda_n^kv_n}{\|A^kw_0\|} \\
    &amp;= \frac{\lambda_1^k(\alpha_1 v_1+\alpha_2(\frac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1})^kv_2+\ldots+\alpha_n(\frac{\lambda_n}{\lambda_1})^kv_n)}{\|A^kw_0\|} 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Comparing a weighted &lt;math&gt;w_k\!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;v_1\!\,&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align} 
\left\| \frac{\|A^kw_0\|}{\lambda_1^k}w_k-\alpha_1v_1 \right\| &amp;=\left\| \alpha_2\left(\frac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1}\right)^kv_2+\ldots+\alpha_n\left(\frac{\lambda_n}{\lambda_1}\right)^kv_n \right\| \\
&amp;\leq \alpha_2 \left|\frac{\lambda_2}{\lambda_1}\right|^k+\ldots+\alpha_n\left|\frac{\lambda_n}{\lambda_1}\right|^k 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

since &lt;math&gt;\| v_i \|=1&lt;/math&gt; by assumption. 

The above expression goes to &lt;math&gt;\,\!0&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;k \rightarrow \infty&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;\,\! | \lambda_1 | &gt; |\lambda_i|&lt;/math&gt;, for all &lt;math&gt;\!\, i \neq 1&lt;/math&gt;.   Hence as &lt;math&gt;\!\,k&lt;/math&gt; grows, &lt;math&gt;\!\,w_k&lt;/math&gt; is parallel to &lt;math&gt;\!\,v_1&lt;/math&gt;. Because &lt;math&gt;\| w_k \| =1&lt;/math&gt;, it must be that &lt;math&gt;w_k \rightarrow \pm v_1&lt;/math&gt;.

Suppose A is an upper triangular, nonsingular matrix. Show that both Jacobi iterations and Gauss-Seidel iterations converge in finitely many steps when used to solve &lt;math&gt; A\mathbf{x}=\mathbf{b}&lt;/math&gt;.
|}

==Solution 3==
===Derivation of Iterations===

Let &lt;math&gt; A=D+L+U \!\,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;D \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is a diagonal matrix, &lt;math&gt;L\!,&lt;/math&gt; is a lower triangular matrix with a zero diagonal and  &lt;math&gt;U\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is an upper triangular matrix also with a zero diagonal.


The Jacobi iteration can be found by substituting into &lt;math&gt; Ax=b \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, grouping &lt;math&gt; L+U \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, and solving for &lt;math&gt; x \!\,&lt;/math&gt; i.e.


&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
Ax           &amp;=   b  \\
(D+L+U)x     &amp;=   b  \\
Dx + (L+U)x  &amp;=   b  \\
Dx           &amp;=   b - (L+U)x \\
x            &amp;=  D^{-1} (b- (L+U)x )
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;


Since &lt;math&gt;L=0\!\,&lt;/math&gt; by hypothesis, the iteration is 


:&lt;math&gt;  x^{(i+1)} =  D^{-1} (b- Ux^{(i)}) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Similarly, the Gauss-Seidel iteration can be found by substituting into &lt;math&gt; Ax=b \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, grouping &lt;math&gt; D+L \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, and solving for &lt;math&gt; x \!\,&lt;/math&gt; i.e.



&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
Ax           &amp;=   b  \\
(D+L+U)x     &amp;=   b  \\
(D+L)x+Ux    &amp;=   b  \\
(D+L)x       &amp;=   b - Ux \\
x            &amp;=  (D+L)^{-1}(b-Ux)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;



Since &lt;math&gt;L=0\!\,&lt;/math&gt; by hypothesis, the iteration has identical from as Jacopi:


:&lt;math&gt;  x^{(i+1)} =  D^{-1} (b- Ux^{(i)}) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Convergence in Finite Number of Steps===
Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel are iterative methods that split the matrix &lt;math&gt; A \in \mathbb{R}^{n \times n } \!\,&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt; D \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; U \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt; L \!\,&lt;/math&gt;: Diagonal, Upper (everything above the diagonal), and Lower (everything below the diagonal) triangular matrices, respectively. Their iterations go as such


:&lt;math&gt;x^{(i+1)}=(D+L)^{-1}(b-Ux^{(i)})\!\,&lt;/math&gt;        (Gauss-Seidel)  

:&lt;math&gt;x^{(i+1)}=D^{-1}(b-(U+L)x^{(i)})\!\,&lt;/math&gt;        (Jacobi)


In our case &lt;math&gt; A \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is upper triangular, so &lt;math&gt; L \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is the zero matrix. As a result, the Gauss-Seidel and Jacobi methods take on the following identical form


:&lt;math&gt;x^{(i+1)}=D^{-1}(b-Ux^{(i)})\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Additionally, &lt;math&gt; x\!\, &lt;/math&gt; can be written


:&lt;math&gt;x=D^{-1}(b-Ux)\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Subtracting &lt;math&gt; x\!\, &lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt; x^{(i+1)}\!\, &lt;/math&gt; we get


&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
e^{(i+1)} &amp;= x^{(i+1)}-x \\
          &amp;= D^{-1}(b-Ux^{(i)}) -  D^{-1}(b-Ux) \\
          &amp;= D^{-1}U(-x^{(i)} + x) \\
          &amp;= D^{-1}Ue^{(i)} \\
          &amp;= D^{-1}U(D^{-1}Ue^{(i-1)}) = (D^{-1}U)^2e^{(i-1)} \\
          &amp;\vdots  \\
          &amp;= (D^{-1}U)^{i+1}e^{(0)}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;


In our problem, &lt;math&gt;D^{-1}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is diagonal and &lt;math&gt;U\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is upper triangular with zeros along the diagonal. Notice that the product &lt;math&gt;D^{-1}U\!\,&lt;/math&gt; will also be upper triangular with zeros along the diagonal.

Let &lt;math&gt;R = D^{-1}U\!\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;R\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


:&lt;math&gt;
R = 
\begin{pmatrix}
   0   &amp;   *    &amp;   *    &amp; \cdots &amp; * \\
   0   &amp;   0    &amp;   *    &amp; \cdots &amp; * \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
   0   &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp;    0   &amp; * \\
   0   &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp;    0   &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;


Also, let &lt;math&gt;\tilde{R}\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; be the related matrix 


:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}

\tilde{R} &amp;= 
\left(
\begin{array}{ccc|cccc}
      0   &amp; \cdots &amp;    0   &amp;    *   &amp;    *   &amp; \cdots &amp;   *    \\
      0   &amp; \cdots &amp;    0   &amp;    0   &amp;    *   &amp; \cdots &amp;   *    \\
   \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
      0   &amp; \cdots &amp;   0    &amp;    0   &amp; \cdots &amp;    0   &amp;   *    \\
\hline
      0   &amp; \cdots &amp;   0    &amp;    0   &amp; \cdots &amp;    0   &amp;   0    \\
   \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \cdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
      0   &amp; \cdots &amp;   0    &amp;    0   &amp; \cdots &amp;    0   &amp;   0    \\
\end{array}
\right)  \\


          &amp;= 

\left(
\begin{array}{c|c}
      \mathbf{a}  &amp;      T        \\
\hline
      \mathbf{0}  &amp; \mathbf{a}^T  \\
\end{array}
\right)

\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;


Where &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{a}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;k\times (n-k)\!\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;T\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;k\times k\!\,&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{0}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;(n-k)\times (n-k)\!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


Finally, the product &lt;math&gt; R\tilde{R} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; (call it (1)) is


:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}

R\tilde{R} &amp;= 

\begin{pmatrix}
   0   &amp;   *    &amp;   *    &amp; \cdots &amp; * \\
   0   &amp;   0    &amp;   *    &amp; \cdots &amp; * \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
   0   &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp;    0   &amp; * \\
   0   &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp;    0   &amp; 0
\end{pmatrix}

\left(
\begin{array}{ccc|cccc}
      0   &amp; \cdots &amp;    0   &amp;    *   &amp;    *   &amp; \cdots &amp;   *    \\
      0   &amp; \cdots &amp;    0   &amp;    0   &amp;    *   &amp; \cdots &amp;   *    \\
   \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
      0   &amp; \cdots &amp;   0    &amp;    0   &amp; \cdots &amp;    0   &amp;   *    \\
\hline
      0   &amp; \cdots &amp;   0    &amp;    0   &amp; \cdots &amp;    0   &amp;   0    \\
   \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \cdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
      0   &amp; \cdots &amp;   0    &amp;    0   &amp; \cdots &amp;    0   &amp;   0    \\
\end{array}
\right)  \\


          &amp;= 

\left(
\begin{array}{ccc|ccccc}
      0   &amp; \cdots &amp;    0   &amp;    0   &amp;    *   &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp;   *    \\
      0   &amp; \cdots &amp;    0   &amp;    0   &amp;    0   &amp;    *   &amp; \cdots &amp;   *    \\
   \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
      0   &amp; \cdots &amp;   0    &amp;    0   &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp;    0   &amp;   *    \\
\hline
      0   &amp; \cdots &amp;   0    &amp;    0   &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp;    0   &amp;   0    \\
   \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \vdots \\
      0   &amp; \cdots &amp;   0    &amp;    0   &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp;    0   &amp;   0    \\
\end{array}
\right)  \\


          &amp;= 

\left(
\begin{array}{c|c}
      \mathbf{a}  &amp; \tilde{T}        \\
\hline
      \mathbf{0}  &amp; \mathbf{a}^T  \\
\end{array}
\right)

\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;


Here &lt;math&gt;\tilde{T}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is almost identical in structure to &lt;math&gt;T\!\,&lt;/math&gt;, except that its diagonal elements are zeros. 

At this point the convergence in &lt;math&gt;n\!\,&lt;/math&gt; steps (the size of the starting matrix) should be apparent since &lt;math&gt;R\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is just &lt;math&gt;\tilde{R}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;k=0\!\,&lt;/math&gt; and each time &lt;math&gt;R\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is multiplied by &lt;math&gt;\tilde{R}\!\,&lt;/math&gt;, the k-th super-diagonal is zeroed out (where k=0 is the diagonal itself). After &lt;math&gt;n-1\!\,&lt;/math&gt; applications of &lt;math&gt;R\!\,&lt;/math&gt;, the result will be the zero matrix of size &lt;math&gt;n\!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

In brief, &lt;math&gt;R^n\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is the zero matrix of size &lt;math&gt;n\!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


Therefore &lt;math&gt; e^{(n)}=(D^{-1}U)^{n}e^{(0)}\equiv 0 \!\, &lt;/math&gt;, i.e. the Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel Methods used to solve &lt;math&gt;A\mathbf{x}=b\!\,&lt;/math&gt; converge in &lt;math&gt;n\!\,&lt;/math&gt; steps when &lt;math&gt; A\in\mathbb{R}^{n\times n}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is upper triangular.

|}

==Solution 1a==

===Forward Direction===

We want to prove the following statement:


If &lt;math&gt;\{g_1,\ldots,g_n\}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is a Chebyshev system, then for any &lt;math&gt;n \!\,&lt;/math&gt; distinct points &lt;math&gt; x_1,\ldots,x_n \in [a,b] \!\,&lt;/math&gt; the matrix &lt;math&gt;A \!\,&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;a_{i,j}=g_j(x_i), 1 \leq i, j\leq n \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is non-singular.


Writing out the matrix &lt;math&gt;A \!\,&lt;/math&gt; yields:


&lt;math&gt;
A= \begin{pmatrix}
        g_1(x_1) &amp; g_2(x_1) &amp; \cdots &amp; g_n(x_1) \\
        g_1(x_2) &amp; g_2(x_2) &amp; \cdots &amp; g_n(x_2) \\
          \vdots &amp;  \vdots  &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
        g_1(x_n) &amp; g_2(x_n) &amp; \cdots &amp; g_n(x_n)
    \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;


Since the set &lt;math&gt;\{g_1,\ldots,g_n\}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is linearly independent,  there does not exist any non-zero sets of constants of &lt;math&gt; \alpha_i \!\,&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i g_i(x)=0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;x \in [a,b]\!\,&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, the columns of the matrix &lt;math&gt; A \!\,&lt;/math&gt; are linearly independent which implies that &lt;math&gt; A \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is non-singular.

===Reverse Direction===

====Proof of (i)====
Assume &lt;math&gt;A\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is non-singular.


This implies the columns of 


:&lt;math&gt;
A= \begin{pmatrix}
        g_1(x_1) &amp; g_2(x_1) &amp; \cdots &amp; g_n(x_1) \\
        g_1(x_2) &amp; g_2(x_2) &amp; \cdots &amp; g_n(x_2) \\
          \vdots &amp;  \vdots  &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
        g_1(x_n) &amp; g_2(x_n) &amp; \cdots &amp; g_n(x_n)
    \end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;


are linearly independent.  Since &lt;math&gt;A\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is non-singular for any choice of &lt;math&gt;\{ x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \}\!\,&lt;/math&gt;,  &lt;math&gt;\{g_1,g_2,\dots,g_n\}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is a linearly independent set and we have shown &lt;math&gt; (i) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

====Proof of (ii)====

By hypothesis, &lt;math&gt;g(x) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is a linear combination of &lt;math&gt;\{g_1,g_2,\dots,g_n\}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; i.e.


:&lt;math&gt;g(x)=\alpha_1g_1(x)+\alpha_2g_2(x)+\cdots+\alpha_ng_n(x) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; 


for &lt;math&gt;\alpha_i\!\,&lt;/math&gt; not all zero. 


Assume for the sake of contradiction that &lt;math&gt;g(x) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt; n \!\,&lt;/math&gt; zeros at &lt;math&gt;\hat{x_1}, \hat{x_2}, \ldots, \hat{x_n} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


This implies the following &lt;math&gt; n \!\,&lt;/math&gt; equations:


&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
g(\hat{x_1}) &amp;=0=\alpha_1 g_1(\hat{x_1})+\alpha_2 g_2 (\hat{x_1}) + \cdots+ \alpha_n g_n(\hat{x_1})\\
g(\hat{x_2}) &amp;=0=\alpha_1 g_1(\hat{x_2})+\alpha_2 g_2 (\hat{x_2}) + \cdots+ \alpha_n g_n(\hat{x_2})\\
             &amp;\vdots \\
g(\hat{x_n}) &amp;=0=\alpha_1 g_1(\hat{x_n})+\alpha_2 g_2 (\hat{x_n}) + \cdots+ \alpha_n g_n(\hat{x_n})
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;


Rewriting the equations in matrix form yields


&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
g_1(\hat{x_1}) &amp; g_2(\hat{x_1}) &amp; \cdots &amp; g_n(\hat{x_1}) \\
g_1(\hat{x_2}) &amp; g_2(\hat{x_2}) &amp; \cdots &amp; g_n(\hat{x_2}) \\
  \vdots       &amp;  \vdots        &amp; \ddots &amp;  \vdots        \\
g_1(\hat{x_n}) &amp; g_2(\hat{x_n}) &amp; \cdots &amp; g_n(\hat{x_n}) 
\end{pmatrix}
\begin{pmatrix}
\alpha_1 \\ \alpha_2 \\ \vdots \\ \alpha_n 
\end{pmatrix}
=\begin{pmatrix}
0 \\ 0 \\ \vdots \\ 0
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;


Since &lt;math&gt; \alpha_i \!\,&lt;/math&gt; are not all zero, this implies that the columns of &lt;math&gt; A \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \{ g_1, g_2, \ldots, g_n \} &lt;/math&gt;, are linearly dependent, a contradiction.


Hence, &lt;math&gt;g \!\,&lt;/math&gt; has at most &lt;math&gt;n-1\!\,&lt;/math&gt; zeros, and we have shown &lt;math&gt; (ii) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;g_j(x)=x^{j-1},j=1,\ldots,m+1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;. Show that &lt;math&gt;\{g_1,\ldots,g_{m+1},f \} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is a Chebyshev system. For this, you may use results from polynomial interpolation without proof.
|}

==Solution 1b==
We have to prove:

(i) &lt;math&gt;\{1,x,x^2,\dots,f\}\!\,&lt;/math&gt;  is a linearly independent set 


(ii)any linear combination of this set has at most &lt;math&gt;m\!\,&lt;/math&gt; zeros. 

===Proof of (i)===

If we evaluate &lt;math&gt;g_1,g_2,\dots,g_{m+1}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; at &lt;math&gt; m+1\!\,&lt;/math&gt; distinct points, &lt;math&gt; \{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_{m+1} \} &lt;/math&gt;, we have the following Van Der Monde matrix whose determinant is non-zero.  


&lt;math&gt;
\begin{pmatrix}
1      &amp; 1      &amp; \cdots &amp; 1 \\
x_1    &amp; x_1^2  &amp; \cdots &amp; x_1^m \\
\vdots &amp; \vdots &amp; \ddots &amp; \vdots \\
x_{m+1}    &amp; \cdots &amp; \cdots &amp; x_{m+1}^m 
\end{pmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;


Hence, &lt;math&gt;g_1,g_2,\dots,g_{m+1}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; are linearly independent.


Assume for the sake of contradiction that &lt;math&gt;f\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is a linear combination of &lt;math&gt;g_1,g_2,\dots,g_{m+1}\!\,&lt;/math&gt;, that is


&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
f(x)&amp;=\beta_0g_1(x)+\beta_1g_2(x)+\dots+\beta_mg_{m+1}(x) \\
    &amp;=\beta_0\cdot 1+\beta_1x+\beta_2x^2+\dots+\beta_mx^m
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;.


Hence, &lt;math&gt; f(x) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial of degree &lt;math&gt; m \!\,&lt;/math&gt;.  Taking &lt;math&gt; m+1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; derivatives of &lt;math&gt; f(x) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; yields 


:&lt;math&gt;f^{(m+1)}(x) = 0\!\,&lt;/math&gt; 


which contradicts the hypothesis. Therefore &lt;math&gt;\{1,x,x^2,\dots,f\}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is a linearly independent set.

===Proof of (ii)===
Let &lt;math&gt;h(x)=\beta_0g_1(x)+\beta_1g_2(x)+\dots+\beta_mg_{m+1}(x)+\beta_{m+1}f(x)\!\,&lt;/math&gt;.

Suppose &lt;math&gt;h\!\,&lt;/math&gt; has &lt;math&gt;m+2\!\,&lt;/math&gt; (or more) zeros in &lt;math&gt;[a,b]\!\,&lt;/math&gt;.  By Rolle's Theorem, the (n+1)st derivative of f vanishes on the given interval, a contradiction. 




(i) and (ii) show that &lt;math&gt;\{1,x,x^2,\dots,f\}\!\,&lt;/math&gt; is a Chebyshev system.

for all &lt;math&gt; f \in C[a,b] \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

|}
==Solution 2a==

By the &lt;span class=&quot;plainlinks&quot;&gt;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stone%E2%80%93Weierstrass_theorem#Weierstrass_approximation_theorem Weierstrass Approximation Theorem]&lt;/span&gt;, given &lt;math&gt; \epsilon &gt;0  \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a polynomial &lt;math&gt; p(x) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; such that 

:&lt;math&gt; \max_{a \leq x \leq b} |f(x)- p(x)| \leq \min \{ \frac{\epsilon}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{M}, \frac{\epsilon}{2} \cdot \frac{1}{b-a} \} \quad \quad (3)&lt;/math&gt;

Let 

:&lt;math&gt; I(f) = \int_a^b f(x) dx &lt;/math&gt;

Adding and subtracting &lt;math&gt;I(p) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; I_n(p) \!\, &lt;/math&gt;, yields,


:&lt;math&gt; I(f)-I_n(f)=[I(f)-I(p)]+[I(p)-I_n(p)]+[I_n(p)-I_n(f)] \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


By the triangle inequality and equation (2) and (3),


&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
|I(f)-I_n(f)| &amp;\leq |I(f-p)|+|I(p)-I_n(p)| + |I_n(p-f)| \\
              &amp;\leq \int_a^b |f(x)-p(x)|dx + |I(p)-I_n(p)| + \sum_{k=1}^n |w_{n,k}| |f(x_n,k)-p(x_n,k)| \\
              &amp;\leq \frac{\epsilon}{2(b-a)} \int_a^b dx + |I(p)-I_n(p)| + \frac{\epsilon}{2M} \sum_{k=1}^n |w_{n,k}| \\
              &amp;\leq \frac{\epsilon}{2(b-a)} (b-a) + |I(p)-I_n(p)| + \frac{\epsilon}{2M} M \\
              &amp;= \epsilon + |I(p)-I_n(p)|

\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

By equation (1), when &lt;math&gt; n \rightarrow \infty \!\,&lt;/math&gt; , 

:&lt;math&gt;|I(p)-I_n(p)|=0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Hence for arbitrary small &lt;math&gt; \epsilon &gt;0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt; n \rightarrow \infty \!\,&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; |I(f)-I_n(f)| \leq \epsilon &lt;/math&gt;


i.e.
:&lt;math&gt; I(f)=\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} I_n(f) \!\, &lt;/math&gt;

|}

==Solution 2b==

For &lt;math&gt;k=0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, equation (1) yields,

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} I_n(x^0)&amp;=\int_a^b x^0 dx \\
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} I_n(1)  &amp;=\int_a^b 1 \cdot dx \\
                                    &amp;=(b-a)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;


Letting &lt;math&gt;f(x) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; in equation (0) yields,
:&lt;math&gt; I_n(1)=\sum_{k=1}^n w_{n,k}\cdot 1=\sum_{k=1}^n w_{n,k} &lt;/math&gt;


Combining the two above results yields,

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} I_n(1) &amp;= \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{k=1}^n w_{n,k} \\
                                   &amp;= (b-a) \\
                                   &amp;\leq  M
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
                                 

Since &lt;math&gt;(b-a) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is finite, there exists some number &lt;math&gt; M \!\,&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt; (b-a)\leq M &lt;/math&gt;.


Since &lt;math&gt; w_{n,k} &gt;0 \!\, &lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} \sum_{k=1}^n |w_{n,k}| \leq M &lt;/math&gt;

i.e. equation (2).

|}

==Solution 3a==
Substituting for &lt;math&gt; M \!\,&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; (v,Mv) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and expanding the inner product we have,


&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
(v,Mv) &amp;= (v,\frac{1}{2}(A+A^T)v)\\
       &amp;= (v,\frac{1}{2}Av+\frac{1}{2}A^Tv) \\
       &amp;= (v,\frac{1}{2}Av)+(v,\frac{1}{2}A^Tv) \\
       &amp;= \frac{1}{2}(v,Av)+\frac{1}{2}(v,A^Tv)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;


From properties of inner products we have,


:&lt;math&gt; (v,A^Tv)=(Av,v)=(v,Av) \!\, &lt;/math&gt;


Hence, 


&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
(v,Mv) &amp;= \frac{1}{2}(v,Av)+\frac{1}{2}(v,A^Tv) \\
       &amp;= \frac{1}{2}(v,Av)+\frac{1}{2}(v,Av) \\

===First Inequality===
:&lt;math&gt;
\frac{(v,Av)}{(v,v)} = \frac{(v,Mv)}{(v,v)} =\frac{v^TMv}{v^Tv}
&lt;/math&gt;

Since &lt;math&gt;M\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is symmetric, it has a eigenvalue decomposition 

:&lt;math&gt; M=Q^T\Lambda Q \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;Q\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is orthogonal and &lt;math&gt;\Lambda\,\!&lt;/math&gt; is a diagonal matrix containing all the eigenvalues.

Substitution yields,

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{(v,Av)}{(v,v)} = \frac{v^TQ^T\Lambda Qv}{v^Tv} &lt;/math&gt;

Let

:&lt;math&gt; Qv=x \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

This implies the following three relationships:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
v    &amp;= Q^Tx \\
v^TQ^T &amp;= x^T \\
v^T    &amp;= x^T Q
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting,
:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
\frac{v^TQ^T\Lambda Qv}{v^Tv} &amp;= \frac{x^T\Lambda x}{x^TQQ^Tx} \\
                              &amp;= \frac{x^T\Lambda x}{x^T x} 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Expanding the numerator we have,

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
x^T\Lambda x &amp;= \begin{bmatrix} x_1 x_2 \ldots x_n \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\lambda_1 &amp; &amp; &amp; \\
          &amp; \lambda_2 &amp;&amp;\\
          &amp; &amp; \ddots &amp;\\
          &amp; &amp; &amp; \lambda_n
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
x_1 \\ 
x_2 \\
\vdots \\
x_n
\end{bmatrix}\\
            &amp;=\begin{bmatrix} x_1 x_2 \ldots x_n \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\lambda_1 x_1 \\
\lambda_2 x_2 \\
\vdots \\
\lambda_n x_n \\
\end{bmatrix}\\
            &amp;= \lambda_1x_1^2+\lambda_2x^2+\ldots+\lambda_n^2x_n^2 \\
            &amp;= \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i x_i^2
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Expanding the denominator yield
:&lt;math&gt;
x^Tx = \sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2
&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting,
:&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
\frac{x^T\Lambda x}{x^T x} &amp;=\frac{\sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i x_i^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2} \\
                           &amp;\geq\lambda_{\min}(M) \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2}{\sum_{i=1}^n x_i^2} \\
                           &amp;= \lambda_{\min}(M) 
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
===Second Inequality===

From part(a)

:&lt;math&gt;(v,Av)=(v,Mv) &gt;0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

for all real &lt;math&gt;v\!\,&lt;/math&gt;.


Therefore &lt;math&gt;M \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is positive definite which implies all its eigenvalues are positive.  In particular,


:&lt;math&gt; \lambda_{\min}(M) &gt; 0 \!\, &lt;/math&gt;

{| WIDTH=&quot;80%&quot;
|-
| style=&quot;background-color: #FFFFEE; border: solid 1px #FFC92E; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=&quot;top&quot; |

Now consider the iteration for computing a series of approximate solutions to (1),


:&lt;math&gt; x_{k+1}=x_k+\alpha r_k \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


where &lt;math&gt; r_k=b-Ax_k \!\,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\alpha \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is chosen to minimize &lt;math&gt; \|r_{k+1} \|_2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; as a function of &lt;math&gt;\alpha\!\,&lt;/math&gt;.  Prove that


:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\|r_{k+1}\|_2}{\|r_k\|_2} \leq \left( 1- \frac{\lambda_{\min}(M)^2}{\lambda_{\max}(A^TA)} \right)^{\frac{1}{2}} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


|}

==Solution 3c==

First, we want to write &lt;math&gt;\|r_{k+1}\|^2&lt;/math&gt; as a function of &lt;math&gt;\alpha \!\,&lt;/math&gt; i.e.


:&lt;math&gt; f(\alpha)= \|r_{k+1}\|^2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Changing the indices of  equation &lt;math&gt;r_k \!\,&lt;/math&gt; from &lt;math&gt;k \!\,&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;k+1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;,substituting for &lt;math&gt; b-Ax_k \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, and applying the definition of norm yields, 


&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\|r_{k+1}\|^2 &amp;=\|b-Ax_{k+1} \|^2 \\
            &amp;=\|b-Ax_k-\alpha Ar_k \|^2 \\
            &amp;=\| r_k - \alpha A r_k \|^2 \\
            &amp;=(r_k-\alpha Ar_k, r_k -\alpha Ar_k ) \\
            &amp;=(r_k,r_k)-\alpha(Ar_k,r_k)-\alpha(r_k,Ar_k)+\alpha^2(Ar_k,Ar_k)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;


From a property of inner products  and since &lt;math&gt; A \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is symmetric,


:&lt;math&gt; (r_k,Ar_k)= (A^Tr_k,r_k)=(Ar_k,r_k) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Hence,


:&lt;math&gt;f(\alpha)=\|r_{k+1} \|^2=(r_k,r_k)-2\alpha(Ar_k,r_k)+\alpha^2(Ar_k,Ar_k) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Next we want to minimize &lt;math&gt; f(\alpha) \!\,&lt;/math&gt; as a function of &lt;math&gt;\alpha \!\,&lt;/math&gt;. Taking its derivative with respect to &lt;math&gt;\alpha \!\, &lt;/math&gt; yields,


:&lt;math&gt;f^{\prime}(\alpha)=-2(Ar_k,r_k)+2\alpha(Ar_k,Ar_k) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Setting &lt;math&gt;f^{\prime}(\alpha)=0&lt;/math&gt; and solving for &lt;math&gt;\alpha \!\,&lt;/math&gt; gives


&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{align}
0          &amp;=-2(Ar_k,r_k)+2\alpha(Ar_k,Ar_k) \\
0          &amp;=-(Ar_k,r_k)+\alpha(Ar_k,Ar_k) \\
(Ar_k,r_k) &amp;=\alpha(Ar_k,Ar_k) \\
\alpha     &amp;=\frac{(Ar_k,r_k)}{(Ar_k,Ar_k)}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;


Substituting for &lt;math&gt;\alpha \!\,&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt; \|r_{k+1} \|^2 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; gives,


&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\|r_{k+1}\|^2   &amp;=(r_k,r_k)-2\alpha(Ar_k,r_k)+\alpha^2(Ar_k,Ar_k)\\
              &amp;=(r_k,r_k)-2\frac{(Ar_k,r_k)}{(Ar_k,Ar_k)}(Ar_k,r_k)+\frac{(Ar_k,r_k)^2}{(Ar_k,Ar_k)^2}(Ar_k,Ar_k) \\
              &amp;=(r_k,r_k)-2\frac{(Ar_k,r_k)^2}{(Ar_k,Ar_k)}+\frac{(Ar_k,r_k)^2}{(Ar_k,Ar_k)} \\
              &amp;=(r_k,r_k)-\frac{(Ar_k,r_k)^2}{(Ar_k,Ar_k)}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

By definition of norm,


:&lt;math&gt; \|r_k\|^2=(r_k,r_k) \!\, &lt;/math&gt;


Hence


:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\|r_{k+1}\|^2}{\|r_k\|^2}= 1-\frac{(Ar_k,r_k)^2}{(r_k,r_k)(Ar_k,Ar_k)} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Multiplying and dividing the second term on the right hand side of the above equation by &lt;math&gt;(r_k,r_k)\!\,&lt;/math&gt; and applying a property of inner product yields,


:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\|r_{k+1}\|^2}{\|r_k\|^2}= 1-\frac{(Ar_k,r_k)^2(r_k,r_k)}{(r_k,r_k)^2(r_k,A^TAr_k)} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


From the result of part (b), we have our desired result:


:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\|r_{k+1}\|_2}{\|r_k\|_2} \leq \left( 1- \frac{\lambda_{\min}(M)^2}{\lambda_{\max}(A^TA)} \right)^{\frac{1}{2}} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

'''Faschierter Braten - Meat Loaf'''

==Background==

''Faschierter Braten'' is a traditional Austrian dish, often served with mashed potatoes, caramelized onion rings and sometimes served alongside a salad. It is a tasteful, satiable and inexpensive meal  of ground beef and ground pork. Depending on the kind of preparation, the ''Braten'' also has other names: ''Netzbraten'' when the ground meat mass is wrapped and roasted in a pork net; ''Falscher Hase'' when it is formed like the shape of a hare's back or ''Stephaniebraten'' when the roast is additionally filled with a hard boiled egg, pickles, and sausages. The ingredients in the ''Braten'' can vary, so numerous nontraditional variations exist. The original recipe can be enriched , for instance, by adding different spices or vegetables to the meat-dough or by mixing the meat with rice in order to reduce the fat content of this dish.


But not only in Austria, almost all over Europe  similar versions of this popular delicious and solid fare can be found. The Germans use the term ''Frikadelle'' for rissoles, which are formed of the same meat-dough as the ''Faschierter Braten''. In Austria, these rissoles are known as ''Faschierte Laibchen''. The Hungarians like it a bit spicier and add paprika to the meat mass. They form a sausage link and call it ''Cevapcici''. The probably most popular version of rissoles accompanies the hamburger. Again, many interesting and tasteful versions exist in different burgers all over the world.

The easy preparation process of this hearty dish even allows ''poor cooks'' to have a try. For one thing, while the ''Braten'' is stewing in the oven, there is enough time to prepare the side dishes and to set the table. For another thing, neither lots of cookware, nor extraordinary spices are needed for this enjoyable dish.

{{recipesummary|Meat recipes||prep: 50 min|2}}

If there is some ''Braten'' left, it can either be warmed over again or enjoyed  as a cold snack. A typical Austrian version of such a cold snack is the so-called ''Brettl-Jause''. For this, different types of cheese, fresh or pickled vegetables like tomatoes, pickles, onions, cucumber or capsicum, and  meat are arranged on a plate. Of course, the ingredients may vary slightly according to personal preferences. Primarily, the ''Brettl-Jause'', whose name derives from the wooden plate (''Brett'') on which it is served, is offered in rural taverns or ski lodges all over Austria.


==Ingredients==

* 500 g of mixed ground pork and ground beef
* 1 roll
* 1/2 cup of milk
* 1 egg
* 1/2 cup of bread crumbs
* 1/2 onion
* 500 ml of consommé or vegetable soup
* salt, pepper, garlic, marjoram (to taste)

'''Side Dishes'''
* mashed potatoes
* caramelized onion rings
* salad

==Procedure==

Preheat the oven to 180 degrees. Take the roll, cut it into croûton-sized cubes and soak them in the milk. Then sauté the brunoise-chopped onions in a pan at medium heat. When they have turned golden yellow, put them into a bowl together with the ground meat. Add the roll cubes, the egg, the bread crumbs, salt, pepper, marjoram, and chopped garlic and stir the mixture thoroughly until you have a solid consistency. Now knead this meat-dough into a longish form and place it in a baking dish. Finally, put the ''Braten'' into the oven and roast it for approximately 40 minutes until it is golden brown. Serve hot with side dishes and enjoy it!

&lt;font size=10 color=&quot;#FEC254&quot;&gt;'''Apple Strudel'''&lt;/font&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size=4 color=&quot;#FEC254&quot;&gt;History&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

The apple strudel is said to be a famous Viennese dish. It is true that it gained international success via the Viennese cuisine, but the origin of the apple strudel is to be found in what was known as &quot;the Orient&quot;. When the Turks occupied Hungary (among other Middle-European countries), the Hungarians got to know the strudel which then, thanks to the high percentage of gluten starch in the Hungarian wheat flour, became quite popular in Hungary. From there the strudel found its way into the Viennese cuisine and later on conquered the whole Austrian-Hungarian monarchy. Already in 1696, a recipe of a so called milk-cream-strudel existed. In 1715, the strudel was described as a spiral wound flummery. This leads to the assumption that the word “strudel” derives from its shape, which reminds of a water vortex

However, the Viennese strudel recipes are, to some extent, of Moorish-Spanish origin as well. The Moors brought their pastry recipe to Spain and to the South of France. In both countries their recipes can be traced back to the 17th and 18th century.

Until the second half of the 19th century, variations developed with a great variety of stuffing and the strudel established itself in the Austrian cuisine. From 1800 onwards, many types of strudels were created, such as apple strudel, almond strudel, semolina strudel, rice strudel, quark strudel, milk-cream-strudel, grape strudel, poppy strudel, nut strudel, cabbage strudel, meat strudel, damson strudel, cherry strudel, pear strudel, apricot strudel, ham strudel, coffee strudel, Parmesan strudel, roll strudel, mushroom strudel, herb strudel, cinnamon strudel, and the Hungarian strudel, which is called rétes.

These variants are more common in the foothills of the Alps than in the Alps, people living in the mountains usually prefer fritter and substantial meals. Generally, it can be said that for the Austrian apple strudel it is important to choose green or tartish apples that are firm and not overripe. If the apples are too sour, just add some more sugar. For the apple strudel of the old-Viennese style, 1/4l of sour cream, or slightly whipped cream, and 80g coarsely cut nuts are added to the original recipe before the strudel is rolled up. For the apple strudel of Salzburg's cuisine, some sugared milk is poured over the stuffing in order to keep the strudel juicy. Each variation of an apple strudel, or a strudel in general, can be served as a main dish or a dessert. Whether it is eaten warm or cold, it always has a delicious taste!

On this page you will find the recipe for the dough and as well as the stuffing. The dough should be soft and smooth when it comes to stretching it. In former years, there was the saying that a woman is not mature until she is able to make a strudel dough thin enough to read a newspaper through it.

&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size=4 color=&quot;#FEC254&quot;&gt;Ingredients for the dough&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
&lt;table border=2 bordercolor=&quot;#000000&quot; cellPadding=3 cellSpacing=1&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;200g&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;flour&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;1/16l&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;luke-warm water (near &quot;hot&quot; is better than near &quot;cold&quot;)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;20g&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;oil&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;salt&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/table&gt;

&lt;b&gt;&lt;font size=4 color=&quot;#FEC254&quot;&gt;Directions for the dough&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;
* put the flour on a (wooden) board
* salt the flour a bit
* form a hole in its middle
* fill in very little water and oil (be careful not to take too much liquid at once!)
* cover the liquid with some flour (to take it from the side might cause a leak)
* knead the mixture a bit
* form another hole, add liquids, cover them and knead it again, repeat this procedure until there is no liquid left
* knead the mixture until it is smooth and does not stick to the hands or the board anymore
* powder a slightly warmed bowl (this dough does not like to get cold!)
* grease the dough with oil (so it cannot build a skin)
* put it into the bowl
* cover the bowl with a damp dish cloth (but the cloth should not touch the dough!)
* let it rest for 30 minutes (prepare the stuffing in the meantime)

* powder a cloth with flour (e.g. a sheet)
* put the dough on it and tumble it
* powder your hands
* put one hand underneath the dough (the back of your hand faces upwards, spread your fingers - take care that your finger nails do not tear the dough!), with the other hand you carefully pull the dough from the middle towards the table-edge until it is &quot;as thin as paper&quot;
* cut the thicker edges off
* now put the stuffing on the dough which you have prepared before

* heat breadcrumbs until they are light brown
* peal the apples and cut them into slices
* put the breadcrumbs on 2/3 of the dough - leave out the 1/3 which will be rolled in at last
* put the apple slices on top of them
* spice with sugar, cinnamon and raisins (and nuts, if you want to add some)
* paste the fat on the other 1/3 of the dough which you have prepared before
* turn the sides up (where the ends of the strudel will be)
* turn up the side that is covered with the stuffing
* now grasp the cloth and pull it up (to roll the strudel up)
* then paste fat onto the dough (do not forget the two ends)
* put it into the pre-heated oven (180°) for 35 minutes
* do not forget to paste fat onto the dough two or three times during the first 15 minutes of cooking (otherwise it will not take on that golden brown colour)
* when it is ready, take it out of the oven and let it cool down for a few minutes
* finally, put a portion on a plate, powder it with sugar and serve it

'''Cheese dumplings'''

Cheese dumplings (pressed) - ''Kaspressknödel'':
A typical Austrian dish - the best dumplings are flat dumplings…


What would Austria be without dumplings? 
Dumplings exist in a variety of shapes and sizes. They can be served not only as a main course, but also in soups, as side dishes or desserts. Some dumplings are filled and some, like ''Kaspressknödel'', are not. They can be savoury, filled with vegetables, or sweet filled with fruit. Cheese dumplings were originally eaten by farmers throughout Austria. Dumplings were often made out of the farm's own produce, so there was no need to buy ingredients. Bread, potatoes and flour were used for the dough. In addition eggs, butter, left-over meats, bacon or fruits from the garden were used to fill them.

Where do cheese dumplings originally come from? This question is almost impossible to answer. Tyroleans claim that they invented them.  The Bavarians claim that cheese dumplings are made according to a traditional Bavarian recipe. And last, but not least, the south Tyroleans claim that cheese dumplings come from their region. Whatever the origins of them, we are glad to be able to enjoy them today.

When making dumplings the kind of cheese used is of particular importance. It should be a strong cheese with a lot of flavour. In Austria they are predominately made using either Pinzgauer beer cheese or grey cheese from Tirol. You can experiment with which ever cheese you like.

As well as using left-overs, another advantage of cheese dumplings is that they are easy to prepare. Not many ingredients are needed and these can be varied. Cheese dumplings can be served in a soup, with sauerkraut or with a salad - in fact with almost anything.

Today cheese dumplings are served and eaten throughout Austria. They are not only plain fare but also a favourite at ski huts and probably always will be.




==Ingredients==
*250 g white bread finely diced (with crust removed)
*250 ml milk
*2-3 eggs
*250 g grated cheese (Pinzgauer beer cheese, Tyrolean grey cheese )  
*50g butter
*1 onion
*pinch of salt, pepper, parsley, caraway seeds
*flour

== Directions==
Mix the eggs with the milk. Soak the white bread in the mixture. Knead and then let it rest while you brown the thinly sliced onions with butter in a pan. Add the onions, salt, pepper, parsley, caraway seeds and the grated cheese to the white bread. Add the flour and let the mixture rest for a further 10 minutes. Form dumplings that are approximately the size of a golf ball, then press them flat (about 2-3cm thick ). Forming them is eaiest when your hands are slightly wet. 
Heat some butter or oil in a pan and put in the pressed cheese dumplings. Cook them on one side and then the other until golden brown. Place the dumplings on a paper towel to absorb the excess fat. 
Finally, serve them in a beef broth, with sauerkraut or a green salad. Enjoy!

==Zwiebelrostbraten with red wine onion gravy for two persons==

[[image:ZwiebelrostbratenEnd.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Zwiebelrostbraten]]
'''Zwiebelrostbraten''' is a typical Austrian entrée and an at all times favorite dish in Austria. The meat used for Zwiebelrostbraten is traditionally a standing rib roast cut, which is called “Rostbraten” in German. There seems to be no agreement on the official translation of “Zwiebelrostbraten”, but a possible one would be &quot;onion-topped roast beef with gravy&quot;. There are numerous variations of the dish and an abundance of recipes available. One of the most common variations is “Wiener Zwiebelrostbraten” (Viennese roast beef). Its gravy is made by adding beef broth and usually butter to the juices running out of the meat during the cooking process.

My recipe, however, uses a red-wine onion gravy and is adapted from a recipe that was published in a cooking magazine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billa.at/Layouts/dd_bi_single.aspx?folderId=102055&amp;pageId=1010937&amp;RezeptID=17446#|title=&quot;frisch gekocht&quot; - cooking magazine (in German)|publisher=Billa AG|accessdate=2009-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; . The magazine's recipe uses a lot of butter during the cooking process, which raises the calorie intake per serving considerably. This recipe is a reduced-calorie version of the original, but nevertheless a flavorful one. The butter, if not left out entirely, can be replaced by healthier vegetable oil. There are no measurements in the recipe telling you how much oil should be used, but in practice, the least possible amount has worked out well without sacrificing the taste. This way, the meal can be enjoyed without having to worry about rising cholesterol levels. The meat juices mentioned above are also used in the cooking process and so their intense flavor will not go to waste. 

A standard side dish for Zwiebelrostbraten are “Bratkartoffeln” (sautéed potatoes), but the list of possible side dishes ranges from bread dumplings to vegetables or mashed potatoes. A side dish is more a question of personal taste, and therefore it is not included in this recipe. 

Although the recipe itself is rather easy, one should set aside at least 45 minutes for the cooking since the gravy takes some time to boil down. One warning before you start cooking: Be prepared to do a lot of dishes after you have finished your Zwiebelrostbraten. The Zwiebelrostbraten, however, is well worth the effort. 


==Ingredients==
[[image:ZwiebelrostbratenStart.jpg|right|thumb|180px|Zwiebelrostbraten ingredients]]
'''Sauce and topping'''
* 1 1/2 onions
* 2 garlic cloves
* 2 tsp tomato paste
* 1 tsp brown sugar
* 1 tsp Hungarian paprika
* 125 ml red-wine
* 500 ml beef broth
* vegetable oil

'''Meat'''
* 2 slices of roast beef (200 g each, standing rib roast cut)
* 1 tbsp Dijon mustard 
* salt and pepper
* vegetable oil


==Directions==

Finely chop one onion and the garlic cloves and sauté them in oil. Add tomato paste, sugar, and Hungarian paprika and let it sauté just a little before finally deglazing the pan with red wine. Add soup and let it boil down until it has achieved the desired consistency. This will take about 25 minutes. Do not forget to stir the gravy every once in a while.

While the gravy is being reduced, slightly beat the meat with a meat mallet. This helps the meat to stay tender. Then rub it in mustard and add salt and pepper. Sear the meat on both sides and cook it for another 4-5 minutes on medium heat. 

For the topping, cut about half an onion into thin onion rings. Add them to the juices remaining from the meat and let them soak up the delicious flavor. Depending on how much oil and juices there are still left in the frying pan, you might have to add some oil or water in order to let the onions absorb the flavor properly. 

Finally top the meat with the onion rings, add the gravy, and serve it with the desired side dish. Enjoy!

'''Buchteln'''

Originally, Buchteln were a Bohemian sweet dish. However, in the course of time they have become part of the traditional Austrian cuisine. 

Grammatically, a singular form of Buchteln, namely Buchtel, exists. Yet hardly anyone would make use of the singular form; somehow, the plural, Buchteln, makes more sense. 
Some say that yeast dough is a rather challenging dough to prepare. Honestly, I do not know a lot of people who have problems with it. It is probably just me who thinks that. Why is that so? What makes it challenging?  

One possible answer to that would be the use of yeast for the dough. In general, yeasts – indeed there is a plural form – can be classified as fungi. Their significant attribute is that they can ferment sugars in order to produce ethanol. They can be found on some plants and flowers, on the surface of skins as well as in the intestinal tract of warm-blooded species. It is important for us to know that yeasts are used, for instance, in the production of alcoholic beverages and in the baking industry. Firstly, in the production of beer, for example, two types of brewing exist: bottom-fermenting and top-fermenting. Top-fermenting yeasts, on the one hand, are able to produce a bigger alcohol level and need higher temperatures during the production process. Hence, they produce sweeter and ale-type beers. Bottom-fermenting yeasts, on the other hand, are able to ferment more sugars and need lower temperatures during the production process. These kinds of yeasts are used to produce lager-beers rather than ale-type beers. 
Secondly, in the baking industry yeasts are an important ingredient. Here, yeasts help with the fermentation of sugars that are either in the flour or added separately. The fermentation process emits two gases: ethanol and carbon dioxide. These two gases are the actual reason why bread dough or any kind of yeast dough rises significantly within some time. In order to get nice, fluffy dough, the right combination of flour, milk and yeast is needed.      

Coming back to the introductory question why yeast doughs are rather challenging, you could add yet another obvious reason: they are - to some extent - time consuming. This is indispensable as dough – with the yeast in it – needs to rise, and this takes some time. Today, however, no one has time to do anything, let alone to make yeast dough.

The joy for cooking and baking should be in the foreground in today’s hectic society. So, take your time and try this traditional Austrian sweet dish that I picked for you. I promise, it does not matter if you use either the singular or the plural form. As long as it tastes good, you don't have to worry.


==Ingredients==
For the dough:
* 500g flour 
* 20g yeast 
* 40g sugar 
* 120g butter 
* 2 eggs
* A pinch of salt 
* 1 lemon (lemon peel) 
* Milk (as required) 


For the filling:
* Jam (optional)


For the baking pan:
* Cooking oil or butter 


==Procedure==

[[image:dough_on_floured_surface.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Media:dough_on_floured_surface.jpg|actual size]]]]

[[image:buchteln_in_baking_pan.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Media:buchteln_in_baking_pan.jpg|actual size]]]]

# Put the yeast in a small bowl and add some lukewarm milk to it. Add a teaspoon of sugar. Let it rest for a moment, as yeast in general needs some time to ferment. 
# When ready, add it to the bowl with the flour. Put the remaining sugar into the bowl. Before adding the butter, be sure it has reached at least room temperature. Add the eggs as well as a pinch of salt. Finally, add ground lemon peel. 
# Knead it until you get nice, smooth dough. 
# Take a cloth and cover the bowl. Let it rest until it has risen significantly.  
# In the meantime, prepare a baking pan, preferably of about 5 to 10 cm height. Oil or butter the pan thoroughly. Don't spare. 
# When ready, take the dough and put it on a clean, floured surface. Roll the dough to 1cm thickness. Divide it so that you get equal quads of about 4 x 4 square centimeters each. Fill each quad with your favorite jam. Bind the 4 angles of the quad and roll it in your hand. Place the small heaps side by side in a baking pan. Cover them with a cloth once more and let them rest for 20 minutes, then put them into the oven.
# Bake them until they are golden brown. 

''Extra Tip'': 

Put some powdered sugar on top. 

For extra taste, you may also serve them with some vanilla sauce.

==Fleischkrapfen - Austrian Pasties/Empandas==

One of the most solid and traditional dishes in the region of Salzburg comes from the Pongau and is called ''Fleischkrapfen''.  ''Fleischkrapfen'' is an ideal way to make use of leftover meat.  Meat of all kinds are cut into small pieces and mixed together, used as a filling in a homemade, sealed dough pocket, which is then deep fried.

There is also a &quot;light version“ of the ''Fleischkrapfen'', which is called ''Blattlkrapfen'' or ''Hasenöhrl''. ''Hasenöhrl'' is Austrian dialect for &quot;rabbit ear“, which describes the shape of the finished item. ''Hasenöhrl'' is made nearly the same way as ''Fleischkrapfen''; the only differences are that ''Hasenöhrl'' is not filled with meat but stays empty, and that the dough of ''Hasenöhrl'' is thinner than the one that is used for the ''Fleischkrapfen''. 

''Fleischkrapfen'' are traditionally eaten during Carnival. Both dishes, ''Fleischkrapfen'' and ''Hasenöhrl'', are served with sauerkraut.

==Ingredients==
'''Dough:''' 
*200 grams rye flour
*200 grams wheat flour
*salt (to taste)
*40 grams butter
*1/4 litres milk 

'''Stuffing:''' 
*400 grams potatoes
*100 grams bacon
*400 grams smoked meat
*1 onion
*salt
*pepper
*marjoram
*parsley
*4 tbsp. butter


Shortening or oil for deep frying

==Procedure==
#For the dough, mix the two kinds of flour and season the mixture with a pinch of salt. Boil up milk and butter, then pour it over the flour and knead it quickly.
#For the stuffing, chop the onion and brown it in butter, add the chopped bacon, the smoked meat, and the boiled and chopped potatoes. Season with salt, pepper, marjoram, and parsley, and let it cool down a little. 
#Roll the dough into one 4 cm thick piece. Then cut it into 2 cm thick slices and roll into a circle with a rolling pin. Overlay one half of each dough circle with a medium amount of the filling and put the other half over it. Press the edges firmly together.
#Deep fry the ''Fleischkrapfen'', afloat in hot shortening, and fry each side until golden brown.
#Serve with [[Cookbook:Sauerkraut|sauerkraut]] on the side (see image).

'''Schweinsbraten''' (“Bratl“, roast pork)

==Background==
„Bratl“ is a traditional meal of the Austrian, Bavarian and even Bohemian cuisine. Back in the „old days“ – in fact not even a century ago – electricity was not available for the majority of households, and hence there was neither a freezer nor a fridge for food conservation. People had to come up with other ways of keeping food (especially meat) edible for more than just a couple of days. Common techniques back then were (and even today are) to pickle or to salt it. Adding herbs to the salty “bath“ gave more taste to salted meat or pork. This is the origin of the Bratl, a roasted piece of salted pork, which has become a very common dish for the rural society, especially for farmers in the Austrian regions called “Innviertel” and “Hausruckviertel”. To pickle meat or pork increased its keeping quality, but not for an unlimited time. Therefore, it was not unusual for our grandparents to be served a putrid piece of Bratl. People usually ate all of it, as nobody dared to throw away valuable food at that time. Nowadays, this would be unthinkable.

Pigs were kept on farms merely as the source for pork, whilst other livestock such as cattle was also used as draft animals. In times when taxes were paid in kind, farmers were allowed to keep a limited number of pigs for that purpose (this is the origin of the German expression “Schwein haben”, which means being lucky). The fatter the pig, the better it was. Fat was an important source of nutritional value for the hard working rural citizens. During World War II pork was rationed. In order to nourish themselves, people used to secretly slaughter pigs or cattle under the cover of the night, and therefore they did not have to let any valuable livestock to the army.

Even until the middle of the last century, farm life was determined by daily hard work which was done by farmhands and maids. The well-established hierarchical structures among the farm servants were also evident on the dining table. For example, when a Bratl was served for lunch, the biggest chunk of pork was reserved for the head of the servants (the “Großknecht”) and marked with a slice of potato on top of it. Precut pieces of Bratl were served to each person on the table and the size of the piece reflected one's position within the hierarchy of servants. After the ranking, it was everyone’s own choice how much of the lunch ration was eaten for lunch and how much was spared for dinner. Considering the hard daily work people had to do back then, this was certainly not an easy decision. Even plenty of dumplings and cabbage were not much more than a cold comfort.

Nowadays, a Bratl is a dish for social events rather than an everyday meal. Served in a tray as “Bratl in der Rein”, it is often the highlight of social get-togethers. Typical side dishes are “Stöcklkraut” (parboiled and roasted cabbage) and “Knödel” (dumplings). Even the cold Bratl is a very tasty snack, particularly in combination with bread, horseradish and a glass of beer or “Most” (a typical Austrian beverage, which is comparable to cider). This plain fare is worth a try.

Schweinsbraten is a famous, legendary and delicious Upper Austrian dish. Try this easy but tasty meat recipe!

[[image:Schweinsbraten_on_plate.JPG|right|thumb|180px]]


==Ingredients==
Makes 6 to 8 servings:
 
*1 (12-ounce) bottle of lager beer (for beer glaze)
*1 piece of pork (1,5 kg)
*8 pieces of potatoes (medium)
*2 tablespoons of caraway seeds
*a pinch of salt (to taste)
*a pinch of freshly milled black pepper (to taste) 
*1 clove garlic (crushed)
*2 yellow onions (medium)


==Procedure==

# Preheat the oven to 170 – 190°C.
#Wash the meat thoroughly and pat it dry with a paper towel. For a crispy crunch on top of the meat, cut a diamond pattern (each about 1 inch long) into the fat side.
# Rub salt, pepper and garlic well into the meat.
#Fill a roasting tray with water to a depth of 2 cm and place the meat with the fat side down in it. Sprinkle it with caraway seeds and place onion rings on it.
#Wash the peeled potatoes and place them next to the roast. Now roast the meat in the oven at 220C° for about 1 hour.
#As soon as the potatoes are soft, take them out of the dish and cover them with foil. Then turn the fat side of the meat up, sprinkle it again with caraway seeds and thinly sliced onions.
# Roast it for another 30 – 45 minutes, basting it frequently with juices from the dish or beer. If there is not enough liquid, you may add water. Only baste with little broth each time. Brush the crispy rind once more with cold beer towards the end of the cooking time. This ensures a crispy crackling.
#The meat is done when only juice oozes out (no blood), and the crust should be brown and crunchy.
#Deglaze the pan with beer and hot water and season it with salt and pepper. Scrape all browned bits sticking to the pan for a tasty sauce. Cut the meat into thin slices and arrange them with gravy, potatoes, and bread dumplings on a plate. 

==Tips==

The ideal roast gravy is brown and translucent. Don’t thicken it with flour or cornstarch. This is deemed a deadly sin for Bratl-Connoisseurs! 
To add a wonderful aroma to the gravy, pour some beer over the meat shortly before it is done.

Frittaten Soup originates from an incident that took place during the Congress of Vienna in the 19th century. This conference involved various European ambassadors and was chaired by the Austrian Prince, Klemens Wenzel von Metternich. At this time the main issues of European politics were not discussed in the conference room but during secret meetings between the key diplomats. These private meetings needed to be kept confidential. This however, was an extremely difficult task, especially in an overcrowded city like Vienna. A number of historians claim that at the time of the Congress, there were more spies in Vienna than normal residents. So, in order to avoid espionage, many ambassadors decided to hold their private meetings incognito in inns outside of the city in an area now called Lower Austria.

It was in this area, in an inn in Langenlebarn, that one of those conspiratorial meetings took place between Metternich, Prince de Lignet, the French ambassador Talleyrand, and the Sicilian ambassador Conte Romano de Frittata. 

The disguised aristocrats arrived at the inn and greeted each other in French, when to Metternich´s dismay, the innkeeper refused them entry. The problem was that the innkeeper despised the French because of the suffering of the Austrians at the hands of Napoleon’s soldiers. Unfortunately there was no other inn in the surrounding area and so Metternich was forced to disclose his Austrian identity and to try to persuade the innkeeper to at least provide the diplomats with accommodation. The innkeeper eventually accepted Metternich’s bribe and let them in, but he refused to cook for them.

The innkeeper’s stubbornness led to Metternich ordering his coachman to prepare a meal for his fellow diplomats. Yet being completely overwhelmed with this task he was only able to heat water and add spices. Fortunately, Frittata’s servant came to the coachman’s aid and mixed a batter out of milk, eggs, and salt, which he then fried in a pan. 

The soup with the cut pancakes in it was then served to the diplomats. They were content with the meal and the meeting turned out to be a complete success. Later on, the Prince of Lignet spoke of how well the &quot;soup of Frittata&quot; had been received. Therefore, one can say that this soup still serves as an excellent example of cross-national cooperation. 

==Ingredients==
[[image:frittaten_ingredients.jpg|right|thumb|180px]]
* 2 eggs
* 400 ml milk
* 180 grams flour
* salt
* butter or oil




==Procedure==
Mix the egg, milk, flour, and salt together. Heat either the butter, or alternatively the oil, in a pan. Pour some of the batter into the hot pan and wait until the pancake has solidified. Flip the pancake and wait for the other side to cook. Let it cool and then cut into thin strips. 

==Beef broth==

===Ingredients===
* 2.5 liters water
* 300 grams beef bones
* 400 grams beef
* 1 onion
* celery
* carrots
* leek
* lovage
* salt
* chives

===Procedure===
Wash the beef bones with warm water. Put the meat and bones in cold water and heat. Simmer for 1½ hours at low temperature. Skim the foam off the top of the soup from time to time and add more water if necessary. Cut the onion in half and brown it in a pan with no oil. The browned onion gives the soup its dark color. Add all the vegetables and a pinch of salt and cook for 20 minutes. Strain the remaining vegetables from the soup.

Finally, put the “Frittaten” into the soup and add some freshly-cut chives on top.

='''Vanillekipferl'''=

''Vanillekipferl'' are small almond biscuits that are shaped like a crescent moon. They are particularly popular in Austria and Germany, where they are part of the culinary delights of Christmas biscuits.

The Christmas markets in Salzburg and Vienna are some of the most popular in the world. People from all over visit these markets and want to feel the magic of the Christmas season. It is a unique atmosphere, when wandering across the Christmas markets in the snow. It is literally a feast for all senses - the glow of lights and candles, the smell of roasted chestnuts, and the taste of warm ''Glühwein'' with ''Weihnachtskeks'' (i.e., mulled claret with Christmas biscuits). All these things are part of Christmas in Austria. For those who seek for a traditional Austrian Christmas, homemade presents can be found at most markets. Decorations made out of straw, hand-knitted woollen socks, and warm biscuits right out of the oven are some of the highlights. In particular, the appeal of homemade biscuits extends beyond tourists at Christmas markets. In most Austrian homes, baking buiscuits is an essential part of Christmas preparation. Baking buiscuits belongs to the Christmas rituals as much as setting up the Christmas tree. Baking is a family activity to be enjoyed on wintry days, when it is snowing outside.  

	Austrians bake a variety of biscuits in all shapes and sizes during advent season. Ginger bread biscuits, biscuits filled with jam, biscuits layered with marzipan, and biscuits topped with pink icing sugar or walnuts are among the most popular. Who could forget one's first experiences of baking biscuits with the sweet smell of vanilla, ginger and cinnamon and then the anticipation as they turn golden brown in the oven? There is nothing quite like it to get everyone in the Christmas spirit. Additionally, baking is an activity that children enjoy, while waiting impatiently for Father Christmas or the ''Christkindl'', which is the Austrian equivalent. Children love to knead dough and cut out biscuits. They enjoy creating the distinctive shape of ''Vanillekipferl'', which is formed by rolling the dough between one's palms. What is more, no two ''Vanillekipferl'' are ever the same, since the size of palms and pressure applied vary. Although, at first, the ''Vanillekipferl'' appears to be a modest, little biscuit among all the colourful and sometimes elaborately decorated Christmas biscuits, it is a clear favourite. What makes the ''Vanillekipferl'' so special is its flavour: a unique combination of vanilla and almonds. 

	Vanilla is an expensive and exotic herb, whose aroma has enchanted people over thousands of years. Vanilla is used to flavour a wide range of desserts such as ice-cream, cake fillings, and puddings. Authentic vanilla comes from vanilla-pods. These are long pods that house the seeds of a variety of orchid which is grown in Central America, Mexico, and islands such as Tahiti and Hawaii. Vanilla-pods can be made into an alcohol solution called vanilla extract or be used to flavour sugar for baking purposes. 

	The distinctive crescent shape that makes ''Vanillekipferl'' instantly recognisable among the Christmas biscuits is based on ''Kifli'', a traditional Hungarian dish. ''Kifli'' are crescent shaped rolls made from a flour dough. The dough is cut into triangular wedges that are then wrapped and will form a crescent shape, when they are baked. Initially, they were a savoury dish, but later they were filled with nuts and served as a dessert. The origins of the shape go back to the time of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. When the Ottoman Turks stormed the city of Vienna, it was the bakers who raised the alarm, and thus saved the city from invasion. As the story goes, these bakers formed the ''Kipferl'' to symbolize the Turkish crescent moon and celebrate having successfully avoided an invasion. Whether this legend is true or not, most Austrians are unaware of this connection. They simply enjoy the taste of ''Vanillekipferl'' with a cup of hot fruit tea, coffee, or even mulled wine.

{{recipesummary|Dessert||prep: 45 min, baking: 8-10 min|2}}
==Ingredients== 
(makes approximately 50 ''Vanillekipferl'')
*350 g plain [[cookbook:flour|flour]]
*200 g cold unsalted butter
*100 g icing/powder [[cookbook:sugar|sugar]]
*100 g ground almonds 
*1 egg
*1 packet vanilla sugar 
*A pinch of salt

For coating the ''Kipferl'' after baking:
*60 g icing sugar
*2 packets of vanilla sugar 

Note: Vanilla sugar can be bought in any supermarket. Alternatively, it can be made by putting a vanilla-pod and some sugar in an airtight jar for a week or two.

==Procedure==
#Sieve the flour into a bowl.
#Cut the cold butter into slices and mix it with the flour. 
#Add icing sugar, salt, vanilla sugar, ground almonds, and egg to the mixture.
# Rinse hands in cold water, and knead the dough on a pastry board. Let the dough rest for half an hour.
#Grease a baking tray, or alternatively use a sheet of baking paper to prevent the ''Kipferl'' from sticking.
# Preheat the oven to 180 C ( 350 F/ Gas 4 ).
#Form the dough to a cylinder with a diameter of approximately 5cm, and cut off 0.5 cm thick slices. Roll them between your flat palms to form a sausage shape that is slightly tapered. Lay them in crescent shape on the baking tray, and bake them for 8-10 minutes until they are a light golden brown.
#Immediately after baking, dip the ''Kipferl'' into a mixture of icing sugar and vanilla sugar. Try some – they are delicious while still warm!
#Leave the rest out overnight, and then store them in an airtight tin.

&lt;big&gt;'''Stuffed breast of duck'''&lt;/big&gt;

==A traditional Austrian dish for the festive season==


Almost every Austrian family has its own Christmas tradition. On 24 December some families might run off to get the last presents, while others might go for a contemplative Christmas walk, attend church or engage in other activities. Christmas Eve also differs from family to family; however, as far as Christmas dinner is concerned, there seems to be less difference among Austrians. According to surveys, “Bratwürstl mit Sauerkraut”, roast duck or goose, “Raclette”, fondue, pheasant, goulash, and carp are among the most favorite Christmas Eve dishes.

I have many Austrian friends and relatives who cannot imagine Christmas without the delicious aroma of a succulent roast duck floating in the air. Nor can I recall any Christmas in my family without having this traditional winter dish. In general, Austrians are always really fond of eating duck.

Honestly, I have a strong trepidation of butchering meat, disemboweling animals, or any other action related to this unpleasant business. Unfortunately,  duck, when bought fresh at a market, often has the head and extremities still attached and they need to be removed. Nowadays, butchering animals for food appears barbaric to us since we are kept away from the act of killing animals as far as possible. Meat is presented to look like an animal as little as possible in order to make us forget the killing process. But this year I decided to face my phobia as it had already been festering for too long, and I was determined to prepare the Christmas duck with everything that it demands. 

Another fact that did not really encourage me is that I am not a good cook. I have a long history of ruining meals, and I already envisioned our kitchen full of smoke, the duck burnt, and us having to order pizza. However, the thought of eating a crispy duck roast with lots of gravy gave me the strength to accept the challenge. 

Roasting a duck is a rather time-consuming activity that can turn the most silent time of the year into a quite stressful one for the cook as expectations in a culinary delicacy are always very high. Given that Christmas should be a happy feast for everybody - also for those preparing the meal - it is always helpful to invite family members or guests to come to the kitchen and help you prepare dinner. It is also recommended to start early enough and to consider that dishes prepared in advance will reduce stress later. With this good advice in mind I undertook the preparation of our Christmas duck. 

Being occasionally helped by both my granny and my mother – three women in a single kitchen can be very stressful – I tried my best to prepare our festive family dinner. Contrary to what I had actually expected, it turned out quite well, and I think I would fearlessly make duck again since it is not as difficult as it seems. But now it is up to you to try my duck recipe! 


'''Ingredients'''

{{recipesummary|Main course|4 - 6|prep: 1 hr, cooking: 2 1/2 hrs|2}}

*1 fresh duck, about 2,5 kg
*salt and pepper
*50 g butter
*1 tbsp marjoram or other herbs
*4-5 peeled apples


Preheat the oven to 200°C and make sure to bring the duck to room temperature before roasting it. If not already done, disembowel the duck, remove the clumps of fat from the tail and rinse it carefully. As a next step, grease the bird with butter all over and season it generously inside and out with salt, pepper and marjoram. Then stuff the duck with the peeled apples and make sure to close it appropriately. This will give a wonderful taste to the finished dish.
Put the duck breast-side up into a roasting pan that is deep enough to hold the occurring fat and roast it at 230°C for around 15 minutes. Take out the duck, baste it, turn it breast-side down, and roast for another 15 minutes. Continue to do so every 15 minutes. It takes roughly an hour to roast 1kg; thus, you may prepare yourself to leave the duck in the oven for about 2 ½ hours. The duck is ready to be served when its skin is richly browned and crisp. In order to obtain a crispy skin, put some more butter on the duck 20 minutes before the end of the roasting process. Turn off the oven and let the duck rest for another 10 minutes. Remove the apples before serving it, carve the bird as you desire, and put the dark brown gravy into an extra cup.

==Side dishes==


&lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''Cabbage salad'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt;


'''Ingredients'''


*1 head of cabbage, shredded
*1 small onion, finely minced
*½ cup sugar
*1 ½ cups white vinegar
*1 tsp. of salt


Put the shredded cabbage and the minced onion into a large bowl. Combine vinegar, salt and sugar in a separate bowl and pour the mixture over the cabbage. Cover the salad and refrigerate it for several hours before serving. 



&lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''Bread dumplings'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt;


Bread dumplings, also known as [[cookbook:serviettenknödel|serviettenknödel]]n, are a very old Austrian dish. “Semmeln” is the German word for dinner rolls. Usually, these dumplings are served as a side dish with roasts or with pork, and a sauce. 

[[image:Ingredients_for_bread_dumplings.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Media:Ingredients_for_bread_dumplings
.jpg|actual size]]]]


'''Ingredients'''


*4 stale rolls, cut into small cubes
*2 eggs
*½ cup milk
*5 g melted butter
*salt
*nutmeg
*green parsley


Put the the bread cubes into a large bowl and pour milk over them; use more or less milk depending on how dry the bread is. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a pan and mix it with the eggs and the remaining ingredients in a bowl. Use your hands and squeeze the dough through your fingers until it is smooth and sticky. If the dough is too loose, add one or two tablespoons of flour to firm it up. Bring a large pot of salted water to boil and form small portions of the dough into balls. Drop the dumplings carefully into the water and let them simmer for about 30 minutes until they are light, firm, and well risen. Remove them with a large spoon and serve them hot!



[[image:Bread_dumpling_dough.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Media:Bread_dumpling_dough.jpg|actual size]]]]


'''Variation'''


Form the dough into a roll, wrap it into a wet dishtowel, and firmly tie up both ends. Then put it into a pot of boiling saltwater and let it simmer for about 30 minutes. Remove the dough from the dishtowel, cut it into generous slices, and arrange them nicely on the plate.


&lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt;'''Wine to go along with the duck'''&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

A rule that you might consider is that white wine usually goes with white meat and red wine with red meat. Therefore, a fruity red wine would go well with duck. My family often has a bottle of Zweigelt with this traditional winter treat.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''CONTENTS'''

This is an accessible chapter-by-chapter commentary on the Gospel According to Mark. It attempts to reflect a broad and even-handed presentation of scholarly opinion (ancient and contemporary) about the book. And it attempts to do so with the clarity necessary to make it fully intelligible to non-specialists in biblical studies.

Three major sections may be expected within the commentary on each chapter:

a. ''Background Information:'' i. Historical Context: What do contemporary readers need to know that author assumed his first readers probably took for granted? ii. Literary Context: How may the constituent parts of a given chapter be better appreciated by information about the structure of the book as a whole?

b. ''Explanation:'' i. Analysis: What does a verse-by-verse examination of the constituent words and phrases suggest about the meaning of the chapter? Consideration will be given to their use in the Old Testament and other nearly contemporary literature. ii. Paraphrase: In light of these considerations an expansive, highly interpretive paraphrase of each chapter will be offered. The paraphrase attempts to avoid technical, theological jargon so as to allow contemporary secular English readers to understand the point of the chapter.

c. ''Implications:'' i. Reception: How has this chapter been received and understood by readers across the centuries since its origin? ii. Influence: What are the apparent theological and practical implications of this chapter within the entire Christian canon of Scripture? What has this chapter contributed to the views of contemporary Christianity?

'''OVERVIEW'''

An overview of the Gospel of Mark

With excerpts from the text and two commentaries for exegesis

Mark’s gospel begins with Jesus’ baptism by John, (there is no birth narrative; like John, Paul, and Jesus himself, Mark is silent on the subject) and chronicles a meandering journey through Galilee and environs, preaching the immanent kingdom of God, performing miracles, and building a following from עם הארץ(''‘aM Ha`aRe&lt;u&gt;Ts&lt;/u&gt;''), which in modern Hebrew means ignoramus, but back in the day referred to unobservant Jews, the working class, and peasants, despised by the establishment - analogous to the Greeks’ δήμοις (''demois''), country rustics (the people of the άργος  (''argos'')), as distinct from the people of the άστυ (''asty'')  [all this raises tantalizing possibilities for exploration if one has an amateur’s familiarity with the subjects; for instance, Jerusalem as city-state - to teeter on the black hole of digression.]) to whom he appealed directly, by-passing the powers and principalities.  Jesus enters Jerusalem in triumph, speaks truth to power, and gets swatted like a fly.  There are no resurrection appearances in Mark (nor in any of the New Testament writings outside the Gospels), just an empty tomb.

Matthew has the birth narrative and presents a patrilineal genealogy.  The story begins in Bethlehem, not Nazareth; Nazareth is resorted to after the escape to Egypt because it is safer than Judea.  If one subscribed to an accretion theory of the synoptics, Mark would be first, then Luke, and Matthew last, all the while keeping in mind that the letters, by in large, preceded the Gospels.

Why did those who followed Jesus follow him?  Why did those who did not, not follow him?  It’s easy enough to understand why the religious establishment declined to step aside, and why Rome would murder a pretender to the throne, but what were the people thinking? What was Jesus thinking?

'''Who were the establishment?'''

“The Pharisees were perhaps the successors of those חסידים [''&lt;u&gt;H&lt;/u&gt;aSiYDiYM''] who in the second century B.C. resisted the tendency to adopt pagan culture. . . The Pharisees opposed the despotism and Sadducean tendencies of John Hyrcanus, Aristabulus, and Alexander Jannaeus, and passively resisted Herod and the Romans when religious issues were at stake.  The first-century revolutionists were principally from the Pharisaic party, though most Pharisees were pacifists . . .” &lt;small&gt;The Interpreters Bible (TIB) VII 1955 pp. 264 and 265&lt;/small&gt;

“The Pharisees were the most considerable sect among the Jews [;]… they had … the scribes and all the learned men of the law … [and] the bulk of the people … Josephus … speaks of them as existing about 144 [B.C.E].  They were probably… the most holy people … having separated themselves from the natural corruption with a design to restore and practice the pure worship of the Most High … they believed … in the resurrection.”  &lt;small&gt;Adam Clarke (A.C.) 1831 V, p. 150&lt;/small&gt;

“Sadducees ... were … political conservatives, many … [were] wealthy landowners who lived in Jerusalem and were friendly to the Roman government.  Most of the first century high priests and their friends were Sadducees ….”  &lt;small&gt;TIB VII pp. 264 and 265&lt;/small&gt;

“The Sadducees had their origin and name from one Sadoc, a disciple of Antigonus of Socho, president of the Sanhedrin, and teacher of the law in Jerusalem about 264 [BCE] … [They believed that] they should serve God [,] … not through expectation of reward but through love and filial reverence only, [there is] … no resurrection[,] [because (“Sadducees were … biblical literalists[;] ... they did not find that it is explicitly taught in the O.T.  Dan 12:2-3 does indeed teach the doctrine, but we do not know what they thought about this passage, if they took note of it.” &lt;small&gt;TIB VII p. 520&lt;/small&gt;)]   “[they] … received [only the Torah].”  &lt;small&gt;A.C. V, p. 150&lt;/small&gt;

“The Sadducees … must have been Jesus’ most dangerous enemies … The high priest and his friends, who denounced him to Pilate, belonged to this party.”  &lt;small&gt;TIB VII p. 520&lt;/small&gt; “… it is this group, more than any other Jewish group, that instigated the crucifixion of Jesus. &lt;small&gt;TIB VII p. 265&lt;/small&gt;

“A third sect … Herodians … held Herod to be the Messiah.”  &lt;small&gt;A.C. V pp. 150-151&lt;/small&gt;

The Scribes: TIB describes the Pharisees as “ardent lay followers” of the scribes.

'''What were the people expecting?'''

“. . . Rabbi Aha (ca. A.D. 320): ‘If the Israelites would repent for one day, the Messiah Son of David would come immediately.’”  &lt;small&gt;TIB VII p. 274&lt;/small&gt;

“In Judaism, ‘Messiah’ always meant the glorious future king of Israel.” &lt;small&gt;TIB VII p. 767&lt;/small&gt;

“Archelaus had been deposed in A.D. 6, and there were doubtless many who hoped for revival of the kingship, as indeed is clear from the appointment of Agrippa I in A.D. 41, and from the great prestige of Agrippa II and his influence in Jerusalem in the latter part of the century.”  &lt;small&gt;TIB VII p. 842&lt;/small&gt;

'''Excerpts from the text'''

Mark 1:14-15 “After they had arrested John [the Baptist ''YOHaNaN''; literally, “Compassionate God”] Jesus came to Galilee and preached the tidings of God, in his saying, (15) ‘Fulfilled is the time, and drawn near the kingdom of God.  Return in thought&quot; [&quot;repent&quot;, “reconsider”] and believe these tidings!”  

::In re: the time referred to in verse 15 “… the time appointed for sending the Messiah; and particularly the time specified by Daniel, Chap. IX. 24-27.” &lt;small&gt;A.C. V p.270&lt;/small&gt;

::“It is no unfit or unprofitable question . . . whence it came to pass, that there was so great a conflux of men to John the Baptist, and so ready a reception of his baptism . . . The reason is because the manifestation of the Messias was then expected, the weeks of Daniel now being expired to the last four years … And now the people were stirred up to prepare for his appearing.” &lt;small&gt;(Adam Clarke quoting Dr. Lightfoot’s Horæ Hebraicæ in Matt. iii &amp; xxviii (1812))&lt;/small&gt;

::“. . . John was at first perfectly convinced that Jesus was the Christ, yet, entertaining some hopes that he would erect a secular kingdom in Judea, wished to know whether this was likely to speedily take place.  It is very probable that John . . . began to entertain doubts relative to this kingdom which perplexed and harassed his mind…” &lt;small&gt;A.C. V, p. iii&lt;/small&gt; 

Mark 9:11 -13 “They asked him ‘Why do the Scribes say that Elijah must come first?’ (12) [He] replied to them, Elijah truly comes first and restores everything.  And how is it written of the Son of man that he will bear much, and they betray him?  (13) But I say to you, that truly Elijahy came, and they did as they pleased with him, as is written of him.”  

::“The problem which this section solved was the relation of John the Baptist with the expected Elijah, and this solution … in turn solved a problem still raised in the second century:  How can Jesus be the Messiah, since Elijah has not yet appeared.  The answer is: Elijah has appeared – in John, not in Jesus, as some people at the time had thought (8:28), but he was put to death; hence his restoration of all things has been deferred by human opposition, just as the glorification of the Son of man … will be deferred by his rejection and death; but only deferred, for both the restoration and the glorification are still sure to come to pass.  The only alternative to this interpretation … is to bracket the clause 'and restoreth all things' as a later gloss inspired by Mal. 4:6”  &lt;small&gt;TIB VII p. 779&lt;/small&gt;

::“Mark’s striking phrase – which Matthew omits – ‘Blessed be the coming kingdom of our father David’, indicates that the crowd turned a festival pilgrimage into a messianic demonstration.  Burkitt believed that this incident occurred, not at the time of Passover, but of Rededication [''&lt;u&gt;Kh&lt;/u&gt;anuka''] … and that Jesus, after his triumphal entry, cleansed the temple and ‘dedicated’ it.  Branscombe prefers Tabernacles [''sukôt''], and points out that the half-shekel dues, which made the money changers necessary, had to be collected nearly two weeks before Passover … if Jesus entered the city only a week before Passover, the money changers would already have finished their work.”  &lt;small&gt;TIB VII, pp. 502 – 503&lt;/small&gt;

::“Though he claimed the leadership of Israel, he did disclaim a kingship which was concerned with political power … the ... all-inclusive duty … to render to God the things which are God’s … for a citizen of a free republic, it involves intelligent and conscientious participation in politics, so that God’s will may be done as fully as possible.” &lt;small&gt;TIB VII p. 520&lt;/small&gt;

::“The Romans [are] … about to fall upon the Jewish state – nothing can prevent this but their conversion to God through Christ.” &lt;small&gt;A.C. V p. 205&lt;/small&gt;

::“There are many who think that, had they lived in the time of our Lord, they would not have acted toward him as the Jews did.” &lt;small&gt;A.C. V p. 203&lt;/small&gt;

::“The Parousia or return of Christ was expected at the time of the Jewish War.  But this had been a mistake, for there must first come a period of apostasy  ... followed by a mission to all nations; only then can the end come.” [in re: Matthew 24] &lt;small&gt;TIB VII p. 541&lt;/small&gt;

::“… under the reign of Nero, while Felix was procurator of Judea, imposters … were so frequent that some were taken and killed almost every day …” &lt;small&gt;A.C. V p. 207&lt;/small&gt;

Jesus, in the parables of the wicked vineyard husbandmen and the rejected invitation (Matthew 21: 33-46 and 22:1-14 respectively) asserts nothing less that that he is the successor to the throne of David.  The signs and wonders attract attention, fulfill prophecy, and persuade the masses, but the establishment has no stake in the new age.  Matthew appears to be at pains to demonstrate that Jesus failed not, by substituting the doctrine of atonement for the restoration of the throne of David, deferring fulfillment of prophecy to later, and eventually, into the doctrine of the Second Coming.  Mark, being earlier, and perceiving the death and resurrection as the immediate precursor to the fulfillment of prophecy, writes, as did the author of Daniel, in the midst of the revolution, exhorting the faithful.

:“Could these disciples have viewed the kingdom of Christ in any other light than that of a temporal one?” &lt;small&gt;A.C. V, p. 163&lt;/small&gt;

'''What was the gospel proclaimed by the twelve before the death and resurrection of Jesus?''' 

:“And teach them to observe all that I commanded you,” said Jesus at Matthew 28:20. 

:“Each who does the will of God; he is my brother, and my sister, and my mother.”  Mark 3:35.

:“The kingdom of God does not come in revelation. Nor will they say ‘Behold, it is here’ or ‘Behold, she [it] is there’, for behold, the kingdom of God, she [it] is within you.” Luke 17:20-21. [There is no “it” in Hebrew or Aramaic; there is only “he” or “she”, depending on the gender of the subject.  The value of reading the Gospels in Hebrew is the possibility that one is closer to the actual words of Jesus than one would be in Greek, assuming a Hebrew or even Aramaic oral or possibly written tradition behind the Greek.]

:“If by the spirit of God I cast out the demons, then thus has arrived unto you the kingdom of God.” Matthew 12:28.

:“Jesus . . . would have men aspire, not to what is socially expedient, but to that righteousness which will be perfectly manifest in the Kingdom of God.  His disciples are, so far as possible, to live in their age as though they were already living in the age to come.”  &lt;small&gt;TIB VII, p. 294&lt;/small&gt;

:“Matthew 6:10 equates the kingdom with the doing of God’s will on earth as it is in heaven.” &lt;small&gt;TIB VII, p. 275.&lt;/small&gt;

'''Did Jesus transcend Judaism?'''

:Mark 2:27-28 “[He] continued and said to them: ‘The Sabbath was made for the sake of the man, and not the man for the sake of the Sabbath (28) Therefore, the Son of man is also lord of Sabbath.”  “This principle, enunciated by Jesus, was later adopted by second century rabbis; in our Lord’s time it was probably something new …” &lt;small&gt;TIB VII p. 679&lt;/small&gt;

:Mark 12:28-31 “One [of] the Scribes drew near, and heard them discussing. At his seeing that Jesus replied to them better, [he] asked him, ‘Which is the commandment that [is] the first of all?’  Jesus answered, ‘Hear Israel, ''YHVH'' [is] our gods (God), ''YHVH'' is one. (30) And love ''YHVH'' your gods [God] with all your heart, and with all your life [or soul], and with al your mind, and with all your might.’ (31) ‘And the second, she is: “And love your neighbor like yourself”.  There is no other commandment greater than these.’”  “Later Rabbis insisted that there are ‘no greater and lesser commandments’, but Hillel (ca. 20 B.C.) ‘What you would not have done to yourself do not do to your neighbor: that is the whole Torah, and all the rest is commentary.’  … it is probably Jesus who first combined the two ‘great commandments’ of Deut. 6:4 and Lev 19:18b in a summary of the law, though Philo came close.”  &lt;small&gt;TIB VII pp. 846-847&lt;/small&gt;

:“Montefiore and Lowe give examples of the rabbinical doctrine that the death of the righteous atones for others.”  &lt;small&gt;TIB VII p. 497&lt;/small&gt;

:“. . . those who deny the resurrection, those who deny that the law is from God, and ‘Epicureans’, will have no share in the world to come.”  From the Mishnah, Sanhedrin 10:1 – &lt;small&gt;TIB VII, pp. 399-400&lt;/small&gt;

:“The problem was to keep unity and coherence in a community which contained Jews who were loyal to the O.T. and also an increasing number of Gentiles.  The author of Luke-Acts believed that the most satisfactory basis of union was the ‘apostolic decree’ which required Gentiles to observe certain food laws (Acts 15: 23-29)… Matthew, instead of declaring that Jesus had absolutely abolished the distinction of clean and unclean (as did Mark in 7:19), records his conviction that Peter had the power to make decisions on such matters.” &lt;small&gt;TIB VII, p. 467&lt;/small&gt;

:In re: Matthew 23:2-3 (“…The Scribes and the Pharisees sit upon the seat of Moses.  Therefore, all that they say to you, do and keep, but as their deeds do not do, for they say and they do not do.”) “…This saying may have circulated among Jewish Christians in Jerusalem who were very zealous for the O.T. law (Acts 15:5; Gal. 2:4, 12 - 14).” &lt;small&gt;TIB VII p. 528-529&lt;/small&gt;

:“There are ten portions of hypocrisy in the world, and nine of them are in Jerusalem.” A second century Rabbi.  &lt;small&gt;TIB VII p. 306&lt;/small&gt;

:“…as often as a poor man presents himself at thy door, the holy blessed God stands at his right hand.”  &lt;small&gt;Vaiyika Rabba, A. C. V p. 223&lt;/small&gt;

:“R. Judah Hakkodesh…’after three days the soul of the Messiah shall return to its body, and he shall go out of that stone in which he shall be buried …’”  &lt;small&gt;A.C. V p. 262&lt;/small&gt;

'''What was Jesus thinking?'''

Mark 10:18  “Jesus said to him ‘Why do you call to me “Good” (תוב) There is no one good but one, and He is the gods (God, האלוהים).”   

::“This question shows the primitive character of the story; later theology found it a problem, which Matthew solved by changing to ‘Why do you ask about what is good?’… Jesus had the natural attitude toward God of every pious and devout Jew.” &lt;small&gt;TIB VII p. 801&lt;/small&gt;

Mark 9:1 “[He] continued and said to them, “Believe [אםן (amen)], I say to you, that there are of those standing here that will not taste death until they see the kingdom of the gods [God] come in her glory.” 

::“This expectation was universal in the early days of Christianity, and must go back to Jesus himself; it begins to weaken only in the second century (c.f. John 21:23, II Pet. 2:4, and the Alexandrines, especially Origen, with their substitution of a ‘spiritual’ otherworldly eschatology.)” &lt;small&gt;TIB VII p. 774&lt;/small&gt;

Mark 13:30 “… I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these are.”  

::“Moses uses the word&quot; [generation] &quot;to count out a term of 38 years (DEUT. i. 35 and ii.1), which was precisely the number in the present case; for Jerusalem was destroyed about 38 years after our Lord delivered this prediction …” &lt;small&gt;A.C. V. p. 312&lt;/small&gt;

Mark 12:14 “And when you see the abomination of the desolation stand in [a] place that is not his place – unto the reader to understand – then those found in Judea should flee to the hills.” 

::“…originally the ''shiqquç shomēm'' [ השקוץ השומם] of Dan. 9:51, the desecration of the altar in the Temple by Antiochus Epiphanes in 168 B.C.  But the phrase was repeatedly reinterpreted, and here it seems to refer to Caligula’s order that his statue should be set up in the Temple … Luke thinks of the siege of Jerusalem, Mark of the antichrist at the end of the world…” &lt;small&gt;TIB VII p. 854&lt;/small&gt;

::An army marches on its stomach.  I think the repeated feeding stories were told to demonstrate that Jesus was able to assemble thousands of followers, and handle the logistics related to their tracking him all over Galilee (except on water), even to Jerusalem.  Jesus’ popularity with the crowds was such that when he provokes the authorities in the Temple, they dared not molest him.  His decision not to incite riot led to his betrayal, and enabled his enemies to do away with him.  

Mark 10:29-31 “Jesus said, “Believe (amen), I say to you, there is no man who left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for my sake and for the sake of the tidings (gospel) (30) that will not receive now, in this time, 100 fold, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and sons and fields.”  

::“Or wife is found only in later MSS; it has intruded from the parallel in Luke. [and] … Luke’s ''for the sake of the kingdom of God'' (18:29b) is probably in the direction of the original form of the saying (so Bultman) …Both Mathew and Luke omit the vivid repetition of temporal benefits – houses and brothers, a little picture of the religious fellowship of the apostolic church.” &lt;small&gt;TIB VII p. 808&lt;/small&gt; [Trading the private life for the communal life?]

Mark 10:44-45 “And he that desires to be first among you will be slave to all. (45) For even the Son of man came not in order that they serve him, rather in order to serve, to give his life [in] ransom for many.”  

::“… one of the few theological statements in Mark … the verse states the ultimate object of the Son of man’s earthly life of service and his death as a ‘ransom for many’, somewhat as the Jewish martyrs died for the redemption of their people (II Macc. 7:37-38; Macc. 17:22) … So primitive, so Jewish, so scriptural (c.f. Ia. 53), so non- (if not pre-) Pauline a phrase is likely to be pre-Markan as well … Jesus is aware of his impending destiny.  A divine necessity confronts him ... and he is prepared to accept it… This saying does not formulate a theology of the atonement, but it one of the data upon which any theology of the atonement must inevitably rest.”  &lt;small&gt;TIB VII pp. 818-819&lt;/small&gt; 

::The messianic secret may have been Jesus’ concession to God’s timetable.  Jesus was waiting and prepared for God to fulfill the scriptures, specifically the prophecy of Daniel, and to assume his role as the anointed one.  But he would not anticipate God.  When, at Jerusalem, the heavens did not open and the angelic army did not descend, Jesus accepted the fact that this would not be the occasion, and the consequences, to wit: his enemies would prevail, temporarily.

::“In Judaism ‘Messiah’ always meant the glorious future king of Israel, … but Jesus is not the Messiah – an earthly king however glorious – he is the heavenly Son of man in disguise … and indeed, in Mark’s preferred terminology, the son of God…  It is the Christian reinterpretation of the term ‘Messiah’ – Christ – that justifies its application to Jesus.”  &lt;small&gt;TIB VII p. 7&lt;/small&gt;67

I::n Mark, the kingdom of God is not taken from Jews and given to Gentiles; it is taken from one group of Jews (the Jewish religious leaders who reject Jesus) and given to another group of Jews (those who followed Jesus).

::Before the Sanhedrin: “Our Lord appears to refer to Dan. VII 13 ‘one like the son of man came with the clouds of heaven’” &lt;small&gt;A.C. V p. 241&lt;/small&gt;

::“Jesus did not willingly choose the title ‘Messiah’ because it immediately suggested armed revolt… The Son of man saying could conceivably mean, ‘I am the Messiah, but the Son of man is yet to come.’  The evangelists carefully preserved this ambiguity because there was no tradition that Jesus clearly identified himself with the heavenly Son of man.” &lt;small&gt;TIB VII p. 588&lt;/small&gt;

::At Gethsemane, was Jesus’ dread over the uncertainties of offering the people a choice between himself and the alternatives (the Pharisees, Sadducees, and Zealots)?

“::…these strong feelings were evoked, not merely [!] by the prospect of torture and death, but by the realization that his own people had rejected him.  By all human standards his mission had failed.” &lt;small&gt;TIB VII p. 579&lt;/small&gt; [But what of his expectation of resurrection and continuing to Galilee?]

::Had Judas sought to precipitate events by putting Jesus before the Sanhedrin?  Had Jesus told him to do so?  No to the latter; maybe to the former.

Mark 13:34-37 “At the third hour, Jesus shouted in loud voice ‘’eLaHiY, ‘eLaHiY , why have you forsaken me’ [in Aramaic] the translation of which is ‘My God, My God, why have you forsaken me?’”  

::On the cross, some people think he calls Elijah (אליהו ‘eLiYaHU) which means, literally, ‘My God Yahoo’ (Jehovah) rather than ‘My God’ (אלי ‘eLiY))  “The Jews believed that Elijah was the rescuer of the pious in their time of need.”  &lt;small&gt;TIB VII p. 608&lt;/small&gt;  “Elijah was daily expected to appear as the forerunner of the Messiah; whose arrival, under the character of a mighty prince, was generally supposed to be at hand throughout the East.  See Mal. iii. 23, Matt. ii. 2-4, xvii. 10-12.” &lt;small&gt;A.C. V p. 257&lt;/small&gt;

::“Josephus found three of his friends who had been crucified, several days after the fall of Jerusalem, and rescued them, but two of the three died in the physician’s hands … Twelve hours seems to have been average … one thing is clear, [in] Christ’s intense mental and physical suffering … we have here … an expression … of loneliness and perplexity over the betrayal, the desertion, and the Cross.”  &lt;small&gt;TIB VII p. 906&lt;/small&gt;

In Mark “the whole evidence for the resurrection of Jesus goes back to the ‘wrought up imagination of a group of hysterical women’ … Mark does not present any account of a resurrection appearance – and it is even possible … to think that he referred (in verse 7) …to the final Parousia.” &lt;small&gt;TIB VII p. 911&lt;/small&gt;

Mark 16:8 “They exited and ran from the tomb, for trembling and shock grabbed them, and [did] not tell a word to [any] man [לאיש (anyone)] because they panicked.”  

::“And they said nothing … helps us to account for the absence of any reference to the empty tomb in the earliest surviving literature in the N.T, e.g., in Paul, or indeed anywhere in the N.T. except in the Gospels” &lt;small&gt;TIB VII p. 915&lt;/small&gt;

::[&lt;u&gt;Note that this is not relevant to the resurrection - Paul bet his life on that - only to the story of the empty tomb&lt;/u&gt;.] 

::Jesus’ victory at the time was establishing the principle that the kingdom of God is available anywhere and anytime one elects to become a citizen of that kingdom.  At the apocalypse, when the kingdom of God is manifest even to those who do not elect it, those who have elected it will already been in it.  In Mark the doctrine of atonement does not exist; Jesus’ death is that of a martyr for a righteous cause that lives forever and is destined to prevail.

'''Conclusion'''

Both Matthew and Mark reinforce my bias and prejudice that Daniel explains more about the expectations and actions of those living in Israel in the first century than any other book in the Bible.  The apocalypse is predicted, and all the precursor events have occurred, all that remains is the fulfillment of the promise that if the people will but turn to God, God will restore the throne of David once and for all (which the Hasemoneans almost accomplished), and relieve the Israelites of the cycle of victory and defeat they have suffered repeatedly since they first became His chosen people (the end of time).

A more entertaining use of my values-laden selectivity in proof-texting may be these tasty morsels I turned up in the commentaries:

In re: Matthew 19:12  (“There are eunuchs that were born such from the belly of their mother, there are eunuchs that were made eunuchs, by the hands of men, there are eunuchs that made themselves eunuchs, for the sake of the kingdom of heaven.  Whoever has in their ability to receive, let him receive.”): “The great Origen, understanding the latter clause of this verse … literally, O human weakness! fulfilled it on himself.”  &lt;small&gt;A.C. V. p. 172&lt;/small&gt;

A neat rationale to the apparent inequity of the master in the parable of the workers hired to work in the vineyard (Matthew 20): “The employer is thinking of the workers’ needs.  If they go home with wages for only a single hour, their families cannot be fed.”  &lt;small&gt;TIB VII p.491&lt;/small&gt;

In re: the parable on the basis of the last judgment at Matthew 25:31-46: “The most striking note of the parable is that on judgment Day some men will discover that, although they have not know it, they have been on God’s side all the time.” &lt;small&gt;TIB VII p. 562&lt;/small&gt;

      <comment>Specifying paths</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Specifying paths ==

This is an ugly hack at the moment, requiring 3 alternative parameters, depending on whether the path passed is relative, absolute, or a plain template name. Since I am expecting most people to want to transclude subpages of their book, the default if the path is taken from parameter 2 (rather than a named parameter) is assumed to be relative paths. The other options are less tested. Improvements welcome! [[User:HYanWong|HYanWong]] ([[User talk:HYanWong|talk]]) 23:20, 18 December 2008 (UTC)</text>

At the bottom of the book it says that it is in the categories, &quot;A guide to identifying rocks and minerals&quot;, and geology. It is supposed to be in geology, but I think that when I added it to geology I accidentally created the category &quot;A guide to identifying rocks and minerals&quot;, and I was wondering how to delete it.--[[User:Summergirl|summergirl]] ([[User talk:Summergirl|talk]]) 18:17, 6 May 2009 (UTC)</text>

|When [[Statistical_Analysis:_an_Introduction_using_R/R/Accessing elements of vectors|accessing elements of vectors]], we saw how to use a simple logical expression involving the less than sign (&lt;code&gt;&lt;&lt;/code&gt;) to produce a ''logical vector'', which could then be used to select elements less than a certain value. This type of logical operation is very useful thing to be able to do. As well as &lt;code&gt;&lt;&lt;/code&gt;, there are a handful of other ''comparison operators''. Here is the full set (See &lt;code&gt;?Comparison&lt;/code&gt; for more details)
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;&lt;/code&gt; (less than) and &lt;code&gt;&lt;{{=}}&lt;/code&gt; (less than or equal to)
* &lt;code&gt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (greater than) and &lt;code&gt;&gt;{{=}}&lt;/code&gt; (greater than or equal to)
* &lt;code&gt;{{=}}{{=}}&lt;/code&gt; (equal to&lt;ref&gt;Note that, when using continuous (fractional) numbers, rounding error may mean that results of calculations are not ''exactly'' equal to each other, even if they seem as if they should be. For this reason, you should be careful when using  {{=}}{{=}} with continuous numbers. R provides the function ''all.equal'' to help in this case&lt;/ref&gt;) and &lt;code&gt;!{{=}}&lt;/code&gt; (not equal to)
Even more flexibility can be gained by ''combining'' logical vectors using '''and''', '''or''', and '''not'''. For example, we might want to identify which US states have an area less than 10 000 '''or''' greater than 100 000 square miles, or to identify which have an area greater than 100 000 square miles '''and''' which have a short name. The code below shows how can be used to do this, using the following R symbols:
* &lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; (&quot;and&quot;)
* &lt;code&gt;{{!}}&lt;/code&gt; (&quot;or&quot;)
* &lt;code&gt;!&lt;/code&gt; (&quot;not&quot;)
When using logical vectors, the following functions are particularly useful, as illustrated below
* &lt;code&gt;which()&lt;/code&gt; identifies which elements of a logical vector are &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt;
* &lt;code&gt;sum()&lt;/code&gt; can be used to give the number of elements of a logical vector which are &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt;. This is because &lt;code&gt;sum()&lt;/code&gt; forces its input to be converted to numbers, and if TRUE and FALSE are converted to numbers, they take the values 1 and 0 respectively.
* &lt;code&gt;ifelse()&lt;/code&gt; returns different values depending on whether each element of a logical vector is TRUE or FALSE. Specifically, a command such as &lt;code&gt;ifelse(aLogicalVector, vectorT, vectorF)&lt;/code&gt; takes &lt;code&gt;aLogicalVector&lt;/code&gt; and returns, for each element that is &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt;, the corresponding element from &lt;code&gt;vectorT&lt;/code&gt;, and for each element that is &lt;code&gt;FALSE&lt;/code&gt;, the corresponding element from &lt;code&gt;vectorF&lt;/code&gt;. An extra elaboration is that if &lt;code&gt;vectorT&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;vectorF&lt;/code&gt; are shorter than &lt;code&gt;aLogicalVector&lt;/code&gt; they are extended by duplication to the correct length.|### In these examples, we'll reuse the American states data, especially the state names
### To remind yourself of them, you might want to look at the vector &quot;state.names&quot;

nchar(state.name)       # nchar() returns the number of characters in strings of text ...
nchar(state.name) &lt;{{=}} 6  #so this indicates which states have names of 6 letters or fewer
ShortName &lt;- nchar(state.name) &lt;{{=}} 6         #store this logical vector for future use
sum(ShortName)          #With a logical vector, sum() tells us how many are TRUE (11 here)
which(ShortName)        #These are the positions of the 11 elements which have short names
state.name[ShortName]   #Use the index operator [] on the original vector to get the names
state.abb[ShortName]    #Or even on other vectors (e.g. the 2 letter state abbreviations)

isSmall &lt;- state.area &lt; 10000  #Store a logical vector indicating states &lt;10000 sq. miles
isHuge  &lt;- state.area &gt; 100000 #And another for states &gt;100000 square miles in area
sum(isSmall)                   #there are 8 &quot;small&quot; states
sum(isHuge)                    #coincidentally, there are also 8 &quot;huge&quot; states

state.name[isSmall {{!}} isHuge]   # {{!}} means OR. So these are states which are small OR huge
state.name[isHuge &amp; ShortName] # &amp; means AND. So these are huge AND with a short name
state.name[isHuge &amp; !ShortName]# ! means NOT. So these are huge and with a longer name

### Examples of ifelse() ###

ifelse(ShortName, state.name, state.abb) #mix short names with abbreviations for long ones
# (think of this as &quot;*if* ShortName is TRUE then use state.name *else* use state.abb)

### Many functions in R increase input vectors to the correct size by duplication ###
ifelse(ShortName, state.name, &quot;tooBIG&quot;)   #A silly example: the 3rd argument is duplicated
size &lt;- ifelse(isSmall, &quot;small&quot;, &quot;large&quot;) #A more useful example, for both 2nd &amp; 3rd args
size                                      #might be useful as an indicator variable?             
ifelse(size{{=}}{{=}}&quot;large&quot;, ifelse(isHuge, &quot;huge&quot;, &quot;medium&quot;), &quot;small&quot;) #A more complex example

|If you have done any computer programming, you may be more used to dealing with logic in the context of &quot;if&quot; statements. While R also has an &lt;code&gt;if()&lt;/code&gt; statement, it is less useful when dealing with vectors. For example, the following R expression
 if(aVariable {{=}}{{=}} 0) then print(&quot;zero&quot;) else print(&quot;not zero&quot;)
expects &lt;code&gt;aVariable&lt;/code&gt; to be a single number: it outputs &quot;zero&quot; if this number is 0, or &quot;not zero&quot; if it is a number other than zero&lt;ref&gt;But unlike &lt;code&gt;ifelse&lt;/code&gt;, it can't cope with &lt;code&gt;NA&lt;/code&gt; values&lt;/ref&gt;. If &lt;code&gt;aVariable&lt;/code&gt; is a vector of 2 values or more, only the first element counts: everything else is ignored&lt;ref&gt;For this reason, using &lt;code&gt;{{=}}{{=}}&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statements may not be a good idea, see the Note in &lt;code&gt;?&quot;==&quot;&lt;/code&gt; for details.&lt;/ref&gt;. There are also logical operators which ignore everything but the first element of a vector: these are &lt;code&gt; &amp;&amp;&lt;/code&gt; for AND and &lt;code&gt;{{!}}{{!}}&lt;/code&gt; for OR&lt;ref&gt;These are particularly used in more advanced computer programming in R, see ?&quot;&amp;&amp;&quot; for details&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">If you are not sure what a complex is or would like to recap, look [[OCR Advanced GCE in Chemistry/Periodic Table: Transition elements|here]].

Using the concepts learnt in the trends and patterns module we can now develop those and look further into ligands and complexes

== Complexes and shape ==
For the trends and patterns module we learnt about complexes consisting of ligands donating a lone pair of electrons to a central metal ion. This is called a monodentate ligand, meaning that each of the ligands donate one lone pair of electrons. The total number of coordinate bonds made by the donating of electron pairs is called the coordination number and the overall charge is a combination of the ligand charges and the metal ion charge. In this module it is required to know more about the different types of ligands which make up complexes:

* Monodentate ligands - Donate one pair of electrons to the central metal ion e.g. H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, CO, Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

* Bi dentate ligands - Donate two pairs of electrons to the central metal ion e.g. NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - ethane-1,2-diamine (en)

* If a ligand is donating more than one pair of electrons it will usually be known as polydentate e.g. en, EDTA

[[File:Ethylenediamine-3D-balls.png|thumb|200px|ethane-1,2-diamine]]

ethane-1,2-diamine is usually shortened to en when it is a ligand (this is acceptable in exams). (Looking right) There are two ammine groups (blue) that each have a lone pair of electrons. They both donate electrons in complexes so one molecule of en will form two coordinate bonds, hence bidentate. en can be put in a complex as any other ligand:
 
e.g. [Ni(en)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;

When the coordination number is four there are two different shapes:

* Square planar

* Tetrahedral

When the coordination number is six the complex is octahedral

== Isomerism ==
As with the organic chemistry modules, in complexes there is stereoisomers and optical isomers:

[[File:Cisplatin-2D.png|thumb|200px|''Cis-platin'']]
=== Stereoisomerism ===
In octahedral complexes (with 4 of one ligand and 2 of another) and square planar complexes (with 2 of one ligand and two of another) there are two different arrangements of the same atoms with the same bonds. These different arrangements are called ''cis'' and ''trans'':

* In ''cis'' molecules the 2 ligands are on the same side of the complex. This means that in both octahedral and square planar complexes the bond angle between the two like ligands will be 90 degrees.

* In ''trans'' molecules the similar ligands are on the opposite sides of the molecules so the bond angle is 180 degrees.

Tetrahedral molecules do not show stereoisomerism

'''''Cis''-platin''' - This chemical is used as an anti-cancer drug because it can bind to the DNA of fast growing cells and prevent correct replication. The ''trans'' form of this chemical is not as effective at binding to the DNA so it is very important that the ''cis'' form is used.

[[File:Chirality with hands.jpg|thumb|200px|example of optical isomerism (not a complex!)]]
=== Optical Isomerism ===
You should be familiar with the idea of optical isomerism from AS organic chemistry. When two molecules have the same atoms and bonds but are a mirror image of each other, they are not super imposable and are said to be optical isomers.

If you shine light through pure solutions of each optical isomer they would rotate the plane of polarised light in opposite directions. When they are together this effect is cancelled out.

== Questions ==
1. What is a monodentate ligand?

2. How many coordinate bonds does an en ligand form in a complex?

3. What is ''cis''-platin used for? why not ''trans''?

4. Draw a the shape of a tetrahedral complex

5. What is the bond angle between two of the same ligand if there are 4 different ligands in a ''trans'' octahedral complex?

6. If i have two samples of a complex how can i test to find if they are the same optical isomers?

      <text xml:space="preserve">First review the section on colour in the trends and patterns module:[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OCR_Advanced_GCE_in_Chemistry/Periodic_Table:_Transition_elements]

== 3d Subshell ==
[[File:D orbitals.svg|thumb|200px|Orbitals in the 3d subshell]]
All five orbitals in the 3d subshell have two electrons each and are all at the same energy level (degenerate). However as we are about to find out this is only when the atom or ion involved is isolated (not bonded with anything else). Electrons will fill any of these orbitals in transitional atoms or ions and will fill each one before pairing. 

d-orbital splitting: This is where the d-orbitals are in an (octahedral) transition metal complex so are no longer isolated. Six coordinate bonds are formed along the same axis as the 3d&lt;sub&gt;z2&lt;/sub&gt; and 3d&lt;sub&gt;x2y2&lt;/sub&gt; orbitals. Consequently, these orbitals are of higher energy than the other orbitals. This creates a higher tier energy level orbitals with an energy gap between them and the lower energy orbitals and is labelled ΔE.

== Electron promotion ==
If a transition element complex has at least one electron in a lower energy orbital and at least one space in a higher energy orbital the electron can jump to the higher energy orbital. This requires energy though, that's why light is needed. The energy gap ΔE previously described is the amount of energy from absorbed light required to allow a promotion. According to quantum theory and the equation [[/e=hf/]], the energy of light is proportional to its wavelength. Therefore the amount of energy for a particular promotion will correspond to a certain wavelength (and therefore colour) of light. Transitional metals absorb wavelengths of light which are in humans visible range so we see colour.

If a particular wavelength of light is absorbed by the complex for electron promotion then the light reflected will be without that wavelength so will appear a different colour to white (all wavelengths).

Using the colour wheel from the trends and patterns module we can work out the colour of a complex solution that requires 4*10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt;J for a promotion:

green light has energy 4*10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt;J so green is absorbed and reflected light appears violet.

Compounds that do not fit the criteria explained above will be white e.g.  Cu+ compounds are colourless because the electron configuration is [Ar]3d&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;4s&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;. As the 3d subshell is full there cannot be electron promotion.

== Changes in colour from ligand exchange ==
If ligands are substituted the E gap may increase or decrease, this will change the frequency of light absorbed from white light:

* If the energy gap becomes smaller the energy, and therefore frequency, of light absorbed will go down. This light will have a greater wavelength e.g. blue--&gt;green light absorbed so yellow---&gt;red viewed.

* If the energy gap increases the frequency of light needed increases. The wavelength of absorbed light decreases e.g. orange ---&gt; blue absorbed, blue ---&gt; yellow viewed

Remember: With all waves Velocity = Frequency X wavelength 

Also, when a reactant is added to a complex a reduction or oxidation reaction could also occur with the transitional metal. This could also change the colour of the solution.

== Metal complex uses and spectra ==
[[File:Phthalocyanine Blue BN.png|thumb|200px|Phthalocyanine Blue BN]]
Transitional elements are used for their colours in pigments for their brilliance in colour and for pure white:

* TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is used in white paint as it is excellent at hiding other colours beneath

* Phthalocyanine Blue BN is used for brilliant blue in paint and dyes - it is very stable

'''Visible spectrometry''' can be used to predict the colour of a transition metal complex. A graph can be drawn using a visible spectrometer for a complex and the relative absorbance of each wavelength can be identified.

== Questions ==
1. What can we call the orbitals of an isolated transition metal atom/ion?

2. Why does d-orbital splitting happen?

3. Which d-orbitals are the higher energy ones? draw them

4. What does the energy gap correspond to?

5. How can i change the energy gap and what will it do?

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Vanadium ==
Vanadium is a silver-grey metal which is very resistant to corrosion.  

It can form compounds in the +5,+4,+3 and +2 oxidation states

== Chromium ==







== Cobalt ==
Cobalt (Atomic no 27 relative mass no 59) is an unreactive white metal with a slight blue appearance and forms compounds with +2 and +3 oxidation states. The +2 state is usually the most stable.

===Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;===
Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; forms the complex molecule [Co(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; which is a pink octahedral complex ion. 

Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; also forms the tetrahedral complex ion [CoCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; which is blue.

Cobalt chloride paper can therefore be used to test for water because the complex [Co(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is formed. This causes the blue cobalt chloride paper to turn pink.

This reaction is an equilibrium reaction:

[CoCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + 6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l) &lt;---&gt; [Co(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + 4Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;(aq)

The reaction is exothermic in the forward reaction. By adding either heat or a high concentration of Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; the reverse ligand substitution reaction will occur.

===Co&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;===
Co&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; forms the aqueous complex [Co(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; which is blue but is so easily reduced to [Co(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; that we do not really look at it. Other simple compound of Co&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; become hydrated and are reduced in the same way.

Co&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; does however make other complex ions with different ligands and they prove to be very stable indeed:

e.g. 

[Co(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;---&gt; [Co(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;; E= +1.81V

[Co(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;---&gt; [Co(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;; E= +0.11V

Here the Electrode potential values show that the Co&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; complex without H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ligands (Hexaamminecobalt ll) is the more stable. This is because ammonia has only one lone pair of electrons resulting in stronger dative bonds.

      <comment>[[pl:Baskijski/Wymowa]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Basque pronunciation is quite straightforward and easy for native speakers of English and most Western European languages. As with all languages, there are various dialectical variations in pronunciation, of which only a few should really be noted by the learner (the rest being much more localized phenomena that are peculiarities of specific dialects).

&lt;big&gt;''Vowels''&lt;/big&gt;

Batua, similar to Spanish, has five distinct vowel sounds: a, e, i, o, u. Vowel length is not phonemical (i.e. you can't distinguish between words based exclusively on the length of a vowel) and vowels should always be pronounced clearly and crisply, not weakened into a schwa (the vowel in the word ''the'') or ellided completely. The vowel sounds are:

[a] as is ''father''

[e] as in ''get''

[i] as the '''ee''' in ''beet''

[o] as in ''don't'' (but note here that in NA English, we have a tendency to pronounce this with a ''w'' at the end, which is not done in Basque)

[u] as the '''o''' in ''move''

There is also one diphthong (combination of a vowel and semi-vowel) that is represented by the digraph (two letters) '''eu'''. It is pronounced like the ''e'' sound quickly followed by an English ''w''. You'll have lots of practice of this sound, as it occurs in the name of the language: '''euskara'''.

Again, the vowel ü might occur in some of the northern dialects, but not in the standard Batua. It is pronounced like the same letter in German, or the French ''u''.

&lt;big&gt;''Consonants''&lt;/big&gt;

Here, again, there is a remarkable amount of overlap with the English system of consonants. For this reason, it is probably best to concentrate on differences, rather than similarities. In this way, it is easier to focus on getting the few unique sounds down correctly rather than trying to memorize the entire system.

'''g''' is always what linguists call a stop, and what most non-technical books call ''hard''. That means that even before e and i, it is pronounced like the g in ''go''. Note that some people also do what is done in Castillian Spanish and use a sound represented by the Greek gamma γ whenever '''g''' appears between vowels. This sounds similar to the Parisian gargled r. Even if you don't use this sound, however, your Basque will be neither incomprehensible nor strange-sounding.

'''h''' is generally silent in the South (Spanish areas) and is pronounced just like in English in the French areas. 

'''j''' is pronounced like the Spanish '''j''', which is similar to the ''ch'' in ''Bach'', in the southern part of the Basque Country. In the northern part, it is pronounced like the ''s'' in ''pleasure''.

'''ñ''' is pronounced the same as in Spanish: like the ''ni'' in ''onion''.

'''r''' is, for the most part, a short tap when it occurs anywhere other than at the beginning of a word, much the way it does in Spanish. You will likely notice that it sounds just like the Parisian r when people from the north speak Basque; I am not sure if this is just the effect of French pronunciation on Basque, or a feature of the northern dialects themselves.

'''rr''' is a trilled r, similar to the one in Spanish. It comes from the back of the throat, not the front (as in Italian). Note that this is also the sound of a single '''r''' when it occurs at the start of the word.

'''s''' is probably the trickiest sound of all. It is not like the English s, but rather like the one used in Castillian Spanish. It sort of sounds like English ''sh'', but is much softer. In effect, it is produced by putting the tip of your tongue at the back of your top front teeth when saying ''s''. It takes a bit of practice.

'''x''' is pronounced like ''sh'' in ''ship''.

'''z''' is always pronounced like ''s'' in ''silent'' and never like ''z'' in ''zoo'' or ''pizza''.

&lt;big&gt;''Palatalization''&lt;/big&gt;

One last feature of Basque that should be mentioned is called palatalization. This occurs when a sound like n or l has a slight ''y'' sound tacked on the end. In Basque, it might be represented by the special characters ll or ñ, but it could also occur because an ''i'' either precedes or follows the letter l or n, as in ''koilara'', which means spoon.

= Smyslov/Karpov Variation =
==4...Nd7==
By developing his Knight rather than the Bishop, Black aims to trade for White's central Knight, without compromising his pawn structure.

At one time named after the first world champion Wilhelm Steinitz, nowadays the variation is more often referred to as the Smyslov Variation after the seventh world champion Vasily Smyslov who played a number of notable games with it, or the Karpov Variation, after the twelfth World Champion Anatoly Karpov, in whose repertoire it appeared quite often. The short-term goal of 4...Nd7 is to ease development by the early exchange of a pair of Knights without compromising the structural integrity of his position. Play is similar to the Classical Variation except that Black has more freedom by delaying the development of his bishop, and is not forced to play it to the g6 square. However, this freedom comes at a cost as White enjoys added freedom in taking up space in the center, and often plays the aggressive 5.Ng5!? where Black's development is brought into question as well as the positional weakness of the f7-square. The famous last game of the Deep Blue-Garry Kasparov rematch where Kasparov committed a known blunder and lost was played in this very line.

This template is used to add extra newlines to adjust page breaks in PDFs of individual [[Spanish by Choice]] lessons. Please make sure that you know very well what you are doing when you modify this template! In particular, make sure that the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag is in the first line except for short periods of time when you generate a PDF.

The work flow to generate a PDF is this:
#move the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag in {{tl|SbcNewline2}} to the second line
#generate a PDF from the Print version of a lesson, for example with the PDF printing of FireFox on MacOS X (letter format, centered page number)
#adjust the {{tl|SbcNewline2}} templates in the lesson to ensure nice page breaks
#iterate the PDF generation and the adjustment of the {{tl|SbcNewline2}} templates until you are satisfied (don't be too pedantic but at least avoid page breaks after section headings)
#postprocess the PDF (compression, web preview)
#move the &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tag in {{tl|SbcNewline2}} to the first line

      <text xml:space="preserve">Jesse Gould Hawkins:  Born about 1799 place unknown.
Jesse Married Sally Clarissa Hubbell 
Born 1800 CT. Daughter of Andrew Read Hubbell &amp; Lucy (?) Hubbell of CT.
Jesse &amp; Sally are on the 1830 census of Edmeston, Otsego N.Y. 
Jesse was a farmer, also from the town minutes he was an overseer of Highways in 1826 &amp; again in 1833-34. Meaning that he made sure the farmers along his road or roads worked a number of days a year, keeping up the road or roads. Jesse &amp; family later moved to Streetsboro Portage Co. Ohio Abt. 1838.

Andrew Read Hubbell father -in- law to Jesse was also included in the town minutes, he was also a overseer of highways a couple years &amp; also a fence viewer. Andrew &amp; Lucy Died 1850's Ostego Co. New York?


Also mentioned in the minutes are:

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==
A quadratic equation is any equation of the form &lt;math&gt;ax^2 + bx + c = 0&lt;/math&gt;. All quadratics have two solutions, or roots. Remember from [[C1]] that these roots may be equal, or not even real! We can also factorise a quadratic, to express it as two linear factors. This chapter is concerned with the roots of various quadratics, and the relationships between the roots.

{{User:DTR/Example|
&lt;math&gt;x^2+7x+10 = 0&lt;/math&gt; can be factorised to give &lt;math&gt;(x+2)(x+5) = 0&lt;/math&gt;. This means the roots are -2 and -5.

Likewise, &lt;math&gt;x^2+6x+9 = 0&lt;/math&gt; ⇒ &lt;math&gt;(x+3)(x+3) = 0.&lt;/math&gt; This means the roots are -3 and -3: a repeated root, because the quadratic is a perfect square.
}}

So that we can refer to and manipulate the roots, we denote them with the Greek letters &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt;, pronounced alpha and beta, respectively. [[It can be shown that]] the sum of the roots, &lt;math&gt;\alpha + \beta = \frac{-b}{a} &lt;/math&gt;. [[Also]], the product of the roots, &lt;math&gt;\alpha \beta = \frac{c}{a}&lt;/math&gt;.

===General Form===

{{User:DTR/Example|
The general form of a quadratic with roots &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;x^2 - (\alpha + \beta)x + (\alpha\beta) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Or, in a more comprehensible form, &lt;math&gt;x^2 - (sum\ of\ roots)x + (product\ of\ roots) = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

'''T'''he Ordovician period opened with no sedimentary break from the Cambrian, but is nevertheless distinct because the fossil assemblage changes drastically. Many Cambrian marine species disappeared or were greatly reduced in numbers in what has been called the Cambrian-Ordovician Extinction Event ([[w:Cambrian-Ordovician_extinction_events|Wikipedia article]]). The most useful group for dating the Cambrian-Ordovician boundary is the Brachiopods. This group was dominantly composed of inarticulated forms (lacking a specific hinge structure between the shell halves) during the Cambrian, but the relative abundance is reversed at the beginning of the Ordovician. The hinge may have provided some added protection against predators, which were now beginning to appear in the fossil record. 

The Ordovician period opened with the Cambrian Sauk Seas still dominating the landscape. The Sauk transgression reached its maximum extent during Early Ordovician time, then began a slow regression that culminated in the complete removal of the epeiric sea at the end of the Early Ordovician. It is thought that this regression represents a period of cratonic uplift due to tectonic forces. The regression of the Sauk Seas left behind a blanket deposit of shoreline sandstones that represent erosion of the newly emerged craton. 

This exposure of the craton to subaerial erosion appears to have lasted for a very long time. No depositional sequence exists by which we may determine exactly how much time is missing, but the fossil record suggests it was many millions of years. During this time, what little geographic relief the craton possessed was eroded down, and the clastic remnants of that erosion are present in the sand layer. The flat, sand covered surface was extensively reworked by erosional forces, and eventually became quite uniform in composition across wide areas of the craton.

Then &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a polynomial.'' (Hint: Baire's category theorem.)

'''Exercise''' ''&lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; are irrational numbers. Moreover, &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is neither an algebraic number nor p-adic number, yet &lt;math&gt;e^p&lt;/math&gt; is a p-adic number for all p except for 2.''

'''Exercise''' ''There exists a nonempty perfect subset of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf R&lt;/math&gt; that contains no rational numbers. (Hint: Use the proof that e is irrational.)''

'''Exercise''' ''Construct a sequence &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; of positive numbers such that &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n \ge 1} a_n&lt;/math&gt; converges, yet &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} {a_{n+1} \over a_n}&lt;/math&gt; does not exist.''

'''Exercise''' ''Let &lt;math&gt;a_n&lt;/math&gt; be a sequence of positive numbers. If &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n \to \infty} n \left({a_n \over a_{n+1}} - 1 \right) &gt; 1&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=1}^\infty a_n&lt;/math&gt; converges.''

'''Exercise''' ''Prove that a convex function is continuous &lt;big&gt;(&lt;/big&gt;Recall that a function &lt;math&gt;f: (a,b) \rightarrow \mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt; is a ''convex function'' if for all &lt;math&gt;x,y \in (a,b)&lt;/math&gt; and all &lt;math&gt;s,t \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;s+t = 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;f(sx+ty) \leq sf(x)+tf(y)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;big&gt;)&lt;/big&gt;''

'''Exercise''' ''Prove that every continuous function ''f'' which maps [0,1] into itself has at least one fixed point, that is &lt;math&gt;\exists p \in [0,1]&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(p) = p&lt;/math&gt;''&lt;br /&gt;
Proof: Let &lt;math&gt;g(x) = x - f(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Then 

'''Exercise''' ''Prove that the space of continuous functions on an interval has the cardinality of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{R}&lt;/math&gt;''

|When collecting data, it is often the case that certain data points are unknown. This happens for a variety of reasons. For example, when analysing experimental data, we might be recording a number of variables for each experiment  (e.g. ''temperature'', ''time of day'', etc.), yet have forgotten (or been unable) to record ''temperature'' in one instance. Or when collecting social data on US states, it might be that certain states do not record certain statistics of interest. Another example is the ship passenger data from the sinking of the Titanic, where careful research has identified the ticket class of all 2207 people on board, but not been able to ascertain the age of 10 or so of the victims (see http://www.encyclopedia-titanica.org).
We could just omit missing data, but in many cases, we have information for ''some'' variables, but not for others. For example, we might not want to completely omit a US state from an analysis, just because it it missing one particular datum of interest. For this reason, R provides a special value, ''NA'', meaning &quot;not available&quot;. Any vector, numeric, character, or logical, can have elements which are ''NA''. These can be identified by the function &quot;is.na&quot;. 
|some.missing &lt;- c(1,NA)
is.na(some.missing)
|some.missing &lt;- c(1,NA)
is.na(some.missing)
[1] FALSE  TRUE
|Note that some analyses are hard to do if there are missing data. You can use &quot;complete.cases&quot; or &quot;na.omit&quot; to construct datasets with the missing values omitted.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The mole equation ==

Moles = Mass divided by the realitive atomic mass

Moles = Concentration x Volume, if this volume is in cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; the answer must be divided by 1000!

You may be required to rearrange the equation in the exam, remember this!!

== Equilibria ==

Reactions that have both a forward and reverse reaction

;Dynamic equilibrium: A reaction that has both a forward and reverse which occurs at the same rate
;Le Chatlier`s principle: When conditions on a system in equilibrium are changed, equilibrium will move to minimise the effect of the change.
When the pressure is increased equilibrium moves in the direction of the fewest molecules.
If the temperature is increased, equilibrium moves in the direction of the endothermic reaction.

== Rates of reaction ==
To increase the rate:
* Increase the temperature.
*: Particles have more energy, therefore move faster, collide more often, with energy which exceeds the activation energy.
* Increase the concentration/pressure (Same marking point in exams).
*: Increases the number of collisions, therefore more successful collisions.
* Use of a Catalyst.
*: Offers an alternative route with a lower activation energy.
* Use smaller particles/larger surface area.
*: Increases the chance of collisions

== The collision theory ==

Chemical reactions happen when particles collide. Particles must collide with sufficient energy (the activation energy).

;Activation energy: The minimum amount of energy required for particles to react.

;Effect of a Catalyst: Adding a catalyst will speed up the rate of the forward and reverse action EQUALLY. Therefore no effect on the yield. However more product is made in a shorter amount of time.

;Increasing Temperature: The system will try to decrease temperature in the forward direction it's exothermic. Therefore the system absorbs the heat (reverse direction) = endothermic therefore the equilibrium position moves to the left.

== The Boltzmann distribution model ==

Please follow the internal link, you need to know;
* The title of the X and Y axes (X=Number of particles/molecules (both accepted by examiners) Y= Energy)
*The shape of the curve
*Where the activation energy lies (E&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;)
*Where the activation energy with a catalyst lies (E&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;CAT&lt;/sub&gt;)
*The affect of an increase in temperature (Moves the right and down)
*The affect of a decrease in temperature (Moves the left and up)

== Orders of reaction ==

* 1st Order - Doubling the concentration, doubles the rate
* 2nd Order - Doubling the concentration increases the rate by a factor of 4
* Zero Order - Doubling the concentration has no affect on the rate

== The rate equation ==

Rate = K[A]&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt;[B]&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt;. K is the rate constant.

Rules
* if a or b = 1 do not include e.g. Rate=K[A][B], both are 1st order
* if a or b = 0 do not include at all e.g. Rate=K[B], A is zero order, so has not been included
* if a or b = 2 include it! e.g. Rate=K[A]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;[B], A is 2nd order, but B is 1st order, the overall order of reaction is therefore 3rd order.

To find the overall order of reaction just add up all the little numbers!

INCOMPLETE, OTHER DETAILS WILL BE ADDED SOON!

This utility template centers text inside an HTML &amp;lt;div style=...&amp;gt; container and internal &amp;lt;span style=... &amp;gt;...&lt;/span&amp;gt;&gt; wrapper with 0.75em padding, and a margin of 1em.
* This can be desirable in many cases as it sets off the text nicely, but assumes it is the last (only) text on a line--which can adversely affect wikimarkup using '||' seperators in tables.
* It can also have undesirable 'enlarging' effects, again, especially in tables.
&amp;nbsp;

==The AROS shell==

In Wanderer (AROS Desktop / GUI), hit RightAROS + w (or F12 + w) (or use right mousebutton to access Wanderer's menu on the top of the screen) to open a shell window. To close the shell window, click on the top left X of the shell window or type in 

 endcli





==Beginners Tutorial / Basic Usage==

By default, the current directory is being displayed as part of your shell prompt. By default, your starting point is 'System:', the OS' root directory. 

&lt;code&gt;System:&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

Type 'dir' and hit return. You will see the contents of the current directory.

&lt;code&gt;System:&gt;dir&lt;/code&gt;

You can run an executable or enter a directory just by typing it's name (and hitting return). Enter the 'C' directory simply by typing 'c' (AROS DOS is case insensitive):

&lt;code&gt;System:&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;

Now press the up-arrow button twice. AROS shell has got a command history, which allows you to repeat or re-use commands quickly. Now you should see the 'dir' command again, so hit return. You will see the contents of the 'c' directory you've just entered.

&lt;code&gt;System:c&gt;dir&lt;/code&gt;


This directory is AROS' primary location for executables which can be run from any directory. Now type '/' (just a slash) and hit return. You've just moved up one directory, back to 'System:'

&lt;code&gt;System:&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

Now try another 'dir' like command (which resides in the 'c' directory), 'list':

&lt;code&gt;System:&gt;list&lt;/code&gt;

The output is quite the same as 'dir'. But you can control the 'list' output with options. AROS DOS command line options are recognized by their name, and eventually their position on the command line. Try this:

&lt;code&gt;System:&gt;list sub d&lt;/code&gt;

The output will now consist of all the directories contents which names contain the substring 'd'. Another example, another option:

&lt;code&gt;System:&gt;list sub d all&lt;/code&gt;

This will list the contents matching 'd' recursively.

&lt;code&gt;
IF &lt;condition&gt;
; these commands are executed if the condition is true
ELSE
; these commands are executed if the condition is false
ENDIF
&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;condition&gt; can be one of

&lt;code&gt;WARN&lt;/code&gt; - return code of the previous command is 5 or higher.

&lt;code&gt;ERROR&lt;/code&gt; - return code of the previous command is 10 or higher.

&lt;code&gt;FAIL&lt;/code&gt; - return code of the previous command is 20 or higher.

&lt;code&gt;EXISTS &lt;filename&gt;&lt;/code&gt; - check if file or directory exists.

&lt;code&gt;''&lt;a&gt;'' '''EQ''' ''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;''&lt;/code&gt; - string comparison.

&lt;code&gt;''&lt;a&gt;'' '''EQ''' ''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;''&lt;/code&gt; VAL - numeric comparison.

&lt;code&gt;''&lt;a&gt;'' '''GT''' ''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'' - same as EQ, just means &quot;greater than&quot;.

&lt;code&gt;''&lt;a&gt;'' '''GE''' ''&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'' - same as EQ, just means &quot;greater or equal&quot;.

any of the above can be negated by NOT.
e.g. use NOT GT for &quot;less or equal&quot; or NOT GE for &quot;less than&quot;.

Example of coloured text in the shell 

&lt;pre &gt;
prompt &quot;*E[&gt;1m*E[1;37;41m%n.%s&gt; *E[0;32;41m&quot;
echo &quot;*E[0;0H*E[J&quot; 
&lt;/pre &gt; 

&lt;pre &gt; 
*E[&gt;1m
&lt;/pre &gt; 
Is a so called SGR command that omits the first few parameters. It turns BOLD ON.

&lt;pre &gt; 
*E[1;37;41m%n.%s&gt; 
&lt;/pre &gt; 
SGR command that tells:
- boldface (1)
- foregroundcolor 7 (37).
Which means it is using pencolor #7 (which is black by default on aros, hence the setpencolor command).
- use background color 1 (41).
Which means it is using pencolor #1 (which is black by default on aros).
- %n means printing the current opened cli/shell-number
- %s means printing the current path
- &gt; print a nice pipe token after all the above (and also a space-character).

&lt;pre &gt; 
*E[0;32;41m
&lt;/pre &gt; 
SGR command that tells:
- plain text (0)
- foregroundcolor 2 (32).
Which means it is using pencolor #2 (which is white by default on aros).
- backgroundcolor 1 (41).
Which means it is using pencolor #1 (which is black by default on aros).

&lt;pre &gt; 
*E[0;0H
&lt;/pre &gt; 
command 'Cursor position'
- set row to 0 (0)
- set column to 0 (0)
Please note that this does not seem to work on AROS as on classic (not checked). it seems that the lowest nr for AROS to use is 1 (for both left and top).

&lt;pre &gt; 
*E[J
&lt;/pre &gt; 
command 'erase in display' (no additional parameters used in this command).





==Drives, Files, Assigns, Directories==

A certain set of directories and files needed by the operating system will be present in every AROS distribution. Additionally, &quot;assigns&quot; (logical, not physical, drives) point to physical drive's partitions or locations in the partition's directory structure.



===Physical drives===
:By default harddrives on the IDE bus are assigned the drive names &quot;DH0:&quot;, &quot;DH1:&quot;, etc.
:By default USB pendrives are assigned the drive names &quot;DU0:&quot;, &quot;DU1:&quot;, etc.
:By default CD / DVD drives on the IDE bus are assigned the drive names &quot;CD0:&quot;, &quot;CD1:&quot;, etc.




===Logical drives, &quot;assigns&quot;===
&lt;code&gt;
SYS:
Extras:
DEVS:
Development:
L:
S:
LIBS:
C:
ENV:
RAM:
ENVARC:
MUI:
T:
&lt;/code&gt;



===Directories and files===



==== SYS:Prefs ====

...contains all system preferences programs, like &quot;Screenmode&quot;, &quot;Locale&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;Trident&quot; (USB), etc.
Is part of default path, thus entering &quot;screenmode&quot; in shell will bring up &quot;Screenmode&quot; prefs program.


==== SYS:Devs ====

...contains device drivers and datatypes. Move a file to the corresponding subdirectory of &quot;SYS:Storage&quot; to disable it (after reboot). More (currently disabled) device drivers or datatypes may be found unter &quot;SYS:Storage&quot;, move to &quot;Devs:&quot; to enable (after reboot).

==== SYS:Storage ====

...is a directory meant to store optional or currently unused devices and datatypes.
Move contents of &quot;Devs:&quot; (see above) here to disable device drivers (after reboot).


==== S:startup-sequence ====

...is a script that will be run when starting up the operating system. It is also used by some applications to store their individial requirements (if any - mosty this will be a line like &quot;assign PROGRAMNAME: SYS:path/to/installation/of/PROGRAMNAME&quot;)


==== S:user-startup ====

...is a script that will be run by S:startup-sequence. It's the place to put your own stuff. Imagine you have some executable programs installed in a different directory than &quot;C:&quot; (or any other in default &quot;path&quot;) but still want to access them without typing their full paths, you may add a line like this: &quot;path WORK:path/to/my/program/ add&quot;.

It is also used by some applications to store their individial requirements (see above).


==== S:shell-startup ====

...is a script that will be run when starting up a new shell. By default, it contains commands that define the look of your shell prompt. See description of 'prompt' command.

Example: Echo &quot;*E[32mRed Text*E[0m&quot;
Purpose: *E[nm where n=30-39 for foreground color or n=40-49 for background colour.
*E[0m resets to normal character set.
&lt;/pre&gt;

Seems that Amiga shell allows an escape sequence to begin with just the 0x9B character, OR it allows the more traditional 0x1B character (033 in octal) followed the [ character. For sake of clarity, I will represent it by the C string \033[

AROS does not understand the \033[0m sequence, therefore you need to reset it using another colour sequence (on the assumption that the user has not changed the default Shell colours). This turns out to be \033[31;40m . It makes sense to play it safe, and follow it by the (ignored on AROS) \033[0m sequence.

Therefore my final highlight code looks like this:
 printf(&quot;Before\033[32;43mDuring\033[31;40m\033[0mAfter\n&quot;);

Or if you code in E (like me) then it is this:
 PrintF('Before\e[32;43mDuring\e[31;40m\e[0mAfter\n')

==Introduction==

Before you attempt to port a program, make sure it's API dependencies are met on AROS.
(AmigaOS (TM) 3.x C API is considered AROS native) 

* Acceptable: ANSI-C/C++, [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=4562&amp;forum=2&amp;post_id=40003#forumpost40003 SDL], GTK via [http://sourceforge.net/projects/gtk-mui/ gtk-mui], [http://archives.aros-exec.org/index.php?function=browse&amp;cat=development/library Cairo] (old port), OpenGL via Gallium3D acceleration, ...

* Very difficult: PyGame, Boost, Allegro, no SDL, Gnome, KDE and/or QT4, etc.

* Impossible: Java, C#, any Windows only source, etc. 



==Compilers and tools==

Open shell - its a menu option at the top left of Wanderer (desktop). Or by using the right Win key and w (or F12 and w) within the directory with the makefile. Type in  
 sh 
to change the amiga shell into a unix shell. You can then type in ls (unix equivalent to amiga dir). Take a look [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Linux_commands here] for commands. 

For a single file program-name.c or program-name.cpp
 gcc -o program-name program-name.c  
or 
 g++ -o program-name program-name.cpp

To close the shell, click on the top left-hand corner to close (twice). 

Other missing symbols are due to linker libraries being necessary for linking in functions that aren't in the standard C libraries. For example some source code would need added 
 -lz -lm -lpng 
to compile or even -lmui switch to link a program with a MUI gui.

use this in unix line command mode to search for 'search-item' in many .c files (*.cpp for c++, etc.)
 grep -l 'search-item' *.c 




==Using CONFIGURE to create a Makefile==

Open shell - its a menu option at the top left of Wanderer (desktop). Or by using the right Win key and w within the directory with the configure and make files. Type in  
 sh 
to change the amiga shell into a unix shell. 

 configure --help

to see the various options available. You'll need time to look over the options and choose the right ones. 
Hints are available later on. When you configure GCC using the `configure' script, it will construct the file `Makefile' from the template file `Makefile.in'.  When it does this, it will incorporate makefile fragment files from the `config' directory, named `t-TARGET'  and `x-HOST'.  If these files do not exist, it means nothing needs to be added for a given target or host.

Examples...
&lt;pre&gt;
 configure prefix=/PROGDIR --build=i686 --host=i686 --disable-nls 

 configure prefix=/PROGDIR --build=i386 --host=i386 --disable-nls --without-opengl --without-star --disable-sdltest

 configure LDFLAGS=&quot;-nix&quot; --prefix=/PROGDIR --build=i386 --disable-nls --without-x --without-pic 
--disable-shared GREP=bin: --enable-client=sdl --disable-server --disable-sdltest 
--with-sdl-prefix=development:include/SDL
&lt;/pre&gt;

to create a Makefile but if it does not work, look at the Hints section or ask questions [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewforum.php?forum=2 here]. 




==EDITING CONFIGURE to suit AROS==

Take a look at Fishy's tutorial [http://web.archive.org/web/20111107002757/http://fishys-house-of-aros-fun.webs.com/apps/blog/show/2651598-aros-porting-guide first]

dir ../   unix moving back a directory or two

dir /    amiga equivalent

When the Makefile is created, whilst in the unix shell, type in

 make -f Makefile

to create the program...




===CREATING MAKEFILE from a blank text file===


====Generic template makefile (not to be used)====

which requires multiple copies of .c .o files


&lt;pre&gt;
CC = gcc
#CC = g++
#AS = nasm -f coff
#AR = ar
LDFLAGS = -s
FLAGS = -I. -Icpu -Iaros -Wall -march=pentium -fomit-frame-pointer
LIBS =	-lz -lm -LDevelopment:lib
#LIBS =	-lSDL_net lSDL_ttf -lSDL_mixer -lSDL_image -lpng -ljpeg -lz -lvorbisfile -logg -lSDL
#LIBS =	-lz -lm -LDevelopment:lib -lglu -lglut -lgl -lSDL_mixer -lSDL_image -lpng -ljpeg -lz -lSDL
EXE =   name
OPTS =	-O2

#

@echo &quot;Building source files...&quot;
$(CC) $(FLAGS) $(OPTS) -c src/.c -o obj/.o
$(CC) $(FLAGS) $(OPTS) -c src/.c -o obj/.o
#$(CC) $(FLAGS) $(OPTS) -c src/.cpp -o obj/.o
#$(CC) $(FLAGS) $(OPTS) -c src/.cpp -o obj/.o

@echo &quot;Making executable...&quot;
$(CC) $(LDFLAGS) $(FLAGS) -o $(EXE) obj/.o $(LIBS)

@echo &quot;Done!&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;


Remove # from CC = g++, if g++ compiler needed. Remember to put # it in front of CC = gcc. # at the start acts as a comment line and are not processed. Similarly, remove/add # in the LIBS part to activate simple command line compiling, simple SDL compiling or openGL compiling respectively. 

Replace name with the program title in EXE part. 

Then add various .c (compiling with gcc) or .cpp (compiling with g++) source code you want to compile and .o also 
&lt;pre&gt;
$(CC) $(FLAGS) $(OPTS) -c src/main.c -o obj/main.o 
&lt;/pre&gt;

Finally, collect all the .o for the final line
&lt;pre&gt;
$(CC) $(LDFLAGS) $(FLAGS) -o $(EXE) obj/main.o main2.o etc.o $(LIBS)
&lt;/pre&gt;


[http://archives.aros-exec.org/index.php?function=browse&amp;cat=development/utility MakeTools] should be looked at also. 

&lt;pre&gt;

#putting the object files--hellomake.o and hellofunc.o in dependency list
#make knows it must first compile the .c versions individually, and then build the executable hellomake

==Hints for correcting errors==

[http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=1807&amp;forum=1&amp;post_id=14817#forumpost14817 Forum post] and see [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=3739&amp;forum=2&amp;post_id=31997#forumpost31997 here] and [http://aros.sourceforge.net/documentation/developers/porting.php here] 
Be warned that these links apply to using Linux to compile code and not native but may be useful.

Undefs about AROSMesa mean -lgl, undefs about sdl_wav mean -lsdl_mixer, undefs about std:: and operators mean that you need to use or g++ , or if you use gcc, then add to -lstdc++.

Link order are important, so you can't for example firstly do -lgl, and then -lsdl. As sdl wants gl, you will need to do -lsdl -lgl, and the same for all the other libs : include one after another when undefs happens. 

 -lSDL_image -lpng -ljpeg -lSDL_ttf -lfreetype2 -lSDL_mixer -lvorbisfile -lvorbis -logg -lSDL -lgl -lglu -lz -lstdc++ -lm 

Additionally, most AROS code depends on the library bases being opened automagically so you may need to add a link library, libauto (-lauto). Some systems (so it's down to the compiler to provide it) don't have working libauto in which case you need to open the library bases manually.

             if ( SDL_Init(SDL_INIT_VIDEO|SDL_INIT_TIMER|SDL_INIT_AUDIO|SDL_INIT_JOYSTICK ) == -1 )
           That includes all the init routines available in SDL, minus the CD one.

==Hints: Porting software from...==


===AmigaOS===

The right form of the main() function is
&lt;pre&gt;
int main(void)
{
...
return retval;
}

or

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
...
return retval;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

(Old code has often &quot;void main()&quot; or no return type at all)

For retval you can either use 0, EXIT_SUCCESS or EXIT_FAILURE (ANSI-C) or ADOS return codes which I don't know off-hand.




First turn anything that end with _proto.h 
&lt;pre&gt;
#include &lt;dos/dos_proto.h&gt;
to
#include &lt;proto/dos.h&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
and if you want it more portable than try
&lt;pre&gt;
#ifdef AROS
#include &lt;proto/dos.h&gt;
#else
#include &lt;dos/dos_proto.h&gt;
#endif
&lt;/pre&gt;

Include function prototypes for shared libraries from proto
e.g. #include &lt;proto/graphics.h&gt; instead of #include &lt;clib/graphics_protos.h&gt;

If the comiler complains about wrong type in a line like
 struct Library *GfxBase
you have to look up the right type in the header, e.g. in includes/proto/graphics.h

 #include &lt;proto/library_name.h&gt;

(replacing with correct name) should pull in the necessary info for automatic opening/closing of CORE libraries to work with basic applications which are written as DOS and Workbench/Wanderer launched processes. Others like mui have to be specified (-lmui in the gcc command line).

It looks like you are still including from clib. You either have to include from proto or you have to link with -lexec -lgadtools, etc.

There are undefined symbols in 'inctst':
U AllocMem
U FreeMem

Adding -lexec removed the errors.

&lt;pre&gt;
There are undefined symbols in 'a.out':
SetFont
CloseFont
OpenFont 
&lt;/pre&gt;

try -lgraphics or #include &lt;proto/graphics.h&gt; or #include &lt;defines/graphics.h&gt; or #include &lt;clib/graphics_protos.h&gt;





Most AROS C/C++ Compilers can open and close the libraries for you as part of the startup code. As long as you have the protos included in the headers and the appropriate compiler options specified, the compiler will take care of opening any used libraries for you. 

The library header source is in principle like AOS 68k too, with Resident struct, functable and so on. Except AROS has its own set of macros for functions which get parameters in registers. The AROS_LH#? and AROS_UFH#? stuff. You should be able to use contrib/mui/classes/nlist/commonaros/mccheader.c from AROS contrib sources as a hint.

But always remember, that coding for AROS is not coding for m68k Amiga. Many things are different here and coding AROS in C means searching hundreds of include files for macros. And AROS source code is partly useless for an external newbie developer, as AROS has a deeply integrated build system which hides important parts from the implementing developers. e.g. a shared library consists only of its methods, the rest (Romtag, Jumptable etc.) is hidden in the AROS build system.


wbstart.library isn't ported indeed but its usage is deprecated and you are advised to convert its calls to use workbench.library/OpenWorkbenchObject() (which should be a pretty easy job).

A temporary quick trick is to use CLI callings on C:Open which will launch programs using Workbench (using this very function). It can even be used with arguments which are passed as workbench arguments (ie like multi-clicked files).





====Programming languages====

As long as no assembler code is being used in the program, compiling a C program written for plain AmigaOS up to version 3.1 should be possible on AROS without any changes to the source code. (That presumes your AROS is using a 32bit big-endian CPU, like the original Amiga computer.)  (Please note that '''AROS is still beta and incomplete''', and might lack some functions from AmigaOS API. See [[Aros/Developer/Docs#Status_of_AROS_implementation|Status of AROS implementation]] for more on this.)



====Data types and sizes / little endian / big endian====

Some of the first things to consider is the actual size of your C data types, and in your uses of binary files (IFF for example) paying attention to reading and writing with portability to 64bit and little-endian CPUs as well as the classic mc680x0 or powerpc cpus used by Amiga OS.  

* Warning signs is casting between char * and WORD/LONG/short/int etc., or any kind of pointer arithmetic, as well as any functions that read/write binary file formats (if they read character by character and/or does things similar to what I mentioned above, they are likely to be ok, if they read a chunk of memory in and treat it as a struct immediately then it'll almost certainly fail). 

* Endianess issues need to be fixed and there are a lot of them (reading/writing binary files, writing data into graphics frame buffers). Also network stack, file system, hardware. Pretty much any time you have to deal with external data, you have to worry about endianess. There are C #define macros to handle writing/reading the correct endianess and flipping the ordering when necessary. 

* all LONG/ULONG/APTRs need to be checked if they need to be replaced by IPTR (e.g. relying on TagLists) 

[we should probably have a chart showing sizes/endian used by manx/sas/dice C on a mc68000/68030 vs today's PPC/i386/x86_64 AROS options here along with some GCC source code to show how to read/write binary files correctly under AROS running on differing endian CPUs]  




====Screens====

Amiga chipset graphics based screens were generally done in a planar format 16/32-colors max for ECS hires/lores modes respectively and 256-colors for AGA. 

[a chart of common amiga screen modes should go here]  

Methods that worked well for the relatively low resolution planar Amiga displays may be suboptimal for chunky and true color screens that are common today. 

[pointer to examples should go here]  

Amiga screens could be of differing resolution, which could be dragged up and down to reveal another, so some applications were written with differing resolution screens, say for a control panel at one resolution and another for the &quot;display&quot; visible at the same time stacked vertically. This may not make sense with today's chip sets or wide-screen displays. Opening multiple screens that vary in scan rate can confuse displays (monitors or projectors) that might take several seconds &quot;calibrating&quot; every time the user decides to change which public or private application screen they want to view.  Defaulting to the user's preference for Wanderer (workbench) for screen mode is probably better than having a predefined mode hard coded into your application.



====Fonts====

AmigaOS 3.1 also shipped with some nice disk fonts that are not currently available under AROS, so you should be careful about having any diskfont hard coded as a default into your program.  The ROM font &quot;topaz&quot; should be ok.

AROS fonts (as of 2010-03-10):
*arial.font
*dejavusansbold.font
*dejavusansboldoblique.font
*dejavusansbook.font
*dejavusanscondensedbold.font
*dejavusanscondensedboldobl.font

====GUI Toolkits====

=====Gadtools=====

The order of the fields in struct Node which is currently different than on AOS (will be changed in ABI V1).

struct Node has currently the following order:

&lt;pre&gt;
struct Node
{
    struct Node * ln_Succ,
        * ln_Pred;
    char    * ln_Name;
    UBYTE      ln_Type;
    BYTE      ln_Pri;
}; 
&lt;/pre&gt;



=====MUI=====

'''MUI''' - AROS' preferred GUI toolkit is Zune, a reimplementation of MUI 3.x, thus MUI 3.x code will work unchanged under AROS. MUI 4.x will need adapting or wait for the following [http://www.power2people.org/projects/profile/54 bounty] to be started. 



=====ClassAct=====

'''ReAction/ClassAct''', a GUI toolkit for AmigaOS, is not available for AROS. It has been made part of AmigaOS 3.5 and higher. Programs that use ReAction might need considerable rework, preferably to use Zune (or: MUI), AROS' GUI toolkit.  



=====BGui=====

'''bgui''' is available as part of the &quot;contrib&quot; archive, thus included in all current AROS binary distributions.

[We could use a chart comparing gui options for developers here.]







====C/C++ Compilers====

GCC/G++ is the primary C compiler supplied with AROS. Amiga programs making use of other compilers' (SAS/C, Maxon C, ...) specific functionality might need some rework.
You'll probably want to write makefiles that can run either hosted or native, so any AROS user can get them compiled and running on their machine.  In a hosted environment the shell will most likely use UNIX semantics like cp==COPY ../==parent directory, and all file names will be case sensitive for your makefile and inside your C source code files (example: #include &quot;myFile.h&quot; != #include &quot;MyFile.H&quot;). Under AROS the makefile may use Amiga shell command semantics (copy #? progdir:prefs)or it may be using a UNIX shell ported to AROS, and the AROS environment, and like AmigaOS 3.1 may not care about case sensitivity of file names.

We can't use the SLOWSTACKTAGS macros for getting ULONG values from a variadic list.




===== SAS Lattice C Compiler=====

SAS/C was one of the more popular compiler packages back when AmigaOS 3.1 was released, it supported various keywords such as __chip for using chipram, and CPU related register arguments that the current AROS GCC does not.

The makefiles will have to be translated from SMAKE to GNU Make and some of the headers will have to be translated from SC to GCC.

Pragmas were used on ancient C compilers like SASC. Include from &quot;proto&quot;, e.g. #include &lt;proto/workbench.h&gt;. Look if there are headers which include from &quot;clib&quot;. Change them to &quot;proto&quot;, too.

You can ignore warnings like &quot;suggested parentheses...&quot; or incompatible pointer types.

Some types and names of defines have changed (SHORT/USHORT -&gt; WORD/UWORD).

 -linput -lutility -lintuition -lrexxsyslib -lconsole -lgraphics -ldos -lexec

strmfp, stcgfe, stcgfp, stcgfn and stci_d are SAS/C / Lattice function that do not exist under gcc. They have to be reimplemented.

tolower and toupper was found once I've included ctype.h in the source code.
Sometimes missing symbols come from missing include files. Those are macros like toupper -- not real functions, and the C preprocessor needs the include definition for the macro. 

If you want your characters to be unsigned you need to put unsigned into the variable type. If you want them to be signed, put signed in the variable type. If you don't put either, you may get unexpected results.

Sometimes you need wrappers for functions which aren't part of ANSI C.

SAS/C allowed to use a type before it was defined =&gt; change the order or use forward declaration.

Use AROS macros for Hook functions as explained here:
http://aros.sourceforge.net/documentation/developers/app-dev/portable.php#hooks

There might be more if you are porting system software (libraries, interrupts etc.)
Just start and try to find the reason for warnings and errors.

Generally when porting sources, if a header doesn't exist in AROS, wrap it with an #if or #ifndef statement and see what symbols, structure definitions, etc. aren't found. Then you can look through the AROS includes to see if the missing symbols, etc. are implemented in another place, or if you have to make your own compatible include file with those defined.

For libraries you might want to look at the AROS source tree to see how others have done it using things like [http://aminet.net/package/dev/gcc/sfdc sfdc], genmodule, etc.

* SAS/C included a ton of non-standard functions in its C library. Alternative versions of these can generally be found online, and for example YAM includes some of them in their sources, depending on license working around this is easy (none of these functions are big/difficult to re-implement if needed).
* SAS/C is very liberal in some of the things it accepts. This causes problems particularly for vbcc (not so relevant for AROS) but some things also for gcc, particularly in terms of type coercion and (lack) of forward declarations.
* SAS/C has a multitude of extensions targeting AmigaOS, such as non-standard 68k focused register declarations. These must either be removed or worked around by defining preprocessor macros that expand to nothing or a suitable replacement.
* The SAS/C smakefiles are a totally non-standard syntax.
* The general caveats of AmigaOS vs. AROS include files apply - many paths can be expected to be different.

* there might be endian issues
* you'll get a lot of compiler warnings. Some of them are harmless (e.g. &quot;parenthesis suggested ...&quot;). Others are dangerous (e.g. &quot;variable xxx may be undefined&quot;)
* for some specials like callback hooks you'll have to use AROS macros.


* Use texteditor or some tool to replace all &quot;ULONG&quot; with &quot;IPTR&quot; and &quot;LONG&quot; with &quot;SIPTR&quot; in the sources. 

* Fix (change IPTR/SIPTR back to ULONG/LONG) the few places which really rely on ULONG/LONG being exactly 32 bit. That's for things like pixel (ARGB) buffers, structs written/read to disk, colormaps, but probably not much else. 


This is the [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?start=30&amp;topic_id=5705&amp;viewmode=flat&amp;order=ASC&amp;type=&amp;mode=0 code] that I use in diskimage.device for converting a BSTR to a CSTR 
&lt;pre&gt;
LONG CopyStringBSTRToC (BSTR src, STRPTR dst, ULONG dst_size) {
#ifdef __AROS__
    STRPTR ptr = AROS_BSTR_ADDR(src);
    ULONG ln = AROS_BSTR_strlen(src);
#else
    UBYTE *ptr = BADDR(src);
    ULONG ln = *ptr++;
#endif
    if (ln &gt; (dst_size-1)) ln = dst_size-1;
    memcpy(dst, ptr, ln);
    dst[ln] = 0;
    return ln;
}
&lt;/pre&gt;



Some blankers are missing the symbol &quot;custom&quot;. They have (as documented in the OS3.9 RKM) &quot;extern struct Custom custom;&quot;. 
'Custom' is a struct that maps the m68k Amiga AGA/OCS/ECS registers. Only build those for amiga-m68k, and you'll be fine.

====Assemblers/ Disassemblers====

ADis, which reads binaries into memory hunk by hunk to disassemble them, and then just treats it as an array of short. The &quot;right&quot; way would be to treat it as a char *, and do (arr[0] &lt;&lt; 8) + arr[1]. I wanted to use it to cross-disassemble M68k programs, but gave up and went with Ira instead because it was so pervasive. 





===Linux Console Apps===

On AmigaOS this is done by libc on every I/O operation. Just AROS libs lacks this. 
Resources allocated by libc (malloc()ed memory, fopen() ed files, etc.) are safely reclaimed at exit(). libc tracks this internally. If your program additionally uses some AmigaOS API, it usually installs exit handler (i don't remebmer how), or disables Ctrl-C checking by redefining __chkabort() function. 

You have to explicitly check for it on AROS (and AmigaOS). The reason for this is that there's no safe way for the OS to kill an app and reclaim all resources on AmigaOS and derivatives (since an app can have &quot;handed off&quot; memory and other resources to other tasks). 

This is an example from the autodocs for SetSignal:

&lt;pre&gt;
#include &lt;libraries/dos.h&gt;

/* Check &amp; clear CTRL_C signal */
if(SetSignal(0L,SIGBREAKF_CTRL_C) &amp; SIGBREAKF_CTRL_C)
{ 
printf(&quot;CTRL-C pressed!n&quot;);
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

It is compiler dependent. It's safer to just do the SetSignal() based check. 


If you want a shared library, recommend getting linux-hosted aros building (use the gimmearos.sh script) and then look at the other library sources found in AROS/workbench/libs for examples of how its done. 

If it were just a linker library, you can just compile the .c files with -fno-stack-protector (needed under aros-sdk cross compiler under linux, native aros gcc might not need that), etc. and join the .o files into a lib-yournamehere.a file with ar and ranlib them. 





===SDL===

SDL_image may need -ljpeg -lpng -lz 

SDL_mixer needs -lSDL_mixer -lvorbisfile -lvorbis -logg (in this order)


First thing to test with SDL sound under AROS is to increase the buffer. In all applications had needed this to obtain good sound output. 

In most cases it would certainly mean that you have to increase the value of SYSSND_MIXSAMPLES. Usually multiplying this value by 2 or 4 gives good results.

You should also check the value of the obtained structure. It is not sure that AROS supports AUDIO_U8 and you might have reverted to AUDIO_U16. In this case sound will of course be distorted.

from [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=2533&amp;forum=2&amp;post_id=45301#forumpost45301 here]

Further tests with buffers using code from [http://www.kekkai.org/roger/sdl/mixer/ here], and this is the result I've noted:

&quot;a quick test compiling with 1024, 2048 or 4096 gave interesting results: 1024 - sounds are more responsive to key-events but if you quickly move the &quot;game-window&quot; around the screen you can hear sound glitches. 2048 - No big difference noticed in responsiveness and now no glitches moving the window around, anyway the fx-sound sample plays with some hiss-click glitches. 4096 - No hiss-click and no glitches moving the window BUT you can see that the responsiveness is decreased. 

Trying this code then with original xRick 8bit samples gives good sound results, and even using 1024 bytes buffer the sound doesn't glitch when moving window&quot;

Seems to me that buffer depends a lot on responsiveness you need, overall game load and also what kind of sound samples you're using (of course the lower is the bit-encoding and frequency, the smaller you can use as buffer).


SDL_GetTicks just disable 

 m_fLastTime = float(SDL_GetTicks())/1000;

in 2 places of sdlapp.cpp and add your own code at the end:

&lt;pre&gt;
    Ellapsed_Time = SDL_GetTicks() - Last_Time;
    if (Ellapsed_Time &lt; 20) /* 20 ms target =&gt; 50FPS */
    {
    SDL_Delay(20 - Ellapsed_Time);
    }
&lt;/pre&gt;

Maybe SDL_GetTicks works a bit wrong by some reasons in aros's SDL, right ? (because if the same code works fast on os4/mos/win32/anything-else), then it mean that something wrong with SDL_GetTicks then .. 
PS : SDL_GetTicks() isn't causing any troubles, its a basic SDL function that is used in almost all SDL applications.

 int CSDLApplication::Run() in sdlapp.cpp
and
 bool CMySDLApplication::FrameMove() in Armygaem.cpp

In intial code Render3DEnvironment is called continuously and only FrameMove is updated at 50fps, Render() and SDL_GL_SwapBuffers() are called even if nothing has moved.
Calling the render() functions and SDL_GL_SwapBuffers() too often is for me the root cause. A correction to OpenGL implementation would only be a safeguard to prevent stupid application from crashing or slowing down the system.


crash on exit is certainly due to the application not freeing any resources before exiting.




===Writing ROM-able code===

Code in AROS modules should be written in a way that makes it suitable for embedding into a ROM, FlashRAM or other kinds read-only memory. The following coding style rules are meant to make it possible. Of course they apply to all Kickstart modules and to code that may be made resident, shared or linked to other modules.
	 
ROM modules must have no .data and .bss sections. Basically, we need to get rid of all non-const global data. The real Amiga Kickstart proves that it's both possible and easy to achieve this. If you encounter an external variable (static or not) that is modified by the code, try to get rid of it or move it into the base of the library/device (or in the device node of your handler or in the userdata of your class).
	 
The above applies to library bases as well. If you are writing a library, put the bases of other libraries into your own library base structure. Boopsi classes can store library bases in their class private data.
	 
Try to set the static and const attributes to all your global data. You can also use the CONST_STRPTR and CONST_APTR types defined in &lt;exec/types.h&gt;. Using static const allows the compiler to move data into the .text (AKA code) segment. If you need to pass these globals to another function, try to change its prototype to use const too.  




===Hooks and SDI===


A hook is a custom function you write in order to be able to handle a specific situation that arises from intercepting the main code (like processing a message). The function must be designed to accept three arguments, whose order and type is given. 

* the first parameter (A0) contains the pointer to your hook, not to your window
* the 2nd Parameter points to the Object which causes this action, this isn´t your window but it´s the Object which was pressed (it´s always the Object which was connected to the Hook (=1st Parameter of DoMethod) 
* then give 5 as number of Parameters for MUIM_CallHook, but´s 4 (=number of all Parameters in DoMethod after the Count Parameter) 

&lt;pre&gt;
AROS_UFH3S
(
void,
MyHookFunction,
AROS_UFHA(struct Hook * , hook, A0),
AROS_UFHA(Object * , obj, A2),
AROS_UFHA(ULONG * , params, A1)
)
&lt;/pre&gt;

params is an array but IPTR should be correct. Then you can access your parameters...

&lt;pre&gt;
app = (Object *) *params++;
window2 = (Object *) params++;
&lt;/pre&gt;


&lt;pre&gt;
The important thing about hook functions is that the parameters must be given in the order A0, A2, A1.
And not to leave out parameters even if they are unused by the hook function.

For initial quick&amp;dirty ports one can even simply defines things like
&quot;__saveds&quot;, &quot;__asm&quot;, &quot;__regargs&quot;, &quot;__stdargs&quot;, &quot;register ...&quot; to nothing.

For library functions it's the same (with library base as last param).

InitLib: libbase(d0), seglist(a0), sysbase(a6)
OpenLib: version(d0), libbase(a6)
CloseLib: libbase(a6)
ExpungeLib: libbase(d0), libbase(a6)

OpenDev: ioreq(A1), unitnum(d0), flags(d1), devbase(a6)
CloseDev: ioreq(a1), devbase(a6)
&lt;/pre&gt;

see [http://utilitybase.com/forum/index.php?action=vthread&amp;forum=3&amp;topic=1495 here]

The AROS asm call and lib call macros require param type (like &quot;struct Hook *&quot;) and param (like &quot;myhook&quot;) to be passed in two different arguments. Not in a single one. 

Converting is easy. Adding some &quot;AROS_&quot; prefix plus some commas. Additionally in the hook functions and dispatcher functions &quot;HOOK_INIT&quot; / &quot;HOOK_EXIT&quot; / &quot;DISPATCHER_INIT&quot; / &quot;DISPATCHER_EXIT&quot; must be used (in case of AROS mapping to AROS_USERFUNC_INIT/AROS_USERFUNC_EXIT). 




To force procedure parameters to use registers (like a0) in GCC 

Since C calling convention on some machines (like 68k or x86) means params are passed on stack your C function must have params in correct order (Hook, object, msg) and not leave out params if they are unused by the function especially if it's the middle param (object).

 ULONG hook_function(REG(a0, struct Hook *hook), REG(a2, APTR object), REG(a1, APTR message))

In short when using HookEntry you initialize hooks like this: 

&lt;pre&gt;
STATIC ULONG hookfunc(struct Hook *hook, APTR obj, APTR msg) 
{ 
/* ... *// 
} 

#if defined(__amigaos4__) 
hook-&gt;h_Entry = hookfunc; 
#else 
hook-&gt;h_Entry = &amp;HookEntry; 
hook-&gt;h_SubEntry = hookfunc 
#endif 
&lt;/pre&gt;

If you are not using SDI headers this is the most universal method which works on OS3, OS4, AROS and MorphOS with every compiler and architecture.

Those dispatchers are usually taken as argument for MUI_CreateCustomClass(), which has:

&lt;pre&gt;
#if defined(__MAXON__) || defined(__amigaos4__)
    cl-&gt;cl_Dispatcher.h_Entry    = (HOOKFUNC)dispatcher;
#else
    cl-&gt;cl_Dispatcher.h_Entry    = (HOOKFUNC)metaDispatcher;
    cl-&gt;cl_Dispatcher.h_SubEntry = (HOOKFUNC)dispatcher;
#endif
&lt;/pre&gt;

metaDispatcher:

&lt;pre&gt;
#ifdef __AROS__
AROS_UFH3(IPTR, metaDispatcher,
    AROS_UFHA(struct IClass  *, cl,  A0),
    AROS_UFHA(Object *, obj, A2),
    AROS_UFHA(Msg     , msg, A1))
{
    AROS_USERFUNC_INIT
   
    return AROS_UFC4(IPTR, cl-&gt;cl_Dispatcher.h_SubEntry,
        AROS_UFPA(Class  *, cl,  A0),
        AROS_UFPA(Object *, obj, A2),
        AROS_UFPA(Msg     , msg, A1),
        AROS_UFPA(APTR    , cl-&gt;cl_Dispatcher.h_Data, A6)
    );

    AROS_USERFUNC_EXIT
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

What confuses me is that our own macros have registers:

&lt;pre&gt;
#define BOOPSI_DISPATCHER(rettype,name,cl,obj,msg) \
    AROS_UFH3(SAVEDS rettype, name,\
        AROS_UFHA(Class  *, cl,  A0),\
        AROS_UFHA(Object *, obj, A2),\
        AROS_UFHA(Msg     , msg, A1)) {AROS_USERFUNC_INIT
&lt;/pre&gt;

Maybe there is a difference between MUI and BOOPSI when it comes to dispatchers and SDI DISPATCHER can only be used for MUI.

AROS's MUI_CreateCustomClass() moves the dispatcher to h_SubEntry and uses something like HookEntry for h_Entry. There we don't have to care about registers.

BTW: SDI's hook macros *are* wrong for AROS.

&lt;pre&gt;
HOOKPROTONHNO(TestFunc, void, int *param)
{
    puts(&quot;Foobar&quot;);
}

MakeHook(TestHook, TestFunc);
&lt;/pre&gt;
expands to:
&lt;pre&gt;
static void TestFunc(__attribute__((unused)) struct Hook *_hook,
__attribute__((unused)) APTR _obj, int *param)
{
    puts(&quot;Foobar&quot;);
}

struct Hook TestHook = {{0L, 0L}, (HOOKFUNC)TestFunc, NULL, 0L};
&lt;/pre&gt;

That works only by accident on i386-AROS (because of stack parameters).
But there I *know* how to fix it and will soon send an update to you.

&lt;pre&gt;
#elif __AROS__

  #define MakeHook(hookname, funcname) struct Hook hookname = {{NULL, NULL}, \
    (HOOKFUNC)HookEntry, (HOOKFUNC)funcname, NULL}
  #define MakeHookWithData(hookname, funcname, data) struct Hook hookname =  \
    {{NULL, NULL}, (HOOKFUNC)HookEntry, (HOOKFUNC)funcname, (APTR)data}
  #define MakeStaticHook(hookname, funcname) static struct Hook hookname =   \
    {{NULL, NULL}, (HOOKFUNC)HookEntry, (HOOKFUNC)funcname, NULL}
  #define ENTRY(func) (APTR)func
  #define DISPATCHERPROTO(name) SAVEDS ASM IPTR name(REG(a0,                 \
    struct IClass * cl), REG(a2, Object * obj), REG(a1, Msg msg))
  #define DISPATCHER(name) DISPATCHERPROTO(name)
  #define SDISPATCHER(name) static DISPATCHERPROTO(name)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Difference is that funcname is moved to h_SubEntry.
Problem are the dispacher macros. They'll currently only work with MUI_CreateCustomClass(). If I define them like our BOOPSI macros I have a new problem: what happens if I define a function with register macros
*AND* use HookEntry in h_Entry and the function in h_SubEntry?

BTW: in SDI_compiler.h there is:
&lt;pre&gt;
  /* we have to distinguish between AmigaOS4 and MorphOS */
  #if defined(_M68000) || defined(__M68000) || defined(__mc68000)
    #define REG(reg,arg) arg __asm(#reg)
    #define LREG(reg,arg) register REG(reg,arg)
  #else
    #define REG(reg,arg) arg
    #define SAVEDS
&lt;/pre&gt;



C++ is much more strict on types than C, this is the root of the problem. Absolutely everything should be casted, implicit conversions are not allowed at all. P.S. And casting is considered an extremely bad coding style IIRC... 

Those who want to develop AROS API in C++ should update their headers from a current SDK.

HOOKFUNC looks now like this in include/utility/hooks.h:
 typedef IPTR (*HOOKFUNC)();

The prototypes have been included in &quot;extern C&quot; blocks, so that problems like this should be [http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?post_id=37123#forumpost37123 gone] 





===Casts===

Casts simply put... casting through pointers, bad... casting through a union, [http://cellperformance.beyond3d.com/articles/2006/06/understanding-strict-aliasing.html good]*. (*exceptions apply) Hopefully someone can correct me if I'm wrong, but the main rule of thumb for avoiding these problems seems to be to not have two pointer variables in the same function that point to the same memory, but are of different type.

It's actually a little more subtle than this. They can point to different types, but not when the types do not contain sub-sets of the others.

i.e.

&lt;pre&gt;

struct Foo {
struct MinNode Node;
};
&lt;/pre&gt;

- any cast from struct Foo * to struct MinNode * is ok ...
but:
&lt;pre&gt;
struct Foo {
struct Foo *next;
struct Foo *prev;
};
&lt;/pre&gt;

- now casts from 'foo' to 'minnode' are not ok ... and worse, can be silently discarded (how that is considered polite behaviour I do not know). (and by extension, casting from List to Node are right out).

I would argue that this is actually a different language - it is no longer 'C', as such, and although the spec (as far as I have been able to ascertain) actually specifies this it has never been implemented in such a way until now. It is there to provide additional optimisation opportunities ... although the whole 'we'll just silently drop code that is otherwise quite obvious' thing is rather nasty.

The CellPerformance stuff really nails it all. Although I find it somewhat absurd you can cast pretty much anything through a union and it's 'ok', but using the language 'cast' exactly the same physical operation becomes 'illegal'.

NEVER EVER touch buffers passed in by the user as an &quot;input&quot; parameter. The concept of input parameters is often implicit in the function description. For instance, the filename passed to Open() is clearly an input variable and Open() must not mess with it, even if it is going to fix it back later. Keep in mind that the buffer might be in read-only memory or shared among several instances of a resident or multithreaded program.

Try to avoid host-OS calls such as malloc() and free() if you can do with AllocMem() and FreeMem(). This is because the pointer checking debug macros rely on finding the pointer within the Exec memory blocks with TypeOfMem().

 SA_BackFill, (ULONG) &amp;sbackfillhook,

Please do not use ULONG's to store/cast pointers in your code. use APTR/IPTR where appropriate. 





==Compiling small parts of AROS source without using Build system==

[http://aros-exec.org/modules/newbb/viewtopic.php?topic_id=3475&amp;forum=2&amp;post_id=29123#forumpost29123 from]

make stub
make
make install

and need genmodule from [http://pagesperso-orange.fr/franck.charlet/temp/radeon.zip inside] here. 


Trying to build the support modules of [http://svn.berlios.de/wsvn/ignition/trunk/libs/scroller/ Ignition] with a normal Makefile:

How can I get rid of these linker warnings? 
U __includelibrarieshandling and U __this_program_requires_symbol_sets_handling 


Is there something I have to care about when I create a module this way? 
(I have always used the build system in the past) Is there a function which must be the 1st one in the generated module?

Are you using ld directly? If so, don't do that, use the compiler's driver instead (gcc, that is) to do all the steps, final linking included. The problem arises because the linker needs to be invoked through a wrapper, which in our case is called collect-aros (it would be collect2 on other systems). You can either call collect-aros in place of ld (I
wouldn't do that) or the compiler's driver (gcc, do that) as said above. Mh, hadn't noticed the makefile when I first replied and I had forgotten these symbols are actually produced by collect-aros itself. 

The problem arises because you are using -nostartfiles, which avoids linking with the startup file, but the startup file contains code that handles the automatic libraries opening/closing and the generic symbol sets handling. By using DFLAGS=-lgraphics -lintuition -lutility you are actually linking with stub libraries that require the automatic handling of shared libraries to be implemented. Either you avoid using these stubs or you implement the needed code yourself. You can take inspiration from the normal startup code. 

After re-enabling lines like
 #define UtilityBase cb-&gt;UtilityBase
I was able to build the module without the stub libraries.

==1. List and describe the principle characteristics, qualities, and sizing of the following cross-country skiing equipment: ==
===a. Skis (both waxable and unwaxable) ===
The skis are long and thin, to distribute the weight of the skier and allow the skier to move quickly. Typical ski dimensions are 2 metres in length, about 5 centimetres in width and one to four centimetres in thickness at different stations along the length of the ski. Depending on the ski design and purpose, they are fit to the skier based on height and weight. Cross country skis are sometimes informally known as &quot;skinny skis&quot; because of their thinness compared to alpine skis.

In recent years, waxless skis have carved a niche in the market among casual skiers. Waxless skis have a fish scale, cross-hatched or ridged pattern in the kick zone to provide grip. A waxless ski is inferior to a finely tuned waxed ski, but does not require the sometimes time-consuming and sometimes costly selection and application of kick wax or klister and will work between temperatures, an important advantage in areas with many sun/shadow boundaries. Some skiers apply a layer of glide wax to keep them sliding smoothly and protecting the surface from dirt and ice build-up. There are specialty liquid wax products on the market manufactured for waxless skis, though standard glide wax can also be used on the tips and tails of the ski. 

Waxless skis are better suited to recreational skiers who simply want to get out on the trail with minimal time spent on maintenance, as they generally produce too much drag for competitive skiers.

Waxless skis are sometimes used by Nordic racers during variable ski conditions such as temperatures over freezing.  In fact, some Nordic ski racers using waxless skis have beaten racers who used waxable skis due to the variable and changing conditions.

===b. Bindings ===
There are three primary groups of binding systems used in modern cross-country skiing:
*NNN (New Nordic Norm) &amp;ndash; including the new R4 NIS variant
*SNS (Salomon Nordic System) Profil
*SNS Pilot

Older styled three-pin bindings (Nordic Norm), with or without cables, are still used by backcountry and Telemarking enthusiasts.

Further variants to NNN and SNS are &quot;BC&quot; (back-country) standards, where the toe hold in the binding is wider and the bar in the boot's toe is longer and thicker in order to give further lateral rigidity. This added strength and rigidity is especially important with the stiffer boots and heavier skis used in backcountry skiing. 

The existing variety of binding systems, none of which are compatible with the other, has long since been a source of frustration for skiers ever since manufacturers diverged from the almost universal three-pin standard.  Whereas downhill skiing has a common binding system allowing any boot to work with any binding short of the dynafit-system, modern cross-country skiers must match the skis' binding system to the boot type.  When it is time to change the boot, the skier must either be limited to boots of the same binding system or also change the skis' binding.

====New Nordic Norm====
Rottefella developed the New Nordic Norm (NNN) binding, and licenses it to Rossignol, Madshus, Atomic, and, beginning in 2007, Fischer.  These bindings have subtypes, such as the NNN-BC for backcountry use, the R3 Skate, the R3 Classic, and the R4 NIS (Nordic Integrated System). The NIS system requires skis that have a permanently bonded plate that the binding slides onto. This allows for the skier to mount their own bindings without needing to screw into the ski. By doing this the skier can easily tune the position of the binding relative to the center of gravity of the ski, said to be useful in different snow conditions. NNN boots are made by Alpina Sports, Madshus, Rossignol and beginning in 2007, Fischer. The R3 and R4 are generally the choice for World Cup Racers using NNN.  These are distinguished from the SNS (Salomon and Atomic) binding in that all NNN bindings have two longitudinal ridges that stick out from the bottom of the binding that mate with corresponding slots in NNN boots.  There is much debate over which is the superior binding system: SNS or NNN.  Overall, the differences between the NNN and SNS binding systems are minuscule to the average skier; the choice should come down to which binding fits with the boot that happens to fit a given skier.

The ''R4 NIS'' binding, made by Rottefella and Rossignol, is the newest variant of the NNN binding. These bindings are compatible with any NNN boot, but can only be used on skis that come with the permanently bonded plate, presently made only by Rossignol, Madshus, and Fischer. The NIS binding made its debut to the general public in 2005.

====Salomon Nordic System Profil====
[[Image:Cross-country skiing, bindings.JPG|right|thumb|SNS binding and ski boots, both of the Salomon brand.]]
Salomon Nordic System (SNS) bindings, made by Salomon and Atomic, however, have their advantages too.  Boots that are compatible with the SNS Profil system are made by Salomon, Atomic, Adidas, and Hartjes.  SNS Profil bindings are used for both Skating and Classic. As opposed to the SNS Pilot's two axes, these boots have only one axis at the front of the sole. Pilots are used by many different racers on the World Cup Circuit. Profil bindings are the standard binding for SNS users, its only competition being the SNS Pilot system. Profil comes in &quot;Equipe&quot; models for racing, &quot;Active&quot; for recreational racing/combination, Auto Touring, and Back Country.  Fischer was for many years synonymous with SNS as well, but switched to the more widely used NNN for the 2007/2008 season and beyond.

====Salomon Nordic System Pilot====
SNS Pilot bindings, compatible with Salomon, Atomic, Adidas and Hartjes boots. As of the 2006/2007 season, Atomic will also have SNS pilot on their boots. The idea for these bindings came from Bjørn Dæhlie.  Pilots are used mostly by elite skiers at the Collegiate/Olympians/World Cup/National level, although it is common to find High School/Citizen Racers with these bindings and their counterpart boots.  Pilots are more expensive than Profils at about 100 U.S. dollars for a pair, and have two completely different designs for skate skiing and classical skiing. In Pilot boots, two axes (metal bars), one positioned about 1&quot; (2.5 cm) behind the other, click into two different slots in the Pilot binding. Profil boots only have one axis and therefore cannot fit into Pilot bindings. However, Pilot boots can fit into most Profil bindings, due to a small space behind the front of the boot for the other axis.  Pilot Skate bindings are superior to Profil due to the two latches reducing ski motion in the air. The Pilot Classic (released at the end of the 2005-2006 season) doesn't have the bumper found on all NNN and SNS Profil bindings. These new boots and bindings provide a superior subtle kick through a spring loaded back slot for the back axis. Unlike the rubber bumpers, this spring has adjustable tension that can be changed in different snow conditions. Fischer has now started producing their new boots with the NNN system.

===c. Shoes ===
Shoes (boots) are covered in the Bindings section above.

===d. Poles ===
Like alpine skiing, cross-country skiers carry two poles, usually made of aluminium or fiberglass. More expensive poles are made of graphite or carbon fiber or some other strong but lightweight material. Poles have a spike at the end to provide a fixed pivot when the pole penetrates through to a hard surface, and a plastic web or disc (called the basket), to provide extra purchase in snow and to ensure the pole doesn't sink too deeply.

==2. Describe and demonstrate how the above gear would be prepared for use and cared for both on the field and during the off season. ==
===a. Skis===
===b. Bindings===
===c. Shoes===
===d. Poles===

==3. What consideration should be made when selecting clothing to be worn while cross-country skiing? What features would you look for when selecting a pack for cross-country ski touring? ==
==4. Demonstrate properly on skis the following travel techniques: ==
===a. Flat striding with good kick, purchase, and form ===
===b. Single poling, change-up, and double poling ===
===c. Side stepping up and down slopes ===
===d. Herringbone slope climbing ===
===e. Traverse-side stepping up slope with kick turns ===
===f. Straight up slope climbing ===
===g. Straight downhill running under control, 20 degree slope (schuss) ===
===h. Moving step turning down slope ===
===i. Snow plowing for slowing speed and stopping ===
===j. Sitback stopping ===
==5. Explain the purpose of waxing. Briefly explain the need for different waxes for different snow types and temperatures. ==
==6. Explain basic safety precautions to follow in cross-country skiing. ==
==7. Know and explain the official National Ski rules for conduct in cross-country skiing.== 
==8. Demonstrate skiing ability by doing the following: ==
===a. Take three separate three-mile trail tours with another individual.  If possible, have varying snow conditions. ===
===b. Take a ten-mile tour over varying terrain. ===
===c. During all tours carry necessary gear (safely) and wear proper clothing for conditions demonstrating ability to maintain proper body temperature, dryness, and condition. ===

== Usurpation of Your Account ==

Another user who operates the single unified account &quot;Summergirl&quot; has asked if they can usurp (take over) the account &quot;Summergirl&quot; (i.e., your account) on Wikibooks. This would involve changing your account name to something else (for example &quot;Summergirl usurped&quot;) to allow the global account user to automatically take the name &quot;Summergirl&quot; here. If you object to this please let me know. If I don't here from you in 7 days I'll presume you have no objections. Thanks &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 20:03, 19 December 2012 (UTC)</text>

==Thanks==
Thanks for your contributions to the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Arts and Crafts/Knitting|Knitting]] honor.  This is one of ''many'' honors that I know next to nothing about, so your help on it is very much appreciated.  

One thing I have done differently in the past concerning the requirements - sometimes the official version of the requirements contain mistakes or misguided thoughts.  I attempt to leave them as they are (with the exception of spelling errors which I do correct), and then talk about why I think the requirement should be changed.  In the Knitting honor, you have changed ''Bulky'' to ''Super Bulky'' - your terminology is most likely correct, but I would suggest that you leave the requirements as they are and perhaps explain that the terminology in the requirement is incorrect.  You can also leave a tag in the honor describing the situation like this:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Problematic requirement|Put your reasoning here}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Requirement 13 of [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Nature/Stars - Advanced (North American Division)|Stars - Advanced]] has one example of this tag in use. 

The reason I approach it this way is because I do not want people complaining that the Wikibook has &quot;changed the requirements.&quot;  The advantage of using the tag is that the honor gets added to [[:Category:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Honors with problematic requirements|this category]] so that we can easily keep track of honors needing attention and give the information to the Honors Committees for future corrective action.

Thank you again ''so much'' for working on this honor! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 15:14, 22 December 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are many technical terms and quantities associated with the study of electronics, each with a specific, well-defined meaning and units. It is important to understand the meanings of and relationships between these.

==Quantities==

===Time===
'''Time''' is considered one of the few [[:w:fundamental quantities|fundamental quantities]] of the universe, and is used to define many other quantities in science. Thus, these quantities cannot be used to define time, as this would mean it would be circularly defined. Time is [[:w:operational definition|operationally defined]] (i.e. we assume that there is a quantity &quot;time&quot; that we can measure) in terms of the '''SI second''' (symbol: '''s'''), which is defined as:
{{cquote|the duration of 9&amp;nbsp;192&amp;nbsp;631&amp;nbsp;770 [[:w:Period (physics)|periods]] of the radiation corresponding to the transition between the two [[:w:Hyperfine structure|hyperfine levels]] of the [[:w:ground state|ground state]] of the [[:w:caesium|caesium]]&amp;nbsp;133 atom.&lt;ref name=&quot;BIPM21&quot;&gt;[http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter2/2-1/second.html Official BIPM definition]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Length===
'''Length''' is a quantity of distance and is defined using the above definition for length and the speed of light, which is held to be constant in our current understanding of the universe. The base unit of length is the '''metre''' (symbol: '''m'''), which is defined to be:
{{cquote|the length traversed by [[:w:electromagnetic radiation|light]] in a [[:w:vacuum|vacuum]] in 1/299&amp;nbsp;792&amp;nbsp;458&amp;nbsp;[[#Time|s]].}}

===Mass===
'''Mass''' is the only measure with an SI unit still defined according to a synthetic artifact rather than a fundamnetal constant of nature. The base unit of mass is the '''kilogram''' (symbol: '''kg'''), which is defined as:
{{cquote|a mass equal to that of the International Prototype Kilogram (IPK)}}

The IPK is a platinum-iridium cylinder stored in a vault at the [[:w:BIPM|BIPM]] in [[:w:Sèvres|Sèvres]], France. Mass is unique in having the base unit having a prefix - the unprefixed &quot;gram&quot; is not considered to be a base unit in the SI system. The kilogram is approximately equal to the mass of one [[#Volume|litre]] of water.

===Area===
'''Area''' is a quantity expressing the two-dimensional size of a defined part of a surface. The base unit of area is the '''square metre''' (symbol: '''m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''). This is:
{{cquote|the area of a square that is one [[#Length|metre]] on a side}}

===Volume===
'''Volume''' is the quantity expressing the three-dimesional size of a given space. The base unit of volume is the '''cubic metre''' (symbol: '''m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'''). This is:
{{cquote|the volume of a cube that is one [[#Length|metre]] on a side}}
Another measure of volume is the ''litre'', equal to the volume of a cube 10&amp;nbsp;cm on a side, or 0.00'''1'''&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

===Force===
'''Force''' is a measure of how much acceleration a mass is provided. The SI unit of force is the '''newton''' (symbol: '''N'''), which is:
{{cquote|the force required to accelerate a one kilogram mass at a rate of one meter per second per second, or 1&amp;nbsp;kg·m·s&lt;sup&gt;&amp;minus;2&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=metric_units&gt;
{{cite book |first=Cornelius |last=Wandmacher |first2=Arnold |last2=Johnson |title=Metric Units in Engineering |page=15 |year=1995 |publisher=ASCE Publications |isbn=0784400709}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
A force of one newton is approximately the gravitational force exerted on a mass of 0.1&amp;nbsp;[[#Mass|kg]] on Earth's surface.

===Current===
'''Current''' is a measure of how much electric charge is flowing in object. It is defined in terms of the attractive [[#Force|force]] between two wires caused by current flowing in the wires. The SI unit is the '''ampere''' (symbol: '''A'''), and it is defined as:
{{cquote|the constant current which will produce an attractive force of 2×10&lt;sup&gt;–7&lt;/sup&gt; [[#Force|newton]] per metre of length between two straight, parallel conductors of infinite length and negligible circular cross-section placed one [[#Length|metre]] apart in a vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bipm.org/en/si/si_brochure/chapter2/2-1/ampere.html BIPM official definition]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul M. S. Monk, ''Physical Chemistry: Understanding our Chemical World'', John Wiley and Sons, 2004 [http://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0471491802&amp;id=LupAi35QjhoC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;lpg=PA16&amp;ots=IMiGyIL-67&amp;dq=ampere+definition+si&amp;sig=9Y0k0wgvymmLNYFMcXodwJZwvAM online].&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The ampere is an SI base unit: it is defined without reference to the quantity of [[#Electric charge|electric charge]], though this could change in future with a proposed redefinition of the unit of electric charge.

===Electric charge===
'''Electric charge''' is the most fundamental of electrical properties. It is a quantity carried by many subatomic particles and is the whole reason electronics as a science exists. The base unit of charge is the '''coulomb''' (symbol: '''C'''), which is defined as:
{{cquote|the charge transferred by a steady current of one [[#Current|ampere]] in one [[#Time|second]]}}
According to conventional values for some other constants, the Coulomb could also be defined as the charge carried by 6.241&amp;nbsp;509&amp;nbsp;629&amp;nbsp;152&amp;nbsp;65 × 10&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt; [[:w:electrons|electrons]], however, this is not (yet) the formal definition of the unit.

'''Melanoma From an Unknown Primary (MUP)'''
*No primary lesion is identified in up to 20% of pts presenting w/ palpable evidence of regional metastatic melanoma.
*Proposed causes include: 
**Failure to recognize a primary lesion during clinical examination
**Prior removal of the primary lesion during traumatic injury or by excision w/o pathologic diagnosis
**de novo malignant transformation of ectopic nodal melanocyte (s)
**Spontaneous regression of the primary lesion.


*'''John Wayne Cancer Institute, CA; 2008''' (1971-2005) PMID 18235114 -- &quot;Improved survival after lymphadenectomy for nodal metastasis from an unknown primary melanoma.&quot; (Lee CC, J Clin Oncol. 2008 Feb 1;26(4):535-41.)
**Retrospective. 1, 571 patients (262 had MUP; 1,309 had MKP) who underwent regional lymphadenectomy for nodal melanoma. No evidence of distant metastatic disease (brain &amp; body imaging available at time of diagnosis). Subjects w/o apparent primary melanoma underwent cutaneous, ophthalmologic and anogenital examination. 181 (82%) MKP and 174 (71%) MUP received adjuvant therapy. Majority were male (66%), less than age 60 (73%), and had axillary site of nodal metastasis (66%). 22% had neck nodal metastasis. Similar distribution of age, sex, # of involved nodes &amp; decade of diagnosis between groups. Median F/U 77 mo
**Outcome:
{| border=1
  |+ Survival

  | 40% +/-7%	
  | 19 mo (p=0.066)

|}
**Conclusion: Lymphadenectomy effective. Significantly better postop OS for MUP vs MKP suggests strong endogenous immune response

*'''MD Anderson; 2006''' (1990-2001) PMID 16568458 -- &quot;Metastatic melanoma to lymph nodes in patients with unknown primary sites.&quot; (Cormier JN, Cancer. 2006 May 1;106(9):2012-20.)
**Retrospective. 71 patients with MUP and control 466 patients with regional LN mets and known primary. N1b 47%, N2b 14%, N3 39%. Median F/U 7.7 years
**Outcome: 5-year OS MUP 55% vs. MKP 42%; 10-year OS 44% vs. 32% (SS)
**Adverse predictors: &gt;50 years, male, N2b/N3 status. MUP favorable prognostic factors (HR 0.6, SS)
**Conclusion: Relatively favorable long-term survival compared to Stage III disease, and should be considered for Stage III adjuvant protocols</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">1. Half filled or filled sub-shells are most stable so are favoured at expense of 4s sub-shell only containing 1 electron (see page for more info)

2. A tranistional element is defined as a d-block element forming one or more stable ions with incompletely filled d-orbitals e.g. zinc and scandium are not transitional metals because they can't form ions with partially filled d-orbitals

3. They form ions with partially filled d-orbitals which can absorb light 

4. green. therefore absorbs red approx 650nm

5. rust coloured gelatinous precipitate

{{closed|1=Closed as '''keep''' due to lack of consensus. In general, book contributors should make decisions regarding individual pages in a book unless content clearly falls outside the scope of Wikijunior and Wikibooks. Currently there is no consensus that this was the case. Also there is currently no consensus that this page should be moved outside of How Things Work or from outside of the Wikijunior namespace. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:55, 23 December 2008 (UTC)}}

No reason given.

Oh, that was like a year ago that I tagged it.  I probably shouldn't have, considering that I still don't entirely understand the deletion criteria or process.  The original reasoning is that it didn't fit in.  It just didn't match with the rest of the book.  It seemed to me that that book was more to be about simple machines and appliances and everyday objects, not abstract concepts.  Also, having looked at the talk page, it seemed that toher people agreed with me.  I haven't noticed any real changes to the article since I tagged it anyway. [[User:RT Jones|RT Jones]] ([[User talk:RT Jones|talk]]) 20:41, 8 November 2008 (UTC)

:{{comment}} I'm not sure I agree with deletion, but this page ''does'' feel strangely out of place in the book. A GUI is a very abstract and high-level concept to be dropping on a young Wikijunior reader. I do think we should have more books teaching children about computers and programming (I've been idly planning such a book myself), but this really seems like the wrong way to go about doing it. I don't know what to do about this page in the long run, whether it can be cleaned up or whether it should be removed, but maybe it should be marked in some way to let readers know that it's &quot;experimental&quot; or &quot;advanced&quot; or something. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 21:39, 8 November 2008 (UTC)

*[[Image:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' I've done a lot of work with wikijunior, and dont think that this page is inkeeping with the books target audience. I think that the topic is too advanced for the book, no matter how simple it is made. Though maybe it could be moved into a computing book. [[User:Reece|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reece&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:Reece|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Talk)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] [[Special:Contributions/Reece|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Contributions)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] 21:50, 8 November 2008 (UTC)

*[[Image:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' Since it appears that my orignal rationale made sense, I'll say &quot;delete.&quot;  Maybe move it to an &quot;Everything You Ever Wanted to Know About Computing Acronyms&quot; wikibook, but it'd still need a lot of work first.  [[User:RT Jones|RT Jones]] ([[User talk:RT Jones|talk]]) 23:06, 9 November 2008 (UTC)

* [[Image:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Speedy Keep''' This is not advertisements, spam, nonsense, vandalism, etc. or outside Wikibooks' scope. This decision should be left up to the book contributors to decide and not the Wikibooks community. Any decision by the Wikibooks community could be in conflict with the wishes of the book contributors in terms of their vision of the book's scope, audience, etc. If the book contributors decide they do not want to keep this and nobody wishes to salvage it for another purpose on Wikibooks than it would meet the speedy deletion criteria (provided proof that discussion and a decision by the book contributors took place is provided of course). --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:38, 10 November 2008 (UTC)

* [[Image:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' While it may be a bit high-level for Wikikjunior, there is nothing that places it outside the scope of Wikibooks. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 19:19, 10 November 2008 (UTC)
:*{{comment}} Well surely it needs to be moved to a more appropriate place then. If its too high-level for wikijunior whats it doing there? Wikijunior is starting to look more and more like it needs its own scope policy... [[User:Reece|&lt;font color=&quot;black&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;Reece&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] [[User talk:Reece|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Talk)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] [[Special:Contributions/Reece|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;&lt;small&gt;(Contributions)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/font&gt;]] 22:24, 10 November 2008 (UTC)
:*: I have to go with darklama's comment below; the discussion here is only about whether the material fits the scope of Wikibooks. Not whether it fits the scope of that particular book. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 20:44, 20 November 2008 (UTC)
:*I agree with Reece here, there are more then two options on a VfD, we don't just decide whether to &quot;keep&quot; or &quot;delete&quot; things, although those are definitely the most popular options. This page really isn't appropriate for this book, which is a normal occurrence in the editing and authoring processes. Wikijunior is books for children, and things that aren't appropriate for children don't belong in Wikijunior. The correct course of action is to move it out of WJ, even if there is no home for in in WB. In that case, we delete it because it can't stay where it is and it has nowhere else to go. It's not a bad thing, it's called &quot;revision&quot; and it's something we need to do in our books all the time. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:27, 10 November 2008 (UTC)
:*: Book contributors decide what the aim, scope, purpose and intentions of a book are. All I'm saying is that because they make those calls, they should also be making the call as to whether this page fits within the aim, scope, purpose and intentions of the book. What makes something too high-level for Wikijunior? How do you define what is and isn't appropriate for children to learn? Children use computers too, so how is understanding how a GUI works inappropriate for children? To me this seems like a case of some people having a very limited idea of what is appropriate for children. If the book contributors don't want it than that is fine, but I don't think this the right way to determine Wikijunior's scope and what is and isn't appropriate for children. Remember Wikijunior includes books for children of all ages. Surely parents and guardians should be making the call on what is appropriate for their child or children to read and not us? There may even be books outside of Wikijunior that parents might consider appropriate for their children to read. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:19, 20 November 2008 (UTC)
:*:* [[Image:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment'''  Well put.  '''Question:''' Where are the contributors of this book, anyway?  It seems to have been almost abandoned, especially the GUI module.  I guess my point is that this particular module appears as if it was written on a whim by someone who promptly disappeared.  As far as I know, there have been no major edits since I nominated this for deletion.  Once again, I apologize if I'm going about this the wrong way. [[User:RT Jones|RT Jones]] ([[User talk:RT Jones|talk]]) 00:40, 21 November 2008 (UTC)  '''Edit:''' [[Operating_System_Design/Graphical_user_interfaces|This]] seems to fit the bill of a module explaining GUI a bit better, if it makes any difference.
:*:*: Lack of recent activity is, however, hardly an argument for deletion. There is nothing wrong with users disappearing after doing a little bit of work; we can use all the help we can get. This book seems to have enjoyed a very large number of editors. I'd see that as a good thing and is indicative of its popularity. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 03:51, 3 December 2008 (UTC)
:*:*:* Most certainly not.  Any help certainly is appreciated.  What I was saying, from my particularly limited viewpoint, was that this module seemed to have been written almost entirely by one person.  The significance of that is that nobody else in the Wikijunior project appeared to support this module.  How Things Work is a popular article, but the GUI chapter hasn't really gone anywhere practical at all.  Or that's what it looked like to me.  I could have sworn I nominated this longer ago than the 19th of October.  I seriously thought I nominated it much longer ago, like in January, when I didn't understand how much of this process was supposed to work.  There was some discussion on the How Things Work talk page against the inclusion of this module, but it wasn't much.  [[User:RT Jones|RT Jones]] ([[User talk:RT Jones|talk]]) 22:32, 3 December 2008 (UTC) '''Edit:''' Seems appropriate to ask: Since we can only decide if this fits the scope of Wikibooks as a whole here, and not whether it fits some scope of Wikijunior or whether the book contributors (of How Things Work, I guess) want it, where would those issues get tackled?
:*:*:*: The talk page of [[WB:WIWJ]] might be a good place to discuss the scope of Wikijunior. The talk page for the GUI page might be a good place to discuss the appropriateness of the page in the book, or perhaps [[Wikijunior talk:How Things Work]] will get the attention of more contributors of the book as a whole. Also just because another book has a page about GUIs too doesn't mean this should be deleted. The GUI information in the OS Design book is likely to have a very different audience, purpose and scope than the GUI page in How Things Work book. You could use the OS Design's GUI page to aid improving the page in the How Things Work book though if you think it provides more useful information that kids would enjoy. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:06, 3 December 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Ares Network ==
Ares (software implementation) was developed in the middle of 2002, originally using the [[w:Gnutella|Gnutella]] network. After Six months of operation, it switched to its own network comprising the leaves-and-[[w:supernode (networking)|supernode]]s p2p architecture. Having a protocol that can be difficult to identify made Ares at times the only P2P client that could functions on restricted networks, such as some university campuses.

=== Software Implementations ===
*'''[[w:Ares Galaxy|Ares]]''' ( http://aresgalaxy.sourceforge.net/ ), a Chat/File Sharing P2P implementation in Delphi/Kylix. It's based on a Network organized into leafs and supernodes into a topology featuring broadcast-type searches. Ares can deliver a broader search horizon by means of the DHT technology, using a mime filter to DHT engine. Ares users can also join chat rooms or host a channel. It is for 32-bit MS Windows Operating Systems (NT/2000/XP) and Open Source under the GPL License (GNU General Public License). From version 1.9.0, data sharing was enabled between two peers behind a firewall. From version 1.9.4, Ares included support for the [[w:BitTorrent|BitTorrent]] protocol. From version 1.9.9, Ares Galaxy has  support for the [[w:SHOUTcast|SHOUTcast]] internet radio stations.

;Discontinued Implementations
*''[[w:Warez P2P|Warez P2P]]'' was a proprietary [[w:Peer-to-peer|P2P]] [[w:filesharing|filesharing]] service that uses the [[w:Ares Galaxy#The Ares network|Ares network]], and offers a service similar to that of [[w:Kazaa|Kazaa]]. Up to version 1.6, Warez P2P was a clone of [[w:Ares Galaxy|Ares Galaxy]], created by Italian developer Alberto Trevisan, but since then has been developed independently by Neoteric Ltd until recently when it was discontinued.

Hello AdRiley. I might get back to my Irish language lessons one of these days, but they need to be divided into subsections. I don't know how to do that. [[User:Panu Höglund|Panu Höglund]] ([[User talk:Panu Höglund|talk]]) 09:45, 18 May 2010 (UTC)</text>

Welcome to the fifth basic lesson of Hebrew! In this lesson we're going to learn journey-related vocabulary and how to conjugate ''qal'' verbs in the present tense.

==Dialogue==
Sarah and David now both have ended their visit in Tel Aviv. They bid each other farewell.

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;
&lt;big&gt;
{{Hebrew|
'''שרה:''' היי! אני נוֹסַעַת לירושלים.&lt;br&gt;
'''דוד:''' באמת? אני נוֹסֵעַ במָטוֹס לניו-יורק.&lt;br&gt;
'''שרה:''' אני נוֹסַעַת ברַכֶּבֶת.&lt;br&gt;
'''דוד:''' טוב... שלום, שרה.&lt;br&gt;
'''שרה:''' להתראות!
}}
&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

{{Question-answer
| question = Transliterate the dialogue (new vocabulary underlined).
| answer = '''Sarah:''' Hay (hi)! Ani &lt;u&gt;nosa‘at&lt;/u&gt; leyerushalayim.&lt;br&gt;
'''David:''' Be’emet? Ani &lt;u&gt;nosea‘&lt;/u&gt; be&lt;u&gt;matos&lt;/u&gt; lenyu-yorq.&lt;br&gt;
'''Sarah:''' Ani &lt;u&gt;nosa‘at&lt;/u&gt; be&lt;u&gt;rakevet.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''David:''' Tov... Shalom, Sarah.&lt;br&gt;
'''Sarah:''' Lehitra’ot!
}}

==On Voyage==
If we want to ask where someone is going, we need to be introduced to a new interrogative pronoun, namely {{Hebrew|לְאָן}} (meaning “where to?”). It is composed of the preposition “to” and a question word obsolete in modern Hebrew meaning “where”.

When we want to add a preposition to an interrogative pronoun in Hebrew, we simply attach the preposition directly to the question word: “'''from where''' &lt;s&gt;do&lt;/s&gt; you come?” (remember, no auxiliary verb “to do” in Hebrew).

So, how are you going to get there? We add the preposition “in” before any mode of transport ({{Hebrew|בְּמָטוֹס}}). 

Here are some modes of transport:

{| width=100% style=&quot;text-align:center&quot;
| [[Image:VW Golf IV 1.6.JPG|100px|Car]] || [[Image:IC-3-Israel-TA-Uni.jpg|100px|Train]] || [[Image:Elal.b747.750pix.jpg|100px|Aeroplane]] || [[Image:Egged bug in Afula 01.jpg|100px|Coach]] || [[Image:Graf_Zeppelin_(ship,_1989).jpg|100px|Boat]]
|-
| {{Hebrew|מְכוֹנִית}} ''f'' ||  °{{Hebrew|רַכֶּבֶת}} ''f'' || {{Hebrew|מָטוֹס}} ''m'' || {{Hebrew|אוֹטוֹבּוּס}} ''m'' ||  {{Hebrew|אֳנִיָּה}} ''f''
|}

'''Notes'''
* {{Hebrew|אוֹטוֹבּוּס}} is a phonological irregularity, since the accent here falls on the first syllable ('''ó'''tobus).
* The mode of transportation can be put anywhere in a sentence. The choice of where should you place it depends on what you want to emphasize.

'''Examples'''
* He comes by train.
: {{Hebrew|הוא בא ברַכֶּבֶת.}}
* They (''f'') come by ship?
: {{Hebrew|הן באות באֳנִיָּה?}}

==''Qal'' Present Tense==

If thus far we have only learned verbs with two radicals in their roots ({{Hebrew|שׂ-ם}}), now we shall tackle verbs with 3 radicals, since the overwhelming majority of verbs have them.

Let us take the verb {{Hebrew|כּוֹתֵב}} (meaning “to write”, root: {{Hebrew|כ-ת-ב}}):

{|  {{Hebrew table|Verbs|?לְאָן אַתָּה נוֹסֵעַ|To write|לִכְתֹב|4}}
!
! Singular 
! Plural
|-
| ''m''
| {{Hebrew|כּוֹתֵב}} 
| {{Hebrew|כּוֹתְבִ'''ים'''}}
|-
| ''f''
| °{{Hebrew|כּוֹתֶבֶ'''ת'''}}
| {{Hebrew|כּוֹתְב'''וֹת'''}}
|}

Other verbs that conjugate the same:

{|  {{Hebrew table|Vocabulary|?לְאָן אַתָּה נוֹסֵעַ|Verbs|פְּעַלִים|2}}
! English
! עִבְרִית
|-
| Think
| {{Hebrew|ח-שׁ-ב}}
|-
| Eat 
| {{Hebrew|א-כ-ל}}
|-
| Say
| {{Hebrew|א-מ-ר}}
|-
| Walk/Go
| {{Hebrew|ה-ל-כ}}
|- 
| Love
| {{Hebrew|א-ה-ב}}
|}


===Irregularities===

When at the end of a root, some consonants change the conjugations of the verbs. These are known as '''weak radicals''', {{Hebrew|א, ה, ח, י, ע}}.

When a root ends with {{Hebrew|ה}}, the said letter is omitted of all the conjugations except for the singulars. The masculine is regular, and the feminine replaces the {{Hebrew|ֵ}} with {{Hebrew|ָ}}. 

When a root ends with {{Hebrew|ח}} or {{Hebrew|ע}}, in the masculine singular a {{Hebrew|ַ}} is added to the final letter and in the feminine all of the {{Hebrew|ֶ}} are replaced with {{Hebrew|ַ}}.

Confusing? Here are examples for clarification.

'''Examples'''
* {{Hebrew|ר-א-ה}} (“to see”, ends with {{Hebrew|ה}})
: {{Hebrew|רוֹאֵה, רוֹ'''אָ'''ה, רוֹ'''אִ'''ים, רוֹ'''א'''וֹת}}
* {{Hebrew|נ-ס-ע}} (“to travel, ride”, ends with {{Hebrew|ע}})
: {{Hebrew|נוֹסֵ'''עַ''', נוֹ'''סַעַ'''ת, נוֹסְעִים, נוֹסְעוֹת}}
* {{Hebrew|פ-ת-ח}} (“to open”, ends with {{Hebrew|ח}})
: {{Hebrew|פּוֹתֵ'''חַ''', פּוֹ'''תַחַ'''ת, פּוֹתְחִים, פּוֹתְחוֹת}}

'''Notes'''
* Roots ending with {{Hebrew|ע}} or {{Hebrew|ח}} form an orthographic irregularity &amp;mdash; {{Hebrew|נוֹסֵעַ}} and {{Hebrew|פּוֹתֵחַ}} are pronounced ''nose'''a‘''''' and ''pote'''aħ''''', respectively.

==Vocabulary==

{{Question-answer
| question = חושבים
| answer = ''ħoshvim''&lt;br&gt; Think (''m sg.'')
}}
| width=33% valign=&quot;top&quot;|
{{Question-answer
| question = .הוא נוסע לניו-יורק
| answer = ''hu nosea‘ lenyu-yorq''&lt;br&gt; He travels to New York.
}}
{{Question-answer
| question = פותח
| answer = ''poteaħ''&lt;br&gt; Open (''m sg.'')
}}
{{Question-answer
| question = מכונית
| answer = ''mekhonit''&lt;br&gt; Car
}}
{{Question-answer
| question = הולכת

}}
{{Question-answer
| question = אומרים
| answer = ''omrim''&lt;br&gt; Say (''m pl.'')
}}
|}

Translate the dialogue from the beginning of this lesson.
{{Question-answer
| question = '''.שרה:''' היי! אני נוֹסַעַת לירושלים
| answer = Sarah: Hi! I'm going (travelling) to Jerusalem.
}}
{{Question-answer
| question = '''.דוד:''' באמת? אני נוֹסֵעַ במָטוֹס לניו-יורק
| answer = David: Really? I'm going by aeroplane to New York.
}}
{{Question-answer
| question = '''.שרה:''' אני נוֹסַעַת ברַכֶּבֶת
| answer = Sarah: I'm going by train.
}}
{{Question-answer
| question = '''.דוד:''' טוב... שלום, שרה
| answer = David: Well, goodbye, Sarah.
}}
{{Question-answer
| question = '''!שרה:''' להתראות
| answer = Sarah: Goodbye!
}}

==Summary==
In this lesson, you have learned:
* How to say and ask where you are going ({{Hebrew|אני נוֹסֵעַ ל...}}).
* How to say which mode of transport you are using ({{Hebrew|באוֹטוֹבּוּס.}}).
* How to conjugate verbs from ''binyan qal'' in the present tense.
* How to conjugate verbs with weak radicals.
Practice what you've learned in the [[Hebrew/Exercises/Basic 5|exercises]].

This template is used for displaying the name of a book, all relevant links, and transcluding the [[User:Whiteknight/Notes|Notes page]] for that book. This is mostly used at [[User:Whiteknight/All Books]]. 

{{User:Whiteknight/Color|red|Warning!}} This template makes heavy use of ParserFunctions, and may only be transcluded into one of my user pages. Attempts to edit this template by other people besides myself will likely be reverted. Plus, this template is very complex and convoluted, so any attempts to edit it will probably fail. I can't even do it right every time, and I know what's supposed to be happening.

;Parameters:
:1: Name of the book
:title: Alternative name of the book, if it should be displayed differently from how the various pages are named.
:code: The [[User:Whiteknight/Book Status Codes|status code]] of the book.
:pc: Alternative name of the personal collection, if any
:cc: Alternative name of the community collection, if any
:state: the state of the book on a sliding scale: bad, stub, expand, revise, review, candidate, featured. &lt;/noinclude&gt;</text>

== Compacting ==

As a memory pool is allocated from, over time the pool will become fragmented. Some objects from the pool will be allocated surrounded by objects that are not, in seemingly random order. Memory compaction is the process of moving allocated objects together, and leaving empty space together.

Consider a system with 3 pages and about 50% of their objects are allocated. By compacting all the living objects into the first two pages, leaving the third page completely empty. This empty page can then be ignored during future mark/sweep phases since it is known to be empty of living objects, or it can be released and returned to the operating system.</text>

== Cooperative Collectors ==

Cooperative collectors are collectors that require the rest of the system to participate in the collector's operation, such as with reference counting. These collectors spread the bookkeeping effort throughout the system and don't require a separate mark or sweep phase. These separate GC phases often require the rest of the program to come to a complete stop temporarily, which can create intolerable pauses in program operation. Cooperative collectors don't have these pauses.

== Pages ==

The word &quot;page&quot; has many meanings in the world of computing. In terms of memory management, we will define the term like this:

;Page:A Page is a region of memory dedicated to holding one type of object with a fixed size. This is also known as a homogenous memory region.

Since all the objects in the page are the same size, it can be treated like a gigantic array in memory and objects can be indexed easily and don't require any extra meta data to find objects.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Basic Concepts == 
To conduct a successful hypothesis test, the following are required:

* Testable Hypothesis
We need to have a null (&lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt;) and alternate (&lt;math&gt;H_1&lt;/math&gt;) hypothesis.

* Feasible test statistic
A test statistic is a random variable whose value for given sample data determines whether the null is rejected or retained.  It is feasible when:
** Its probability distribution is known when the null hypothesis (&lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt;) is true.
** Its value can be calculated from the given sample data

* Decision rule
A decision rule clearly delineates the:
** Rejection region - the set of values of the test statistic for which &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; is to be rejected.
** Non-rejection region - the set of values of the test statistic for which the &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; is to be retained.

== Procedure for testing a hypothesis ==
# Formulate &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H_1&lt;/math&gt;.
# Specify the test statistic and its distribution.
# Calculate the sample value of the test statistic under &lt;math&gt;H_0&lt;/math&gt; for the given sample data.
# Select a significance level (&amp;alpha;) and determine the corresponding critical values (for the particular distribution).
# Apply the decision rule and state the conclusion (or inference) implied by the sample value of the test statistic.

== Notes ==
* The null hypothesis will always be the position where there is an equality (either strong or weak), and the alternate hypothesis will have the inequality.

      <text xml:space="preserve">CORBA allows for the service of persistent objects, i.e., objects not residing in RAM, or cached memory in a runnable state. The IMR is the infrastructure which provides this functionality. The thing is, with modern servers, this really isn't a concern as the ACE+TAO executables are quite small. For a smaller chunk of hardware, like a PC or laptop, this still holds true as the executables are really quite small. The point being, that if you need to use the IMR, your app is likely quite beefy and needs to run in a multi server environment, thus, you can afford the $200 USD for the manual from OCI to figure out how to use it effectively. That being said, it isn't too bad as most of the functionality is baked into the command line of your service app. You can also look at the TAO documentation, which as usual, gets you 80% there.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A t-test involves the computation of a t-statistic, which is then compared to the critical values of a t-distribution for a given significance level.

A t-test is essentially the Z-statistic of a variable divided by the square root of an independent chi-square distribution divided by its own degrees-of-freedom.  The resulting value is the t-statistic with the same degrees-of-freedom as the chi-squared distribution.

&lt;math&gt; t = \frac{Z}{\sqrt{V/m}} \sim t[m]  &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the t-statistic of &lt;math&gt;\beta_1&lt;/math&gt; would be:
* Numerator:
&lt;math&gt; Z(\hat{\beta_1}) = \frac{\hat{\beta_1} - \beta_1}{se(\hat{\beta_1})} = \frac{(\hat{\beta_1} - \beta_1)(\sum X_{i}^2)^1/2}{\sigma} &lt;/math&gt;

* Denominator:
We know (as an implication of the last assumption of the CLRM) that
&lt;math&gt; \frac{(N-2)\hat{\sigma^2}}{\sigma^2} \sim \chi^2 [N-2]
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,
&lt;math&gt; \frac{\hat{\sigma^2}}{\sigma^2} \sim \frac{\chi^2 [N-2]}{[N-2]} \Rightarrow \sqrt{\frac{\chi^2 [N-2}{[N-2]}} \sim \frac{\hat{\sigma}}{\sigma} &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, putting it all together we get,

&lt;math&gt; t(\hat{\beta_1}) = \frac{Z(\hat{\beta_1})}{\hat{\sigma}/\sigma} = \frac{(\hat{\beta_1 - \beta_1})(\sum X_i^2)^{1/2}/\sigma}{\sigma^2 / \sigma}
= \frac{\hat{\beta_1} - \beta_1}{\hat{\sigma} / (\sum X_i^2)^{1/2}}
= \frac{\hat{\beta_1} - \beta_1}{\hat{se}(\hat{\beta_1})}
\sim t[N-2]
&lt;/math&gt;

== Notes == 
* &lt;math&gt; se(\hat{\beta_1}) = \frac{\sigma}{(\sum X_i^2)^{1/2}} &lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt; \hat{se} (\hat{\beta_1}) = \frac{\hat{\sigma}}{(\sum X_i^2)^{1/2}} &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Winter-War-Overview.png|thumb|right|The Soviet attack and Finnish defence]]
The Winter War began in November 1939 when the Soviet Union attacked Finland. The Soviet army was much larger than the Finnish army with four times as many soldiers and 200 times as many tanks. But the Finns were fighting to defend their own homes and the Soviet army had many new soldiers who were still learning. This meant the Finns were able to keep the fight going for longer than anyone thought possible. The war didn't end until March 1940 and even then Finland wasn't completely beaten.


==Before the war==

The Soviet Union had been trying to take some of Finland for its own use, where it wanted to build a base for its warships. Finland said, &quot;No.&quot; So the Soviets wanted to fight the Finns for the land. They decided to lie. The Soviets fired their artillery (very large guns) at one of their own towns and said that the Finns had done it. They did this so that they would have an excuse for fighting the Finns. The Soviet Union was much, much bigger than Finland, and nobody thought Finland would last long in a war. Soviet army leaders estimated, that Helsinki (capital of Finland) would be taken in two weeks.

==The war starts==

In the first attack, nearly three-quarters of a million Soviet soldiers fought the Finns, who had less than one-quarter of a million men in their army.  The Soviets thought they would win easily, but they were surprised! They found it really hard to beat the Finns. The country was covered with snow, and the Finns were brilliant skiers. They would ski into battle, shoot at the Soviets, then ski away before the Soviets got a chance to fight back.  They also attacked camps and kitchens so that the Soviets had no hot food and no warm place to sleep. At the time of the war, it was winter, and the temperature in Finland was  -40 degrees Celsius. That's as cold as the North Pole!
[[File:Winter war.jpg|thumb|left|Well camouflaged Finnish soldiers]]
The Finns wore white clothes so they were hard to see in the snow, but the Soviet clothes were all black and brown so they were easy to see and shoot. 

Instead of the Soviets winning easily, it began to look like the Finns might win. In one amazing battle the Soviets lost nearly 25,000 soldiers as well as 43 tanks, 260 lorries and loads of guns. The Finns only lost 800 men! 
[[File:Norwegian Winter War Volunteers.jpg|thumb|right|Norwegian volunteers in Finland]]
Because the war was going so well for Finland, other countries started thinking about helping. Some of these countries were Sweden, Norway, Britain and France. Some brave men volunteered to help, but the rulers of the other countries couldn't make up their minds whether or not to send their armies.

==End of the war==
&lt;!--[[File:Raattentie T-26.jpg|thumb|left|A knocked out Soviet tank is inspected by Finish soldiers]] --&gt;
As winter ended, the Finnish army was becoming really tired. Although the Soviets had lost far more soldiers than the Finns, they still had many more they could send. The Finns began to lose hope. They'd even begun to run out of bullets for their guns. At this time Sweden, which is next door to Finland, said it wouldn't help. So the Finns decided to discuss giving up with the Soviets, and the Soviets agreed.

==Aftermath==

[[File:Finnish areas ceded in 1940.png|thumb|left|The land Finland had to cede to the Soviet Union to end the war]]

Finland had to give up the land the Soviet Union wanted in order to end the Winter War. In the war, the Soviet Union had sent over one and a half million men to Finland. Some people think one million of them were killed, although some other people think it could have been a lot less. The Finns also destroyed 1,000 aircraft and more than 2,000 tanks. Finland lost about 20,000 men. Because the Finns did not easily give up, they were able to defend their country for a long time. The Finns were brave, but unfortunately they lacked the resources to win the war.

      <comment>/* Things to check */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Over the last 10 years, my usage of CORBA technologies has included [[http://orbit-resource.sourceforge.net/ Orbit]], [[http://www.jacorb.org/documentation.html JacOrb]], and [[http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/TAO.html ACE+TAO]]. Of the three technologies, ACE+TAO has been the most useful as it has been the most portable among platforms, and the most feature rich. The promise of CORBA of course is that you put in some IDL, run it through the IDL compiler, and out comes a mostly written client server application. As you've seen with the previous examples, this is mostly a stretch goal for the existing spec. The only area where this applies is for the RPC style applications. For everything else, you, the programmer, are responsible for doing quite a bit of non-network related CORBA internal programming. Perhaps, some day in the distant future, this spec can be widened to the point that many of the desired features can be accessed from the IDL. That being said, it is quite nice not to have to worry about the networking aspect of programming. It's also nice to be able to rely on the POA to manage objects, even if this is only a slight improvement over modern C++ template patterns such as those found in the STL and Boost.

The warts of this particular implementation of a committee designed spec should in no way detract from its substantial advantages, most notably, its performance in relation to other technologies, and relative ease of programming, again in relation to comparable technologies. For example, a white paper available from the ACE+TAO website details the performance advantage in using TAO's CORBA to [[http://manoftoday.wordpress.com/2006/09/29/in-depth-investigation-of-corba-vs-soap/ Microsoft's .Net protocol]] as being 40x faster, and a comparison of [[http://www.jot.fm/issues/issue_2004_05/article2/|CORBA to J2EE performance and features]] (if a bit dated) is generally favourable to CORBA.

As the examples in this Wikibook illustrate, using TAO's CORBA to implement a programming environment to distribute objects and events demonstrates, performing most tasks in a distributed manner isn't that hard. Using TAO's CORBA for a robust, configurable, error free implementation makes it that much more desirable, and when you consider the performance advantages of using this technology as glue for your various programming projects, CORBA may well start to appear as the preferred middleware technology for most of your needs.

To make the examples in this book, I used [[http://www.kdevelop.org KDevelop]] as the programming IDE. I used this on Linux, and then used Microsoft's Visual C++ for the MS environment. Generally, I'd do all my development first under Linux as developing and deploying services under Linux is much easier. This is not to say that testing out the examples shouldn't be done under Ms Windows. Problems you will run into under Windows include the usual issue with lack of support for server based applications. If you look under the ACE directory in the TAO distribution, there is an example of a Microsoft server which I believe I've gotten to work in the past. 

If you're going to use [[http://www.kdevelop.org KDevelop]], or a similar [[http://sources.redhat.com/automake/automake.html autotools]] based IDE, then, you'll want to put the appropriate libraries in the LDFLAGS line of your project. If your IDE doesn't support a GUI field to set this, then edit your Makefile.AM file so that the &lt;your project name&gt;_LDFLAGS variable has the following items in it: '''-lTAO_PortableServer -lTAO_CosNaming -lTAO_AnyTypeCode -lACE -lTAO''' , plus any database libraries you might need.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An F-test involves the computation of an F-statistic, which is then compared to the critical values of an F-distribution for a given significance and numerator and denominator degrees-of-freedom.

An F-statistic is calculated by dividing a chi-squared distribution divided by its degrees-of-freedom by another (independent) chi-squared distribution by its degrees-of-freedom.  The resulting F-statistic has two degrees-of-freedom parameters, one each for the numerator and the denominator.

Therefore, the F-statistic for &lt;math&gt;\hat{\beta_1} &lt;/math&gt; would be:
* Numerator:
We know (somehow) that &lt;math&gt; [Z(0,1)]^2 = \chi^2 [1] &lt;/math&gt;, therefore we set the numerator equal to:

&lt;math&gt; Z(\hat{\beta_1})^2 = \frac{(\hat{\beta_1} - \beta_1 ) ^ 2 (\sum X_i^2)}{\sigma^2}
\sim \chi^2 [1] = \frac{\chi^2 [1]}{1}
&lt;/math&gt;

* Denominator:
From the same implication of the last assumption of the CLRM as used by the t-test explanation,

&lt;math&gt; \frac{\chi^2 [N-2]}{N-2} \sim \frac{\hat{\sigma^2}}{\sigma^2} &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, putting it all together gives us:
&lt;math&gt; F(\hat{\beta_1}) = \frac{(\hat{\beta_1} - \beta_1 )^2 (\sum X_i^2) / \sigma^2}{\hat{\sigma^2} / \sigma ^2}
= \frac{(\hat{\beta_1} - \beta_1)^2}{\hat{\sigma^2} / \sum X_i^2}
= \frac{(\hat{\beta_1} - \beta_1)^2}{\hat{Var} (\hat{\beta_1})} \sim F[1,N-2]
&lt;/math&gt;

The 4012 is a member of the [[Practical_Electronics/IC/4000 Series|4000 Series]] [[Practical_Electronics/CMOS|CMOS]] range, and contains two independent [[Practical_Electronics/Logic#NAND|NAND gates]], each with four inputs. The pinout diagram, given on the right, is the standard four-input CMOS logic gate IC layout:

:*Pin 7 is the ground supply (GND)
:*Pin 14 is the positive supply (V&lt;sub&gt;DD&lt;/sub&gt;)
:*Pins 2-5 and 9-12 are gate inputs for the two gates
:*Pin 1 and 13 are gate outputs
:*Pin 6 and 8 are not connected

The truth table for one of the two gates is shown below. For more infomation about the NAND gate in general, see this [[Practical Electronics/Logic#NAND|module]].

{{center|'''Truth Table for a Single Gate'''}}
{{Truthtable4
|A|B|C|D|Q|1|1|1|1 |1|1|1|1 |1|1|1|1 |1|1|1|0}}

This chip is widely available, and usually comes in a [[Practical_Electronics/IC/DIL|DIL]]-14 or [[Practical_Electronics/IC/SOIC|SOIC]]-14 package.

This chip is different in pinout to the TTL [[Practical_Electronics/IC/7420|7420]], but can fulfill its function if the wiring is modified.</text>

==Connotations of the Text==

===Line 12===

This line is surrounded by textual problems.  The manuscripts read:  ''nam in'' (or ''ni'') ''ista prevalet nichil tacere.'' Given above is the reading of S.G. Owen, which has the major advantage of making sense.

Canada is a country occupying most of northern North America. It is the world's second largest country by total land area and shares land borders with the [[Wikijunior:North America/United States|United States]] to the south and northwest. The Capital is Ottawa.
[[File:Flag of Canada.svg|thumb|150px|right|The Flag of Canada]]
==History==
Europeans first arrived when the Vikings settled briefly at L'Anse aux Meadows around AD 1000; following the failure of that colony, there was no further attempt at North American exploration until 1497, when John Cabot explored Canada's Atlantic coast for England, followed by Jacques Cartier in 1534 for France.

French explorer Samuel de Champlain arrived in 1603 and established the first permanent European settlements at Port Royal in 1605 and Quebec City in 1608. 

The English established fishing outposts in Newfoundland around 1610 and colonized the Thirteen Colonies to the south. A series of four Intercolonial Wars erupted between 1689 and 1763. Mainland Nova Scotia came under British rule with the Treaty of Utrecht (1713); the Treaty of Paris (1763) gave Canada and most of New France to Britain following the Seven Years' War.

Canada was the main front in the War of 1812 between the United States and the British Empire. The defence of Canada contributed to a sense of unity among British North Americans. Large-scale immigration to Canada began in 1815 from Britain and Ireland.
[[File:Parliament Hill Panorama.jpg|300px|thumb|Ottawa, The capital of Canada.]]
==Geography==
By total area, Canada is the second largest country in the world after [[Wikijunior:Europe/Russia|Russia]]. Canada also has the longest coast line in the world 243,000 kilometers (151,000 miles).

Canada is a federation made up of ten provinces and three territories; in turn, these may be grouped into regions. Western Canada consists of British Columbia and the three Prairie provinces: Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba. Central Canada is made up of Quebec and Ontario. Atlantic Canada consists of the three Maritime provinces: New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, and Nova Scotia, along with Newfoundland and Labrador. Eastern Canada refers to Central Canada and Atlantic Canada together. Three territories: Yukon, Northwest Territories, and Nunavut make up Northern Canada. Provinces have more authority than territories. Each has its own provincial or territorial symbols.

Average winter and summer high temperatures vary depending on the locations. Winters tend to be harsh in many regions of the country.
Daily average temperatures are near −15 °C (5 °F) but can drop below −40 °C (−40 °F) with severe wind chills. In non-coastal regions, snow can cover the ground almost six months of the year (more in the north)

Canada is geologically active having many earthquakes and potentially active volcanoes. Some notable volcanoes include: Mount Meager, Mount Garibaldi, Mount Cayley and the Mount Edziza Volcanic complex.

==People==
Canada's two official languages are [[Wikijunior:Languages/English|English]] and [[Wikijunior:Languages/French|French]]. Ninety-Nine percent of Canadians speak [[Wikijunior:Languages/English|English]] or [[Wikijunior:Languages/French|French]]. Sixty-Seven percent speak only English, thirteen percent speak only French, and eighteen percent speak both languages. Other languages spoken in the country include [[Wikijunior:Languages/Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin Chinese]], [[Wikijunior:Languages/Italian|Italian]], [[Wikijunior:Languages/German|German]], and Punjabi.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:United States (orthographic projection).svg|200px|thumb|right|Location of the United States]]
The United States of America (commonly referred to as the United States, the U.S., the USA, or America) is a federal constitutional republic made up of fifty states and a federal district. The country is situated mostly in central [[Wikijunior:North America|North America]] bordered by [[Wikijunior:North America/Canada|Canada]] to the north and [[Wikijunior:North America/Mexico|Mexico]] to the south. The state of [[Wikijunior:North America/United States/Alaska|Alaska]] is in the northwest of the continent, with [[Wikijunior:North America/Canada|Canada]] to its east and [[Wikijunior:Europe/Russia|Russia]] to the west across the Bering Strait. The state of [[Wikijunior:North America/United States/Hawaii|Hawaii]] is located in the mid-Pacific. The country also possesses several territories scattered around the Caribbean and Pacific.
[[File:Flag of the United States.svg|200px|thumb|right|The United States Flag]]
==History==
The indigenous peoples of the U.S. mainland, including Alaska Natives, migrated from Asia. They began arriving at least 12,000 and as many as 40,000 years ago. After Europeans began settling the Americas, many millions of indigenous Americans died from imported diseases such as smallpox.

In 1492, Genoese explorer Christopher Columbus reached several Caribbean islands, making first contact with the indigenous people. 

Tensions between American colonials and the British during the revolutionary period of the 1760s and early 1770s led to the American Revolutionary War, fought from 1775 through 1781. On June 14, 1775, the Continental Congress, meeting in Philadelphia, established a Continental Army under the command of George Washington. The Congress adopted the Declaration of Independence, drafted largely by Thomas Jefferson, on July 4, 1776. That date is now celebrated annually as America's Independence Day. In 1777, the Articles of Confederation established a weak federal government that operated until 1789.

After the British defeat by American forces assisted by the French, Great Britain recognized the independence of the United States. A constitutional convention was organized in 1787 by those wishing to create a strong national government, with powers of taxation. The United States Constitution was changed in 1788, and the new republic's first Senate, House of Representatives, and president—George Washington—took office in 1789. The Bill of Rights was adopted in 1791.

==Geography==
The United States is situated almost entirely in the Western Hemisphere and it is bordered by Canada on the north and Mexico on the south. Alaska is the largest state in area it touches the Pacific on the south and the Arctic Ocean on the north. Hawaii occupies an archipelago in the central Pacific, southwest of North America. After Russia and Canada, the United States is the world's third or fourth largest nation by total area. Including only land area, the United States is third in size behind Russia and China, just ahead of Canada.

The United States, with its large size and geographic variety, includes most climate types. The United States is home to more than 400 mammal, 700 bird, 500 reptile and amphibian, and 90,000 insect species. The United states is also home to a wide variety of plant life.
[[File:WhiteHouseSouthFacade.JPG|thumb|200px|right|The White House]]
==People==
The United States population is projected by the U.S. Census Bureau to be 305,975,000, including an estimated 11.2 million illegal immigrants. The United States is the third most populous nation in the world, after China and India. Its population growth rate is 0.89%, compared to the European Union's 0.16%.
===Languages===
In 2005, about 216 million, or 81% of the population aged five years and older, spoke only [[Wikijunior:Languages/English|English]] at home. [[Wikijunior:Languages/Spanish|Spanish]], spoken by 12% of the population at home, is the second most common language and the most widely taught foreign language. Some Americans want to make English the country's official language, as it is in at least twenty-eight states. Both Hawaiian and English are official languages in Hawaii by state law. While neither has an official language, New Mexico has laws providing for the use of both English and Spanish, as Louisiana does for English and French. Other states, such as California, require the publication of Spanish versions of certain government documents including court forms.

===Education===
American public education is operated by state and local governments, regulated by the United States Department of Education through restrictions on federal grants. Children are required in most states to attend school from the age of six or seven until they turn eighteen, which usually brings them to the end of their schooling; some states allow students to leave school at sixteen or seventeen. Of Americans twenty-five and older, 84.6% graduated from high school, 52.6% attended some college, 27.2% earned a bachelor's degree, and 9.6% earned graduate degrees. The basic literacy rate is approximately 99%.

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;grid&gt;
&lt;rows&gt;
  &lt;row&gt;First Name: 
    &lt;textbox id=&quot;firstName&quot; forward=&quot;onChange=onFirstNameChange&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/row&gt;
  &lt;row&gt;Last Name: 
    &lt;textbox id=&quot;lastName&quot; forward=&quot;onChange=onLastNameChange&quot;/&gt;
  &lt;/row&gt;
  &lt;row&gt;Full Name: &lt;label id=&quot;fullName&quot;/&gt;&lt;/row&gt;
&lt;/rows&gt;
&lt;/grid&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
'''macrobind.zs:'''
The class definition of the macro component, Username. It delegates API calls down to the real UI components.
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
import org.zkoss.zk.ui.*;
import org.zkoss.zul.*;

public class Username extends HtmlMacroComponent {
  
  public void setFirstName(String str) {
    getFellow(&quot;firstName&quot;).setValue(str);
    refreshFullName();
  }
  
  public String getFirstName() {
    return getFellow(&quot;firstName&quot;).getValue();
  }
  
  public void setLastName(String str) {
    getFellow(&quot;lastName&quot;).setValue(str);
    refreshFullName();
  }
  
  public String getLastName() {
    return getFellow(&quot;lastName&quot;).getValue();
  }

  private void refreshFullName() {
    getFellow(&quot;fullName&quot;).setValue(getFirstName() + &quot; &quot; + getLastName());
  }

}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
'''usemacrobind.zul:''' The example application that use the Username macro component and apply annotation data-binding. Notice that the '''save-when''' definition in the @{...} binding. It tells DataBinder to save Username's value to the Person object when the event is fired. The '''access:both''' tells DataBinder that the Username object is '''both''' for loading and saving. The button at the bottom is for checking whether the properties of the Person object are really changed. 
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;?init class=&quot;org.zkoss.zkplus.databind.AnnotateDataBinderInit&quot; ?&gt; 
&lt;?init zscript=&quot;macrobind.zs&quot; ?&gt;
&lt;?component name=&quot;username&quot; macro-uri=&quot;macrobind.zul&quot; class=&quot;Username&quot;?&gt;
&lt;window xmlns:a=&quot;http://www.zkoss.org/2005/zk/annotation&quot;&gt;
&lt;zscript&gt;
//define a Person data object for data-binding test
public class Person {
  private String _firstName;
  private String _lastName;
  
  public Person(String first, String last) {
    _firstName = first;
    _lastName = last;
  }

  public void setFirstName(String str) {
    _firstName = str;
  }
  
  public String getFirstName() {
    return _firstName;
  }
  
  public String setLastName(String str) {
    _lastName = str;
  }
  
  public String getLastName() {
    return _lastName;
  }
}

Person person = new Person(&quot;Hello&quot;, &quot;World&quot;);

&lt;/zscript&gt;
&lt;!--
   see http://www.zkoss.org/javadoc/3.0.0/zkplus/org/zkoss/zkplus/databind/AnnotateDataBinder.html
--&gt;
&lt;username 
	firstName=&quot;@{person.firstName,save-when='self.onFirstNameChange',access=both}&quot; 
	lastName=&quot;@{person.lastName,save-when='self.onLastNameChange',access=both}&quot;/&gt;

&lt;button label=&quot;check Person&quot; onClick='alert(person.firstName+&quot; &quot;+person.lastName)'/&gt;
&lt;/window&gt;

&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that you could have done the same thing in ZK2.4 without use of the 'forward' feature
by using this version of macrobind.zul that explicitly fires an event on the macro component. 

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;grid&gt;
&lt;rows&gt;
  &lt;row&gt;First Name: 
    &lt;textbox id=&quot;firstName&quot;&gt;
      &lt;attribute name=&quot;onChange&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- delegate event to the Macro Component --&gt;
        Events.sendEvent(spaceOwner, new Event(&quot;onFirstNameChange&quot;, spaceOwner));
      &lt;/attribute&gt;
    &lt;/textbox&gt;
  &lt;/row&gt;
  &lt;row&gt;Last Name: 
    &lt;textbox id=&quot;lastName&quot;&gt;
      &lt;attribute name=&quot;onChange&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- delegate event to the Macro Component --&gt;
        Events.sendEvent(spaceOwner, new Event(&quot;onLastNameChange&quot;, spaceOwner));
      &lt;/attribute&gt;
    &lt;/textbox&gt;
  &lt;/row&gt;
  &lt;row&gt;Full Name: &lt;label id=&quot;fullName&quot;/&gt;&lt;/row&gt;
&lt;/rows&gt;
&lt;/grid&gt;
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

= How do I dynamically render a grid from a collection of Java Objects? =

== Pending review ==

Hi. After you made a small change to a page, my subsequent edits appear to be &quot;pending review&quot;. At this early stage in the book's development, I'm expecting to make many more changes, so is there a way of switching off this while the book's still taking shape? [[User:Cormullion|Cormullion]] ([[User talk:Cormullion|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Cormullion|contribs]]) 07:32, 13 September 2014 (UTC)
:I don't think so, other than an admin deleting and then restoring the page. I shouldn't worry about it - everything that is unreviewed is &quot;pending review&quot; even if no first review has been given. [[User:QuiteUnusual|QuiteUnusual]] ([[User talk:QuiteUnusual|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/QuiteUnusual|contribs]]) 20:34, 13 September 2014 (UTC)
::Thanks. I'll get the hang of it soon, I hope... :) [[User:Cormullion|Cormullion]] ([[User talk:Cormullion|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Cormullion|contribs]]) 08:12, 14 September 2014 (UTC)

== ArchiverBot ==
No need to reply, just to register my displeasure on your interpretation of consensus, especially since dialog was open and the power to remove my objection was on the proponent side and not very hard to do, it was also not an unreasonable (per comments made) or an unsurpassable objection making the outright dismissal (without attempting addressing it on the discussion) ignoble. More the speed of witch the bot took action strongly indicates that a &quot;consensus&quot; was reached outside of the ongoing discussion something that is always a problem...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 20:14, 20 September 2014 (UTC)
:I hadn't considered that conversation was ongoing as there had been no comments for nearly 2 months. If there are specific things being archived that concern you then I'm happy to address that. However it didn't seem to be reasonable to stop all archiving for everyone given the state of the request. There was no off wiki discussion on this.what you see on the rfp page is the totality of the discussion. [[User:QuiteUnusual|QuiteUnusual]] ([[User talk:QuiteUnusual|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/QuiteUnusual|contribs]]) 20:43, 20 September 2014 (UTC)
::I'm not asking you to undo I'm just stating that a clear error was made and prompting you not to do it again if possible.
::Since a conversation requires distinct parties to commit to it I can't see how you took the proponent silence as a right validator to surpass the objection of an active wikibookian (the rational does not follow) one type of block is not superior to the other in fact the silent one is weaker as it requires no argumentative support.
::I also did not see reasonable stopping the archiving (and so have been doing some on the more populated pages) note that blocking the bot does not stop archiving (anyone can do it) it only stops the automatic archival (the very thing I was objecting to in some forums), so this argument is also void.
::I'm glad that there was not off-site collusion, but the timing in starting operations especially due to the proponent silence in face of my reasonable request makes the acceptance of proposal even more problematic as it demonstrates an intentional failure to compromise even on a point that only run parallel to the proposal itself (had not major impact and would have fixed the unilaterally of the past mistake neatly).
::It is obvious that there is a problem in the automatic archival of some of the forums that require as explicit human intervention on the process (like in deletion requests etc) and someone to be responsible for the action (even of dismissal). I don't think any reasonable person can fail to understand this is a important issue.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 21:07, 20 September 2014 (UTC)

::: &amp;lt;unwisely getting involved&amp;gt; Panic, clearly we have different perceptions of how that discussion was left.  My perception is that you raised some concerns, others said the concerns you were raising were not appropriate grounds for holding the bot hostage but could be addressed by a number of other routes, and the discussion lapsed.  After a more than ample period for further comments on the RFP, it was closed as successful; I agree with that assessment of the outcome of the RFP.  I haven't noticed that any of the other avenues have been taken, though I could be missing something (there's been plenty of time for me to lose track).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 22:36, 20 September 2014 (UTC)

:::: I did not raised concerns I opposed the granting of the flag. I was not holding the bot hostage I expressly requested that he conformed to my objections on operation (something that was easily done), the use of the word hostage implies that I was abusing the power to block (not so, clearly willing to compromise) and that the proponent had to lose something to get my collaboration (clearly not the case). It is clear that we have different perceptions (as we should and be more rich for it) but think about the wording you chose to use and you clearly see where we are coming from...
:::: I was simply stating to QU my displeasure with his action and explaining how he got it wrong, while it was not my intention on making the statement, I'm always open to be shown at fail in my rational (as I hope others are).
:::: I also note that those that would be more accountable (the administration) are the ones perpetuating the problem of the automatic archival of discussions that clearly require a formal process and someone to become responsible for administering them (integral part of their function on the project). This has been clearly a problem especially with the due process of proposals and requests for administrative action, that should not prescribe by time-lapse without proper conclusion and someone signing for it. The bot flag only obfuscates the problem for those that are unaware of the discussions and ultimately empowers the vocal active minority (that I include myself) to dismiss and promote only the policies that they support something that we should clearly avoid.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 22:57, 20 September 2014 (UTC)

::::: &quot;(as we should and be more rich for it)&quot; &amp;mdash; my intention exactly in describing what it looked like to me.  I likewise chose the word &quot;hostage&quot; as a precise description of the perception involved; though &quot;abusing the power to block&quot; is less in line with what I was describing; but, be that as it may, that description has likely served its purpose.  Moving on...

::::: You say you wanted something changed in the behavior of the bot.  I'd honestly lost track, likely to do to the combination of the length of time involved and the size of the discussion.  To save time:  what was it you wanted changed about the behavior of the bot (on which the rest of what you've just said is predicated)?  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 23:31, 20 September 2014 (UTC)

:::::: I guess we live in a very hectic time and people have no patience but I think it is pretty obvious even from what I said above that I oppose automatic archival of proposals and requests to administrator (at least), there have been some requests for technical help that should have remained open, even if the recent extension in time makes that forum auto-archival less critical. In fact we have been having this discussion for several years now (I've always defended the same position when it has any relevance).
:::::: You should also have memory of the reversal I made of an archival on the adm forum (I think that it was the first time I wrote anything about the, well, deleterious even pernicious nature of the practice). If you don't remember, you resumed the automation process (that I had blocked, on that discussion thread by changing the date) dismissing a valid administrative request.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 02:17, 21 September 2014 (UTC)

==Just to be sure...==

So we want to write a book (Mujje Tulye) related to Cooking in Uganda. This book will not only include recipes and ingredients, but also cultural aspects for example or growth of ingredient. Shall it stay in the Cooking area anyway ? Is there any risk that we are told that this book can NOT contain stuff related to rites and traditions because it belong to the Cookbook area and should only be about food ?

Also, from what I could see, the cookbook area only contain recipe and ingredients. As such, there are no subpages. We would like to create a book that can be assembled into a pdf afterwards for dissemination. If so, is it allowed to create all the subpages of the book just as is done with the regular books on wikibooks ? such as [[Cookbook:Mujje Tulye/Rites and traditions in Uganda]] or [[Cookbook:Mujje Tulye/Spices and pregnancy in Uganda]] (I am completely inventing here...). We would like to have it feel like a real book rather than being simply a list of recipes.

Thanks

== Cookbook edit notice ==
&quot;If you are about to copy a recipe you found on the Internet then STOP NOW. You are about to commit a copyright violation and it WILL BE DELETED and you might be BLOCKED.&quot; can you edit it as to put it correctly? &quot;The You are about&quot; should be &quot;You may be about&quot;, even if one considers that since the last revision of the law, copyright should be assumed, there are plenty of content that is on the public domain or similarly licensed to make this assertion incorrect. I also find the mention of being blocked a bit excessive (I can only see it happen to a repeating offender).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 04:55, 10 October 2014 (UTC)
:At the risk of stepping into a firestorm... [http://www.copyright.gov/fls/fl122.html US copyright office]. &quot;Copyright law does not protect recipes that are mere listings of ingredients. Nor does it protect other mere listings of ingredients such as those found in formulas, compounds, or prescriptions. Copyright protection may, however, extend to substantial literary expression—a description, explanation, or illustration, for example—that accompanies a recipe or formula or to a combination of recipes, as in a cookbook.&quot; So the cookbook itself is protected, but individual recipes may not be.

:::I am more than happy to change the wording (or for you to do it). One thing to bear in mind is that 99% of people who contribute here know nothing about copyright law so the nuances of different licenses, how to check compatibility with the WMF license, etc., are beyond them. So I would prefer to keep it simple - e.g., a direction to come to the Reading Room to ask. I created the notice after blocking several serial copyright offenders (who continued despited repeated warnings) and having to spend 4 hours solid work deleting more than 200 violations they'd created over an extended period.

{{fsharpTitle|Classes and Objects}}

In the real world, an '''object''' is a &quot;real&quot; thing. A cat, person, computer, and a roll of duct tape are all &quot;real&quot; things in the tangible sense. When we think about these things, we can broadly describe them in terms of a number of attributes:

* Properties: a person has a name, a cat has four legs, computers have a price tag, duct tape is sticky.
* Behaviors: a person reads the newspaper, cats sleep all day, computers crunch numbers, duct tape attaches things to other things.
* Types/group membership: an employee is a type of person, a cat is a pet, a Dell and Mac are types of computers, duct tape is part of the broader family of adhesives.

In the programming world, an &quot;object&quot; is, in the simplest of terms, a model of something in the real world. Object-oriented programming (OOP) exists because it allows programmers to model real-world entities and simulate their interactions in code. Just like their real-world counterparts, objects in computer programming have properties and behaviors, and can be classified according to their type. 

While we can certainly create objects that represents cats, people, and adhesives, objects can also represent less concrete things, such as a bank account or a business rule. 

Although the scope of OOP has expanded to include some advanced concepts such as design patterns and the large-scale architecture of applications, this page will keep things simple and limit the discussion of OOP to data modeling.

== Defining an Object ==
Before you create an object, you have to identify the properties of your object and describe what it does. You define properties and methods of an object in a ''class''. There are actually two different syntaxes for defining a class: an implicit syntax and an explicit syntax.

=== Implicit Class Construction ===
Implicit class syntax is defined as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fsharp&quot;&gt;
type TypeName optional-type-arguments arguments [ as ident ] =
    [ inherit type { as base } ]
    [ let-binding | let-rec bindings ] *
    [ do-statement ] *
    [ abstract-binding | member-binding | interface-implementation ] *
&lt;/source&gt;
: ''Elements in brackets are optional, elements followed by a &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; may appear zero or more times.''

This syntax above is not as daunting as it looks. Here's a simple class written in implicit style:

&lt;source lang=&quot;fsharp&quot;&gt;
type Account(number : int, holder : string) = class
    let mutable amount = 0m

    member x.Number = number
    member x.Holder = holder
    member x.Amount = amount
    
    member x.Deposit(value) = amount &lt;- amount + value
    member x.Withdraw(value) = amount &lt;- amount - value
end
&lt;/source&gt;

The code above defines a class called &lt;code&gt;Account&lt;/code&gt;, which has three properties and two methods. Let's take a closer look at the following:

 type Account(&lt;u&gt;number : int, holder : string&lt;/u&gt;) = class

The underlined code is called the class ''constructor''. A constructor is a special kind of function used to initialize the fields in an object. In this case, our constructor defines two values, &lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;holder&lt;/code&gt;, which can be accessed anywhere in our class. You create an instance of &lt;code&gt;Account&lt;/code&gt; by using the &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; keyword and passing the appropriate parameters into the constructor as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;fsharp&quot;&gt;
let bob = new Account(123456, &quot;Bob’s Saving&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

Additionally, let's look at the way a member is defined:
 member &lt;u&gt;x.&lt;/u&gt;Deposit(value) = amount &lt;- amount + value

The &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; above is an alias for the object currently in scope. Most OO languages provide an implicit &lt;code&gt;this&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt; variable to access the object in scope, but F# requires programmers to create their own alias.

After we can create an instance of our &lt;code&gt;Account&lt;/code&gt;, we can access its properties using &lt;code&gt;.propertyName&lt;/code&gt; notation. Here's an example in FSI:

&lt;source lang=&quot;fsharp&quot;&gt;
&gt; let printAccount (x : Account) =
    printfn &quot;x.Number: %i, x.Holder: %s, x.Amount: %M&quot; x.Number x.Holder x.Amount;;

val printAccount : Account -&gt; unit

&gt; let bob = new Account(123456, &quot;Bob’s Savings&quot;);;

val bob : Account

&gt; printAccount bob;;
x.Number: 123456, x.Holder: Bob’s Savings, x.Amount: 0
val it : unit = ()

&gt; bob.Deposit(100M);;
val it : unit = ()

&gt; printAccount bob;;
x.Number: 123456, x.Holder: Bob’s Savings, x.Amount: 100
val it : unit = ()

&gt; bob.Withdraw(29.95M);;
val it : unit = ()

&gt; printAccount bob;;
x.Number: 123456, x.Holder: Bob’s Savings, x.Amount: 70.05
&lt;/source&gt;

==== Example ====

Let's use this class in a real program:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fsharp&quot;&gt;
open System

type Account(number : int, holder : string) = class
    let mutable amount = 0m

    member x.Number = number
    member x.Holder = holder
    member x.Amount = amount
    
    member x.Deposit(value) = amount &lt;- amount + value
    member x.Withdraw(value) = amount &lt;- amount - value
end

let homer = new Account(12345, &quot;Homer&quot;)
let marge = new Account(67890, &quot;Marge&quot;)

let transfer amount (source : Account) (target : Account) =
    source.Withdraw amount
    target.Deposit amount
    
let printAccount (x : Account) =
    printfn &quot;x.Number: %i, x.Holder: %s, x.Amount: %M&quot; x.Number x.Holder x.Amount
    
let main() =
    let printAccounts() =
        [homer; marge] |&gt; Seq.iter printAccount
    
    printfn &quot;\nInializing account&quot;
    homer.Deposit 50M
    marge.Deposit 100M
    printAccounts()
    
    printfn &quot;\nTransferring $30 from Marge to Homer&quot;
    transfer 30M marge homer
    printAccounts()
    
    printfn &quot;\nTransferring $75 from Homer to Marge&quot;
    transfer 75M homer marge
    printAccounts()
        
main()&lt;/source&gt;

The program has the following types:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fsharp&quot;&gt;
type Account =
  class
    new : number:int * holder:string -&gt; Account
    member Deposit : value:decimal -&gt; unit
    member Withdraw : value:decimal -&gt; unit
    member Amount : decimal
    member Holder : string
    member Number : int
  end
val homer : Account
val marge : Account
val transfer : decimal -&gt; Account -&gt; Account -&gt; unit
val printAccount : Account -&gt; unit
&lt;/source&gt;

The program outputs the following:
&lt;pre&gt;
Initializing account
x.Number: 12345, x.Holder: Homer, x.Amount: 50
x.Number: 67890, x.Holder: Marge, x.Amount: 100

Transferring $30 from Marge to Homer
x.Number: 12345, x.Holder: Homer, x.Amount: 80
x.Number: 67890, x.Holder: Marge, x.Amount: 70

Transferring $75 from Homer to Marge
x.Number: 12345, x.Holder: Homer, x.Amount: 5
x.Number: 67890, x.Holder: Marge, x.Amount: 145
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Example using the &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; keyword ====
The &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; keyword is used for post-constructor initialization. For example, let's say we wanted to create an object which represents a stock. We only need to pass in the stock symbol, and initialize the rest of the properties in our constructor:

&lt;source lang=&quot;fsharp&quot;&gt;
open System
open System.Net

type Stock =
  class
    new : symbol:string -&gt; Stock
    member Current : float
    member High : float
    member Low : float
    member Open : float
    member Symbol : string
    member Volume : int
  end

This program outputs the following (your outputs will vary):
&lt;pre&gt;
Symbol: &quot;MSFT&quot; (19.130000)
Symbol: &quot;NOC&quot; (43.240000)
Symbol: &quot;YHOO&quot; (12.340000)
Symbol: &quot;GM&quot; (3.660000)
&lt;/pre&gt;

: '''Note:''' It's possible to have any number of &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; statements in a class definition, although there's no particular reason why you'd need more than one.

=== Explicit Class Definition ===
Classes written in explicit style follow this format:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fsharp&quot;&gt;
type TypeName =
    [ inherit type ]
    [ val-definitions ]
    [ new ( optional-type-arguments arguments ) [ as ident ] =
      { field-initialization }
      [ then constructor-statements ]
    ] *
    [ abstract-binding | member-binding | interface-implementation ] *
&lt;/source&gt;

Here's a class defined using the explicit syntax:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fsharp&quot;&gt;
type Line = class
    val X1 : float
    val Y1 : float
    val X2 : float
    val Y2 : float
    
    new (x1, y1, x2, y2) =
        { X1 = x1; Y1 = y1;
            X2 = x2; Y2 = y2}
            
    member x.Length =
        let sqr x = x * x
        sqrt(sqr(x.X1 - x.X2) + sqr(x.Y1 - x.Y2) )
end&lt;/source&gt;

Each &lt;code&gt;val&lt;/code&gt; defines a field in our object. Unlike other object-oriented languages, F# does not implicitly initialize fields in a class to any value. Instead, F# requires programmers to define a constructor and explicitly initialize each field in their object with a value.

We can perform some post-constructor processing using a &lt;code&gt;then&lt;/code&gt; block as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fsharp&quot;&gt;
type Line = class
    val X1 : float
    val Y1 : float
    val X2 : float
    val Y2 : float
    
    new (x1, y1, x2, y2) as this =
        { X1 = x1; Y1 = y1;
            X2 = x2; Y2 = y2;}
        then
            printfn &quot;Line constructor: {(%F, %F), (%F, %F)}, Line.Length: %F&quot;
                this.X1 this.Y1 this.X2 this.Y2 this.Length
            
    member x.Length =
        let sqr x = x * x
        sqrt(sqr(x.X1 - x.X2) + sqr(x.Y1 - x.Y2) )
end
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice that we have to add an alias after our constructor, &lt;code&gt;new (x1, y1, x2, y2) &lt;u&gt;as this&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/code&gt;), to access the fields of our object being constructed. Each time we create a &lt;code&gt;Line&lt;/code&gt; object, the constructor will print to the console. We can demonstrate this using fsi:

&lt;source lang=&quot;fsharp&quot;&gt;
&gt; let line = new Line(1.0, 1.0, 4.0, 2.5);;

val line : Line

Line constructor: {(1.000000, 1.000000), (4.000000, 2.500000)}, Line.Length: 3.354102
&lt;/source&gt;


==== Example Using Two Constructors ====
Since the constructor is defined explicitly, we have the option to provide more than one constructor.

&lt;source lang=&quot;fsharp&quot;&gt;
open System
open System.Net

type Car = class
    val used : bool
    val owner : string
    val mutable mileage : int
    
    (* first constructor *)
    new (owner) =
        { used = false;
            owner = owner;
            mileage = 0 }
    
    (* another constructor *)
    new (owner, mileage) =
        { used = true;
            owner = owner;
            mileage = mileage }
end

let main() =
    let printCar (c : Car) =
        printfn &quot;c.used: %b, c.owner: %s, c.mileage: %i&quot; c.used c.owner c.mileage
    
    let stevesNewCar = new Car(&quot;Steve&quot;)
    let bobsUsedCar = new Car(&quot;Bob&quot;, 83000)
    let printCars() =
        [stevesNewCar; bobsUsedCar] |&gt; Seq.iter printCar
    
    printfn &quot;\nCars created&quot;
    printCars()
    
    printfn &quot;\nSteve drives all over the state&quot;   
    stevesNewCar.mileage &lt;- stevesNewCar.mileage + 780
    printCars()
    
    printfn &quot;\nBob commits odometer fraud&quot;
    bobsUsedCar.mileage &lt;- 0
    printCars()
    
main()
&lt;/source&gt;

This program has the following types:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fsharp&quot;&gt;
type Car =
  class
    val used: bool
    val owner: string
    val mutable mileage: int
    new : owner:string * mileage:int -&gt; Car
    new : owner:string -&gt; Car
  end
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice that our &lt;code&gt;val&lt;/code&gt; fields are included in the public interface of our class definition.

This program outputs the following:
&lt;pre&gt;
Cars created
c.used: false, c.owner: Steve, c.mileage: 0
c.used: true, c.owner: Bob, c.mileage: 83000

Steve drives all over the state
c.used: false, c.owner: Steve, c.mileage: 780
c.used: true, c.owner: Bob, c.mileage: 83000

Bob commits odometer fraud
c.used: false, c.owner: Steve, c.mileage: 780
c.used: true, c.owner: Bob, c.mileage: 0
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Differences Between Implicit and Explicit Syntaxes ===
As you've probably guessed, the major difference between the two syntaxes is related to the constructor: the explicit syntax forces a programmer to provide explicit constructor(s), whereas the implicit syntax fuses the primary constructor with the class body. However, there are a few other subtle differences:

* The explicit syntax does not allow programmers to declare &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; bindings.
* Even though you can use &lt;code&gt;val&lt;/code&gt; fields in the implicit syntax, they must have the attribute &lt;code&gt;[&lt;DefaultValue&gt;]&lt;/code&gt; and be mutable. It is more convenient to use &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; bindings in this case. You can add public &lt;code&gt;member&lt;/code&gt; accessors when they need to be public.
* In the implicit syntax, the primary constructor parameters are visible throughout the whole class body. By using this feature, you do not need to write code that copies constructor parameters to instance members.
* While both syntaxes support multiple constructors, when you declare additional constructors with the implicit syntax, they must call the primary constructor. In the explicit syntax all constructors are declared with new() and there is no primary constructor that needs to be referenced from others.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! width=&quot;50%&quot; | Class with primary (implicit) constructor
! width=&quot;50%&quot; | Class with only explicit constructors
|-
| valign=&quot;top&quot; |
&lt;source lang=&quot;fsharp&quot;&gt;
// The class body acts as a constructor
type Car1(make : string, model : string) = class
    // x.Make and x.Model are property getters
    // (explained later in this chapter)
    // Notice how they can access the
    // constructor parameters directly
    member x.Make = make
    member x.Model = model

    // This is an extra constructor.
    // It calls the primary constructor
    new () = Car1(&quot;default make&quot;, &quot;default model&quot;)
end
&lt;/source&gt;

| valign=&quot;top&quot; |
&lt;source lang=&quot;fsharp&quot;&gt;
type Car2 = class
    // In this case, we need to declare
    // all fields and their types explicitly 
    val private make : string
    val private model : string

    // Notice how field access differs
    // from parameter access
    member x.Make = x.make
    member x.Model = x.model

    // Two constructors
    new (make : string, model : string) = {
        make = make
        model = model
    }
    new () = {
        make = &quot;default make&quot;
        model = &quot;default model&quot;
    }
end
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

In general, its up to the programmer to use the implicit or explicit syntax to define classes. However, the implicit syntax is used more often in practice as it tends to result in shorter, more readable class definitions.

=== Class Inference ===
F#'s &lt;code&gt;#light&lt;/code&gt; syntax allows programmers to omit the &lt;code&gt;class&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;end&lt;/code&gt; keywords in class definitions, a feature commonly referred to as ''class inference'' or ''[http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/cambridge/projects/fsharp/manual/spec2.aspx#_Toc207785727 type kind inference]''. For example, there is no difference between the following class definitions:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! width=&quot;50%&quot; | Class Inference
! width=&quot;50%&quot; | Class Explicit
|-
| valign=&quot;top&quot; |
&lt;source lang=&quot;fsharp&quot;&gt;
type Product(make : string, model : string) =
    member x.Make = make
    member x.Model = model
&lt;/source&gt;

| valign=&quot;top&quot; |
&lt;source lang=&quot;fsharp&quot;&gt;
type Car(make : string, model : string) = class    
    member x.Make = make
    member x.Model = model
end
&lt;/source&gt;
|}

Both classes compile down to the same bytecode, but the code using class inference allows us to omit a few unnecessary keywords.

Class inference and class explicit styles are considered acceptable. At the very least, when writing F# libraries, don't define half of your classes using class inference and the other half using class explicit style -- pick one style and use it consistently for all of your classes throughout your project.

== Class Members ==

=== Instance and Static Members ===
There are two types of members you can add to an object:
* Instance members, which can only be called from an object instance created using the &lt;code&gt;new&lt;/code&gt; keyword.
* Static members, which are not associated with any object instance.

The following class has a static method and an instance method:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fsharp&quot;&gt;
type SomeClass(prop : int) = class
    member x.Prop = prop
    static member SomeStaticMethod = &quot;This is a static method&quot;
end
&lt;/source&gt;

We invoke a static method using the form &lt;code&gt;className.methodName&lt;/code&gt;. We invoke instance methods by creating an instance of our class and calling the methods using &lt;code&gt;classInstance.methodName&lt;/code&gt;. Here is a demonstration in fsi:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fsharp&quot;&gt;
&gt; SomeClass.SomeStaticMethod;; (* invoking static method *)
val it : string = &quot;This is a static method&quot;

&gt; SomeClass.Prop;; (* doesn't make sense, we haven't created an object instance yet *)

  SomeClass.Prop;; (* doesn't make sense, we haven't created an object instance yet *)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

stdin(78,1): error FS0191: property 'Prop' is not static.

&gt; let instance = new SomeClass(5);;

val instance : SomeClass

&gt; instance.Prop;; (* now we have an instance, we can call our instance method *)
val it : int = 5

&gt; instance.SomeStaticMethod;; (* can't invoke static method from instance *)

  instance.SomeStaticMethod;; (* can't invoke static method from instance *)
  ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

stdin(81,1): error FS0191: property 'SomeStaticMethod' is static.
&lt;/source&gt;

We can, of course, invoke instance methods from objects passed ''into'' static methods, for example, let's say we add a &lt;code&gt;Copy&lt;/code&gt; method to our object defined above:

&lt;source lang=&quot;fsharp&quot;&gt;
type SomeClass(prop : int) = class
    member x.Prop = prop
    static member SomeStaticMethod = &quot;This is a static method&quot;
    static member Copy (source : SomeClass) = new SomeClass(source.Prop)
end
&lt;/source&gt;

We can experiment with this method in fsi:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fsharp&quot;&gt;
&gt; let instance = new SomeClass(10);;

val instance : SomeClass

&gt; let shallowCopy = instance;; (* copies pointer to another symbol *)

val shallowCopy : SomeClass

&gt; let deepCopy = SomeClass.Copy instance;; (* copies values into a new object *)

val deepCopy : SomeClass

&gt; open System;;

&gt; Object.ReferenceEquals(instance, shallowCopy);;
val it : bool = true

&gt; Object.ReferenceEquals(instance, deepCopy);;
val it : bool = false
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;Object.ReferenceEquals&lt;/code&gt; is a static method on the &lt;code&gt;System.Object&lt;/code&gt; class which determines whether two objects instances are the same object. As shown above, our &lt;code&gt;Copy&lt;/code&gt; method takes an instance of &lt;code&gt;SomeClass&lt;/code&gt; and accesses its &lt;code&gt;Prop&lt;/code&gt; property.

'''When should you use static methods rather than instance methods?'''

When the designers of the .NET framework were designing the &lt;code&gt;System.String&lt;/code&gt; class, they had to decide where the &lt;code&gt;Length&lt;/code&gt; method should go. They had the option of making the property an instance method (&lt;code&gt;s.Length&lt;/code&gt;) or making it static (&lt;code&gt;String.GetLength(s)&lt;/code&gt;). The .NET designers chose to make &lt;code&gt;Length&lt;/code&gt; an instance method because it is an intrinsic property of strings.

On the other hand, the &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; class also has several static methods, including &lt;code&gt;String.Concat&lt;/code&gt; which takes a list of string and concatenates them all together. Concatenating strings is instance-agnostic, its does not depend on the instance members of any ''particular'' strings.

The following general principles apply to all OO languages:

* Instance members should be used to access properties intrinsic to an object, such as &lt;code&gt;stringInstance.Length&lt;/code&gt;.
* Instance methods should be used when they depend on state of a ''particular'' object instance, such as &lt;code&gt;stringInstance.Contains&lt;/code&gt;.
* Instance methods should be used when its expected that programmers will want to override the method in a derived class.
* Static methods should not depend on a particular instance of an object, such as &lt;code&gt;Int32.TryParse&lt;/code&gt;.
* Static methods should return the same value as long as the inputs remain the same.
* Constants, which are values that don't change for any class instance, should be declared as a static members, such as &lt;code&gt;System.Boolean.TrueString&lt;/code&gt;.

=== Getters and Setters ===
Getters and setters are special functions which allow programmers to read and write to members using a convenient syntax. Getters and setters are written using this format:

&lt;source lang=&quot;fsharp&quot;&gt;
    member alias.PropertyName
        with get() = some-value
        and set(value) = some-assignment
&lt;/source&gt;

Here's a simple example using fsi:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fsharp&quot;&gt;
&gt; type IntWrapper() = class
    let mutable num = 0
    
    member x.Num
        with get() = num
        and set(value) = num &lt;- value
end;;

type IntWrapper =
  class
    new : unit -&gt; IntWrapper
    member Num : int
    member Num : int with set
  end

&gt; let wrapper = new IntWrapper();;

val wrapper : IntWrapper

&gt; wrapper.Num;;
val it : int = 0

&gt; wrapper.Num &lt;- 20;;
val it : unit = ()

&gt; wrapper.Num;;
val it : int = 20
&lt;/source&gt;

Getters and setters are used to expose private members to outside world. For example, our &lt;code&gt;Num&lt;/code&gt; property allows users to read/write to the internal &lt;code&gt;num&lt;/code&gt; variable. 
Since getters and setters are glorified functions, we can use them to sanitize input before writing the values to our internal variables. For example, we can modify our &lt;code&gt;IntWrapper&lt;/code&gt; class to constrain our to values between 0 and 10 by modifying our class as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;fsharp&quot;&gt;
type IntWrapper() = class
    let mutable num = 0
    
    member x.Num
        with get() = num
        and set(value) =
            if value &gt; 10 || value &lt; 0 then
                raise (new Exception(&quot;Values must be between 0 and 10&quot;))
            else
                num &lt;- value
end
&lt;/source&gt;

We can use this class in fsi:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fsharp&quot;&gt;
&gt; let wrapper = new IntWrapper();;

val wrapper : IntWrapper

&gt; wrapper.Num &lt;- 5;;
val it : unit = ()

&gt; wrapper.Num;;
val it : int = 5

&gt; wrapper.Num &lt;- 20;;
System.Exception: Values must be between 0 and 10
   at FSI_0072.IntWrapper.set_Num(Int32 value)
   at &lt;StartupCode$FSI_0076&gt;.$FSI_0076._main()
stopped due to error
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Adding Members to Records and Unions ===
Its just as easy to add members to records and union types as well.

'''Record example:'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;fsharp&quot;&gt;

&gt; type Line =
    { X1 : float; Y1 : float;
        X2 : float; Y2 : float }
    with    
        member x.Length =
            let sqr x = x * x
            sqrt(sqr(x.X1 - x.X2) + sqr(x.Y1 - x.Y2))
        
        member x.ShiftH amount =
            { x with X1 = x.X1 + amount; X2 = x.X2 + amount }
            
        member x.ShiftV amount =
            { x with Y1 = x.Y1 + amount; Y2 = x.Y2 + amount };;

type Line =
  {X1: float;
   Y1: float;
   X2: float;
   Y2: float;}
  with
    member ShiftH : amount:float -&gt; Line
    member ShiftV : amount:float -&gt; Line
    member Length : float
  end

&gt; let line = { X1 = 1.0; Y1 = 2.0; X2 = 5.0; Y2 = 4.5 };;

val line : Line

&gt; line.Length;;
val it : float = 4.716990566

&gt; line.ShiftH 10.0;;
val it : Line = {X1 = 11.0;
                 Y1 = 2.0;
                 X2 = 15.0;
                 Y2 = 4.5;}

&gt; line.ShiftV -5.0;;
val it : Line = {X1 = 1.0;
                 Y1 = -3.0;
                 X2 = 5.0;
                 Y2 = -0.5;}
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Union example'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;fsharp&quot;&gt;
&gt; type shape =
    | Circle of float
    | Rectangle of float * float
    | Triangle of float * float
    with
        member x.Area =
            match x with
            | Circle(r) -&gt; Math.PI * r * r
            | Rectangle(b, h) -&gt; b * h
            | Triangle(b, h) -&gt; b * h / 2.0
            
        member x.Scale value =
            match x with
            | Circle(r) -&gt; Circle(r + value)
            | Rectangle(b, h) -&gt; Rectangle(b + value, h + value)
            | Triangle(b, h) -&gt; Triangle(b + value, h + value);;

type shape =
  | Circle of float
  | Rectangle of float * float
  | Triangle of float * float
  with
    member Scale : value:float -&gt; shape
    member Area : float
  end

&gt; let mycircle = Circle(5.0);;

val mycircle : shape

&gt; mycircle.Area;;
val it : float = 78.53981634

&gt; mycircle.Scale(7.0);;
val it : shape = Circle 12.0
&lt;/source&gt;

== Generic classes ==
We can also create classes which take generic types:

&lt;source lang=&quot;fsharp&quot;&gt;
type 'a GenericWrapper(initialVal : 'a) = class
    let mutable internalVal = initialVal
    
    member x.Value
        with get() = internalVal
        and set(value) = internalVal &lt;- value
end&lt;/source&gt;

We can use this class in FSI as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fsharp&quot;&gt;
&gt; let intWrapper = new GenericWrapper&lt;_&gt;(5);;

val intWrapper : int GenericWrapper

&gt; intWrapper.Value;;
val it : int = 5

&gt; intWrapper.Value &lt;- 20;;
val it : unit = ()

&gt; intWrapper.Value;;
val it : int = 20

&gt; intWrapper.Value &lt;- 2.0;; (* throws an exception *)

  intWrapper.Value &lt;- 2.0;; (* throws an exception *)
  --------------------^^^^

stdin(156,21): error FS0001: This expression has type
	float
but is here used with type
	int.

&gt; let boolWrapper = new GenericWrapper&lt;_&gt;(true);;

val boolWrapper : bool GenericWrapper

&gt; boolWrapper.Value;;
val it : bool = true
&lt;/source&gt;

Generic classes help programmers generalize classes to operate on multiple different types. They are used in fundamentally the same way as all other generic types already seen in F#, such as Lists, Sets, Maps, and union types.

== Pattern Matching Objects ==
While it's not possible to match objects based on their ''structure'' in quite the same way that we do for lists and union types, F# allows programmers to match on ''types'' using the syntax:

&lt;source lang=&quot;fsharp&quot;&gt;
match arg with
| :? type1 -&gt; expr
| :? type2 -&gt; expr
&lt;/source&gt;

Here's an example which uses type testing:
&lt;source lang=&quot;fsharp&quot;&gt;
type Cat() = class
    member x.Meow() = printfn &quot;Meow&quot;
end

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 19:54, 26 December 2008 (UTC)

== Category question ==

Are you really sure my individual book pages should be in the main category &quot;Geology&quot;? They are already in their subject (book title) category, which is itself in &quot;Geology&quot;. Since I plan to write an awful lot, it seems to me that the main cat will get cluttered beyond usefulness if we do this. -- [[User:Pinkfud|Pinkfud]] ([[User talk:Pinkfud|talk]]) 06:36, 22 December 2008 (UTC)

:Heck, you could have saved me some work by stating the name of the book :). I think you are referring to [[A Chronological Survey of Sedimentary Landforms in the Continental United States]], my bad, I've fixed it now... 
:The idea is that all subpages should be tagged only with the book's category and subpages (you can put the templates in a subcategory of the book if you like, personally I don't think it is worth it but as it is now, in that book, they appear on the main category). Great work by the way...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 07:43, 22 December 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:De Gaulle-OWI.jpg|thumb|Charles de Gaulle]]

==Quick Facts==

* Born: 22 November 1890
* Died: 9 November 1970
* Leader of: Free French during the German occupation, then France after the liberation
* Full name: Charles André Joseph Marie de Gaulle

==General Charles de Gaulle==
Charles de Gaulle was a French general who led the Free French Forces during World War II. He fought during World War I and was a believer in the importance of the newly invented tanks and aircraft as a way of winning battles quickly. This knowledge helped him in World War II where he lead a successful tank attack against the invading Germans. But then he had to leave France for Britain because France surrendered to the Germans. 

In Britain he created the &quot;Free French&quot;, an army of Frenchmen who had escaped the Germans. He trained them ready for the day when they could return and free their country.  He returned with his army soon after D-Day and was involved in many big battles to drive the Germans out. Once France was free again in 1944 he became the Prime Minister of France. Later he was to become the French president.

==Quote==

&quot;To strive for the common prosperity and happiness of all nations as well as the security and well-being of our subjects is the solemn obligation which has been handed down by our imperial ancestors and which we lay close to the heart.&quot; -- Emperor Hirohito, accepting terms of surrender&lt;ref&gt; Federal Communications Commission, 14 August 1945 https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/hirohito.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quick Facts==

* Born: 29 April 1901
* Died: 7 January 1989
* Leader of: Japan.

==Before the war==

Hirohito became the Japanese Emperor on Christmas Day 1926. Before the war there was a lot of fighting in Japan and it seemed to many people that the soldiers in the army were ruling the country. In 1931, with Hirohito's support, Japan invaded parts of China, continuing to fight with them right through until 1945. During this fighting the Emperor allowed his soldiers to use poison gas, which had been banned since World War I.   He was engaged to Princess Nagako on February 4th 1918.

==During the war==

During World War II with Hirohito's backing, Japan formed an alliance with Germany and Italy, called the &quot;Axis Powers&quot;. The emperor also chose the tough General Hideki Tōjō as his Prime Minister to run the war. 

Towards the end of the war, the Emperor began to have meetings with his government to see if they should surrender, but nobody wanted to except a former Prime Minister, Fumimaro Konoe. He said surrender was Japan's only hope but Hirohito wanted to win a great victory first. But no &quot;great victory&quot; happened, so the Japanese decided instead to &quot;fight to the last man&quot;, as they had in Okinawa and other battles.

But on 9 August 1945, the US dropped the first of two atomic bombs on Japan and the Soviet Union declared war on them. This made the Emperor decide that he needed to surrender. The Emperor announced the surrender on the radio. It was the first time most people had ever heard his voice, and some people didn't even believe that he was the Emperor.

==After the war==
Many people wanted the Emperor to be tried for war crimes, and other people in his family tried to make him step down as Emperor. But the US General MacArthur, who had been in charge of Japan since the surrender, said that he should stay on as long as told his people that he wasn't a god.

Hirohito continued to rule Japan until his death from cancer on January 7, 1989.

Welcome to the first basic review! We now review all that we have learned in Unit One.

==Dialogue==

So, we have learned quite a lot in the past five lessons! The quantity of vocabulary and grammar points may have been overwhelming, and therefore we shall now take a step back and retrace what we have learned here. 

The following dialogue between Dan {{Hebrew|דָּן}} and Noa {{Hebrew|נוֹעָה}} sums the expressions we learned:

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:right&quot;&gt;
&lt;big&gt;
{{Hebrew|
'''דן:''' שלום! קוראים לי דן.&lt;br&gt;
'''נועה:''' ולי קוראים נועה. מה נשמע?&lt;br&gt;
'''דן:''' בסדר. מה שלומך?&lt;br&gt;
'''נועה:''' טוב, תודה. בן כמה אתה? אני בת שלושים ושבע.&lt;br&gt;
'''דן:''' אני בן שלושים וחמש, ואני גר בחֵיפָה. איפה את גרה?&lt;br&gt;
'''נועה:''' אני גרה בירושלים. אני נוסעת לניו-יורק באונייה.&lt;br&gt;
'''דן:''' טוב, להתראות.&lt;br&gt;
'''נועה:''' שלום.
}}
&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

==Vocabulary==
We have learned:
* Greetings: {{Hebrew|שלום, להתראות, היי, ביי, תודה}}, etc.
* Feminine numbers: {{Hebrew|אחת, שתיים, שלוש, עשרים ושבע, מאה}}, etc.
* The personal pronouns: {{Hebrew|אני, אתה, אנחנו, הן}}, etc.
* The interrogative pronouns: {{Hebrew|מה, למה, מי, איפה, מתי}}, etc.
* Some modes of transport: {{Hebrew|מכונית, אוטובוס, מטוס, אונייה, רכבת}}.
In addition, we learned some verbs:
* Verbs with two consonants: {{Hebrew|גר, שר, בא, חי}}, etc.
* Verbs with three consonants: {{Hebrew|כתב, הלך, אהב, פתח, ראה}}, etc.
As well as some expressions:
* Asking for name, welfare, age, residence, destination ({{Hebrew|איך קוראים לך, מה נשמע, בן כמה אתה, איפה אתה גר, לאן אתה נוסע}}, etc.).
* Stating yours ({{Hebrew|קוראים לי, אני בן, אני גר ב, אני נוסע ל}}, etc.).

==Grammar==
* We have learned that Hebrew has two genders, and that these can be identified by the following rule of thumb: if the word ends with {{Hebrew|ה}} or {{Hebrew|ת}}, it is feminine, and if anything else, it is masculine. We also learned of the existence of exceptions.
* We have learned the prefixes attached to Hebrew words: the definite article, the conjunction &quot;and&quot;, the prepositions &quot;to, from, in&quot;, and the combination of the prepositions &quot;to&quot; and &quot;in&quot; with the definite article.
* You can pluralize a noun or an adjective by adding {{Hebrew|ים}} for masculine and {{Hebrew|ות}} for feminine, though we did not elaborate. Again, there are exceptions.
* Verb conjugation in ''binyan qal'' in the present tense for verbs with 2 and 3 radicals.
* Syntax: questions. 

==Exercises==
* Translate the dialogue.
{{Question-answer
| question = .'''דן:''' שלום! קוראים לי דן
| answer = '''Dan:''' Hello! My name is Dan.
}}
{{Question-answer
| question = ?'''נועה:''' ולי קוראים נועה. מה נשמע

}}
{{Question-answer
| question = ?איפה גר דן
| answer = {{Hebrew|דן גר בחֵיפָה.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">I don't understand how 1 XOR'D with 111 = 011 (as shown in the &quot;Direct CDM&quot; example).

001 XOR 111 should be 110 - so the example is probably wrong, although the layout isn't very clear and it could mean 100 XOR 111 rather instead, which would be 011. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual? Quite''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 16:35, 26 December 2008 (UTC)

: I'm a bit embarrassed that I didn't notice this error before now. When transmitting a data &quot;1&quot; bit, every code chip is inverted - the first chip, and the last chip, and all the chips in-between, until the next data bit arrives. Does it look good now?
: I'm a bit worried that this simplified example is a bit misleading -- real DSS systems typically have dozens or hundreds of code chips per data bit. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 21:12, 29 December 2008 (UTC)

::What you are saying in the example is, I presume this:


     1     0     1     1
   X 101 X 100 X 111 X 000
   ----- ----- ----- -----
     010   100   000   111


:: XOR 1 three times (i.e., with 1, 0 and 1) - that is equivalent to XOR 7 and 5 which gives 2. Then XOR 0 three times (with 1, 0 and 0) which is equivalent to XOR 0 and 4 which gives 4 and so on. If this is right, then your example is correct. And yes, looks better! &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual? Quite''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 16:56, 30 December 2008 (UTC)

::: Yes, thank you. Another way of explaining this is that there are 2 spreading sequences that continually repeat, over and over:
  010011000111... -- sequence transmitted on &quot;1&quot; data
  101100111000... -- sequence transmitted on &quot;0&quot; data
  (practical spreading sequences are much, much longer than this)
::: and the data bit selects either one or the other code to actually be transmitted at any particular instant.
::: Please edit this book to make it easier to understand. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 19:58, 12 January 2009 (UTC)</text>

== Welcome message ==

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

== [[MagicJack]] ==
Due to your post on [[Wikibooks:Reading room/General]] I got to examine your book project. Did you read [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]] ?&lt;br&gt;
I know that you are still working on the project but due to how it is structured and the content now available, it only seems to be attempting to fit the definition of manual, but without no real information on how to operate, the hardware or software, this is worrying , at least to me and so I call your attention to the fact, mostly because of the for profit nature of the content, since the project doesn't have any instructional information except for the [[MagicJack/Support Resources/FAQ]] an in off site resources, those don't make a Wikibook.&lt;br&gt; 
I also got a bit worried by the use in [[MagicJack/Benefits and Criticism/Benefits]] of the &quot;This page attempts to comply with WikiBooks Neutral Point of View policy.&quot; box, I haven't seen any comparatives with similar services, the use of compatible hardware that could indicate a NPOV (similar services are mentioned but in an unrelated fashion), this is further aggravated by marketing phrases like &quot;an incredibly inexpensive telephone service.&quot; (it could by another qualifiers but without no valid context it is just a sales pitch, and the author's opinion).&lt;br&gt;
I don't have nothing against Wikibooks about profitable entities or their products if they really provide useful content under the GFDL...&lt;br&gt;
That said I hope you continue to add material but focus more on the instructional aspect of it.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 08:28, 30 December 2008 (UTC)

: Thanks for the time you spent visiting the book, and providing your feedback. I will try to improve the book. Just a few specific replies:
:* I didn't think anyone could confuse this book with a sales pitch. The &quot;criticism&quot; page is far from that. I could introduce you to some MJ fanatics who would assert that page is trying to &quot;destroy&quot; the company. (smile).
:* Regarding an instruction manual, MJ is kind of unique. The instruction manual is just &quot;plug it in, make a call, talk as long as you want.&quot; The brevity of information provided to customers is why customers spend so much time trying to help each other, and why I thought a &quot;book&quot; would be a good place to aggregate this kind of &quot;user guide&quot; information.
:** On a related note: The references to content stored elsewhere was just my way to bootstrap the book's structure quickly and announce it to other MJ users so they could begin participating. I do plan to pull that content into actual pages within the book.
:* The emphasis on NPOV is due to the fact that there are very strong, polarized opinions among MJ users. There are many who can't tolerate even the smallest criticism of the company or service. And others who believe it's the work of the devil. MJ is unique compared to other services because it really is a &quot;disruptive technology.&quot; It's &quot;game changing&quot; in the VOIP industry. Because of that, there are users who are infatuated with it, and believe any criticism is harmful to this world-changing product. And, others who think it's all a scam, and it can't possibly remain in business due to various factors. It's not mild dissension like you find among Microsoft Word users.
:** I really struggled with the Benefits/Criticisms area. I was worried that the moment I announced the book an edit war would break out. That's why I made NPOV so pronounced '''just for that pros/cons subsection'''. Not to imply that the entire book claims exceptional devotion to NPOV. Only that sub-topic, which is known to touch nerves with both sides.
:** Think about it as two levels of NPOV. One level would be to strive for NPOV among competing services (even if it's just mentioning they exist, which is a good suggestion you made.). The second level is NPOV among users of this one service. The latter is what I focused on. It may sound strange. But, MJ is unique this way. There are advocates who, at the mention of any criticism begin &quot;bearing their testimony&quot; like it's a religion to them.
:** I even struggled with the naming. I initially called it &quot;Praises and Criticism&quot; because I thought it might get too far into cheerleading, not an objective examination of benefits. But, I was worried the partisans would complain that &quot;Praises&quot; is pejorative, unlike the clinical sound of &quot;Criticisms.&quot; Then I considered calling it &quot;Praises and Gripes.&quot; 
:** Maybe I should have gone that way. I thought &quot;Gripes&quot; devalued the legitimacy of the criticism so it would be clear(er) that it is a sub-area for two polarized &quot;camps&quot; to express their views. It's a difficult topic because I want to help prevent it from degenerating into everyone voicing their passionate opinion (love it, hate it). I want to keep it generalized of the opinions that exist.
:** Maybe it should be called &quot;Common points found in user reviews.&quot; Then it would be clear that it's not supposed to be for every person to voice their own review. But, an objective summation of what commonly appears in reviews. And, it wouldn't be confused with what should be a fair representation of its features (compared to other services).
:** You might say this sub-topic doesn't belong in a book. But, it really is part of the MJ experience/culture. There are very strong opinions about how people save a ton of money with such a simple device. And, strong opinions of disappointment. It's really not an unrelated topic. And, it's related to how readers would compare it to other services. I.e., the criticisms would be of interest to users of other services.
:=== Closing ===
: I have announced the book to the larger user community. I'm hoping more will get involved. I hope you'll give it a chance to see what it becomes. I understand your concerns about it being just an advertisement. Or, a table of contents for off-site resources. Or, a user-group site (not really a book.). I want to to do the right thing as a &quot;book.&quot; But, a book geared toward users of the subject of the book. So, it's a fine line I'll try to be aware of. The &quot;game-changing&quot; nature of the subject of the book, along with the passions of its users make it more challenging than most topics.
:Thanks. --[[User:Az2008|Az2008]] ([[User talk:Az2008|talk]]) 17:04, 30 December 2008 (UTC)

::Ok, thanks for the explanations. As for any extremists users, they would find it hard to participate on Wikibooks so even if you have to consider that they exist and they can have a negative impact on your time and patience (as to deal with such situations) they shouldn't be the audience you ought to be catering to, if you keep the middle ground you will aggravate each side equally...
::As for the page name, I would have solved you conundrum by naming it pros and cons, this seems to be easy to understand and not subject to any assumptions.
::On the subject of the book, as it is, it will, sooner or later be a target of a VFD (vote for deletion) on the grounds I pointed out to you, if you wish you can move the two above posts to the book talk page so any other Wikibookian can see that you will be addressing the problems and they can consider the time factors involved, so they give your project time to evolve. But without changes the mercantilistic aspect of the work will probably seal it's future on Wikibooks.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:02, 30 December 2008 (UTC)
::: Thanks. We'll see what we can do. I've started looking at inexpensive Mediawiki hosting options. Maybe that will be the best route. (I just had someone named &quot;swift&quot; delete a link from one of the pages with no explanation. I'm not getting a warm feeling at the moment.). --[[User:Az2008|Az2008]] ([[User talk:Az2008|talk]]) 01:12, 31 December 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">A &quot;chemical&quot; weapon is one that contains something that when released will hurt people. This could be poison gas, acid or liquids that burn the skin. A &quot;bacteriological&quot; or &quot;biological&quot; weapon is a germ that makes people ill.

==History of chemical and biological weapons before World War II==

These weapons have been used for a long time. As long ago as 1500 BC (that's 3,500 years ago!), people who had a terrible disease called Plague were forced into enemy towns and villages so that they would give the disease to the enemy soldiers. 2000 years ago people used arrows dipped in snake venom.

In World War I, Germany tried to spread anthrax, a nasty illness that kills animals as well as people.  They also spread glanders, which kills cows and pigs. Then they tried to bring a fungus that kills wheat into the United States. All these attacks were meant to weaken the allies.

Gas weapons were used a lot in World War I. Tear gas was used, which makes your eyes water badly so it is hard to see. If you could blind your enemy, he couldn't see to shoot. Then the Germans started using chlorine gas. This is the same chemical used to clean swimming pool water and in bleach. It attacked the lungs, making it hard to breathe, and could kill. The British decided to fight back and started to use chlorine as well. The gas wasn't used very often because it was hard to make sure only the enemy was hurt. If the wind was blowing the wrong way, or your own soldiers moved forward quickly, they could end up in the gas cloud.

Later in the war the Germans began to use phosgene, another deadly gas. Finally they used mustard gas, the most terrible of all the gases. It burnt the skin and made it hard to breathe. It killed but took four or five weeks to do so, during which time the soldier was in a lot of pain. It also stuck to the ground meaning it could poison people for weeks.

By the end of the war, chemical weapons weren't working against well trained and equipped soldiers. One quarter of shells contained gas but they only three in every hundred men were killed by gas (the rest by normal shells).

==Use in World War II==
[[File:Hitlerwarn.jpg|thumb|right|British poster reminding people to carry their gas masks]]
After World War I, many countries got together and agreed not to use these weapons again. But, as both sides in World War I had used them, everybody thought they would be used again. So every soldier had to carry a gas mask in case of a gas attack. People not fighting had to carry a mask too - every child at school carried one in a box. Gas masks were supplied for animals too, like dogs and horses. The Germans even made covers for prams!

[[File:Kindergasmasken.jpg|thumb|left|German child gas mask and cover for a pram]]
Both the Axis and Allied powers continued to develop and store chemical and biological weapons, but in the end only the Japanese used them against soldiers. The Germans used Zyklon B in their &quot;concentration camps&quot; to kill prisoners.

The Japanese bombed China with plague as well as releasing insects carrying the disease and handing out infected food for Chinese people to eat. We think nearly 400,000 people died from the disease. They also tried to put another nasty illness, typhus, into rivers, but this didn't work so well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Map of USA AR.svg|200px|thumb|right|Location of Arkansas]]
Arkansas is a state located in the southern region of the United States. Arkansas shares a border with six states. Arkansas shares its southern border with Louisiana, its northern border with Missouri, its eastern border with Tennessee and Mississippi, and its western border with Texas and Oklahoma.
[[File:Flag of Arkansas.svg|thumb|200px|right|Flag of Arkansas]]
==History==
Arkansas was inhabited thousands of years by the Native American people before European settlers arrived.  Henri de Toni settled it in the name of King Louis the XIV of France in 1686 and called it the Arkansas Post.

Napoleon Bonaparte sold Arkansas to The United States in 1803 as part of the Louisiana Purchase.  Arkansas became a territory of The United States in 1819 and shortly after this the capitol of Arkansas was moved to Little Rock.  Arkansas gain fulled statehood in in 1836.  It was the 25th state to enter the Union.

==Geography==
Arkansas is a land of the mountains and valleys, thick forests and fertile plains. The so-called Lowlands are better known by names of their two regions, the Delta and the Grand Prairie. The Arkansas Delta is a flat landscape of rich soils formed by repeated flooding of the Mississippi River. Further away from the river, in the southeast portion of the state, the Grand Prairie consists of a more rolling plains landscape. Both are fertile agricultural areas.    

The Highlands of Arkansas are called the Ozark mountains and the Ouachita Mountains.  In the Ozarks and the Ouachita Mountains there are dense forests and rivers.  The Ozark Mountains are found in the North Central part of Arkansas and the Ouachita Mountains are found in the western part of the state.  The Ouachita Mountains were part of the Appalachian mountains of the East coast a long time ago.

==People==
As of 2012, Arkansas has an estimated population of 2,949,132.  In the 2008 American Community Survey, 93.8% of Arkansas' population over the age of five years spoke only English at home.  

Arkansas is mostly Protestant, with Baptist being the most followed denomination.  There are Catholic, Buddhist, and Pagans in Arkansas as well.  

Arkansas is home to the world's largest retailer Walmart.  Arkansas is also the United States largest producer of rice, broiler chickens, and turkeys.  Arkansas is fourth in The United States in softwood lumber production.  

Arkansas also depends on tourism for it's economy.  It is called The Natural State and has 52 state parks.  Arkansas has the only diamond producing site that is open to the public at Crater of Diamonds State Park in Murfreesboro, Arkansas.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Map of USA CA.svg|200px|thumb|right|Location of California]]
Arizona to the southeast, and to the south the Mexican state of Baja California. California is the most populous U.S. state. Its four largest cities are Los Angeles, San Diego, San Jose, and San Francisco. It is known for its varied climate and geography as well as its diverse population.
[[File:Flag of California.svg|200px|thumb|right|The Flag of California]]

==History==
The area known as Alta California was colonized by the Spanish Empire beginning in the late 18th century. It and the rest of Mexico became an independent republic in 1821. In 1846 California broke away from Mexico, and after the Mexican-American War, Mexico gave California to the United States. California became the 31st state admitted to the United States on September 9, 1850.


==Geography==
California borders the Pacific Ocean, Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, and the Mexican state of Baja California. With an area of 160,000 square miles (414,000 km2) it is the third largest state in the United States in size, after Alaska and Texas.

In the middle of the state lies the California Central Valley, bounded by the coastal mountain ranges in the west, the Sierra Nevada to the east, the Cascade Range in the north and the Tehachapi Mountains in the south. The Central Valley is California's agricultural heartland and grows approximately one-third of the nation's food.

California is famous for earthquakes due to a number of fault lines present in the state, in particular the San Andreas Fault. It is vulnerable to tsunamis, floods, droughts, Santa Ana winds, wildfires, and landslides on steep terrain, and has several inactive volcanoes.

This guide was written as a basic guide on ripping a DVD into a single computer video file via the free program MeGUI. The aim of this guide is to be a complete walkthrough of the basic concepts for ripping a DVD, and is aimed at everyone from the complete newbie to intermediate users.

There is an [http://wiki.darkforge.eu/wiki/index.php?title=MeGUI_-_Guida_base Italian (Italiano)] version of this guide.

'''It covers:'''
*[[/Setup|Setting up the required programs]],
*[[/Ripping|Ripping the DVD]], which involves:
**Ripping the data off the DVD Disc
**Demuxing the audio streams and creating a d2v index.
*[[/Audio|Encoding the audio]],
*[[/Video|Encoding the video]], which involves:
**Creating an avs script,
**Calculating the required bitrate,
**Encoding the video.
*[[/Muxing|Muxing together the two streams with chapters to produce the final file]].

'''It does not cover:'''
*'''Using any of the automated features of MeGUI for video encoding.''' This guide is intended to show people how to use MeGUI the 'manual' way.
*Using alternate DVD rippers. DVD Decrypter cannot rip all DVDs, if it fails on ripping your disc or you wish to use a different ripper, then feel free. A few recommended rippers are  [http://www.dvdidle.com/free.htm DVD Fab Decrypter] or [http://www.ripit4me.org RipIt4Me]. It should be reasonably straight forward to work out the instructions yourself.
*Multiple audio or video tracks.
*Subtitles.
*5.1 audio (if you want to do this, I would recommend muxing the original ac3 file and not doing any encoding).

      <text xml:space="preserve">A computer movie file is a computer file that contains audio and video. Movie files are made up of several components, and these components are largely ''modular'', which means they can be easily swapped for other compatible pieces while leaving the other parts of the file intact. This page explains the different types of components and gives common examples of them.

'''Important Note:''' This page (and subpages) contains subjective quality comparisons. The final word in any quality comparison is your eyes (or ears), so take all comparisons with a grain of salt.
__TOC__
==The Container==
The container is the part of the file that holds everything together. You put your video (as in, the actual pictures), your audio and anything else you want ''inside'' the container, sort of like how you can store multiple files in a zip archive.

Containers are used for a few reasons:
*Allows media players to make better sense of the other components
*Allows additional features to be added to the file, such as:
**Indexing of streams
**Metadata (information about the streams inside)
**Error recovery capabilities
**Chapters and other forms of meta-navigation
**Streaming

The [[MeGUI/Computer movie files/Container|Container]] subpage has more information on the various types of container.

==The Video Stream==
The video stream contains the data about the actual pictures that are shown (&quot;video file&quot; refers to both both audio and video, but &quot;video stream&quot; refers to the picture component of a &quot;video file&quot;). Basically it consists of instructions on how to display a sequence of still pictures.

Read about the multitude of video formats on the [[/Video|video]] subpage.

Many video formats have limitations about what can be displayed. Most video codes perform optimally when frame sizes are [[/Video/mod16|Mod16]].

==The Audio Stream(s)==
The audio stream (or streams) contains the data for the audio component of the video file. Audio formats are similar to video formats in terms of the whole standard vs. encoder, so read the section on standards vs encoders in that section for information about how it works.

The [[/Audio|audio]] subpage has extra information on some of the various audio formats around.

==The Subtitles==
In this case, 'the subtitles' refers to softsubs. Subtitles which are overlaid onto the video during playback, as opposed to hardsubs which are encoded directly into the video. Softsubs have quite a few advantages (only the main ones are outlined here):
*You can have multiple subtitle streams (i.e. different languages, different styles, etc ''ad nauseum'')
*You can turn subtitles on and off (e.g. if your language is available as an audio stream)
*The video is untouched, allowing slightly higher quality compression.

Read more on different subtitle formats on the [[/Subtitles|subtitle]] subpage.

==Additional Information==
Some of the more advanced containers can store extra stuff, such as chapter files, embedded fonts and the like. Read on to learn about some of these.

===Attachments===
Matroska, being the cool little container it is, lets you include any sort of random file you want as an attachment. Want to include a text file with information about the release? A zip file of the soundtrack? DVD cover? Sure! You can attach any sort of file. With Haali's splitter installed (the de facto Matroska splitter for DirectShow) you can view files attached like this in the explorer properties window for the relevant file and extract them from there.
:'''Embedded Fonts'''
:Only available in Matroska files. When muxing in SSA/ASS subtitles, sometimes you want to use whacky fonts the target computer is not guaranteed to have. If you add fonts in as an attachment to a Matroska file, VSFilter (the de facto subtitle renderer for DirectShow) will be able to make use of these fonts when playing back the subtitles.

===Chapters===
Pretty self explanatory. Different formats use different chapter styles: Here's an example of Matroska's:
 &lt;Chapters&gt;
  &lt;EditionEntry&gt;
    &lt;EditionUID&gt;1&lt;/EditionUID&gt;
    &lt;EditionFlagHidden&gt;1&lt;/EditionFlagHidden&gt;
    &lt;EditionFlagDefault&gt;0&lt;/EditionFlagDefault&gt;
    &lt;ChapterAtom&gt;
      &lt;ChapterUID&gt;1&lt;/ChapterUID&gt;
      &lt;ChapterFlagHidden&gt;0&lt;/ChapterFlagHidden&gt;
      &lt;ChapterFlagEnabled&gt;1&lt;/ChapterFlagEnabled&gt;
      &lt;ChapterDisplay&gt;
        &lt;ChapterString&gt;Part A&lt;/ChapterString&gt;
        &lt;ChapterLanguage&gt;eng&lt;/ChapterLanguage&gt;
      &lt;/ChapterDisplay&gt;
      &lt;ChapterTimeStart&gt;00:00:00.000000000&lt;/ChapterTimeStart&gt;
    &lt;/ChapterAtom&gt;
    &lt;ChapterAtom&gt;
      &lt;ChapterUID&gt;2&lt;/ChapterUID&gt;
      &lt;ChapterFlagHidden&gt;0&lt;/ChapterFlagHidden&gt;
      &lt;ChapterFlagEnabled&gt;1&lt;/ChapterFlagEnabled&gt;
      &lt;ChapterDisplay&gt;
        &lt;ChapterString&gt;Part B&lt;/ChapterString&gt;
        &lt;ChapterLanguage&gt;eng&lt;/ChapterLanguage&gt;
      &lt;/ChapterDisplay&gt;
      &lt;ChapterTimeStart&gt;00:09:48.000000000&lt;/ChapterTimeStart&gt;
    &lt;/ChapterAtom&gt;
  &lt;/EditionEntry&gt;
Complex hey? Here's an example of OGG format chapters:
 CHAPTER01=00:00:00.000
 CHAPTER01NAME=Chapter 1
Much nicer. Of course, you can do a lot more with Matroska chapters, far too much more to go into detail here, apart from a brief explanation of ordered chapters.

:'''Ordered Chapters'''
:These are pretty much chapters that also refer to other matroska files for portions of the playback. For example, say you are encoding a TV series. You can cut the opening and ending out of every episode and encode them into two independant files. Then you can use ordered chapters in the main episode files to have them automatically and transperantly loaded back in again. Nifty.

===Anamorphic Flags===
The ability to store in certain containers (MKV and MP4) a value that will reflect the Aspect Ratio of the file on playback, in other words, to have [[/Glossary#Anamorphic|anamorphic]] playback. Say you have a 16:9 movie that's encoded in 4:3 aspect ratio. Well, when you mux into MKV you can specify the playback ratio as 16/9 and your media player will automatically resize to the correct ratio on playback.

      <comment>Timothy Gu moved page [[MeGUI/FFDShow reference]] to [[Ffdshow/Reference]]: The reference does not belong in MeGUI, but instead ffdshow.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">ffdshow is a DirectShow filter, designed to both encode and decode video using both the DirectShow, and video for windows (VfW) interfaces. It was originally created and maintained by someone called Milan, but he disappeared in early 2006. After that time, ffdshow tryouts was born to carry the ffdshow torch and they have been working since to improve ffdshow.

ffdshow consists of three main components.
*'''Video decoder:''' This could be considered the 'meat' of ffdshow. It is the DirectShow component that can decode many different video formats to raw video. In addition, it can optionally transform the video in a number of ways (sharpening, resizing, etc.).
*'''Audio decoder:''' The counterpart to the previous component, this is a DirectShow decoder for audio, that also includes a sizeable number of transform filters (channel mixer, equaliser, etc.).
*'''VfW Codec:''' The ffdshow VfW component is both a video encoder and decoder which duplicates the functionality of the DirectShow decoder, except it works with the VfW interface. The VfW interface is an older system that is often used for video processing programs (VirtualDub, Adobe Premiere, etc.). As well as providing VfW decoding, it is also a VfW encoder for a large variety of formats.

==Video Decoder==
===Codecs Page===
[[Image:ffdshow video codecs.gif|400px|right]]
The codecs page lets you control what formats ffdshow will decode. The decoder column will let you choose the decoder for each format listed, you can choose 'disabled' to prevent ffdshow from decoding it. Make sure to read the remarks, not all decoders are fully implemented.

'''Tips &amp; Tricks'''
* If you right click anywhere on the list, you can enable all stable decoders in one click. This does not enable raw video processing.
* The last item, for raw video is useful if you want ffdshow to process the decoded video from another stream. One side effect of enabling this is that ffdshow will insert itself into more or less every stream. You can enable decoding only for one colorspace, or for all.
* Some items show additional checkboxes just underneath the list when you select them. These boxes will change the behavior of the decoder in certain ways:
:*''h264'': If you check 'skip deblocking when safe', the decoder will not always apply the inloop deblocking filter to the displayed frame, which will reduce CPU usage. If you check 'skip deblocking always', the decoder will never apply the inloop deblocker. Be aware the inloop deblocker is a normal part of h264 decoding, and disabling it (especially on low quality streams) will produce a suboptimal picture.
:*''MPEG1/2'': Both MPEG1 and MPEG2 include a setting 'use speedup tricks'. This setting will reduce the CPU usage for decoding, but produce a lower quality image. With MPEG2 decoding, you can also enable DVD decoding, which will allow ffdshow to decode DVD video. Consider it experimental, but stable.
:*''Raw Video'': Running Vista? If you want to use ffdshow as a passthrough for raw video in WMP11 you must check the 'Enable in Vista WMP11' checkbox.

===Info &amp; Debug===
[[Image:ffdshow video info.gif|400px|right]]
This page lets you set a small number of miscellaneous options, and also gives statistics about the current stream being handled, if it exists.

'''Settings:'''
* You can change the filter merit for the decoder on this page. The filter merit is more or less the priority of ffdshow, compared to other filters. If multiple filters can decode a file, the one with highest merit will be used.
* If you check the 'Don't use ffdshow in' box, you can specify a list of executables that ffdshow will refuse to be run from. This affects only video decoder. Audio deocoder has to be configured separately. Vfw codecs doesn't have this feature.
'''Tips &amp; Tricks'''
* The statistics will only show up if you are viewing the config panel ''for an instance of ffdshow that is currently handling video''. Because multiple copies of ffdshow can be running at the same time, you can't just open ffdshow from anywhere and get information on the particular stream you want. If you are using ffdshow in a media player, you will have to open the config panel from the media player in question for it to show you the stream statistics. In media players, this is often available in rclick on video -&gt; filters. When a stream is playing and you have enabled the tray icon (on by default), you can double click that icon ([[Image:Ffdshow icon.gif]]) as well.
* The 'average bitrate' info is calculated from when you open the ffdshow window. Don't be surprised if you see unexpectedly high bitrates if you open the window in the middle of an action scene.

===Resize &amp; aspect===

[[Image:ffdshow video resize.gif|Resize &amp; Aspect dialog|400px|right]]

This section is based on ffdshow-tryouts rev 1103 or later. Earlier versions (or original ffdshow) will have some subtle and not so subtle differences.&lt;br&gt;
The dialog is made up of three sections that work in tandem:
*Resize, which defines the base output resolution,
*Aspect Ratio, which constrains the output resolution to satisfy aspect ratio limitations, and
*Conditional Activation, which enables or disables resizing based on the original resolution.

'''Resize'''
:[[Image:radiobox.gif]]'''Specify horizontal and vertical size'''
::* &quot;No aspect ratio correction&quot; selected: Stretched or shrinked to the specified size.
::* &quot;Keep original aspect ratio&quot; selected: Stretched or shrinked untill either width or height touch the specified size ''using the original aspect ratio''. Black borders are added, if necessary.
::* Manually configured: Stretched or shrinked untill either width or height touch the specified size ''using the specified aspect ratio''. Black borders are added, if necessary.

:[[Image:radiobox.gif]]'''Specify horizontal size'''
::''Height is calculated automatically to keep original aspect ratio.''
::* &quot;No aspect ratio correction&quot; and &quot;Keep original aspect ratio&quot; give the same result.
::* Manually configured: You can specify aspect ratio manually.

:[[Image:radiobox.gif]]'''Specify aspect ratio'''
::''Height is calculated based on width. (Let's call it a ''box'' here.)''
::* No aspect ratio correction : Stretched to fill the box.
::* Keep original aspect ratio : Stretched or shrinked untill either width or height touch the box ''using the original aspect ratio''. Black borders are added, if necessary.
::* Manual : Stretched or shrinked untill either width or height touch the box ''using the specified aspect ratio''. Black borders are added, if necessary.

:[[Image:radiobox.gif]]'''Expand to next multiply of'''
::* Both width and height are expanded to the next multiple of the specified value. For example, if you specify 100, 320x160 becomes 400x200. You may want to use this mode when ffdshow connects to a filter which does not work with width or height of non-multiple of 16.
::* &quot;Keep original aspect ratio&quot; and &quot;Manual&quot; work in this mode too.

:[[Image:radiobox.gif]]'''Multiply by'''
::* Both horizontal and vertical sizes are stretched using the specified magnification ratio.

:[[Image:checkbox.gif]]'''Process pixel aspect ratio internally'''
::* If checked (by default), resize to the size taking into account pixel aspect ratio (SAR), and fix output SAR 1:1.
::* If unchecked, output SAR equals input SAR and the video renderer (or any downstream filter) handles it.

'''Aspect'''
:[[Image:radiobox.gif]]'''No aspect ratio correction'''
::*The output aspect ratio (DAR) will not be affected by the original DAR.
:[[Image:radiobox.gif]]'''Keep original aspect ratio'''
::*The output DAR will be the same as the input DAR.
:[[Image:radiobox.gif]]'''Manual'''
::*Manually specify the output DAR.
:*'''Overlay aspect ratio:''' If your computer's overlay does not have a 1:1 SAR (ie, your display has non square pixels), you can use this slider to correct it.

'''Conditional Activation'''
:[[Image:radiobox.gif]]'''Resize if...'''
::*Only resize if the input resolution matches the conditions specified. By clicking the ''&lt;'' or ''&gt;'' signs, and the ''and'' or ''or'' sign, you can specify conditions that the resize filter will fire on. If the conditions are not met, the resize filter will not activate.
:[[Image:radiobox.gif]]'''Resize if number of pixels is...'''
::*You can specify a condition for the resize filter to fire on based on the number of pixels in each input frame. You can click on the ''greater than'' or ''less than'' sign to swap the condition type. You can determine the number of pixels in a frame by multiplying width by height.

'''Example'''
Following situation: You have a projector with 1280x720 resolution and you want to play a DVD whose pixel aspect ratio (aka SAR) changes during playback. To get the optimal resizing system:
* Specify horizontal and vertical size&quot;-&gt;1280x720.
* Select &quot;Keep original aspect ratio&quot;.
* Make sure &quot;Process pixel aspect ratio internally&quot; is checked.
You will find the video will always be resized to the largest possible resolution possible, while keping the aspect ratio correct.

===Avisynth===
There is a page written on this filter available at the [http://ffdshow-tryout.sourceforge.net/html/en/avisynth.htm official ffdshow-tryouts site].

===Output===
[[Image:ffdshow video output.gif|400px|right]]
The output page gives you control over the output formats used by ffdshow. The top half gives you control over the allowed output colourspaces, while the lower half is used for miscellaneous output settings.

'''Colourspaces'''

This page allows you to set the default output colourspace and format used by ffdshow. There are two general colourspaces that can be used, and a number of formats within each colourspace.
*'''YUV Colourspace'''
:The default output colourspace. Read more about YUV on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/YUV this] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chroma_subsampling this] wikipedia article. As the YUV colourspace (and YV12 in particular) is the colourspace of choice for video compression, setting ffdshow to output YV12 saves it from having to do any colourspace conversion on the decoded image, speeding up decoding.
:There are a number of different YUV output formats supported by ffdshow.
:*''I420/IYUV'': Similar to YV12 described below, but less hardware support. Not recommended, even if it's supported by your video card, as YV12 is faster. Uses 12 bits per pixel (bpp).
:*''YV12'': Almost always the fastest output mode (video codecs usually use YV12 for storage). The recommended output for most system setups, although some older/onboard video cards do not support it - if this is the case for you, try YUY2. Windows media player sometimes has trouble with YV12 output. Uses 12bpp.
::'''&lt;big&gt;NVidia 8800 Owners take note!&lt;/big&gt; YV12 output appears to be broken in many instances and with most driver versions currently available (2007). If you run into any sort of image corruption issues, try falling back to YUY2.'''
:*''YUY2'': Used by MJPEG and some MPEG2 video streams, and has slightly more colour definition than YV12. Slightly slower to output than YV12, but generally not by much. If your input video is YUY2, or your video card doesn't support YV12, this is the recommended output. Uses 16bpp.
:*''YVYU &amp; UYVY'': Rare and unused, avoid. Uses 12bpp.
:*''NV12'': Another rare output format, not even supported by many cards. Uses 12bpp.

*'''RGB Colourspace'''
These modes uses the more traditional and familiar colour format of RGB. Read about RGB on [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RGB wikipedia] (again). RGB output is slower, but possibly more accurate than YUV output - the difference will be minimal in any case.
:RGB formats supported.
:*''RGB32 &amp; RGB24'': These modes will give you the same picture output, the only difference is that RGB32 is packed to 32bits which is usually faster to manipulate. These modes use 32 or 24bpp respectively.
:*''RGB16 &amp; RGB15'': Same as bove, but only 16/15bit. RGB15 is a bad idea unless you know it's a good idea. These use 16 or 15bpp respectively.
:*''High Quality YV12 to RGB Conversion'': Because &lt;small&gt;(almost)&lt;/small&gt; all video files are compressed in a YUV format (usually YV12), ffdshow must convert from the YUV colour system to the RGB colour system when outputting RGB modes. This checkbox will instruct it to use a slower, but higher quality conversion method. If you are planning on taking screenshots, or really ''really'' need every last drop of faithful quality reproduction, enable this.

[[Image:checkbox.gif]]''' Select closest matching colorspace '''
:*Checked: The closest colorspace to that of the input stream will be selected automatically.
:*Unchecked: The colorspaces will be tried in the order that is listed in the dialog.

[[Image:checkbox semi.gif]]''' Set pixel aspect ratio in output media type / Use overlay mixer '''
:*Unchecked: Use classic connection method.
:*Checked: Use an advanced connection method that includes pixel aspect ratio (SAR) and interlacing information when connecting with the next filter (usually a video renderer).
:*Indeterminate/grayed: Try advanced connection method first and fall back to classic connection method if it fails. This is the default and should not be touched unless you have some special purpose.

[[Image:checkbox empty.gif]]''' Set interlace flag in output media type / HW deinterlacing '''
:*Send interlacing related information obtained from the input stream or ffdshow's internal decoders to the next filter.
:*Some filters (like video renderers) will use this information to deinterlace the video if neccessary.
:*This is just for informing the downstream filters - the actual result will depend purely on the implementation of these filters.
:*Unchecked by default. DVDs are flagged interlaced, but in most cases they are originaly film (progressive) and just telecined. For such video, it is recomended to keep it unchecked.

'''Tips &amp; Tricks'''

*You can select more than one output format, ffdshow will try to use the closest output format to the input. Generally this means YV12, but not always.
*The other settings on the page shouldn't be touched unless you know what they are. The author recommends using the settings in the image to the right (although with YV12 enabled). Flip video is occasionally useful for broken or old streams.

==Audio Decoder==
The audio decoder shares many similarities with the video decoder. Because of this, some pages will not be covered here, and you can instead simply refer to the video decoder's information. These pages include:
*'''Codecs''': The only change are the formats supported, and there are three items with checkboxes:
:*''AC3'': The checkbox enables Dynamic Range Compression, which is part of the normal AC3 decoder. It is not recommended that you disable this, unless you have good reason to do so.
:*''DTS'': The checkbox for Dynamic Range Compression is the same as above. The second checkbox, 'Check for DTS in WAV', is used to tell ffdshow to check .wav files and see if they actually have DTS audio inside them. You can get these files off Super Audio CDs and DVD Audio discs.
:*''Vorbis'': Enabling VorbisGain will tell ffdshow to read the suggested gain setting that can be written into vorbis bitstreams, and apply it if present. Use depends on user preference, you can consider it a form of 'volume levelling'.
*'''Info &amp; Debug''': Identical beyond the different information given for the currently playing stream.
===Mixer===
[[Image:Ffdshow audio mixer.gif|right|400px]]
This page controls the Mixer filter, which can change the number of channels in the audio stream being processed. Its main use is to mix all audio streams so they have the same number of streams as your audio setup has. Increasing the number of channels is known as upmixing, and reducing is known as downmixing.

There are two ways to define the number of output channels: by use of the configuration presets, or by manually specifying the matrix. Note that ffdshow can output a maximum of 6 channels (i.e. 5.1).
'''Configuration Presets'''
The most common and recommended presets are shown at full size, other presets are shown in a smaller font. Note the channel definitions used (2/0, 3/2, etc.) refer to ''front speakers / back speakers''.
:*&lt;small&gt;'''1/0 - mono'''&lt;/small&gt;
:*'''2/0 - stereo:''' If you have two speakers connected to your computer, this is the preset you want.
:*&lt;small&gt;'''3/0 - 3 front'''&lt;/small&gt;
:*&lt;small&gt;'''2/1 - surround'''&lt;/small&gt;
:*&lt;small&gt;'''3/1 - surround'''&lt;/small&gt;
:*&lt;small&gt;'''2/2 - quadro'''&lt;/small&gt;
:*'''3/2 - 5 channels:''' If you have 5 speakers attached to your computer, you almost certainly want this setup.
:*&lt;small&gt;'''Dolby Surround/ProLogic:'''You might want to use this preset or the next if you are sending the audio output to a amplifier that only supports stereo input, but handles ProLogic/ ProLogic II&lt;/small&gt;
:*&lt;small&gt;'''Dolby ProLogic II'''&lt;/small&gt;
:*'''Same as input:'''No mixing.
:*'''Headphone virtual spatialization:''' Can make &gt;2 channel audio sound better through headphones, can make it worse; usually makes 2 channel audio sound worse.
:*&lt;small&gt;'''Head related transfer function'''&lt;/small&gt;

===Output===
[[Image:Ffdshow audio output.gif|400px|right]]
This page is identical in design to the video decoder's page, but the actual content is different.

'''Settings'''
*'''Supported Output Sample Formats''': The checkboxes here set the allowed output formats that the video decoder will use.
:*''16/24/32/32float'': These are normal PCM output, with different levels of bitdepth. The 'normal' rate for almost all audio streams encountered is 16bit (used in CDs, DVDs, most HDVDs/BDs), but using larger bitdepths can be advantageous in some settings. If you are using any audio filters it can help to increase bitdepth to produce more accurate 'rounding'. There are two '''important caveats''' when increasing the bitdepth here:
::*Converting between different audio bitdepths is a lossy conversion, and it will not increase the audio quality above the original. There is no point in outputting a 16bit CD as 32bit, you won't find there to be any better sound.
::*Many sound cards do not correctly support bitdepths other than 16bit. In particular, many creative cards will resample 24/32/32float output back to 16bit before sending it out to the speakers, which means you will end up just running your audio through multiple destructive processes for no gain.
:*''AC3'': This mode will encode the audio to AC3 and then output it along SPDIF (if the audio is already AC3, it will not be re-encoded). If you want to play your audio through speakers attached to a SPDIF compatible amp, consider using this option. Use the highest bitrate your link can support for maximum quality.
:*''LPCM'': As the helptext says: ''&quot;LPCM output is intended for connecting to DVD audio decoder filters like one from Cyberlink.&quot;'' 'nuff said.
*'''Connect to''' is useful when you want to try and force the audio output to be sent to a particular location. Generally, directsound is the default, and preferred output, but you may want to use another in some cases.

=x264 Settings=
==Frame-type options==
===keyint===
'''Integer: 250'''

Sets the maximum interval between IDR-frames (aka ''keyframes'') in x264's output. Normally, x264 will only make a frame an IDR frame if it passes the threshold set by scenecut. This setting lets you place an upper bound on length of time before an IDR frame appears. IDR frames are 'delimiters' in the stream - no frame can reference data from the other side of the IDR. These mean they can be used as points to randomly seek in the movie &lt;small&gt;(you can't just start playback from anywhere, the frame will reference previous frames, and they will reference previous frames, and etc)&lt;/small&gt;. Note that while an IDR frame is necessarily an I frame, not all I frames are IDR frames. Most of the time x264 will make the first frame of a new camera scene an IDR frame, so much of the time this setting will not come into play. Higher settings can theoretically improve compression (reducing the number of forced IDR frames which would otherwise be smaller P or B frames), as well as reducing the appearance of fluctuating quality if the average quantizers are high (since I frames share no similarity in terms of artifacts with their neighbours the artifacts are more noticeable). Lower settings can reduce the time needed to seek to a certain frame.

'''Recommendation:''' Default, or 10x whatever your framerate is. On HD encodes which will be CPU challenging you may want to use smaller values (say 2x - 5x fps).

'''See also: '''[[#min-keyint|min-keyint]], [[#scenecut|scenecut]]
===min-keyint===
'''Integer: 25'''

Sets the minimum length between IDR frames. See [[#keyint|keyint]] for an explanation of IDR frames. Very small IDR ranges can reduce 'incorrect' frame placement (for example, a strobing scene). This option limits the minimum length after each IDR frame before another can be placed.

'''Recommendation:''' Default, or whatever your framerate is.

'''See also: '''[[#keyint|keyint]], [[#scenecut|scenecut]]

===scenecut===
'''Integer: 40'''

Sets the threshold for IDR frame placement (read: scene change detection). x264 calculates a metric for every frame to estimate how different it is from the previous frame. If the value is lower than scenecut, an IDR frame is used. The metric is slightly more complex then, but it's a reasonable approximation. Higher values of scenecut increase the number of scenecuts detected. For more information on how the scenecut comparison works, see [http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=121116 this doom9 thread].

'''See also: '''[[#keyint|keyint]], [[#min-keyint|min-keyint]], [[#pre-scenecut|pre-scenecut]]
===pre-scenecut===
'''Default: disabled when --threads 1, else enabled'''

Enables a faster scenecut mechanism. It's enabled by default when you use more than one thread, since regular (not pre) scenecut doesn't work with threads. Normal IDR frame encoding works by encoding the frame normally, then if the frame passes the scenecut test, re-encoding it as an IDR frame. Pre-scenecut detects before encoding if the frame should be an IDR frame and acts accordingly. Pre-scenecut is theoretically not as good as normal scenecut, although the cost of this is usually low. See [http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?p=955877#2 this doom9 thread] for more information about the quality loss from bad IDR frame placement.

'''Recommendation:''' Default

'''See also: '''[[#keyint|keyint]], [[#min-keyint|min-keyint]], [[#scenecut|scenecut]], [[#threads|threads]]
===bframes===
'''Integer: 0'''

Sets the maximum number of concurrent B-frames that x264 can use. B-frames are similar to P-frames, except they can use motion prediction from future frames as well. This can lead to significantly better efficiency in terms of compression ratio. Their average quality is controlled by [[#pbratio|pbratio]]. For more information about the choices x264 makes between P or B frames for each candidate frame, see [http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.video.ffmpeg.devel/29064 this ffmpeg-devel mail].  In this case, frame types will look like this (in display order) (assuming ''--bframes 3''): IBBBPBBBPBPI.

Bonus info: x264 also occasionally distinguishes between two different sorts of B-frames. A 'B' can refer to a B-frame that is used as a reference by other frames, while 'b' can  refer to a B-frame that is not. If you see a mix of 'B' and 'b', it's usually related to the above. When the difference is not important, just 'B' is generally used to refer to all B-frames.

'''Recommendation:''' Unless you use ''--b-adapt 2'' choose ''--bframes 16'', the maximum. This is the fastest and most flexible option for the encoder. If you use ''--b-adapt 2'' much lower ''--bframes'' is reasonable, like 2-5. Higher values will significantly slow the encoding without major benefit. For an idea of how many B-frames are used in your encode, read the &quot;consecutive B-frames&quot; line in x264's stats output after an encode.

Sometimes you'll have to settle for less: Blu-Ray limits the maximum number of B-frames.

&lt;small&gt;B-frames also may increase decoder CPU usage, but the reduced bitrate (and thus reduced time spent on CABAC) may counteract that. Any effect would be minor.&lt;/small&gt;

'''See also: '''[[#no-b-adapt|no-b-adapt]], [[#b-bias|b-bias]], [[#b-pyramid|b-pyramid]], [[#ref|ref]], [[#pbratio|pbratio]], [[#partitions|partitions]], [[#weightb|weightb]], [[#b-rdo|b-rdo]], [[#bime|bime]]

===no-b-adapt===
Note: this option is for backward compatibility, use [[#b-adapt|b-adapt]] 0 instead.

'''Default: Not Set'''

Disables adaptive B-frame placement. Normally, when encoding a length of frames, x264 will encode some as B and some as P frames, in a mix which is most efficient. This may mean no B frames are used for a number of frames. Setting this option removes the adaptive decision making and forces x264 to use as many B frames as it can.

Example: you run an encode with 3 max B-frames, and with b-adapt enabled (ie the default). You see this (in display order): &lt;small&gt;I&lt;/small&gt;BB&lt;small&gt;PP&lt;/small&gt;BBB&lt;small&gt;P&lt;/small&gt;BB&lt;small&gt;P&lt;/small&gt;B&lt;small&gt;P&lt;/small&gt;B&lt;small&gt;PI&lt;/small&gt;. If you run it again with no-b-adapt you'll see this: &lt;small&gt;I&lt;/small&gt;BBB&lt;small&gt;P&lt;/small&gt;BBB&lt;small&gt;P&lt;/small&gt;BBB&lt;small&gt;P&lt;/small&gt;BB&lt;small&gt;PI&lt;/small&gt;. Note that the sequence is simply interrupted for the final group of three at the end of the GOP.
There's no real advantage to this setting, the disadvantage is that you reduce the efficiency of x264. You'll end up with non-optimal frame type decisions.  Note that if you want to force a specific number of B-frames in threaded mode, scenecut must also be disabled, by setting it to -1: this is because pre-scenecut does not work with no-b-adapt.

'''Recommendation:''' Default, see above.

'''See also: '''[[#b-frames|b-frames]]

===b-adapt===
Note: For a multi-pass encode, this option is only needed for the first pass where frame types are decided.

0 - disable

1 - old algorithm, faster, speed slightly increases with higher [[#b-frames|b-frames]] setting.

2 - new algorithm, slower, speed significantly decreases with higher [[#b-frames|b-frames]] setting.

===b-bias===
'''Integer: 0'''

Controls the likelihood of B-frames being used instead of P-frames. Values great than 0 increase the weighting towards B-frames, while values less than 0 do the opposite. This number is no a percentage, or absolute increase, just an arbitrary metric number. The range is from -100 to 100. Note that a value of 100 does not guarantee every P-frame will be converted (use [[#no-b-adapt|no-b-adapt]] for that).

Only use this if you think you make better ratecontrol decisions than x264.

'''Recommendation:''' 0

'''See also: '''[[#b-frames|b-frames]], See also: [[#ipratio|ipratio]]

===b-pyramid===
'''Default: Not set'''

Allow the use of B-frames as references for other frames. Without this setting, frames can only reference I or P-frames. Although I/P-frames are more valued as references because of their higher quality, B-frames can also be useful. B-frames designated as references will get a quantizer halfway between P-frames and normal B-frames.

'''Recommendation:''' Enabled, if you have at least two B-frames. Slows encoding slightly. Note: in older x264 revisions this increased DPB size, but this is now constant based on [[#ref|ref]].

'''See also: '''[[#b-frames|b-frames]], [[#refs|refs]], [[#mixed-refs|mixed-refs]]

===no-cabac===
'''Default: Not set'''

Disables CABAC &lt;small&gt;('''C'''ontext '''A'''daptive '''B'''inary '''A'''rithmetic '''C'''oder)&lt;/small&gt; stream compression and falls back to the less efficient CAVLC &lt;small&gt;('''C'''ontext '''A'''daptive '''V'''ariable '''L'''ength '''C'''oder)&lt;/small&gt; system. Significantly reduces both the compression efficiency and the decoding requirements.

Many handheld devices don't have the processing power to play back CABAC content, so you need to encode CAVLC for them. Stuff produced by Apple Computers also tends to lack the ability to decode CABAC properly.  The benefit of CABAC is about 10-20% compression over CAVLC.

'''Recommendation:''' Default, always, unless your player just doesn't support it.

===ref===
'''Default: 1'''

Controls the size of the DPB ('''D'''ecoded '''P'''icture '''B'''uffer). The range is from 0..16. In short, this value is the number of previous frames each P-frame can use as references. B-frames can use one or two fewer, depending on if they are used as references or not. The minimum number of refs that can be referenced is 1.

Note, this setting used to control the number of refs used. See [http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=132924&amp;page=5#84 this doom9 post] outlining the difference.

Also note that the [http://www.itu.int/rec/dologin_pub.asp?lang=e&amp;id=T-REC-H.264-200711-I!!PDF-E&amp;type=items ITU-T specification] limits DPB and thus limit the ref for each level. If adhering to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264/MPEG-4_AVC#Levels Level 4.1] specs, the maximum ref for full height 720p and 1080p video are 9 and 4 respectively. But if the video's height is not the full 720 or 1080 pixels, a higher ref can be used. Level 4.1 is the level implemented on Blu-ray and HD DVD, and the highest level supported in most consumer electronics which support H.264 playback, including Xbox 360, Playstation 3 and Popcorn Hour A-100 Media Extender.
The formula for calculating maximum ref is as follows, the value should be rounded down:

maximum ref = 12288 * 1024 / ( width * height * 1.5)

'''Recommendation:''' Around 4-6. Each increase has a reduced benefit and constant speed loss. Very large numbers of refs are normally not very useful, but even up to 16 can be helpful for animated content, video game capture, CGI, and other similar content.

'''See also: '''[[#b-pyramid|b-pyramid]], [[#mixed-refs|mixed-refs]], [[#level|level]]

===no-deblock===
Completely disables in-loop deblocking.

'''See Also:''' [[#deblock|deblock]]
===deblock===
'''Default: 0:0'''

Controls the loop filter (aka inloop deblocker) which is part of the h264 standard. The loop filter takes a rather large slice of decoding time for a single item, and is responsible for a similar slice of the overall quality output. It is very efficient in terms of encoding time vs. quality gained.

You can find a good description of how the loop filter parameters work in [http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=109747 this doom9 thread] (see the initial post and akupenguin's replies).

'''Recommendation:''' Default. Lower values can be used if you feel x264 is blurring too much, although this only helps if you have enough spare bitrate. Sane values are probably within the range -3 to 3. Note that at higher bitrates (and thus lower quantizers), deblocking is inherently weaker, so you do not need to &quot;compensate&quot; for higher bitrate with lower deblocking settings or vice versa.

'''See Also:''' [[#no-deblock|no-deblock]]

===interlaced===
'''Default: Not Set'''

Enable interlaced encoding.  x264's interlaced encoding is inherently less efficient than its progressive encoding, so it is probably better to deinterlace an interlaced source before encoding rather than use interlaced mode.

==Ratecontrol==
===qp===
'''Default: Not Set'''

The first of three possible ratecontrol methods. Set x264 to encode the movie in '''C'''onstant '''Q'''uantizer mode. The number you give here specifies the P frame quantizer. The quantizer used for I and B-frames is derived from [[#ipratio|ipratio]] and [[#pbratio|pbratio]]. CQ mode targets a certain quantizer, which means final filesize is not known (although it can be reasonably accurately estimated with some methods). A setting of 0 will produce lossless output. qp produces larger files than [[#crf|crf]] for the same visual quality.  qp mode also disables adaptive quantization, since by definition &quot;constant quantizer&quot; implies no adaptive quantization.

This option is mutually exclusive with [[#bitrate|bitrate]] and [[#crf|crf]]. See [http://akuvian.org/src/x264/ratecontrol.txt this writeup] for more information on the various ratecontrol systems.

'''Recommendation:''' Use [[#crf|crf]] instead

See also: [[#bitrate|bitrate]], [[#crf|crf]], [[#ipratio|ipratio]], [[#pbratio|pbratio]]

===bitrate===
'''Default: Not Set'''

The second of three ratecontrol methods. Encode the video in target bitrate mode. x264 will attempt to encode the video to target the given bitrate as the final average. The parameter given is the bitrate in kilobits/sec. &lt;small&gt;(8bits = 1byte and so on)&lt;/small&gt;. This setting is usually used in conjunction with [[#pass|pass]] for two pass encoding. Target bitrate mode means the final filesize is known, but the final quality is not (although it's possible to estimate with a reasonable degree of accuracy).  It is generally not recommended to use bitrate mode without 2pass encoding.

This options is mutually exclusive with cq and crf. See [http://akuvian.org/src/x264/ratecontrol.txt this writeup] for more information on the various ratecontrol systems.

'''Recommendation:''' Something which gives P frame quantizers around 18-26. Estimated ranges: for SD resolution: 800kbits - 2100kbits. For 720p, 3-6mbit. For 1080p, 8-15mbit+.

'''See also:''' [[#qp|qp]], [[#crf|crf]], [[#ratetol|ratetol]], [[#pass|pass]], [[#stats|stats]]

===crf===
'''Default: Not Set'''

The final ratecontrol method: '''C'''onstant '''R'''ate'''f'''actor. While qp targets a certain quantizer, and bitrate targets a certain filesize, crf targets a certain 'quality'. The idea is for crf n to give the same perceptual quality as qp n, just in a smaller space. It is not extremely exact, but reasonably close (and will average out to be accurate over a large number of videos).

CRF achieves this by reducing the quality of less important frames. In this case, frames in complex or high-motion scenes, where quality is more expensive (in terms of bits) and/or less visible, will have their quantizer increased. The bits saved in cuts like this are redistributed to frames where they will be more effective.  CRF mode gives almost exactly equivalent quality to 2pass at the same bitrate; the difference is that you cannot choose the output bitrate.

This options is mutually exclusive with cq and bitrate. See [http://akuvian.org/src/x264/ratecontrol.txt this writeup] for more information on the various ratecontrol systems.

'''Recommendation:''' The range 18-26 is probably where you will want to look at. If you need absolutely perfect quality you could go down to 16, but it's probably not worth it. Around 19-21.5 is where a rip will look very good. Higher res encoding can generally get away with higher crf values.

See also: [[#qp|qp]], [[#bitrate|bitrate]]

===vbv-maxrate===
'''Default: 0'''

Sets the maximum bitrate in VBV mode.  You should only use VBV if you have a hardware decoder that requires it.  It is highly recommended, though not required, to use 2pass bitrate mode with VBV.

See also: [[#vbv-bufsize|vbv-bufsize]], [[#vbv-init|vbv-init]]

===vbv-bufsize===
'''Default: 0'''

Sets the maximum size of the VBV buffer. You should only use VBV if you have a hardware decoder that requires it.  The buffer chosen is generally specific to the target device.

See also: [[#vbv-maxsize|vbv-maxsize]], [[#vbv-init|vbv-init]]
===vbv-init===
'''Default: 0'''

Sets the initial size of the VBV filled buffer size. Shouldn't be adjusted.

See also: [[#vbv-maxsize|vbv-maxsize]], [[#vbv-bufsize|vbv-bufsize]]
===qpmin===
'''Default: 10'''

Defines the minimum quantizer that x264 will ever use. The lower the quantizer, the closer the output is to the input. At some point, the output of x264 will look the same as the input, even though it is not exactly the same. Usually there is no reason to allow x264 to spend more bits than this on any particular frame / area. For most videos, anything below q16 will be ''perceptually lossless'' in this way, and anything below the conservative default of q10 will certainly be.

You can use this setting to prevent creating needlessly oversized files. Take note if you set this aggressively (ie to 16 or such), and your bitrate based encode is not coming out as large as it should be, this is possibly the reason why. You should analyse x264's stats output at the end of encoding and see if all frames are being at the minimum quantizer.

With adaptive quantization enabled (on by default), raising qpmin beyond its default is strongly discouraged because this could reduce the quality of flat background areas of the frame.

See also: [[#qpmax|qpmax]], [[#ipratio|ipratio]].

===qpmax===
'''Default: 51'''

The opposite of qpmin above. Defines the maximum quantizer that x264 can use. The default of 51 is the highest quantizer available for use in the h264 spec, and is extremely low quality. This default effectively disables qpmax. You may want to set this lower (values in the 30-40 range are generally as low as you'd go) if you want to cap the minimum quality x264 can output, but adjusting it is generally not recommended.

See also: [[#qpmin|qpmin]], [[#pbratio|pbratio]].

===qpstep===
'''Default: 4'''

Sets the maximum change in quantizer between two frames. If a frame is encoded at q20, the next frame's quantizer will be capped if it is lower than 16 or greater than 24.

The purpose behind this setting is to reduce the possibility of any large quality jumps in the output video. The reasoning is that it's better to slow this change over a few frames than do it in one. Remember that most videos at standard quality will range ''at most'' between quantizers 16 - 30, this setting can only distort the bitrate allocation for three frames max. The default value is a good one.
===ratetol===
'''Default: 1.0'''

Only applicable to 1pass bitrate encodes. Sets the percentage that x264 can miss the target average bitrate by. 1.0 = 1%. This means the final average bitrate (and corresponding filesize) will be within about ±1% of what you set. 

You can set this to 'inf' to disable this overflow detection completely. You can set this to 0 to tell x264 it must exactly hit the target bitrate, but it might not always be possible and will often kill quality of the final few % of the video.

&lt;small&gt;Many movies (any action movie for instance) are most complex at the climatic finale. As a 1pass encode doesn't know this, the number of bits required for the end is usually underestimated. A ratetol of inf can mitigate this by allowing the encode to function more like a [[#crf|crf]] encode, but the filesize will blow out.&lt;/small&gt;

===ipratio===
'''Default: 1.40'''
Sets the target average increase in bitrate for I-frames as compared to P-frames. Seen as 'keyframe  boost' in xvid. Higher values increase the quality of I frames. This makes them better references, which can improve the overall image quality. The problem is that the extra bits taken by the I-frames are taken from the P and B-frames, which makes this variable a balancing act.

See also: [[#pbratio|pbratio]]
===pbratio===
'''Default: 1.30'''

Sets the targest average reduction in bitrate for B-frames as compared to P-frames. This variable works more or less the same as ipratio above.

See also: [[#ipratio|ipratio]]

===chroma-qp-offset===
'''Default: 0'''

Normally, x264 encodes all three colour planes (luma, U (chroma), V (chroma)) at the same quantizer. This value will be added to the quantizers for the U and V planes. This allows you to bias x264 in favour of brightness (luma) by setting positive values (chroma fields will have higher quantizers), or in favour of colour (chroma). Remember than x264 encodes video as YV12, which means chroma takes up only half the space luma does anyway.

Note: x264 only encodes the luma and chroma planes at the same quantizer up to quantizer 29. After this, chroma is progressively quantized by a lower amount than luma until you end with luma at q51 and chroma at q39. This behavior is not adjustable, as it is required by the H.264 standard.
===aq-mode===
Adaptive Quantization Mode

'''Default: 2'''

Without AQ, x264 tends to underallocate bits to lower details sections. AQ is used to better distribute the available bits between all macroblocks in the video. This setting changes what scope AQ re-arranges bits in:
* 0: Do not use AQ at all.
* 1: Allow AQ to redistribute bits within each frame.
* 2: Allow AQ to redistribute bits across the whole video.

'''Recommendation:''' Default

'''See also:''' [[#aq-strength|aq-strength]]

===aq-strength===
Adaptive Quantization Strength

'''Default:''' 1.0

Sets the strength of AQ bias towards low detail ('flat') macroblocks. Negative values are not allowed. Values more than a couple of hundred percent off from 1.0 are probably a bad idea.

'''Recommendation:''' Default

'''See also:''' {{a|aq-mode}}

===pass===
'''Default: Not Set'''

This is an important setting for 2pass encoding. It controls what x264 will do with the [[#stats|stats]] file. It has three settings:
*'''1''': Create a new statsfile. Use this on the first pass.
*'''2''': Read the statsfile. Use this on the final pass.
*'''3''': Read the statsfile, and update it as well.

The statsfile contains information about every input frame, which can be input to x264 in order to improve the output. The idea is you run a first pass to generate the statsfile, and the second pass will create an optimised encode of the video. The improvement is mostly gained from better ratecontrol.

See also: [[#stats|stats]], [[#bitrate|bitrate]].

===stats===
'''Default: &quot;x264_2pass.log&quot;'''

Set the location that x264 will read/write the [[#pass|pass]] statsfile from.

===rceq===
'''Default: &quot;blurCplx^(1-qComp)&quot;'''

Set the ratecontrol equation that x264 will use. Don't change this.

See also: [[#qcomp|qcomp]], [[#cplxblur|cplxblur]], [[#qblur|qblur]]

===qcomp===
'''Default: 0.60'''

Quantizer curve compression factor. 0.0 =&gt; Constant Bitrate, 1.0 =&gt; Constant Quantizer.  Note that adaptive quantization partially replaces the effect of qcomp and x264 will internally raise qcomp to compensate based on the adaptive quantization strength.

[[#rceq|rceq]], [[#cplxblur|cplxblur]], [[#qblur|qblur]]
===cplxblur===
'''Default: 20'''

Apply a gaussian blur with the given radius to the quantizer curve. This means that the quantizer assigned to each frame is blurred temporally with its neighbours to limit quantizer fluctuations.

See also: [[#rceq|rceq]], [[#qcomp|qcomp]], [[#qblur|qblur]]

===qblur===
'''Default: 0.5'''

Apply a gaussian blur with the given radius to the quantizer curve, after curve compression. Not a very important setting.

See also: [[#rceq|rceq]], [[#qcomp|qcomp]], [[#cplxblur|cplxblur]]

===zones===

===qpfile===
Manual override to standard ratecontrol. Specify a file that gives the quantizer and frametype for every frame. The format is &quot;framenum frametype quantizer&quot;. For example:
 0 I 18 &lt; IDR (key) I-frame
 1 P 20 &lt; P-frame
 2 B 22 &lt; Referenced B-frame
 3 i 21 &lt; Non-IDR (non-key) I-frame
 4 b 18 &lt; Non-referenced B-frame

==Analysis==
===partitions===
'''Default: &quot;p8x8,b8x8,i8x8,i4x4&quot;'''

h264 video is split up into 16x16 macroblocks during compression. These blocks can be further split up into smaller partitions, which is what this options controls. 

With this option, you enable individual partitions. Partitions are enabled per-frametype (ie I, P, B). The available partitions are:
p8x8, p4x4, b8x8, i8x8, i4x4
*'''I''': i8x8, i4x4
*'''P''': p8x8 (also enables p16x8/p8x16), p4x4 (also enables p8x4/p4x8)
*'''B''': b8x8 (also enables b16x8/b8x16)
You can also set &quot;none&quot; or &quot;all&quot;.

p4x4 is generally not very useful and has an extremely high ratio of speed cost to resulting quality gain.

See also: [[#8x8dct|8x8dct]]
===direct===
'''Default: &quot;spatial&quot;'''

Set prediction mode for 'direct' motion vectors. There are two modes available: ''&quot;spatial&quot;'' and ''&quot;temporal&quot;''. You can also select ''&quot;none&quot;'' to disable direct MVs, and ''&quot;auto&quot;'' to allow x264 to swap between as it sees fit. If you set auto, x264 outputs information on the usage at the end of the encode. &quot;auto&quot; works best in a 2pass encode, but will work in single pass encodes too.  In first-pass auto mode, x264 keeps a running average of how well each method has so far performed, and picks the next prediction mode from that.  Note that you should only enable auto on the second pass if it was enabled on the first pass; if it wasn't, the second pass will default to temporal.  Direct none wastes bits and is strongly discouraged.

'''Recommendation: &quot;auto&quot;'''

===direct-8x8===
'''Default: -1'''

Set the size of the direct prediction mode.  Enabling direct-8x8 inference (on by default at most levels) may slightly improve quality when used with 8x8dct.
===weightb===
'''Default: Not Set'''

Allows non-symmetric weighting between references in B-frames. h264 allows you to 'weight' references in B-frames, which allows you to change how much each reference affects the predicted picture.  Generally recommended for film footage and probably not useful for animated footage.
===me===
'''Default: &quot;hex&quot;'''

Set the full-pixel motion estimation method. There are four choices:
*'''dia''' (diamond) is the simplest search, consisting of starting at the best predictor, checking the motion vectors at one pixel upwards, left, down, and to the right, picking the best, and repeating the process until it no longer finds any better motion vector.
*'''hex''' (hexagon) consists of a similar strategy, except it uses a range-2 search of 6 surrounding points, thus the name. It is considerably more efficient than dia and hardly any slower, and therefore makes a good choice for general-use encoding.
*'''umh''' (uneven multi-hex) is considerably slower than hex, but searches a complex multi-hexagon pattern in order to avoid missing harder-to-find motion vectors. Unlike hex and dia, the merange parameter directly controls umh's search radius, allowing one to increase or decrease the size of the wide search.
*'''esa''' (exhaustive) is a highly optimized intelligent search of the entire motion search space within merange of the best predictor. It is mathematically equivalent to the bruteforce method of searching every single motion vector in that area, though faster. However, it is still considerably slower than UMH, with not too much benefit, so is not particularly useful for everyday encoding.
*'''tesa''' (transformed exhaustive) is an algorithm which attempts to approximate the effect of running a Hadamard transform comparison at each motion vector; like exhaustive, but a little bit better and a little bit slower.

See also: [[#merange|merange]]

===fpel-cmp===
===merange===
'''Default: 16'''

merange controls the max range of the motion search. For hex and dia, this is clamped to between 4 and 16, with a default of 16. For umh and esa, it can be increased beyond the default 16 to allow for a wider-range motion search, which is useful on HD footage and for high-motion footage. Note that for umh, esa, and tesa, increasing merange will significantly slow down encoding.

See also: [[#me|me]]
===mvrange===
'''Default: 511.75'''

Set the maximum range of any one motion vector. The default value is the maximum specified by the h264 standard. It is not level or profile dependant, so don't touch it.
===mvrange-thread===
===subme===
'''Default: 6'''

Set the subpixel estimation complexity. Higher numbers are better. Levels 1-5 simply control the subpixel refinement strength. Level 6 enables RDO for mode decision, and level 8 enables RDO for motion vectors and intra prediction modes. RDO levels are significantly slower than the previous levels.

# QPel SAD 1 iteration
# QPel SATD 2 iterations
# HPel on MB then QPel
# Always QPel
# Multi QPel + [[#bime|bime]]
# RD on I/P frames
# RD on all frames
# RD refinement on I/P frames
# RD refinement on all frames

===psy-rd===
'''Default: 1.0:0.0'''

First number is the strength of Psy-RDO to use (requires subme&gt;=6 to activate). The second number is the strength of Psy-Trellis (requires trellis&gt;=1 to activate). Note that Trellis is still considered 'experimental', and almost certainly is a Bad Thing for at least cartoons.

===mixed-refs===
'''Default: Not Set'''

Allow references to be selected on a per-8x8 partition, rather than per-macroblock basis. This improves quality when using multiple reference frames albeit at some speed cost.

See also: [[#ref|ref]]
===no-chroma-me===
'''Default: Not Set'''

Normally, motion estimation works off both the luma and chroma planes. This disables chroma motion estimation for a small speed boost.

'''Recommendation:''' Default

===8x8dct===
'''Default: Not Set'''

Adaptive 8x8 DCT enables the intelligent adaptive use of 8x8 transforms in I-frames.

'''Recommendation:''' Enabled

===trellis===
'''Default: Not Set'''

Performs Trellis quantisation to increase efficiency. On Macroblock provides a good compromise between speed and efficiency. On all decisions reduces speed further. 

'''Recommendation:''' 1 (On Macro Block)

'''Note:''' Requires [[#no-cabac|CABAC]]

===no-fast-pskip===
'''Default: Not Set'''

Disables early skip detection on P-frames. Fast skip detection increases speed but may cause slight blockiness in areas of solid colour or slight gradients such as dark scenes or sky.

'''Recommendation:''' Enabled

===no-dct-decimate===
'''Default: Not Set'''

Disables coefficient thresholding on P frames.

'''Recommendation:''' Default

===nr===
'''Default: Not Set'''

Performs fast noise reduction. Estimates film noise based on this value and attempts to remove it by dropping small details before quantization. This may not match the quality of a good external noise reduction filter, but it performs very fast.

'''Recommendation:''' Default or (100 to 1000 for denoising)

===deadzone-inter/intra===
'''Default: Not Set'''

Set the size of the inter / intra luma quantization deadzone. Deadzones should be in the range of 0 to 32. The deadzone value sets the level of fine detail that x264 will arbitrarily drop without attempting to preserve. Very fine detail is both hard to see and expensive to encode, dropping this detail without attempting to preserve it stops wasting bits on such a low-return section of the video.

'''Recommendation:''' Default

===cqm===
'''Default: Flat (Not Set)'''

Sets custom quantization matricies from the built in presets of flat or jvt.

'''Recommendation:''' Default

'''See also:''' [[#cqmfile|cqmfile]]

===cqmfile===
'''Default: Not Set'''

Sets custom quantization matricies from a specified JM compatible file. Overrides any other --cqm* options.

'''Recommendation:''' Default

'''See also:''' [[#cqm|cqm]]

===cqm4* / cqm8*===
'''Default: Not Set'''

* --cqm4: Set all 4x4 quant matrices. Takes a comma-separated list of 16 integers.
* --cqm8: Set all 8x8 quant matrices. Takes a comma-separated list of 64 integers.
* --cqm4i, --cqm4p, --cqm8i, --cqm8p: Set both luma and chroma quant matrices
* --cqm4iy, --cqm4ic, --cqm4py, --cqm4pc: Set individual quant matrices. Same switches exist for cqm8.

'''Recommendation:''' Default

==Input/Output==
===output===
'''Default: Not Set'''

Specifies output file name.

'''Recommendation:''' Use a custom output file name such as &quot;Compressed Video.mp4&quot;

===sar===
'''Default: Not Set'''

Specifies the Sample Aspect Ratio in for form of width:height. This is useful for encoding anamorphic video.

'''Recommendation:''' Default

===fps===
'''Default: Not Set'''

Specifies video framerate. In most instances the frame rate will be detected from the input video stream.

'''Recommendation:''' Default

===seek===
'''Default: Not Set'''

Specified the first frame to encode, allowing the encode to begin at any point in the source.

'''Recommendation:''' Default

===frames===
'''Default: Not Set'''

Specifies the maximum number of frames to encode, allowing the encode to finish at any point before the end of the source.

'''Recommendation:''' Default

===level===
'''Default: autodetect'''

Sets the level flag in the output bitstream (as defined by [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264#Levels Annex A] of the H.264 standard). Permissible levels include 1, 1b, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 2, 2.1, 2.2, 3, 3.1, 3.2, 4, 4.1, 4.2, 5, 5.1. If you do not put ''--level'' on the commandline, x264 will attempt to autodetect the level. This detection is not perfect, and may underestimate the level if you are not using VBV controls to limit the max bitrate.

If playback is intended on any consumer level product besides a HTPC, Level 4.1 is the maximum usually supported (Xbox 360, Playstation 3, Popcorn Hour A-100 Media Extender to name a few). The GPU-based DXVA decoders on PCs have a maximum level of 4.1 too. Blu-ray and HD DVD are Level 4.1.

Note that x264 treats this setting as an '''output flag only'''. It does not take any measures to ensure compliance with the level you specify.

'''Recommendation:''' 4.1

'''See also: '''[[#ref|ref]]

===verbose===
'''Default: Not Set'''

Displays statistics for each encoded frame.

'''Recommendation:''' Default

===progress===
'''Default: Not Set'''

Displays a progress indicator while encoding.

'''Recommendation:''' Default

===quiet===
'''Default: Not Set'''

Enables Quiet Mode, silencing status messages from x264.

'''Recommendation:''' Default

===no-psnr===
'''Default: Not Set'''

Disable the PSNR computation. Prevents PSNR calculations that are reported on completion. Provides a small increase in speed.

'''Recommendation:''' Enabled

===no-ssim===
'''Default: Not Set'''

Disable the SSIM computation. Prevents SSIM calculations that are reported on completion. Provides a small increase in speed.

'''Recommendation:''' Enabled

===threads===
'''Default: 1.5 * logical CPUs detected'''

Enables parallel encoding by using more than 1 thread to increase speed on multi-core systems. Previously, this threading was based on a slice encoding model, where the video was encoded in ''n'' slices (where n == threads). Since r607 this model was changed to sliceless threading, where the 'atomic unit' is now macroblock rows. The rest of this section refers to the latter system only.

The quality loss from multiple threads is mostly negligible unless using very high numbers of threads (say, above 16).

The default setting provides more or less optimum speed. If you want to reduce the quality loss, use one thread (Not Recommended, unless all other settings are already maxed)

'''Recommendation:''' Auto

'''See also:''' [[#thread-input|thread input]]

===thread-input===
'''Default: Not Set'''

Decodes the input video in a separate thread to the encoding process. Enabled implicitly when threads &gt; 1.

'''Recommendation:''' Enabled with there is more than one logical CPU available.

===non-deterministic===
'''Default: Not Set'''

Slightly improve quality of SMP, at the cost of repeatability. Not for general use.

'''Recommendation:''' Default

'''See also:''' [[#threads|threads]]

===no-asm===
'''Default: Not Set'''

Disables all CPU optimisations. Useful for debugging or troubleshooting.

'''Recommendation:''' Default

===visualize===
'''Default: Not Set'''

Enables Macroblock Type visulisations over the encoded video. Useful for frame by frame debugging or analysis.

'''Recommendation:''' Default

===sps-id===
'''Default: Not Set'''

Set SPS (sequence parameter set) and PPS (picture parameter set) id numbers. Not for general use.

'''Recommendation:''' Default

===aud===
'''Default: Not Set'''

Use access unit delimiters. Not for general use.

'''Recommendation:''' Default

removed since r996, it is now enabled automatically at [[#subme|subme]] &gt;= 7

'''Default: Not Set'''

[[#subme_(old)|subme]] levels above 5 only affects I and P-frames by default. Set this to enable RDO calculations on B-frames as well.

See also: [[#subme_(old)|subme]]
===bime===
removed since r996, it is now enabled automatically at [[#subme|subme]] &gt;= 5

'''Default: Not Set'''

Enables joint optimization of both Motion Vectors in B-frames. Bi-Directional Motion Estimation performs an additional search for forwards and backwards vectors when encoding bi-directional B-frames, improving quality. 

Note: Does not effect B-frames encoded as direct/skip (no motion vector), forward (1 MV pointing to a past reference), backwards (1 MV pointing to a future reference).

'''Recommendation:''' Enabled

===subme (old)===
changed since r996:

subme 1~6 remain unchanged

new subme 8 == old subme 7 + b-rdo

new subme 9 == didn't exist, RD refinement in B-frames is completely new.

'''Default: 5 (pre r970), 6 (since r970)'''

Set the subpixel estimation complexity. Higher numbers are better. Levels 1-5 simply control the subpixel refinement strength. Level 6 enables RDO for mode decision, and level 7 enables RDO for motion vectors and intra prediction modes. Both the RDO levels are significantly slower than the previous levels.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''A basic introduction to how a video encoder works'''
:Video codecs generally use three different types of frames, I, P and B-frames.
:*I-frames (I for intra, meaning within) are the keyframes. They are like a jpg (the only similar thing is that they are both compressed images really) of the particular frame in question, and are used to cut the video up into smaller areas, and as references for other frames. These frames depend on no other frames to get decoded, which is where 'Intra' comes from.
:*P-frames are ''predicted'' frames (see where the P came from)? This means they are made up of two parts. The first part is original content, so just as with I-frames, parts (not all) of the frame are stored similar to jpg. The other parts are where the 'predicted' label comes in - they are taken from previous frames. This is the difficult part. Say you have someone's head on the frame, and it's moving to the left (a pan). Well, if the first frame was an I-frame, you could make the second frame a P-frame. Then you would say &quot;take the info from frame #01 and move it all 4 pixels to the left. Then add this new data to the right&quot;. You then have a P-frame. Ahhh, that wasn't that hard after all.
:*B-frames are just a logical extension of P-frames, with B standing for ''Bi-directional''. B-frames are predicted from both past ''and'' future frames, ''and'' they can have original content. Until you learn more, just assume that this works, don't spend sleepless nights trying to work out why it does.

'''A Note About The Difference Between ''Standards'' and ''Codecs''''':
:'''Standards''' are a set of specifications which are intended to serve as ''descriptions'' on how a video (or whatever) format should work.
:'''Encoders''' (aka codecs) are ''implementations'' of a standard.
:See the difference? What this means is when a '''standard''', like MPEG-4 ASP is produced, a number of different groups produce their own '''encoders''', like DivX and XviD. Yes, you are reading this right. A DivX encode will produce a file that can be played by the same decoder as that which is required by XviD. Of course, real life is never this nice and different encoders will use different features from the standard, and even add on their own. A real world example:
:*Quicktime h264 uses only the base features defined by MPEG-4 AVC. An encoder like x264 uses practically all of them. This means that you will have a hard time making a file in QT that is as good quality as you can get out of x264.

MeGUI only supports Xvid MPEG-4 ASP encoding and X264 MPEG-4 AVC encoding.
__TOC__

==MPEG==
By far the most common group of standards for video formats are those published by the MPEG ('''M'''otion '''P'''ictures '''E'''xperts '''G'''roup) group. Some of the formats are listed below:

===MPEG-1===
Probably the oldest video standard that still exists. Created to store video on CDs (i.e. VCDs) and other such devices. The most common use was 352x240 @ 1.5Mbit/s, which is usually referred to as &quot;VHS Quality&quot;

===MPEG-2===
Designed to produce better quality than [[#MPEG-1|MPEG-1]], but at higher bitrates. In other words, if you are looking at a bitrate under 1.5mbits, there will be little difference. For any bitrate higher than this, MPEG-2 will give significantly better quality. This format is what DVDs use as well as SVCDs and KVCDs. Also notable for being one of the few video formats in which a colour space other than YV12 is seen in the wild, MPEG2 occasionally uses YUY2.

===MPEG-4 SP===
SP Stands for '''S'''imple '''P'''rofile.&lt;br&gt;
A cut down version of [[#MPEG-4 ASP|MPEG-4 ASP]] as described below. Removes lots of cool features and is almost obsolete now. Big name encoders for it were Sorenson (used in QuickTime) and 3ivx. Microsft attempted to provide an implementation of it (as Microsoft Video V1/V2) but their implementation did not conform to spec and was mostly ignored.

===MPEG-4 ASP===
ASP Stands for '''A'''dvanced '''S'''imple '''P'''rofile. Also known as &quot;MPEG-4 Part 2&quot;.&lt;br&gt;
By far the most common format used in anime and 'scene' (i.e. American TV &amp; movie) releases. The two biggest implementations are DivX and XviD. CPU requirements are pretty measley by computer standards now, and quality is still reasonable.

Common implementations:
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xvid Xvid]. The best free implementation out there, and probably better than most commercial ones too. Supports practically everything of the ASP spec, definitely the recommended encoder for this content. This is the only 
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DivX DivX]. Often used by newbie encoders, but XviD gives generally better results. Note that the included decoder produces bad quality and you should never use it should an alternative present itself.
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FFmpeg LMP4]. Short for '''L'''ibavcodec '''MP4''', an encoder similar to XviD, but falls short in the quality stakes. Developed by FFmpeg and Libav team. Implemented in mencoder and a few other places.

===MPEG-4 AVC===
AVC Stands for '''A'''dvanced '''V'''ideo '''C'''oding.&lt;br&gt;
Wikipedia has [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H.264 a nice article about MPEG-4 AVC], aka h264, aka AVC, aka MPEG-4 Part 10. The next step in MPEG video compression after MPEG-4-ASP. It provides significant compression improvements (one option alone can improve efficiency by 20%), at the cost of encoding and decoding speed.

Common implementations:
*[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X264 x264]. Pretty similar to XviD - it's the only open source encoder for its standard, and it's better than all the commercial encoders. x264 supports most high profile options (see the Wikipedia page for the table of what feature is what profile level). The ''de facto'' encoder for personal high quality h264, because it's the only publicly available [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command_line_interface CLI] encoder, and because as said previously, it supports the most and outputs the highest quality. Homepage at [http://x264.nl/ x264.nl]. This is the only AVC encoder MeGUI supports.
*Nero Recode. It doesn't expose half as many options as x264, but includes a nice GUI which x264 does not. Although the final quality isn't as great as x264's, the fact it has a GUI makes it a good choice for people who are just starting out in the wild world of video encoding. Homepage is here: [http://www.nero.com/eng/products/nero-recode/ nero.com]. 
*Apple h264. The wooden spoon in this race goes to... Apple! Well, it's not really a wooden spoon, because even Apple's h264 implementation is a fair bit better than XviD. Their files are plain old baseline profile, but also use 1 b-frame. More info on the profile that's used [http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=102609 here]. Homepage: [http://www.apple.com/quicktime/ apple.com/quicktime]

==h26_==
The set of video specifications developed by the standards institute [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ITU-T ITU-T].

===h263===
Basically a subset of [[#MPEG4-ASP|MPEG4-ASP]]. Often found in the 3gp container for mobile phones.

===h263+===
h263 plus random stuff. Some of the random stuff is not compatible with MPEG4-ASP either. That said, h263+ is rarer than h263 in the wild, about the only places it exists is in proprietary videoconferencing software, and on some mobile phones. Often found in the 3gp container for mobile phones.

===h264===
Another name for [[#MPEG-4_AVC|MPEG-4 AVC]].

==Theora==
A free codec that was created when On2 released the source-code for VP3 and made it freely available for use. Development is rather slow, that is to say it doesn't happen. The biggest advantage of this format is that it's completely free for any sort of use at all, which means for any OSS zealot this is your must-use codec. The disadvantage is that the quality is not all that flash compared to the latest codecs, and ffdshow / VLC / mplayer are really the only Windows programs that support it. Quality-wise it's almost identical to VP3, which places it slightly above [[#MPEG-1|MPEG-1]] but well below the latest codecs such as [[#MPEG-4 AVC|MPEG-4 AVC]] or [[#VC-1|VC-1]]

==On2==
On2 is a company that make video specifications and codecs to go along with them. As they are a private company the specs they make are obviously closed and private. The company was acquired by Google.

[http://www.on2.com/ Homepage]

===VP3===
Old, rare, practically unused. [[#Theora|Theora]] was based off this, the quality is around that of [[#MPEG-1|MPEG-1]].

===VP6===
On2's next codec after VP3, which has become one of the official encoders of the Flash Video format (.flv), and thus can be decoded by Flash. It's reasonably rarely used though, most people seem to have used [[#h263|h263]] instead. Now that [[#MPEG-4 AVC|MPEG-4 AVC]] is also a support format by Flash Video this will probably quietly expire.

===VP7===
On2's codec after VP6. They claim quality is equal to [[#MPEG-4 AVC|MPEG-4 AVC]] and [[#VC-1|VC-1]]. Nobody really cared about it enough to test the quality, and it has long ago fallen by the wayside. There's a free encoder/decoder for personal use on their page.

===VP8===
On2's successor of VP7. It became a royalty free codec after Google acquired On2. It is used by WebM format.

===VP9===
Successor of VP8.

==WMV==
The '''W'''indows '''M'''edia '''V'''ideo group of codecs, developed by Microsoft. Read the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Media_Video Wikipedia article] for more info on the various formats (including VC-1) that make up the WMV family. Generally the only available encoders for all of these standards are the official Microsoft ones.

===MS MPEG, Microsoft Video, etc===
A variety of ancient modifications to official MPEG specs (mostly), which existed before the WMV brand name was born. Mostly unseen these days, but there are VfW encoders still around for them in versions of Windows. Some full names: Microsoft H.261/3 Video Codec, Microsoft Video 1/2, MS MPEG Video 1/2 (possibly the same as the previous item).

===WMV7/8/9===
Microsoft's video codecs that first came out probably around 2000. They are '''the''' codecs used in .wmv files, so quite common around the place. Relative quality has always been lower than the alternatives (read: xvid &amp; x264) have been. That said, the lower quality is not a huge drop, and the decoders are guaranteed to be on every Windows computer ever. There is even playback support on Linux via libavcodec and whatever makes use of it.

===VC-1===
An extension of WMV9 which adds a few necessities for the broadcasting world (in other words, full interlaced encoding &lt;small&gt;(WMV9 only supported interlaced in 4:1:1 colour format)&lt;/small&gt;). Quality is claimed to be equal to that of [[#MPEG-4 AVC|MPEG-4 AVC]], but that's been shown not to be true. VC-1 is effectively a subset of AVC features (a totally incompatible one of course), and it lacks many powerful coding techniques as a result. Most tests put the quality equal to or better than xvid, which is far short of decent h264 encoders. Found on HD DVD and Blu-ray discs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==MPEG-1 Layer 2 &amp; 3==
'''Layer 2:''' AKA MP2. Reasonably rare, probably because people assume it's not as good as MP3 (because of the name, see). [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-1_Audio_Layer_II Wikipedia says] that it provides better sound quality than [[#MP3|MP3]] at bitrates of 256kbits or higher.
:Encoded with TooLAME ([http://toolame.sourceforge.net/ toolame.sourceforge.net]), its fork TwoLAME ([http://twolame.sourceforge.net/ twolame.sourceforge.net]), or ffmpeg. MeGUI only supports to encode with FFmpeg.

'''Layer 3:''' Known everywhere as MP3, it's the .avi of audio formats - anything can play it. Audio quality is 'average', i.e., it's the worst out of all formats, but since audio files are pretty small, people are happy to just increase the bitrate. Encoded with LAME ('''L'''AME '''A'''in't an '''M'''P3 '''E'''ncoder - yes, this is a recursive acronym. Just ignore the fact that LAME ''is'' an MP3 encoder and you'll do fine).

==AAC==
AAC &lt;small&gt;aka&lt;/small&gt; Advanced Audio Coding &lt;small&gt;aka&lt;/small&gt; MPEG-4 Part 3 &lt;small&gt;aka&lt;/small&gt; MPEG-2 Part 7 (so a nice simple set of names in other words). Here's the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Audio_Coding wikipedia page] on it. AAC offers better quality than MP3, and probably the best overall compared to any other codec.

There are a few different AAC 'profiles' you can encode to:

* '''Main''': The 'normal' version of AAC, but virtually nothing implements it, so you can ignore it.
* '''LC''' (Low Complexity): the 'normal' profile, AAC files are usually LC.
* '''HE''' (High Efficiency): When you start encoding to bitrates under around 64-96kbits (for stereo) (which is the common ballpark figure, Nero use around 75-80kbits), you can start using HE, which will increase the audio quality at those bitrates. HE codes the upper half of the frequency spectrum with a technique called '''S'''pectral '''B'''and '''R'''eplication (SBR). Basically it's coded as a difference from the lower half, rather than normally as a standalone segment. Maximum efficiency is increased, but maximum quality is reduced.
* '''HEv2''' (High Effiency version 2): If you drop the bitrate even further (to around 40kbits), you can start using HEv2, which will again allow you better quality at those bitrates. This introduces another coding technique called '''P'''arametric '''S'''tereo (PS). Instead of encoding each channel separately, PS encodes one 'master' channel, and encodes the other channels as 'differences' from it. Once again, maximum efficiency is increased, but maximum quality is reduced.
* '''LTP''' (Long Term Prediction): Another magical compression technique that is especially useful for voice compression (or anything has repeated sounds). As per Main profile, it's not used and therefore safe to ignore.
* '''LD''' &amp; '''ELD''' (Low Delay &amp; Extra Low Delay): Used for speech encoding.

Different AAC encoders &amp; decoders will implement support for different profiles above. Generally you can rely on LC support being in whatever tool you use, but HE and HEv2 are a little more hit and miss. Computer decoders should support all three, but your mileage may vary. In particular, Apple stuff only does LC.
On the bright side, AAC implements 'graceful degradation', which means if a decoder tries to play back a file encoded with an unsupported profile, at least ''something'' should come out:
* HE content on a LC decoder: you'll only hear the lower half of the frequency spectrum.
* HEv2 content on a LC decoder: you'll only hear a single channel.

AAC can be created with a few tools. Even if they don't say it, most available programs will just use one of the below.

* Nero Digital Audio. Released May 2006, supports LC/HE/HEv2, free, great quality output, CLI. What more could you want? Homepage: [http://www.nero.com/enu/nero-aac-codec.html nero.com/enu/nero-aac-codec.html]
* FFmpeg. It is an experimental codec included in libavcodec.
* VisualOn AAC Encoder. Bought from VisualOn by Google to use in Android open-source project.
* Fraunhofer IIS AAC Encoder. Like VisualOn encoder, it was open-sourced by Google for Android. It supports almost all the AAC profiles including LC, HE, HEv2, and ELD.
* Quicktime. Back in early 2004, [http://www.rjamorim.com/test/aac128v2/results.html Quicktime was the best AAC encoder]. What's changed since then? Probably very little. It only outputs AAC-LC though, no HE or HEv2 support.
* FAAC. '''F'''ree '''AA'''C '''C'''odec. Not nearly as good quality as the rest above, but it's the only real open source AAC encoder. Once commonly used, now not so common. It does support Main and LTP encoding though.

MeGUI only supports Nero AAC Codec.

==Vorbis==
A completely patent free audio codec that lies very close to AAC qualitywise. Different testers give one or the other first prize, they are pretty much neck and neck for 'normal' bitrates. Usually can be seen referred to as Ogg Vorbis, however we speak of the audio codec itself, Vorbis, since it will be used in other media containers. The name Ogg comes from the container it is typically stored in by itself (.ogg). Vorbis is maintained by the [http://www.xiph.org/ Xiph] organization along with a few other strange codecs, none of which are terribly common.

==Opus==
It is a speech codec developed by Xiph.org.

==AC3==
Implementation of the ATSC A/52 standard by Dolby Studios. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_Digital#Dolby_Digital Dolby Digital AC3] is Dolby's base lossy audio codec in which they have enhanced over the years to create a large umbrella suite of codecs. It is the standard audio format for DVDs and most Digital TV Broadcasts. If the file contains AC3 audio it usually means it is the original audio from the source, essentially the highest possible quality. Compared to other lossy codecs however, it is quite inefficient and space-consuming. Maximum bitrate of 640kbits and a limit of 5 channels.

===DD+ (EAC3)===
Dolby Digital Plus, or Extended AC3. AC3's reincarnation for use with HD video. Seen mainly on HD DVD and Blu-ray discs. General compression efficiency improvements have been included, but since the maximum bitrate of the stream is now over 6mbit (rather than 640kbit) you can get perceptually lossless quality pretty easily anyway. Allows 13 channels. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_Digital_Plus See also: Wikipedia].

==TrueHD==
Dolby's attempt at a 'next gen' lossless audio codec. Support is mandatory on HD DVD, but optional on Blu-ray. Supports 14 channels, 192&amp;nbsp;kHz sampling rate and 24bit depth. It's limited to 8/96/24 respectively on the next gen disc formats. Bitrate goes up to the insanely high 18mbits, although as with most maximum limits here and below, real life usage will probably never break 6mbit. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolby_TrueHD Wikipedia can probably tell you more].

==DTS==
DTS (Digital Theater Systems) is an extremely high bitrate audio codec rarely found in the wild. DTS is an official audio codec to be used with the DVD standard, however, it is not mandatory to the standard and thus not all DVD players can decode DTS audio tracks. HD DVD and Blu-ray both mandate support. It comes in two flavors: huge (768 kbit/s) and ginormous (1,536 kbit/s). Actually comparing this codec to AC3 is difficult, because it is often mastered differently to the AC3 file when both are included on a DVD. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Theater_System Read the wikipedia page] for more info on this subject.

===DTS ES===
DTS Extended Surround. Basically the same as DTS, just with another channel included. The extra channel is a second 'center surround' channel. Comes in two varieties, but both are reasonably rare. The first is called '''Matrix''', where the extra channel is modulated into the existing channels (remember dolby pro logic? Like ''that''). Also there is the '''Discrete''' variant, where the extra channel is included as another totally separate channel. Both are backwards compatible (i.e., just the 5.1 will play in a normal DTS decoder). [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTS-ES Wikipedia] might tell you more.

===DTS-HD MA===
DTS High Definition Master Audio. An updated version of DTS ES that is also '''lossless'''. It's very similar to the above. There's a normal DTS track that's played back if the decoder doesn't support this. 'This' is the lossless version, which supports 8 channels, 96&amp;nbsp;kHz sampling rate and 24bit depth. The bitrate also goes up to 25mbit! Just thinking about what could make someone think that bitrate is required for an ''audio stream'' makes me shudder in horror. Decoding support for this is optional for both HD DVD and Blu-ray, so with any luck it will never see the light of day. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTS-HD_High_Resolution#DTS-HD_Master_Audio Wikipedia].

===DTS-HD HR===
DTS High Definition High Resolution (is it just me, or are these names are getting progressively dumber?). What was produced when DTS realised nobody would support DTS-HD MA. Supports 8 channels at 96&amp;nbsp;kHz and 24 bit depth. Wow, sounds the same as the above! It is, just not lossless. What difference does that make? Well, about 19mbits. Yes, the maximum bitrate is now a far more sane 6mbit. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DTS-HD_High_Resolution#DTS-HD_High_Resolution_Audio Wikipedia].

==Flac==
Flac stands for '''F'''ree '''L'''ossless '''A'''udio '''C'''odec. It is a lossless audio codec like TrueHD and DTS-HD MA.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==AVI==
Full name: ''Audio Video Interleave''. This is probably the most common container format out there, which is due to the fact it can be played in almost every media player and on every operating system / platform. It was created back in 1992 by Microsoft.

AVI is often seen as the 'baseline' of video containers, because it supports the least number of features and is the oldest and most common. Some people still prefer this container over others, [http://www.alexander-noe.com/video/amg/en_myths.html this guy] points out that AVI supports many of the features that newer containers (like [[#MKV|MKV]] and [[#MP4|MP4]]) do, however this support is usually non-standard or bad. Despite this, if you don't actually need any of the features that the more advanced containers support, AVI might be all you need.

'''Verdict:''' Fine (sort of, you should still prefer [[#MKV|Matroska]]) if all you want to store is xvid+mp3, but anything else requires a better container.

==FLV==
Full name: ''Flash Video''. The container used by Flash to stream video. It's what the flash player streams on sites such as YouTube etc., and what you download from them when you use a site like [http://keepvid.com/ KeepVid]. Almost always holds MP3 audio and either h263/h263+ or VP6 video, it can probably hold other formats but there is little reason to do so. Since this should not be a format you should encode to (unless you want flash video), there is no verdict for usability.

==OGM==
Full name: ''Ogg Media''. Originally developed by Tobias Waldvogel as a means to use the amazing new Vorbis audio codec (at that time) with your typical [[Computer movie files/Video#MPEG-4 ASP|MPEG-4 ASP]] video formats. Considered by many a &quot;hack&quot; of the Ogg container to fit in such video formats. The format became extremely popular for a short time as it allowed chapters, multiple audio streams, and softsubs to be added in the container. Eventually though development declined for the OGM &quot;standard&quot; by Tobias and was eventually taken on by the Xiph Project. However their stance seems to still be ignore it's existence. The formats use eventually ceased to exist with the rise of the Matroska container, which could do everything it did and more and with less overhead.

'''Verdict:''' Less features than [[#MKV|Matroska]], and with a higher overhead. Unless you have some wacky device that can play ogm but not mkv or similar, you probably shouldn't use this.

==MKV==
Full name: ''Matroska Video''. Probably the best container for computer playback, you can do ''almost anything'' with it. It allows the use of  all video formats with ease, uses any audio or subtitle format you want and provides advanced features such as vfr encoding, chapters, and softsubs. A common misconception with it is that it requires more CPU to decode than normal AVI, which is true, sort of. It requires such a tiny increase in CPU that you can safely assume there to be no difference. Matroska also offers lower overhead for muxed files which decreases filesize and allows you to pack more bitrate into your video and audio files.

The homepage is [http://www.matroska.org/ matroska.org], but it doesn't really contain that much information useful to a precious newbie like yourself.

'''Verdict:''' The most versatile container around. It's lovely!

==MP4==
Full name: ''MPEG-4 File Format''.  The first version was finalised in 1998 and standardised in early 1999.  It was the first MP4 file format developed by MPEG and primarily designed for web video and portable hardware (such as mobile phones).  Version 1 was superseded by Version 2 shortly after, at the end of 1999 (standardised in 2000) and is fully backward compatible.  Since then, MP4 has been extended, and constantly developed.

In addition to supporting the latest MPEG standards, it is also backward compatible with older standards.  In MP4 you can contain:
*[[MeGUI/Computer movie files/Video#MPEG-1|MPEG-1]]
*[[MeGUI/Computer movie files/Video#MPEG-2|MPEG-2]]
*[[MeGUI/Computer movie files/Video#h263|h263 (and extensions)]] (via .3gp which is a simplified MPEG-4 V1)
*[[MeGUI/Computer movie files/Video#MPEG-4 ASP|MPEG-4 ASP]] and [[MeGUI/Computer movie files/Video#MPEG-4 AVC|MPEG-4 AVC]] (H.264) video
On the audio side you can store
*[[MeGUI/Computer_movie_files/Audio#MPEG-1_Layer_2_.26_3|MPEG-1/2 Layer 1,2 &amp; 3]]
*[[MeGUI/Computer movie files/Audio#AAC|AAC]]
:*SLS (a scalable lossless extension to AAC)
*AMR (via .3gp)
*CELP &amp; TwinVQ (for low bitrate/speech)
*SAOL (MIDI)
*ALAC (Apple Lossless)
*ALS (MPEG4 standardised lossless format)

It also has its own softsub format, 3GP timed text. Last but not least, MP4 support JPEG &amp; PNG image formats.

MP4 also has a user data atom where you can store meta info about the stream, album art etc.  Through the use of private streams, you could also mux [[Computer movie files/Audio#Vorbis|Vorbis]], [[Computer movie files/Audio#AC3|AC3]] or DVD Subpictures.  This is not standard and players aren't required to support it.  If you want such features, this is the time to use MKV.  MP4 also supports menus (there are working players and examples to test).

Bond has a very informative MP4 faq posted at [http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?s&amp;threadid=62723 doom9].

'''Verdict:''' Doesn't support as many formats as MKV, but it supports all the common, popular formats and ISO standards helping to ensure interoperability.  MP4 has more &quot;out of the box&quot; support than MKV, this is reflected in commercial software and hardware players, but obviously audio/video decoder support is another matter.  If you want native MPEG-4 ASP or H.264 video with MP3 or AAC audio, or you just want to transmux a .ts or .mpg file, MP4 offers just that.  If you want softsubs and vorbis, use MKV.

==MOV==
Full name: ''Quicktime Movie Format''. This format is a proprietary format from Apple. Supports a lot of the stuff that mp4 does, however those are considered unofficial hackish use and will not play in its native player. 

'''Verdict:''' Do not use this for anything other than iPod files.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Parallel job execution''' is a feature introduced to MeGUI in version 0.2.6.1001 to allow running multiple jobs at once. This page is an explanation of why it was introduced, and how to use it.

==Rationale==
Video encoding is a CPU-intensive task, and welcomes improvements in hardware, to boost the speed of encodes, and allow deeper searching by the encoder to achieve better compressibility. Dual-core CPUs theoretically offer an almost 2x speed-up over their single-core counterparts, and the improvements (in theory) continue to increase as you get more cores. To harness this extra processing power, video encoders have been parallelized to support multiple cores. This means that encoding frontends can achieve most of the gains of multiple core CPUs without needing to do anything. However, there are two main problems with this:

# The need for synchronisation within the encoder means that the computer's processing power is not all used. While significant gains over single core applications are still observed, it is not the 2x/3x/4x/etc, that you would hope for.
# Not all encoders have support for multi-threading yet. In particular, many audio encoders are still single-threaded.

There is an alternative approach. Since video encoding is often done with more than one job at a time, running these jobs simultaneously solves both of these problems, as the parallelization comes from running both at once, not from the encoder.

Supporting parallel job execution drops the need for in-order execution of jobs, which allows for a lot more freedom when using MeGUI: you don't have to wait for a job to finish before running the next one.

==How it works==
The basic unit of job execution is the '''Job Worker''' (or just a worker). A single worker can process one job at a time. Within MeGUI, however, there can be multiple job workers, each processing jobs, leading to parallelism.

====Normal job execution====
The standard method of job processing is that each job worker requests a job from the main job queue, and processes it, then requests another. This continues until all the jobs are finished or cannot be processed (ie they are set to ''postponed'' or ''skip'' or ''aborted'', or they had errors). So that jobs that depend on each other aren't executed in the wrong order, each job maintains a list of jobs it depends on, and a job will not be run until all the jobs it depends on have completed successfully (which means that their status is ''done''). This is done on a fine level, so that even in a job chain containing audio, video, and mux jobs, the mux job depends on the audio and video, but the audio and video don't depend on each other, so they can be processed at the same time.

====Owned jobs====
Workers also maintain a list of reserved jobs, which are jobs that they 'own'. If a job is owned, it can only be executed by the worker that owns it. A worker will execute all the jobs it owns before requesting more from the main job queue. This ability is useful for running quick jobs without needing to wait for the slow jobs already queued. For example, you may have several long video encodes queued, and you want to set up another, which requires d2v indexing. With pre-0.2.6.1001 behaviour, you would have to queue the index job and wait for the previous job to finish. With owned jobs, you just queue the job, and then right-click and select 'Run in new temporary worker'. The temporary worker will then ''own'' that job, will run it immediately, and then shut down when the job is finished. This will not interrupt the other jobs running.

Each worker has a local queue, which lists the jobs it owns. If you want to 'disown' a job, you can 'return job to main job queue' by right-clicking on that job in the worker's local queue.

====Worker summary====
The '''worker summary''' is a small window which gives a concise summary of the workers. You can also reach most of the worker functionality by using right-click on that window.

Detecting the interlace type of a video stream can be difficult at first, but there are a number of tools to make it easier for you.
==MeGUI interlace analyser==
This is the recommended method for determining the interlace type.

The MeGUI analyser can be found in the avisynth creator. Open the video file, move across to the second tab and there is the interlace detector. All you need to do is click &quot;Analyse...&quot;, but you should check the box labelled ''source is anime'', if it applies to you. Once it has finished, it will pop up its findings and recommended filters to produce a progressive output.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Megui updatewindow.png|right]]
The update window allows you to keep MeGUI and its components up to date. Whenever you run MeGUI, it will automatically check for updates and prompt you if there are any available. You can also run the updater from the Tools menu.

When the updater window opens, it will automatically poll the webserver for any updates. If updates are available, it will automatically select them in the list, ready for you to click ''Update''.

If you do not wish to update a certain component, you can right click on the item and choose &quot;Ignore updates for this file&quot;. Any future updates will not be automatically suggested. You can undo this by right clicking and selecting &quot;Ignore updates for this file&quot; again.

==Technical Information==
The download cache for MeGUI is located at [http://megui.org/auto/ megui.org/auto] or [http://megui.xvidvideo.ru/auto/ here] as mirror. An xml file (update.xml) is downloaded which contains a list of components and their latest versions. If the latest version is newer than the version MeGUI has recorded as downloading, it will prompt for updating. Keep in mind MeGUI determines what requires updating by its internal records, not by reading file version from the files or anything.

==Advanced Simple Profile==
Also known as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MPEG-4_Part_2#Advanced_Simple_Profile_.28ASP.29 MPEG-4 Part 2], ASP defines a highly compatible subset of features of the MPEG-4 standard, that is well established in the market. The most common ASP codecs are Divx and XviD. Please see [[MeGUI/Computer_movie_files/Video#MPEG-4_ASP|Video Codecs]].

==Advanced Video Coding==
Also known as [[w:MPEG-4 Part 10|MPEG-4 Part 10]] or H.264, this is the latest and most powerful incarnation of MPEG-4. Programs such as x264 and Nero Recode are capable of using this codec. Please see [[Computer_movie_files/Video#MPEG-4_AVC|Video Codecs]].

==Analysis Pass==
An analysis pass (aka Avisynth job) is a job which simply requests each frame consecutively from AviSynth. This is useful in two cases:
* for two-pass AviSynth scripts, when the first pass is simply collecting metrics (dedup, some tdecimate modes, etc.)
* benchmarking avisynth scripts.

==Anamorphic==
Anamorphic encoding is the process of creating a video where the encoded [[#Aspect Ratio|aspect ratio]] (AR) is different from the displayed aspect ratio. This allows for better image quality without having to upsize the image during encoding. The most common scenario for anamorphic encoding is for encoding DVDs at their full resolution.

Anamorphic encodes are usually found in [[Computer movie files#MKV|MKV]] or [[Computer movie files#MP4|MP4]] files, but is technically also supported in [[AVI]] files, either through storing the AR information in the [[Computer_movie_files/Video#MPEG-4_SP|MPEG-4]] bitstream (not supported by all codecs) or by storing it in the container (not supported by ''any'' AVI splitters). Suffice to say, anamorphic encoding in AVI files is possible, but these files may be displayed wrongly by some programs.

==Aspect Ratio==
The ratio of a video's horizontal display length to its vertical display length. In other words, the relative horizontal length compared to the vertical. For example, you can determine a square pixel video's aspect ratio by dividing the width by the height (4 / 3 = 1.333, 16 / 9 = 1.77). This would give you the decimal aspect ratio ( 16:9 = 1.77 ). Some videos are [[#Anamorphic|anamorphic]], so you cannot always rely on the ratio of horizontal resolution / vertical resolution to give the correct value. Common aspect ratios are 1.33 (4:3 'square'), 1.78 ( 16:9 widescreen), 1.85:1 and 2.35:1 (common American anamorphic widescreen ratios).

For anamorphic encoding, the aspect ratio information needs to be stored with the video. This is normally represented in one of two ways: [[#DAR|DAR]] and [[#SAR|SAR]]

See [[MeGUI/Aspect Ratio Signalling in AviSynth Scripts|Aspect ratio signalling in AviSynth scripts]] for how MeGUI handles them.

==AVC Levels==
There are now some hardware devices which support AVC video (like the iPod, PSP). The AVC standard includes something called Levels, which is a specification of video complexity in terms of processing power required to decode a given stream. This is useful for low-power applications like the iPod. In the x264 codec configuration, there is a box which allows the level to be set. Enforcing this level could mean limits on the allowed resolution. MeGUI will tell you what changes need to be made to enforce that level if you go Tools-&gt;Validate AVC Level. You can then make the changes. Alternatively, if you have a level set and you use the One Click Encoder, if your chosen resolution is too high for the level, it will find the highest resolution that satisfies the level, and use that.

The upshot of this note means that if you want to make a Hardware-compatible encode, you should download the relevant profile by Sharktooth and use that. If there is a level set, then you can just use this with the One Click Encoder, or you could generate your own script manually and see if it qualifies using the &quot;Validate AVC Level&quot; option in the ''Tools'' menu.

See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H264#Levels Wikipedia] for a list of all AVC Levels specified, which should give you a pretty good idea of what they are used for.

==AviSynth==
AviSynth is a very powerful scripted [[#Backend|backend]] for video (pre-)processing used by many video tools, MeGUI included. As it is script based, it is highly customisable and fast.

AviSynth files have an extension of '.avs' and are plain text script files. MeGUI provides the [[MeGUI/Tools/Avisynth Script Creator|AviSynth script creator]] for the easy generation of scripts.

For more information on AviSynth:
* [http://avisynth.org Official site]
* [http://forum.doom9.org/forumdisplay.php?f=33 Doom9 usage forum]
* [[w:AviSynth|Wikipedia's AviSynth page]]

==Backend==
A '''backend''' is a tool which does most of the actual processing yet, because of a limited user interface, is generally used via a frontend (such as MeGUI). Examples:
*x264 is a backend which does h264 encoding for MeGUI
*AviSynth is the backend which does video pre-processing for MeGUI

''See also [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backend Wikipedia's article on backends]''

==Compressibility==
A clip's ''compressibility'' is a measure of how easily a video encoder can compress it. It is a purely rule of thumb measure. For example, a clip of grass growing is cosidered more 'compressible' than an action packed clip from the Matrix. This is because if you were to feed both videos to an encoder and tell it to encode them to the same quality, the former clip will come out much smaller.

Other rules of thumb which help to determine compressibility of a clip:
*Sharperning reduces compressibility
*Low motion is more compressible than high motion

==d2v==
A type of file that is created by DGIndex and is used as the input for encoding. 
''See also [[#DGIndex|DGIndex]]

==DAR==
'''D'''isplay '''A'''spect '''R'''atio. The ratio of width to height of the displayed image (i.e. after any resizing that occurs from an [[#Anamorphic|anamorphic]] encode). This contrasts with [[#SAR|SAR]] which refers to the width:height ratio of an individual pixel.

==DGIndex==
A program used prior to video encoding that allows one to frameserve videos into other applications that cannot open MPEG-2 files. This is the [[#Backend|backend]] that MeGUI uses when you use the [[MeGUI/D2V Creator|D2V Creator]] tool.

See [http://www.digital-digest.com/articles/Creating_D2V_Project_page1.html digital-digest] for a quick guide to creating [[#d2v|d2v]] files with DGIndex.

You can read more about DGIndex on the [http://neuron2.net/dgmpgdec/dgmpgdec.html official site].

==Demuxing==
Demuxing (short for ''demultiplexing'') is the act of extracting a specific stream (or streams) from a file. For example, extracting the mp3 audio track from an AVI file is demuxing.&lt;br&gt;
''See also [[#Muxing|Muxing]]''

==DirectShow==
A video processing interface found in the Windows OS. Used almost exclusively as the framework for decoding video for media players (apart from players that use only inbuilt decoders, such as VLC and mplayer). Also can be used for encoding tasks, or any task that requires throughput of video (muxing, etc.), although this usage is still rare. DirectShow is simply a framework, filters are registered into it, and these filters are assembed into 'chains' for transforming the video data passed from the start to the end.

==Frontend==
A frontend is a program (usually a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GUI GUI]) which is used to interface with a [[#Backend|backend]] program. MeGUI is an example of a multi-function frontend, which gives the user a simple interface to the programs doing all the hard work

==GNU GPL==
Short for '''''GNU''' '''G'''eneral '''P'''ublic '''L'''icense''. GNU is a recursive acronym that stands for '''''G'''NU is '''N'''ot '''U'''nix''. This is a common license used by free software. You can read about this license at the [http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html official site]. All programs licensed under the GNU GPL must include the license text.

==Interlaced==
A video stream where the data is transmitted in fields. Fields are made up of alternate lines of a full frame, so instead of transmitting lines 1,2,3,4...., an interlaced stream transmits 1,3,5,7..., and then 2,4,6,8.... Compare with [[#Progressive|progressive]] streams. More on [[w:Interlace|Wikipedia]].

==IVTC==
'''I'''n'''v'''erse '''T'''ele'''c'''ine. A method of 'un-telecining' a [[Glossary#Telecine|telecined]] video stream. The most common application is applying IVTC to a TCed 29.97i source. Most NTSC movies are released this way, either broadcast on TV or distributed on DVD.

==Mux path finding==
Mux path finding refers to MeGUI dynamically deducing which container formats are possible given a set of input files. It uses a clever algorithm which allows muxers to be easily registered and unregistered while still being able to tell what container formats are possible. A lot of MeGUI uses mux path finding when possible, which (for the user) means that only the filetypes which are achievable are displayed.

==Muxing==
Muxing (a contraction of ''multiplexing'') is the act of combining multiple video, audio and subtitle streams into one file. For example, combining MP3 audio and XviD video (either already in avi or in m2v (raw) format) into a single AVI file is muxing.&lt;br&gt;
''See also [[#Demuxing|demuxing]]''

==Pre-rendering job==
Checking this box before you click 'enqueue' will create an extra job that runs before the encoding. This job will encode the input script to a (lossless) HuffYUV file, and then use that file for input for your encoding. The advantage of this is that your avisynth script will only have to run once, meaning a 2  pass encode will run faster.

'''Caveats:'''
*Lossless files can be large. A 2hr DVD movie will come in around 30gb, a 2hr 720p file closer to 60gb.
*The huffyuv file is output to the same location as the input script, not to the same location as the final file.

==Progressive==
Meaning a stream of video frames that are not interlaced. Compare with [[#Interlaced|interlaced]] video streams. More on [[Progressive video|Wikipedia]].

==Raw Video==
Raw video is video data not stored in any container. It can be referred to as an ''elementary stream''. Raw video must usually be muxed to a container such as AVI or MKV before it can be viewed. Different file extensions are used to signify the fact that raw streams are not compatible with each other: for MPEG-4 AVC streams, this is .264 or .h264, and for MPEG-4 ASP, this is generally .m4v

==Splitting==
When a file that contains more than one stream (say an .avi, .mkv or similar) is played back, the first step in the playback 'chain' is to separate the different streams and send them to the appropriate decoders. This is accomplished by use of a '''splitter'''. A splitter can also refer to a program that extracts streams from a file (i.e. [[#Demuxing|demuxing]]).

==SAR==
'''S'''ample '''A'''spect '''R'''atio. The ratio of width to height of an individual sample (or pixel) of the displayed image (i.e. after any resizing that occurs from an [[#Anamorphic|anamorphic]] encode). This contrasts with [[#DAR|DAR]] which refers to the width:height ratio of the entire image.

==Telecine==
A system where you turn a 23.976p video stream into a 29.97i video stream by interlacing and then selectively duplicating fields. Technically, there are many types of telecine processes, and this is the 3:2 Pulldown. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telecine#3:2_pulldown_.28technically.2C_2:3_pulldown.29 Read wikipedia] for more info.

==Upscaling Video==
When you resize video to a resolution greater than its original resolution. Generally frowned upon, because it's rather hard to increase the quality. The main way you can increase quality is by using a slower resizer than is practical in real-time on playback - but the gain is generally felt to be less than the increased 'cost' which manifests itself in a higher filesize required and the low overall gain in quality.

==Video for Windows (VfW)==
An old interface used on the Windows OS for encoding and decoding of video. Although it is mostly depracated and outright incompatible with new codecs such as h264 (and only partly compatible with MPEG4-ASP), it lives on in many programs. Its successor is [[#DirectShow|directshow]], which has totally replaced it in decoding apps (media players), but has only made a few inroads on the encoding side.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Setting up the source==
First thing you need to do is get your video ready so you can encode it.

:{| style=&quot;background: #D9FFD9&quot;
|- 
|'''MPEG2 Source'''
:For an MPEG2 transport stream the tool of choice is [http://neuron2.net/dgmpgdec/dgmpgdec.html DGIndex]
:* Load the ts.
:* Select the Stream menu and click 'Detect PIDS/PMT'.
:* Select MPEG2 Video and press set Video.
:* Select AC3/DTS Audio, press set Audio and done.
:* Make sure audio-&gt;output method is set to 'demux all tracks'.
:* Press F4 and choose a directory to save the d2v (video) and ac3 (audio) files.
|}

:{| style=&quot;background: #BFDFFF&quot;
|- 
|'''h264 Source'''
:* If you're trying to encode a h264 source you need two programs:
::* ProjectX ( http://www.videohelp.com/tools?tool=ProjectX ( you want &quot;Projectx compiled with Java included here (27MB)&quot;))
::* PTSCalc ( http://www.h264tscutter.de/ )
:* ProjectX will let you take the ac3 audio out of your transport stream. Open up ProjectX and open your ts.
::* Press quick start (wait until it's done then close ProjectX).
::* Your AC3 audio will be in the same directory as your transport stream.
:* Open up the TS with PTSCalc, press calc.
::* This handy little program will work out the audio delay for you. Rename your ac3 file and put DELAY xx (xx is the delay PTSCalc said, but keep it as a whole number). (e.g. 'The 4400 S01E01 DELAY -300ms.ac3')
|}

:{| style=&quot;background: #FFFFBF&quot;
|- 
|'''Other Source'''
:* For other sources, you don't need to do any preprocessing.
|}

== Creating your avs file ==
This is where you resize your video and apply filters to it if you want.
*Download &amp; install the latest stable version of Avisynth from [http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=57023 sourceforge].
*Download the latest copy of the TIVTC package from [http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=82264#1 here]. Extract the dlls to your avisynth\plugins directory.
*Move the DGDecode.dll file from your DGIndex directory into avisynth\plugins as well.
*Create a blank file, name it encode.avs and open it up with notepad (or your text editor of choice).

===Loading the video source===
:{| style=&quot;background: #D9FFD9&quot;
|- 
|'''MPEG2 Source'''
:''MPEG2Source(&quot;C:\myvideo.d2v&quot;)''
::Ensure the location is correct for the d2v file
|}

:{| style=&quot;background: #BFDFFF&quot;
|- 
|'''h264 Source'''
:*To load the video in type:
::''directshowsource(&quot;C:\myvideo.ts&quot;,fps=###)''
:Ensure the location is correct for the d2v file
:Replace the '###' with the correct framerate. For BBC caps this is 25.
:If FFDShow can decode the stream correctly, use it in preference to CoreAVC, which exhibits blocking artifacts in some circumstances. The latest CoreAVC is meant to have fixed this (1.3.0.0), but it's unconfirmed, and older versions are broken.
|}

:{| style=&quot;background: #FFFFBF&quot;
|- 
|'''Other Source'''
:Different sources will need to be loaded different ways. New formats, such as HD DVD and BD can be troublesome to load, and you will need to find current informations in forums to load them in the best possible way. If in doubt, try:
::''directshowsource(&quot;path\to\file.ext&quot;)
|}

===Deinterlacing / Telecine removal===
The next step involves converting the stream to a series of progressive frames with the correct framerate. There are three main types of stream that you might be starting with at the moment:
*'''[[MeGUI/Glossary#Progressive|Progressive]]'''
*'''[[MeGUI/Glossary#Interlaced|Interlaced]]'''
*'''Hybrid''': The most common form of which is [[MeGUI/Glossary#Telecine|telecined]] content. Some frames are progressive, some are interlaced.
You can determine if the source is interlaced or progressive by opening the script you have created so far (which should be just one line) in a media player, and stepping through a section with fast motion frame by frame. If the video has [[:Image:Combing.jpg|combing]] in some or all of the frames, the video is interlaced or telecined. If all frames are clean, the video is progressive.

:{| style=&quot;background: #FFDFBF&quot;
|- 
|'''Progressive Source''' (i.e., 720p and 1080p captures)
:These sources will either come at the correct framerate, or a faster rate. For example, most 720p captures come at 60fps, which is faster than the original framerate.
:*If the framerate is 23.976fps, 25fps or 29.970fps, you don't need to do anything!
:*If the framerate is 59.94fps, you have three options:
::*''Keep at the original framerate.'' Sometimes when you have a sports cap or something else with a high framerate, any framerate reduction leads to a jerky picture. In these cases, you can choose to keep the original framerate, which will be more bitrate intensive, but look better.
::*''Decimate to 23.976fps.'' If the video was originally a film, or some other video that started life as a 23.976fps video, you can return it to this framerate with TDecimate: ''tdecimate(mode=0,cycleR=9,cycle=15)''
::*''Decimate to 29.97fps.'' If your video began as 29.970fps, return it to that with the inbuild AviSynth command SelectEven: ''selecteven()''
|}

:{| style=&quot;background: #FFBFDF&quot;
|- 
|'''Interlaced / Telecined Source''' (i.e., 1080i captures)
:These sources are sources that contain interlaced frames. An interlaced source is a continuous stream of interlaced frames, while a telecined source has a mix of interlaced and progressive frames. You must process each format differently. You can read the article on [[/Detecting interlace|detecting interlace]] for more info on how to do that.
:*''If the stream is pure interlaced:'' You can deinterlace it with TDeint: ''tdeint()''
:*''If the stream is telecined:'' You can run an [[MeGUI/Glossary#IVTC|IVTC]] with TFM &amp; TDecimate: ''tfm().tdecimate()''
|}

===Cropping &amp; Resizing===
Cropping involves removing all black bars from the source. You must crop in multiples of 2. A simple way to work out the cropping is to open the video in MeGUI's [[MeGUI/Tools/Avisynth Script Creator|avisynth script creator]] and use the dynamic cropping tool in there. Then take the ''crop(...)'' line from the third tab and add it to your script. Note, you should crop out ''all'' the black edges, even if it means you must also slice off a pixel of video. The final result will be better for it.
Once you have done this, you need to resize the video. Add in a spline36 resize: ''spline36resize(1280,720)''. This will resize to a 16:9 [[MeGUI/Glossary#Aspect Ratio|aspect ratio]], if the original display ratio of the video was different you much change the 720 to suit. For example, a 2.35:1 AR video becomes 1280x544.

===Filtering===
If your source is mpeg2, use [http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?s=&amp;threadid=82217 colormatrix] to correct colors: ''colormatrix()''

==x264 encoding==
Firstly, download [http://mewiki.project357.com/files/x264cqm.zip this] collection of x264 matrices, and extract them wherever you want. Then start up MeGUI and load the input avs. Scroll through a few frames to make sure everything is ok (cropping at all points in the movie, no overfiltering, etc.), then close the preview window.
*'''Choose encoding profile:''' Choose your x264 encoding profile. Use one of the ''HQ-_____'' set (i.e. HQ-Slow, Slower, Slowest, Insane). Slower profiles give better results, but the quality gain reduces every time.
:*'''Verify 2pass:''' Open the codec config and check 'Automated 2pass' is selected, and 'turbo' is enabled. If your source is clean and free of grain, you can increase the deblock settings, but don't go higher than -1,-1 for a normal film. Click OK.
:*'''Set the custom matrix:''' On the fourth tab, set 'quantization matrix' to custom, and choose either ''eqm_avc-hr.cfg'' or ''M4G HRM V2.cfg''. The former is better when slightly bitrate starved, while the latter can get you close to transperancy.
*'''Calculate the bitrate:''' Go tools-&gt;bitrate calculator. First put in the output size (either use one of the presets or put the number in by hand). Next, set the correct bitrate for your audio track. Finally, make sure 'b-frames' is checked, the framerate is right (although both of these make little difference), and you have selected the right codec (x264) and container (mkv). Note down the average bitrate and click 'apply'. Check it has been correctly applied in the codec config.
*'''Setup the encoding jobs:''' If you have a spare 100gb on the drive you have your input script on, you can check the box 'add [[Glossary#Pre-rendering job|pre-rendering job]]'. Click 'enqueue'. The jobs should now be visible on the job tab.
*'''Start the encoding:''' On the jobs tab, click 'start'. Wait the 16-72hrs this step takes.

==Muxing the audio and video together==
*'''Download MKVMerge:''' Download MKVToolnix from its [http://www.bunkus.org/videotools/mkvtoolnix/downloads.html homepage]
*'''Select input files:''' Open mmg.exe, and add as sources both your encoded video and the original file that contains audio
*'''Choose output streams:''' Uncheck all streams that aren't required.
*'''Set output track options:''' Set languages for any audio / subtitle streams and if there are more than one, name them. If required, set the correct audio delay for any audio streams.
*'''Mux:''' Choose save location, and click ''start muxing''.

All done :)

----

There are various steps to encoding content using MeGUI, and these can be automated to different extents:

#For MPEG2 input, D2V creation is the first step. This is normally done using Tools-&gt;D2V Creator. The options are all self-explanatory. If you have multiple VOB files, select the first one, and the rest will be added later.
#For all video input, the next step is creating an AviSynth script. Go to Tools-&gt;AviSynth Script Creator to do this.
#*Set up cropping by pressing Auto Crop.
#*Press Analyse to determine what interlacing, if any, your source has. If your source is anime or cartoon-like, you should press 'Source is Anime' BEFORE you press Analyse.
#*Press Suggest Resolution to suggest a vertical resolution to match your horizontal resolution.
#*With all the other settings, a good rule is, 'If you don't know what something does, leave it at its default'. If you want to find out what something does/is, read up on it somewhere else.
#Calculate bitrate using Tools-&gt;Bitrate Calculator. This isn't required.
#Set up video input and settings and queue the video job (in the main window).
#Set up audio input and settings and queue the audio job (in the main window). This isn't necessary, as you could choose to keep your original audio, which would just mean adding it later, in the muxing stage.
#After encoding, mux the video with the audio using either the AVI muxer (only takes avi and mp3 input), the MP4 muxer (takes mp4, AAC, 264, m4v input), or the MKV muxer (takes just about anything as input).

See, there are quite a lot of steps. These can be automated, the tradeoff being between control and automation.

==Using AutoEncode==
:''Note: See [[/AutoEncode|AutoEncode]] for a more comprehensive guide''
Using AutoEncode means that steps 3-6 can be set up in one step, as opposed to multiple steps, with waiting in between. To use it:
*After you have done steps 1-2, go to the main window and select your video input that you '''want to encode. Set up the video encoding settings to whatever you choose. If you want to encode your audio (instead of keeping the original audio), then select your input files in the audio section, and configure the encoding settings. If you wish to keep your original audio, don't configure any audio in the main window.
*Press AutoEncode. This will open a new window where you can select the output format (determines which muxer to use) and the target filesize.          If you have a target filesize, then, after audio encoding (if there is any), MeGUI will calculate the required video bitrate to reach the target filesize. If you don't care about the filesize, then your best option would be to select 'No Target Size (use profile settings)'. This means that MeGUI will leave the bitrate/QP/CRF to whatever you set up in the main window.
*If you have original audio that you want to mux at the end, or you have subtitles or chapters that you want to mux, check 'Add additional content'. A muxing window will open when you press Queue. In it, you just configure the correct input files for whatever you want.
*Press Queue, and you now have your jobs in the queue in the main window



==Using the One Click Encoder==
:''Note: For a more comprehensive guide to One Click Encoder, go [[/One Click Encoder|here.]]''
The OneClick Encoder can automate steps 1-6. This means that you can select your input, configure settings (optional, as it chooses defaults anyway), press go, and leave your computer to come back when it is finished. To use this tool:
*Create some audio and video profiles which contain the settings you want to use for encoding (required).
*Go to Tools-&gt;One Click Profile Setup. (recommended, but not required. Likewise for step 3)
*Just as there are video, audio and AviSynth profiles, there are OneClick profiles. Here you can configure the settings that the One Click Encoder chooses by default, and you can group different sets of settings by naming them with different profiles. It is recommended that you create your profiles here, so as to save reconfiguring the One Click Encoder every time you use it, however, this configuration is not required. All the options in this window are also in the One Click Window, so they will be explained further down.
*Go to Tools-&gt;One Click Encoder. Use the '...' button to select your input file. Like the D2V creator, if you have multiple VOB files, just select the first one, and the rest will be added later.
**If it comes up with a message warning you about a missing Stream Information.txt file, then don't worry. This file is used by MeGUI to name the audio streams. Since it is missing, you will just have to select your track numbers (typically track 1, or track 1 and track 2).
**Now that the input is selected, everything else is ready to go, but the configuration may not be what you desire. An explanation of the options is below. Feel free to skip it.

***The output file is just that: the completed output file
***The audio tracks allow you to choose which audio tracks from the VOB you want (these will either be encoded, or the original audio muxed at the end).
***The playback method combobox shows the profiles we configured in step 2.
***The filesize has the target filesize, just like the AutoEncode method. Also like AutoEncoding, you can choose a target filesize of &quot;Don't Care&quot;, which will use the settings configured in your video profile instead.
***In the Advanced Config tab, the Working Directory is where all the intermediate files will be put.
***The output resolution lets you configure the HORIZONTAL output resolution. The vertical resolution will be adjusted accordingly.
***The Aspect Ratio (AR) should have been correctly set automatically. If it failed, it will be set to Auto-Detect Later. There isn't really much point in changing this, unless it has been signalled incorrectly in your source (unlikely).
***Check Signal AR to keep the full resolution and signal the required stretching factor with the video.
***The AVS profile is the AviSynth profile that will be used for script generation. If you are familiar with AviSynth, you can play around with this in the AviSynth Script Creator. There is a brief explanation of how the AviSynth profiles work at the end. If you are not familiar with AviSynth, leave it at Default Profile.
***Automatic Deinterlacing automatically detects the source, and inserts the best deinterlacing filter accordingly. This is recommended
***The Other comboboxes are self-explanatory.
***The Don't Encode Audio checkbox means that the original audio will be muxed at the end.
** Press Go to set up the jobs. You are finished

==A note about AVC Hardware (iPod, etc) and AVC Levels==
There are now some hardware devices which support AVC video (like the iPod, PSP). The AVC standard includes something called levels, which defines a way of categorising how much processing power is required to decode a stream. This is useful for low-power applications like the iPod. In the x264 codec configuration, there is a box which allows the level to be set. Enforcing this level could mean limits on the allowed resolution. MeGUI will tell you what changes need to be made to enforce that level if you go Tools-&gt;Validate AVC Level. You can then make the changes. Alternatively, if you have a level set and you use the One Click Encoder, if your chosen resolution is too high for the level, it will find the highest resolution that satisfies the level, and use that.

The upshot of this note means that if you want to make a Hardware-compatible encode, you should download the relevant profile by Sharktooth and use that. If there is a level set, then you can just use this with the One Click Encoder, or you could generate your own script manually and see if it qualifies.

==AviSynth audio==
AviSynth-based audio uses AviSynth for audio decoding and filtering, just like the video section uses AviSynth. However, at this point in time, AviSynth-based audio behaves in a very similar way to BeSweet-based audio, inside MeGUI. They even share the same dialog box. The process for encoding via AviSynth is still the same. For those who don't know it, here's a quick summary:

# Open your input (can be any playable audio file, or can be your already-written AviSynth audio file.
# Click config to configure your decoder. To use AviSynth-based encoding, make sure that 'Encode via AviSynth' is ticked. Configure the rest of your settings in the way you see fit.
# Press ok to leave the config window, and press queue to queue the audio job. It will run like any other job

==AviSynth templates==
AviSynth templates are a flexible way of inserting custom filters while retaining some of the automation that MeGUI provides. Of course, you should only play with these if you are familiar with AviSynth, or else you could run into a lot of trouble with broken scripts.

The idea behind the AviSynth profiles is that, for most AviSynth processing, large amounts of your filter-chain will remain the same, while some parts will have to be source-specific (like loading the input, cropping, etc). The way MeGUI manages both parts of this, then, is to allow you to outline the basic structure of the script, then it configures the source-specific values.

How it actually works:

# You write a template script.
# When MeGUI needs to generate the actual AviSynth script, it loads the template script and it replaces &lt;resize&gt; with the correct resize filter, &lt;denoise&gt; with the correct denoise filter, &lt;crop&gt; with the correct cropping values, and so on for &lt;input&gt; and &lt;deinterlace&gt;. Everything else, it leaves the way it is (don't worry about remembering those keywords; MeGUI has buttons to insert them for you).


That's all that MeGUI does. Now let me give an example. Suppose you have this SUPER FABULOUS TEN-TIMES-BETTER-THAN-ANYTHING-ELSE deinterlacer, but MeGUI doesn't support it. Not to worry, here's what you do: copy and modify the default profile, which looks like
 &lt;input&gt;
 &lt;deinterlace&gt;
 &lt;crop&gt;
 &lt;resize&gt;
 &lt;denoise&gt;
and make a new profile like this:
 &lt;input&gt;
 MySuperDeinterlacer()
 &lt;crop&gt;
 &lt;resize&gt;
 &lt;denoise&gt;

Now, when generating the script, MeGUI won't insert its own deinterlacer, but it will leave yours there. Here's an example of what might be the result:
 mpeg2source(&quot;Yoursource.d2v&quot;)
 MySuperDeinterlacer()
 crop(10,24,-88,-20)
 lanczosresize(320,240)
 #denoise
Notice that the denoise is commented out. This is what happens if the user chooses there not to be any denoising. The same goes for all the optional filters.

If you want to add a postprocessor, just add a filter at the end. You get the point.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==SRT==
'''S'''ub'''R'''ip'''T'''ext. Made a while ago by a frenchy, it is a very basic text based subtitle format. Allows for simple hex coloring, bold and italic flags. It is a very bare simple format, however, it does allow the user to select a font, font size, or override the font color/outline during playback, Assuming VSFilter is used to play the subs.

Code sample (thank you [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SubRip wikipedia]):

 In connection with a dramatic increase
 in crime in certain neighbourhoods,

==SSA==
'''S'''ub'''S'''tation '''A'''lpha. A rather old format which was developed out of the need for a powerful digital subtitle format, it was used extensively by fansubbers. Development ended with SSAv4 many years ago upon the disappearance of the developer and was succeeded by ASS (SSAv4+). Allows lots of cool stuff, including:
*Defining bold, italic, font type, font size, font color, font encoding type, and alignment (very basic positioning) of the text.
*Styles are used to easily group together lines of text to use the same &quot;style.&quot; They specify all of the above as well as outline width, shadow depth, outline/shadow color, and margins.
*Basic karaoke effects.
*Because each line has its own timestamp and positioning is allowed, multiple lines of text can be show on screen
Style and Code sample:
 Style: Default,Arial,40,16777215,16777215,16777215,-2147483640,-1,0,1,1,1,2,30,30,25,0,0
 Dialogue: Marked=0,0:25:50.40,0:25:53.06,*Default,Comment,0000,0000,0000,,Kakarrot-o!!

==ASS==
'''A'''dvanced'''S'''ub'''S'''tation Alpha, which is referred to as SSAv4+ in the specifications of the format, is where the major improvements were made. Most people do not realize the difference between SSA and ASS because the same filter, TextSub/VSFilter, has been the prime renderer of the format. As such, override codes which are ASS only can be used in a SSA script when rendered by TextSub/VSFilter. This among other things has lead to a large blurring of the two formats. However the documentation of SSA as well as the ASS revisions can be found [http://web.archive.org/20040525123029/moodub.free.fr/ass-specs.doc here]. Since the developer of SSA disappeared, the primary uses of the format was anime fansubbing. However many of the fansubbers needed the format to grow even more powerful, and thus SSAv4+ was proposed which then became known as ASS. The following advancements over SSA were made:
*Can define the text for underline, strikeout, border width and shadow depth (only available in styles before), blurred edges, font scaling in the x and y axis, define spacing between letters, rotation of text, outline and shadow colors (only available in styles before), and alpha transparency.
*Huge assortment of functions which allow for the font to be transformed over time through styles or override codes, movable text, exact pixel positioning, define the origin of text, and fading.
*Karaoke is rebuffed, somehow
*Styles are updated for the new options

There were also a few other parts of the SSA/ASS documentation which just never implemented into VobSub/VSFilter. The only one to note is embedded pictures. Which would essentially cross the barrier of text and image based subtitles in one format. However this never came to be.

Style and Code sample:
 Style: Batou,Century Gothic,28,&amp;H00C0C0C0,&amp;H00000000,&amp;H00000000,&amp;H7F000000,0,0,0,0,100,100,0,0,1,1,1,2,10,10,10,0
 Dialogue: 0,0:13:00.11,0:13:03.77,Batou,,0000,0000,0000,,Both our faces aren't meant for mirrors.

==VobSub==
The name should be taken literally as to where these subtitles come from. VobSub is the name of the format for bitmap subs '''after''' they have been extracted from a VOB, '''V'''ideo '''Ob'''ject file, on a DVD. The application which extracted the subtitles was also called VobSub (now known as VSRip) was developed by Gabest. VobSubs consist of an .idx file (the index of starting timestamps, colors, and other basic info) and a .sub file (which contains the bitmap pictures for the subtitles themselves). Unlike SRT, SSA, ASS, and TTXT which are Text based formats VobSubs are image based, and thus usually somewhat larger.

Index code and bitmap sample:
 timestamp: 00:18:40:752, filepos: 0000aa000
 [[Image:Vobsub sample.PNG|Raw picture of a bitmap in a VobSub]]

==TTXT==
MPEG-4 '''T'''imed '''T'''e'''xt'''. Based off the subtitle format created by 3GPP (in which case they are exactly alike). Looks alot like XML madness. Of interest is the fact that it seems a line must defined for all times, meaning when there are no subtitles to be displayed, a blank line must be inserted. Sample:
 &lt;TextSample sampleTime=&quot;00:03:35.980&quot; xml:space=&quot;preserve&quot;&gt;Please excuse me.&lt;/TextSample&gt;

Note this does not neccessarily match up with the capabilities your CPU has. On some chips, x264 won't use a certain instruction set as it is actually slower.

Information on the h264 profile and level for the stream. The profile is implied by the options used (eg, B-frames implies at least main profile, 8x8dct implies at least high profile) and is given here for information only. The level is a number written into the bitstream. You can either explicitly set the level you want with --level, or not do so and let x264 guess (reasonably accurately).

For each of the three macroblock types (I,P,B), show what percentage of partitions within are either I or the native type of partitions (which is P for P MBs and B for B MBs). The three numbers for I partitions represent 16x16, 8x8 and 4x4. For P/B partitions, the five numbers represent 16x16, 16x8/8x16, 8x8, 8x4/4x8 and 4x4.

Skip shows the number of macroblocks using the skip vector without residual, while Direct shows the number of MBs using the skip vector ''with'' a residual. &lt;small&gt;What is the skip vector? It's very very complicated.&lt;/small&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Tips==
* Don't use x264 as a replacement for a denoising filter. Make sure your input looks like what you want as output (ignoring the loss in quality from compression). Doing anything else causes x264 to run less efficiently.
* If you aren't seeing 100% usage while encoding, remember the problem may lie with your input. Avisynth is single-threaded (usually), and so is often the bottleneck in multicore systems.

==Commandline Suggestions==
x264 has a lot of options, each with its own speed/quality tradeoff curve. Sometimes there is almost no reason to ever disable an option ([[MeGUI/x264 Settings#8x8dct|8x8dct]]), other times there is almost no reason to use an option ([[MeGUI/x264 Settings#me|me tesa]]). It's easy to build a commandline, but hard to build one that has well balanced options.

For this reason, I recommend using (at least as a base) Sharktooth's profiles. Sharktooth publishes an excellent set of [[MeGUI]] x264 profiles located [https://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=139765 here].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Basic Info==
This section deals with downloading, installing and configuring the required programs correctly.

== Required Programs ==
* MeGUI. For guide on installing MeGUI, read the instructions [[MeGUI/Installation|here]].
* Any DirectShow filter (or &quot;Codec Pack&quot;) that can decode the source file format. There are a few free codec packs:
** The '''K-Lite Codec Pack''' is a complete solution of decoding the majority of files. It contains some more video and audio processing features comparing to the CCCP. Please visit [http://www.codecguide.com/about_kl.htm] for more information.
** The '''CCCP''' is a codec pack that installs a minimal set of filters that decode the vast majority of files (see [http://www.cccp-project.net/wiki/index.php?title=FAQ#What_exactly_can_the_CCCP_play.3F] for more info).
* '''DVD Decrypter:''' DVD Decrypter is the program used to rip the raw DVD data off your DVD. The last available version is 3.5.4.0 and decrypts the vast majority of available DVDs. [http://www.dvddecrypter.org.uk Download here].

==Program Setup==
*''' MeGUI:''' MeGUI requires no additional setup after you have fully updated it. By default, it will prompt you to update whenever there is one.
*''' DVD Decrypter:''' Once installed, set the program mode to IFO mode (mode-&gt;IFO) and open up the settings (tools menu). Under the &quot;IFO Mode&quot; tab, set splitting to none and check the box to create OGG format chapters as well as Stream information.

&lt;noinclude&gt;'''Once you've done this, proceed to the next section: [[MeGUI/Guides/Basic_Guide/Ripping|ripping the DVD]].'''

== Basic information ==
This is a guide for installing MeGUI.

== Prerequisites ==
* The MeGUI zip file which you can download at its [http://sourceforge.net/projects/megui/ Sourceforge project page].
*''' Microsoft .NET framework 2.0:''' This is a free Microsoft update around 20mb in size available from Windows Update or the [http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyID=0856EACB-4362-4B0D-8EDD-AAB15C5E04F5&amp;displaylang=en Microsoft website].
*''' Avisynth:''' This is a separate program that is used to do editing of video through the writing of scripts. Download the latest stable version from its [http://sourceforge.net/projects/avisynth2 Sourceforge project page].

== Installation ==
* Install Microsoft .NET framework and Avisynth if you have not.
* Extract all the files in the zip file to a seperate folder and launch MeGUI.exe.
* Go to ''Options'' -&gt; ''Update'' and make sure you have all the latest versions of packages.

=== Nero AAC Encoder ===
The optional freeware Nero AAC encoder is the only AAC encoder MeGUI supports. If you planned to use AAC encoding, you have install this:
* Go to {{URL|http://www.nero.com/enu/company/about-nero/nero-aac-codec.php|Nero website}}. After reading through the End-User License Agreement, download the file into the MeGUI folder you just created.
* Extract the neroAacEnc.exe in the win32 folder of the zip file and copy it to tools\eac3to folder in the MeGUI directory.
* Launch MeGUI.exe, go to ''Options'' -&gt; ''Settings'' -&gt; ''External Program Configuration'', and check ''Enable NeroAacEnc''. For the ''Location'', select the neroAacEnc.exe you just copied to the &quot;tools\eac3to&quot; directory.

This section deals with two actions:
* Extracting &amp; decrypting ('ripping') the raw data off the DVD
* Demultiplexing (demuxing) the audio streams from the resulting file and creating an index file for the video data. 
==Ripping the DVD==
* Start up '''DVD Decrypter''' and choose your DVD drive in the drop down box.
* Choose IFO (InFomatiOn file) in 'Mode'.
* Select the PGC (ProGram Chain) that matches the length of your movie (may be auto-selected): 
* Choose your save location
* Click the Rip button. Once this process completes you will be left with:
:* One large vob file (the video and audio data),
::* If you didn't set DVD Decrypter to create only one VOB file, you will end up with a number of 1gb sized VOBs. Just use the first one for the next step.
:* An ifo file (part of the DVD file structure),
:* The OGG format chapter file (open it up to see how the chapters are stored),
:* A stream information file (with information on the audio and video streams in the vob).

==Demuxing the audio and creating the d2v index==
* Start up '''MeGUI'''
* Go Tools -&gt; File Indexer
* Select the .vob file from DVD Decrypter as the Video Input
* Choose &quot;all audio tracks&quot; under &quot;audio demux&quot;
* Choose the location to save the d2v file to
* Click &quot;queue&quot;, then wait for the indexer to complete.
* Go back to the main screen and click on the tab. Click the button to create the d2v.

This section deals with encoding the audio into its final format (which is up to you to decide) with the MeGUI audio encoder.

==Creating the input file==
There are three options for creating an input file. All will work, you can choose whichever you prefer:
* '''Use the audio file as direct input:''' For supported audio files (ac3, mp2, mp3 and a few other formats), you can directly select these files to be used as input.
* '''Create a new AviSynth script to use as input:''' The audio encoder dialog also supports audio from avs files. You can create a new avs file which can load the required audio with the following line (assuming you have the required decoders)
 directshowsource(&quot;path\to\file.wmv&quot;,audio=true)

==Encoding the Audio==
* On the first page of '''MeGUI''' click the [...] button next to &quot;audio input&quot;. Browse to the audio file and open it
* You now have to choose which audio format to use. Here is a quick rundown of the advantages of each format. Formats that are not recommended have been greyed out:

:* &lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:grey&quot;&gt;'''Aften AC3:''' An encoder for DVD format audio. Don't use this encoder - if you want to have an AC3 stream, simply use the version that was demuxed from the original DVD and skip any audio encoding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
:* &lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:grey&quot;&gt;'''FAAC:''' Another AAC encoder, not-very-good quality output. Use Nero AAC instead. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
:* &lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:grey&quot;&gt;'''FFmpeg AC3:''' Another encoder for DVD format audio. Don't use this encoder - if you want to have an AC3 stream, simply use the version that was demuxed from the original DVD and skip any audio encoding.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
:* &lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:grey&quot;&gt;'''FFmpeg MP2:''' Very similar to MP3, gives slightly better quality at bitrates above 256kbits (some say 192kbits), but not by a large amount, and bitrates that large aren't recommended.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
:* &lt;small&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color:grey&quot;&gt;'''Flac:''' A lossless audio codec.  Produce large file.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;
:* '''LAME MP3:''' The oldest and most common audio format. Can be played on all Windows computers, but gives the lowest audio quality out of all formats (which is still reasonable). ABR is recommended. In MeGUI, this is encoded with LAME, which does incredibly well on such an old format.
:* '''Nero AAC:''' Nero AAC encoder. AAC is probably the equal highest quality format available for stereo files (ties with Vorbis). Variable bitrate (VBR) is recommended.
:* '''Vorbis:''' Free and open-source, often called 'ogg' (ogg is the filename extension and container format, Vorbis is the audio format).

* For more information on Audio formats, check out the [[MeGUI/Computer_movie_files#Common_Audio_Formats|computer movie files]] page.
* Once you have chosen your audio format (if in doubt, stick with MP3).
* For a normal movie, 128kbits is usually used. This corresponds to approximately q3 for vorbis files. For concerts or movies where you want a higher audio quality, you can increase this value up to 160 (q5 for vorbis) - any higher is probably a waste.
* Once you have chosen your bitrate, click the 'enqueue' button, move over to the tab and click  to start the job:

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Basic Info==
This section is divided into three sub-sections:
* Creating the Avisynth script file for the video
* Calculating the bitrate for the video
* Encoding the video
==Creating the AviSynth file==
* Open up '''MeGUI''' and start the ''avisynth script creator'' from the tools menu
* Set your d2v file as the video input
* If &quot;Input DAR&quot; ratio is a different ratio to the aspect ratio of the preview window, it means the DVD is anamorphic. You can either resize to a non-anamorphic resolution, or keep the video anamorphic by checking the &quot;anamorphic&quot; button. If you encode anamorphic, the video will be stretched on playback to maintain correct Aspect Ratio
&lt;small&gt;
:A little info on the three anamorphic modes:
:* &quot;Resize to mod16&quot; will only resize the video if the width or height are not equally divisible by 16.
:* &quot;Overcrop to achieve mod16&quot; do the same as above, but instead of resizing, the video will be cropped.
:* &quot;Encode non mod16&quot; will not resize or crop the video, but if the resolution is not mod16, the compressibility of the video will suffer. This loss is basically negligible unless you are going for extremely high quality encoding.
&lt;/small&gt;
* If the video has black bars around the edge, you should crop them with the tool.
* If you want to resize your video, check &quot;suggest resolution&quot; and change to the resolution you want. If you want the highest quality file, do not resize.
* Flip over to the second tab. Under deinterlacing, check the &quot;source is anime&quot; box if your source is anime or cartoon, then click the analyse button. The analyser will make one or two passes to determine the optimal filter. Choose whichever option it gives you for deinterlacer.
* Choose your resize filter. Use spline36 unless you know why you should use another.
* Enable denoising and pick the appropriate level. Denoising reduces noise, which makes the image look better (less flickering) and compress better (less flickering = lower complexity). Always enable at least minimal. Medium &amp; High denoising should be used sparingly.
* Use MPEG2 deblocking only if there is noticeable blocking in the source. Very few DVDs need this.
* Save the avs (it should automatically load into MeGUI once you do this) and proceed to the next section.

==Calculating the bitrate==
* If your avs file is not loaded, load it now (by clicking the [...] button next to &quot;Avisynth script&quot;).
* Open the bitrate calculator in tools. Once it opens, MeGUI should automatically fill in the information such as length and framerate.
* Choose the format and container that your final video file will be in
* Choose your final desired size (&quot;total size&quot;)
* Click the &quot;select&quot; button in the Audio 1 area and select the audio file you created.
* The required video bitrate should appear in the lower right corner, write this number down and click apply.
* For more information on the Bitrate Calculator click [[MeGUI/Tools/Bitrate Calculator|here]].

==Encoding the video==
* You should already have the avs video file loaded into MeGUI - if not, load it now (click the top [...] button).
* You have two options for choosing the video format to encode in: XviD and x264. It is beyond the scope of this document to give a large discussion of the differences between these two formats. Suffice to say:
:* XviD is a very popular encoding format - it is used almost exclusively for 'scene' TV and movie rips. It use the MPEG-4 Part 2 or ASP standard. It has been around for a long time and offers a reasonable level of quality for filesize. You can compare it to mp3 in many respects.
:* x264 is a 'new' codec. It use the MPEG-4 Part 10(H.264) or AVC standard. Both new disc formats (HD-DVD and Blu-Ray) will support x264 encoded files, and it looks set to become the successor to XviD. It has not yet reached a large level of support yet, although support and use is constantly growing. It gives better quality than XviD, especially at bitrates under 1500kbits or so. 
* To encode in XviD:
:* Select your codec as 'XviD: *scratchpad*', and choose your container as AVI
:* Click the config button
:* On the first page:
::* Set mode to &quot;automated 2pass&quot; and check &quot;turbo&quot;
::* Set your bitrate to the figure you got from the bitrate calculator
::* Set the keyframe interval to ten times the framerate (which you got from DGIndex)
::* Set the VHQ mode to 4. 
:* Click OK 
* To encode in x264:
:* Select your codec as 'x264: *scratchpad*, and choose your container as MP4
:* Click the config button
:* On the first page:
::* Choose the preset as what you want. Faster the preset, lower the quality. I personally recommend Slower, you only run the encode once and the quality will stay forever.
::* Set mode to &quot;automated 2pass&quot;.
::* Set your bitrate to the figure you got from the bitrate calculator 
:* Click OK 

* Click the 'Queue' button, move over to the tab and click to start the job.


&lt;noinclude&gt;'''Once you've done this you will need to wait for all the audio and video encoding to finish before you move onto the last step, which is [[MeGUI/Guides/Basic_Guide/Muxing|muxing]] the files together.'''

      <text xml:space="preserve">The MeGUI bitrate calculator is an extremely versatile calculator. It can give video bit rates for all the video types that MeGUI produces and can take differing containers, audio input codec, b-frames and so on into account.

The calculator is divided into four logical sections: Video, Audio, Output, and Result. It's easiest to go through the calculator in that order too.

The bitrate calculator only updates when you click a button or press enter, so that it doesn't get confused by half-entered values. Because of this, if you manually insert a value, you will need to press enter or click a button (such as increasing something by one and then decreasing it) for the calculation to refresh.

Note: The M2TS calculation is a Work in Progress. Also, the quality estimate may require further refinement.

[[File:MeGUI Bitrate Calculator.png|thumbnail|Screenshot of Bitrate Calculator.]]

== Video ==
The video section allows you to choose the video properties, such as time and frame rate. These options will be automatically filled in if you load your AVS script first.
* '''Hours / Minutes / Seconds:''' You can use these boxes to input the length of your video. If you have an AviSynth script open in the video section of the main window the time for it will already be imported, as will be the frame rate.
* '''Total Length in Seconds (hidden):''' Click the clock to switch to this mode (and unhide) to input the length of your movie as seconds.
* '''Framerate:'''The frame rate of your video.
* '''Number of frames:''' If your video is variable frame rate or you will be using a non-standard framerate, you can simply enter the number of frames here instead. The bitrate calculator bases the rest of the calculations on the value in this box.
* '''Codec:''' Choose the video codec as some codecs require different amounts of overhead.  The codec can also affect the quality estimate.
* '''B-frames:''' If your video will contain b-frames you should check this box. B-frames add a very small amount of overhead - usually it has a difference of under 1kbit/second, but it will still produce a more accurate result.

== Audio ==
The audio and extras section allows you to specify any number audio streams or extra data to be accounted for in the muxing process. An extra may be a subtitle or embedded menu data.

* '''Select:''' If you have already encoded your audio you can select it with this button to use the exact size of the file and get a more accurate result. This method will automatically select the correct type for you.
* '''Type:''' Choose the type of audio you will be using.  Usually variable bitrate audio requires extra overhead.
* '''Bitrate:''' If you have not yet encoded the audio you can specify the expected/nominal bitrate here as well as the format you will be using with the ' 'Type'' dropdown menu.
* '''Add''' and '''remove:''' You can add additional streams like subtitles and other audio streams to calculate.

== Container ==
* '''Container:''' The container used will have a large effect on the final bitrate, different containers mixed with different audio and video formats will require different amounts of overhead. The containers present here are determined by mux path finding.

== Calculate By ==
This section allows you to calculate the video bitrate and total file size. Depending on what you calculate by, the other values will be calculated for you. You can switch between these modes of operation by clicking the radio buttons.

* '''Video Bitrate:''' Choose the average video bitrate, simple enter it into the box.
* '''Bits Per Pixel:''' Choose the amount of video data used for each pixel.  The BPP value is not very useful because the compressibility of video can vary greatly.
* '''Quality Estimate:''' Choose the estimated quality of the video calculated using a combination of BPP, complexity, and video codec.  Because the compressibility of video can vary greatly, this value is just an estimate.
* '''Total File Size:''' Choose from the many common sizes that are stored in the list. You can quickly load a preset or choose a custom value.

If your result is an average bitrate, you can apply it to the current video config by clicking ''Apply''.

In this step the audio &amp; video are muxed together with chapters if desired.
== Muxing The Final File ==
* Open the ''adaptive muxer'' in the tools menu under 'muxers'
* Select the video file you encoded as the video input. The name field is optional.
* Do the same for the audio.
* You can add the chapters file that was demuxed by DVD Decrypter too if you want, it will work for mp4 and mkv files.
* Choose the container format
* Choose the output filename.
* Click the 'queue' button, move over to the tab and click to start the job.

This section deals with downloading, installing and configuring the required programs correctly.

== Required Programs ==
* MeGUI. For guide on installing MeGUI, read the instructions [[MeGUI/Installation|here]].
* Any DirectShow filter (or &quot;Codec Pack&quot;) that can decode the source file format. There are a few free codec packs:
** The '''K-Lite Codec Pack''' is a complete solution of decoding the majority of files. It contains some more video and audio processing features comparing to the CCCP. Please visit [http://www.codecguide.com/about_kl.htm] for more information.
** The CCCP is a codec pack that installs a minimal set of filters that decode the vast majority of files (see [http://www.cccp-project.net/wiki/index.php?title=FAQ#What_exactly_can_the_CCCP_play.3F] for more info).

== Program Setup ==
*''' MeGUI:''' MeGUI requires no additional setup after you have fully updated it. By default, it will prompt you to update whenever there is one.

This section covers encoding the audio to reach an iPod compatible standard.

==Setting up your iPod Profile==
[[File:MeGUI iPod encoding audio config box.png|thumbnail|right|The items needed attention are in red boxes.]]
We are going to add an iPod profile to simplify future encoding for MeGUI.
* In the main window of '''MeGUI''' go to the audio section. In the Drop down list that is labelled &quot;Codec&quot;, choose '''&quot;Nero AAC: *scratchpad*&quot;'''. Click &quot;Config&quot;.
* Set your settings like the ones shown on the right.
** In '''&quot;Output channels&quot;''', select '''&quot;Downmix Multichannel to stereo&quot;'''.
** Select '''&quot;Constant Bitrate&quot;'''. Set the slider to '''&quot;320kbit/s&quot;'''.
** Set the AAC profile to '''AAC-LC'''
* Click &quot;New&quot;. Type &quot;iPod Profile&quot;. Click &quot;OK&quot;

==Encoding the Audio==
All modern iPods supports AAC audio, and it is the best audio codec that MeGUI supports encoding to. We have to use the Nero AAC encoder as it is the only AAC encoder available in MeGUI.
* On the first page of '''MeGUI''' click the [...] button next to audio input. Browse for your input file and open it.
* Click the [...] button next to audio output. Remember the location of the file as it will be used later.
* Select your iPod Profile in the profiles drop down list.
* When you are ready, click '''Queue'''.

&lt;noinclude&gt;

This section will walkthrough the encoding of an iPod-compatible video file using either Xvid or x264.
You can't just use any settings to encode for the iPod, there are limits as it is a portable device and not capable of everything. Here's a table of the more generic restrictions.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|+ iPod touch (4th generation) video specifications [http://support.apple.com/kb/SP594]
|-
! !! [[MeGUI/Computer movie files#MPEG-4 AVC|MPEG-4 AVC]] !! [[MeGUI/Computer movie files#MPEG-4 ASP|MPEG-4 ASP]]
|-
! Bitrate 
| No restriction || 25000 kbps
|-
! Frame rate
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;|30 fps
|-
! Profile
| Main @ 3.1 || Simple
|-
! Max resolution (pixels)
| 1280 by 720 || 640 by 480
|-
! Max 4:3 resolution (pixels)
| 960 by 720 || 640 by 480
|-
! Max 16:9 resolution (pixels)
| 1280 by 720 || 640 by 360
|-
! Container
| colspan=&quot;2&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;|.m4v, .mp4, or .mov
|}
According to the table, AVC support is significantly better than ASP, so you are encouraged to use AVC.

Note: In your AVS file you will need to resize your video to iPod Standards. You can go below these standards if you like, but '''not''' above.

== x264 Preset Setup ==
[[File:MeGUI iPod encoding x264 options.png|thumbnail|Setting up presets.]]
We will set up an encoding preset for convenience.

* Open '''MeGUI''' to its main window.
* Select '''x264: *scratchpad*''' in the codec drop down list. Click &quot;Config&quot;.
* Under '''Target Playback Device''', select '''iPhone 4, iPad 1/2, iPod touch 4/5''' in the drop down list.
* Click &quot;New&quot; under &quot;Presets&quot;, type in &quot;iPod&quot;.

==Encoding==
Once you have finished creating your presets, you can use them!
Return to the MeGUI main window.

* Select your '''Video Profile''' first. Use '''x264: iPod''' for '''X264''' output.
* Open your AVS script if you have it, and create if not.
** When you are creating the AVS script, you '''must''' resize it to 1280 lines, or your iPod will not play it.
* Now, select '''RAWAVC''' for your container.
* Calculate your bitrate using Bitrate Calculator. Click &quot;Yes&quot; when asked if you want to copy calculated bitrate into video settings.
* Check that the input AVS script is OK with your iPod. Go to '''Tools''' -&gt; '''AVC Levels Checker'''.
** If it outputs '''&quot;This file matches the criteria&quot;''', then you are good and click &quot;OK&quot;.
** If it outputs other things, then there's something wrong. Make sure your source file is less than or equal to 1280 px by 720 px, or make another AVS script using the &quot;Resize&quot; feature in AVS creator.
* Finally, select your Video Output location. Remember that your encoded video will have an extension of &quot;.264&quot;.
* Click '''Queue'''.

'''Once you've done this you will need to wait for all the audio and video encoding to finish before you move onto the last step, which is [[MeGUI/Guides/iPod_Conversion_Guide/Muxing|muxing]] the files together.'''

==Basic Info==
This will cover the requirements of muxing a iPod capable MP4 file with an audio stream, a video stream, and an optional chapter stream.

==Muxing==
* Open MeGUI. Click '''Tools'''. Scroll down to '''Muxer'''. Click '''MP4 Muxer'''.
* Under video input, browse for your encoded &quot;.264&quot; video file. Leave the '''Name''' section blank for safety.
* Under audio input, browse for your encoded &quot;.mp4&quot; audio file.
* Under chapters, you can add your optional chapter file.
* Under output, select your target device in &quot;Device type&quot; (iPod or iPhone).
* Scroll down to '''Muxed Output'''. Select your file destination. Click '''Queue'''.

When you are done, load the file into iTunes and transfer it to your iPod. Happy Viewing!

Detecting the interlace type of a video stream can be difficult at first, but there are a number of tools to make it easier for you.

==MeGUI interlace analyser==
This is the recommended method for determining the interlace type.

The MeGUI analyser can be found in the avisynth creator. Open the video file, move across to the second tab and there is the interlace detector. All you need to do is click &quot;Analyse...&quot;, but you should check the box labelled ''source is anime'', if it applies to you. Once it has finished, it will pop up its findings and recommended filters to produce a progressive output.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The MeGUI AviSynth script creator is used to create the AVS file which will supply the data to the video encoder to be encoded. It provides a standardised way to load any type of video into one program, as well as process it in various ways. The AVS creator provides a frontend to create the AVS script for you.

==Page 1: Options==
[[Image:Megui scriptcreator1.png|200px|right]]
Basic input and processing.
*'''Video Input:''' Load the video source you want to use as input.
*'''Re-open original video player''': Reopen MeGUI's video preview window.
*'''Video DAR:''' Set the input [[MeGUI/Glossary#DAR|DAR]]. MeGUI mostly detects this correctly.
*'''Clever (TM) Anamorphic Encoding:''' Checking this box will enable [[MeGUI/Glossary#Anamorphic|anamorphic encoding]]. There are three methods to encode anamorphic video with MeGUI:
:* ''Resize to mod16:'' Video is cropped as requested, then resized to [[MeGUI/Computer movie files/Video/Mod16|mod16]] dimensions.
:* ''Overcrop to achieve mod16:'' Video is cropped by at least the requested numbers. Extra cropping is done so the final video is mod16.
:* ''Encode non mod16:'' Video is cropped as requested, then resized as requested.
*'''AVS Profile:''' You can load an [[Avisynth profile]] here. AVS profiles are templates used when by the AVS Script Creator. Their use should be reasonably self-explanatory if you know enough to touch them.
*'''Crop:''' 'Cut' the sides off the input video, in case there are black borders. MeGUI will graphically the cropping if the video preview window has not been updated since it was opened.
*'''Resize:''' Resize the video. Resizing is only allowed to multiples of 16, and when reducing the resolution. See [[MeGUI/FAQ#My_logs_say_my_video_is_not_divisible_by_16.2C_should_I_be_worried.3F|these]] [[MeGUI/Glossary#Upscaling_Video|two]] pages for information on why these restrictions exist.
==Page 2: Filters==
[[Image:Megui scriptcreator2.png|200px|right]]
Deinterlacing and other filtering.
*'''Deinterlacing:''' Choose what deinterlacing (if any) should be applied.
:*If you know the video type already, set the 'Source Type' and choose appropriate deinterlacing.
:*If you don't know the video type, click 'Analyse' (make sure 'source is anime' is ticked if appropriate). MeGUI will make a (virtually always) accurate guess as to the source type and suggest filtering.
*'''Resize Filter:''' Choose the resizer algorithm. Generally, spline36 is a good choice.
*'''Noise Filter:''' The noise filter adds one of four predefined noise reducing scripts to the AVS file. The noise reductions go all the way from undot() to Convolution3D(&quot;movielq&quot;).
*'''MPEG2 Deblocking:''' Should only be enabled for very blocky MPEG-2 sources, which generally means ''not'' on DVDs, such as the following:
*'''Colour Correction:''' Automatically added with .d2v sources. Colour correction for DVDs and other MPEG2 files ensures the video has the right colours.
*'''Framerate:''' Required only if MeGUI cannot auto-detect it.
*'''Vertical Flip'''

==Page 3: Manual Script Editing==
[[Image:Megui scriptcreator3.png|200px|right]]

==Options on all pages==
The options down the bottom of every page:
*'''On save close and load to be encoded:''' When this is checked, immediately after saving the AVS creator will be closed and the AVS loaded into MeGUI ready for you to set up video encoding options.
*'''Preview:''' Clicking this will refresh the video preview window. Be aware this causes a problem when cropping, as detailed above.
*'''Save:''' Saves the AVS.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Organisatoric Pages ==

I prefer talk pages for discussion. This page will count as a chapter for automatic statistics and other future tools. It is true that general discussions about the book have been spread in [[Talk:Programming:Ada]] and [[Talk:Programming:Ada:Contributing]] but IMHO creating another one is counterproductive.  [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 22:51, 4 August 2005 (UTC)

=== Talk Pages ===

If you dislike the idea of a Contributors page we can leave the page behind when doing the rename. Which would then be true for [[Programming:Ada:Contributing]] as well.

Or how about [[Talk:Ada Programming/Contributors lounge]] and [[Talk:Ada Programming/Contributing]] insteed.

:You're right, Programming:Ada:Contributing will be counted as a content page while being internal, but at least it is not a talk page. I think we should designate a talk page as the main page for discussing about the wikibook, either [[Talk:Programming:Ada]] (future Talk:Ada Programming) or [[Talk:Programming:Ada:Contributing]] (future Talk:Ada Programming/Contributing) and open the major discussions always on that page.

::Yes, we need a central discussion page. Some days ago I put a proposal at [[Talk:Programming:Ada:Libraries:Ada]] but nobody noticed it. I prefer to use [[Talk:Programming:Ada]] because the people that see the talk page of the cover will see a lot of movement and not a dead page. And maybe we can have some redirections from other talk pages.
::PS: The MediaWiki should have an option to watch every page of the wikibook --[[User:Suruena|surueña]] 15:36, August 8, 2005 (UTC)

:::Yes, sometimes the discussions may be lost in the discussion pages, but we can also end like in the Spanish Wikipedia where all the discussion is done in the Café, then it grows too fast and the discussions decay before an agreement is reached. A compromise is to discuss the topics in their respective talk pages but announce it in the central discussion page. And you are right, MediaWiki lacks some features that would be very useful for Wikibooks. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 16:37, 9 August 2005 (UTC)

::::Bug reports and feature requests should go to http://bugzilla.wikimedia.org - [[User:Aya|Aya]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Aya|T]]&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Aya|C]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:46, 9 August 2005 (UTC)

:::::I followed your advice and created several new feature requests. See [[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge#New_enhancement_request_for_MediaWiki]]. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 00:50, 11 August 2005 (UTC)

:::I like the idea of announcing discussions in a central talk page (I still propose [[Talk:Programming:Ada]]), having the actual conversations in the adecuate talk pages. If we're all agree, we can move the contents of this page to [[Talk:Programming:Ada:Contributing]], archive the current contents of the [[Talk:Programming:Ada]] in the subpages [[Talk:Programming:Ada/2004]] and [[Talk:Programming:Ada/2005H1]], and start using that central talk page. But it's better to wait after the new title is chosen and every module is moved to the final domain name. --[[User:Suruena|surueña]] 09:41, August 10, 2005 (UTC)

== Ada -&gt; WiKi translator for Emacs ==

hi,

[http://home.arcor.de/bauhaus/Ada/ada-to-wiki.el ada-to-wiki.el] ''New! Delimiter and Operator templates work properly now''

is a translator from Ada text to MediWiKi text, written Emacs Lisp.
It will translate a region in an Emacs buffer.
The region may contain Ada fragments, or entire programs.

After loading the Lisp file (or the byte-compiled Lisp file),

 ;;; Usage:
 ;;;    mark a region, then command M-x Ada-to-WiKi.  Modifies the
 ;;;    current buffer by replacing the text in the region.

==== Comments and Ada Wiki markup ====

While editing [[Computer programming/Design by Contract]], I stumbled
across a few character combinations in Ada comments, viz
 {{Ada/--| a = b}},
...

:The equal sign is used in [[meta:help:templates|templates]] for the ''named notation''. Apart from replacing with entity references you can solve this by correctly using the named notation for assigning the comment to the only one parameter (by default named 1):
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Ada/operator|not_equals|1=/=}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; is {{Ada/operator|not_equals|1=/=}}
:-- [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 19:29, 15 December 2005 (UTC)
:: Thanks, I have added corrections accordingly.
:: BTW, since `[' and `]' are wiki specials, too, the comment function could treat them specially. I'm not sure though whether it should or not. What do you think? [[User:GeorgBauhaus|gb]] 04:36, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

:::Note that `[' and `]' are only interpreted by the wiki in the following cases:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[internal links]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; gives [[internal links]]
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[http://es.wikipedia.org external links]&lt;/nowiki&gt; gives [http://es.wikipedia.org external links]
 [but this one has no effect] because it doesn't start with http
 ]] these pairs are not enclosing nothing [[ so they aren't interpreted.
:::Given that the wiki syntax will be seldom used to represent anything else I think it isn't very needed to take it into account, but if you do so, you would have to enclose with nowiki tags:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:::-- [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 13:38, 17 December 2005 (UTC)

::::Some escaping conflicts remain, as in the following example, but o.K., these will be easy to resolve by hand, I think. I wouldn't know what to do automatically.

 {{Ada/--| foo a[[bar] &lt;- baz]}}  (problem domain notation, comment rendering broken)
 ...
 {{Ada/--| see [[http://foo.bar.baz|here]]}}  (wiki aware author, working. Almost, because of the bar in &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;|here]&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;)
versus
 {{Ada/--| foo &lt;nowiki&gt;a[[bar] &lt;- baz]&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}  (problem domain notation, working)
 ...
 {{Ada/--| see &lt;nowiki&gt;[[http://foo.bar.baz|here]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}  (wiki aware author, partially broken)

=== Compiler Tips? ===

Will it be interesting to have a section on how to best use a specific
compiler? For example,

# How to best use large objects with compiler X.
# How to interpret a given message? (Why is ''selected_component'' not the selected component?) How to get better messages.
# Compiler Y's treatment of possibly large discriminated records is different from compiler X's.
# Source file handling with different compilers, how to set them up portably.

For example, you can get a different error message making a seemingly meaningless
change to your sources. The latter is what has made me think about this
addition to the book. After replacing &lt;code&gt;x.component&lt;/code&gt; with
&lt;code&gt;x.all.component&lt;/code&gt;
the error messages (of course?) change, which is helpful. [[User:GeorgBauhaus|gb]] 08:59, 30 November 2006 (UTC)

:I think it is very interesting, although I'm not sure whether I'll contribute anything to the section, I have only used GNAT. We could start in the [[Ada Programming/Tips]] section, and if it grows out, we can move it to a new independent section. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 12:01, 2 December 2006 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{status|100%}}

== Starting Out ==
=== Where can I get the latest version of MeGUI? ===
[http://sourceforge.net/projects/megui SourceForge] has a copy of MeGUI that, if not the latest, you can use it to update to the latest.

=== How can I use the development version of MeGUI? ===
You can change to the bleeding edge development builds in options -&gt; settings -&gt; extra config -&gt; configure servers.

=== Which version do you recommend - stable or development? ===
The development builds are the latest builds, straight from the SVN.  The problem is that these may have more bugs. To get possibly more stable builds, but with less features, get the builds on 

=== How do I report a bug or request a feature? ===
MeGUI uses the sourceforge trackers for these two areas. You can view and post both [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=798476&amp;group_id=156112&amp;func=browse bug reports] and [http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?atid=798479&amp;group_id=156112&amp;func=browse feature requests] without an account.

=== What version of the NET framework can I use? ===
Versions 2.0 and 3.0 should work.

=== The path to save ___ is invalid ===
This error usually occurs if you haven't installed AviSynth before you install MeGUI. The solution is to install avisynth, the latest stable version is preferred.

== General MeGUI ==
=== What are workers? ===
A worker for MeGUI is a &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''thread''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; that can process jobs in the queue. One worker can process one job at a time. There are a few reasons you'd want to run more than one job at once:
*You are running one job and it's not using all the CPU (i.e., it's IO limited, or something else)
*You want to run one job straight away (i.e., run a small encode and skip the long queue)
You can read more about workers here: [[MeGUI/Presentation/Parallel job execution|MeGUI Parallel Job Execution]].

== Audio ==
=== How do I use delay? ===
If the file has a delay value in its filename (''Delay __ms''), or you otherwise know you need a delay, you will have to compensate for this in one of two places in MeGUI. The first is to write the delay value as is into the muxer config when you mux your final file. The second, alternate (i.e., only use one of these methods), is to add a delay when you reencode the audio in the audio config, again entering the delay as is.

=== How do I import audio? ===
If simply adding the audio file does not work, you can create an [[MeGUI/Glossary#AviSynth|Avisynth]] file to load it for you. Create a text file with the following line:
 directshowsource(&quot;path\to\file.mp3&quot;,audio=true)
and save it as a .avs. You will be able to use this file to import to whatever format you want.

== General Video ==
=== How do I set the aspect ratio of my video? ===
It's on the video preview window after opening a video in the main window. See [[MeGUI/Aspect Ratio Signalling in AviSynth Scripts|Aspect ratio signaling in AviSynth scripts]] for a more in-depth treatment.

=== My source VOBs are split up! How can I tell MeGUI's d2v indexer to import them properly? ===
If the vobs are named in the format VTS_''xx''_''yy''.vob, where ''xx'' is the same for every vob but ''yy'' is different, (i.e. VTS_02_01, VTS_02_02, etc.) and they are in the same directory, they will automatically be linked.

=== My logs say my video is not divisible by 16, should I be worried? ===
All video encoders in MeGUI work best when the video resolution is equally divisible by 16 (aka ''mod16''). If the video is not so, the encoder will pad it upwards to the next whole multiple of 16. In other words, if your video can't be mod16 for some reason, try to ensure the encoder has to do as little as possible.

The quality loss from non mod16 encoding is lower at higher resolutions, and is generally small.

== Xvid ==
=== Encoding with xvid doesn't work! ===
Check in the log. If there's a line like this: ''Error opening input file extra\_____.cqm'', you do not have the correct quantization matrix in the correct path. You need to download the .cqm file and place it into the default location of ''program files\megui\tools\xvidencraw\extra''. Alternately you can manually select the path to the .cqm in the xvid codec config. You can find the .cqms in the attachment in [http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?p=841263#post841263 this post].

== x264 ==
=== How does the number of threads affect quality? ===
x264 implements threading with two models. The first is [[MeGUI/Glossary#AviSynth|Avisynth]] input threading, and the second is parallel frames encoding.
* Threaded Avisynth input: If the input is an .avs script, this setting will tell x264 to decode the avs in its own thread. This is especially useful for CPU intensive scripts, but also gives a slight advantage for even the fastest script. In MeGUI, this option is always on as it cannot reduce encoding speed nor quality.
* Parallel frames encoding: The parallel frames encoding method was introduced in recent x264 revisions and is similar to the Xvid 1.2 implementation of multithreaded encoding. It is more efficient in both speed and final quality than the previously used slicing method implementation. This option is in MeGUI's [[MeGUI/Video Encoder Configuration/x264|x264 codec config]]. The commandline switch is ''--threads n''.

=== What's the difference between Constant Quantizer and Constant Quality? ===
These two modes are variations on the generic idea of ''&quot;unknown bitrate, known quality&quot;'' where the encoder aims to encode to a specified quality level. This is opposed to the normal ''&quot;known bitrate, unknown quality&quot;'' model where the encoder is given an average bitrate and must produce the best file possible with that. The advantage of the former is obviously that the quality can be precisely set, while the latter allows precise filesize control. Which one is right for you is ''your'' decision. Note that a 1pass constant quality/quantizer encode will not look as good as a 2pass encode to the same filesize.

In x264, there are two modes of &quot;known quality&quot;, Constant Quantizer (CQ) and Constant Quality (aka CRF, Constant Ratefactor).
* Constant quantizer: every frame is encoded with a mathematically identical quantizer. Constant quantizer produces a file that for the x264 program is of perfect constant quality (it would be 'interpreted' in a similar fashion by other video encoder programs).
* Constant quality (aka constant rate factor): the video is encoded to a nominal quantizer, but the encoder varies the quantizer on different frames to give a higher perceived quality for human eyes. The output will probably be around the same size as a CQ encode (Your Mileage May Vary), but it will look subjectively better to humans and is therefore generally the more used of these two modes.

We have been mentioned in [http://osnews.com/comment.php?news_id=10499&amp;offset=0&amp;rows=15 OSNews]. I wonder whether the submitter is a wikibook contributor or we are already famous :) By the way, given that Ada 200Y it is now officially (well officially informally) named Ada 2006 [http://www.adaic.com/standards/articles/ada06-faq.html] I have renamed [[Programming:Ada:2005]] and the template.

== Organizational comment ==

Hi all.  I've just been browsing this book for the first time, since a co-worker will be joining me on my project and needs to learn Ada.  If I were new to the language I would find the ordering of the book confusing and disconcerting. For example, the section on mathematics uses packages before packages have been discussed.  

My coworker is a C programmer and has had some difficulties trying to use Ada packages in the same ways as C header and source files.  (Isn't it a classic question for the new Ada student to ask how to guard against including a header file multiple times, since there is no preprocessor?)

I think an ordering that would be less confusing would be to start with packages, followed by a discussion on procedures and functions, followed by a discussion on type and variable declarations, and then a discussion on code.

Of course this means going through several chapters without being able to write code.  One way to remedy this would be to add a small chapter to the beginning:  Start with a discussion on procedures and functions (as main procedures and functions), and in the same chapter a quick overview of procedure calls (enough to call Ada.Text_IO.Put_Line(&quot;Hello World&quot;);

Then go to a discussion of packages, etc.  These following chapters can then make use of material from the first chapter.  The point is, in example code, do not use material that has not been covered yet.

*I have made a minor rearrangement so part of your concerns are addressed.  But I haven't removed the current division in:
# Getting Started
# Language Features
# Computer Programming
# Language Summary
: I'm not sure this is the best division from the point of view of the reader but I don't want to change it before listening the opinion of the remaining authors. Nevetheles I have moved the tips page to the bottom of Language Features (only useful when you know the language), and the mathematical calculations actually belong to the Computer Programming part so I have moved it down (consequently your concern about this topic is resolved). Nevertheless I would merge the Language Features and the Computer Programming sections. By the way, you can sign with the toolbar button or typing &lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt; by hand. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 21:24, 11 August 2005 (UTC)

* True. It would be interesting to know what the new C programmer will think about the book - maybe he has some ideas for improvement. BTW: This is a WikiBook - if you have the feeling that there are things your new Co-Worker will need to know you are free to add them right here into the Wikibook. Doing so will be good for us (a better Wikibook) and good for you (you don't need to write it all down - you can build on top of what is allready there): --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 11:02, 12 August 2005 (UTC)

=== Programmer's Reference ===
I would like to propose a dedicated reference section for people with a particular programming background, where the mapping between common constructs from a given programming language to Ada syntax is illustrated (pretty much inspired by http://www.adahome.com/Ammo/Cplpl2Ada.html ). So that migration is simplified, this could be split into sub groups for each language (i.e. C++, Java) and could address a number of fixed issues (function def, classes, types, methods, var decl etc)&lt;small&gt; The preceding comment was written by an anonymous user.&lt;/small&gt;
:I think it's a good idea. If you want to develop it, you are free to start, remember this is a wiki, and it is open to anyone. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] ([[User talk:ManuelGR|talk]]) 11:52, 24 December 2007 (UTC)

=== Featuring multiple differently structured TOCs for readers with certain backgrounds ===

This is actually also something that could be rather elegantly addressed by optionally providing differently structured TOCs for people with a particular background, so that certain assumptions can be made regarding background knowledge. OTOH, I am not sure whether wikimedia supports something like this?

: ''MediaWiki does support multiple TOCs. The [[C++ Programming]] book currently is an example of a book with multiple TOCs. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 06:52, 4 January 2008 (UTC)''

Okay, so let's try to come up with potential candidates for background-specific TOCs:
* people completely new to programming in general
* people with previous programming experience:
** C programmers
** C++ programmers
** Java programmers
** Python programmers (?)
** Pascal programmers (?) (possibly interesting due to the relative similarity between Pascal &amp; Ada)

Eventually, this list is supposed to address the most likely audience of the book, so that the various TOCs may reflect making certain assumptions about the reader's background (or lack thereof).

Furthermore, there probably needs to be an agreement concerning the creation, embedding and use of &quot;glue contents&quot; that are meant to level off the playing field for different audiences, i.e. by providing augmentations to existing contents.

== History of the Ada Project ==

Is there information available on the history and development of this language? [[User:Pedant|Pedant]]

: You can read about that in the article in Wikipedia: [[w:Ada programming language#History]]. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 19:19, 27 September 2005 (UTC)

: We removed the history chapter long ago - as it was only a duplicate of the [[w:Ada programming language#History]] article. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 06:44, 28 September 2005 (UTC)

== New Ada Lovelace picture ==

[[Image:Ada Lovelace.jpg|thumb|]]We already discussed about a [[/New Picture]] for the wikibook. Although is almost the type of image, one of the Lady, I think it might be better. This is a classic picture used several times in relation to the language. What do you think of this picture of Ada Lovelace as the wikibook image?  [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 19:31, 7 October 2005 (UTC)

== PDF version ==

I have made a PDF version of the [[Ada Programming/All Chapters|All Chapters]] view using [http://htmldoc.org/ htmldoc]. Although not all the formating is preserved (htmldoc does not understand CSS), I think it is a better format for printing the book, mainly because the table of contents has page numbers. Do you think is a good idea to upload this book to the sf project? I can make snapshots of the book regularly if we upload it. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 16:47, 23 October 2005 (UTC)

:I finally uploaded a [[:File:Ada Programming.pdf|PDF version]] since it is recommended in [[Help:Print versions]]. This version was produced using Mozilla Seamonkey and CUPS PDF instead of using htmldoc. Although the later produces a better quality PDF for reading in a screen (the TOC and web links are clickable), the uploaded one is better because all the formatting is preserved and the URLs are always displayed. The main use for the PDF version will be to be printed so these characteristics will be more useful than the ones provided by htmldoc. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 22:51, 9 January 2006 (UTC)

For manually created PDF exports, it might make sense to consider also providing a creation data and revision info, as well.
Also, please consider requiring future PDF exports to fully retain internal references/links, so that navigation is simplified.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''This is a very nice, complete introduction to the Ada programming language, one of the best books to come out of the Wikibooks project so far.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Dangling Pointer in [[Ada Programming]]: Contributing ===

There used to be a page describing how to contribute: guidelines,
templates, etc., titled &quot;Contributing&quot;. Where has this gone?
The link from the top page seems dead.

I wanted to learn the reason why someone had removed links to the
&quot;&amp;&quot; operator using Ada/operator... or Ada/delimiter... markup.
(A no comment change.)

[[User:GeorgBauhaus|gb]] 17:54, 6 May 2006 (UTC)

:The Contributing page has been deleted without proper reason! See [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge#Why Talk:Ada Programming/Contributing was deleted?]].

::Thanks for the pointer. [[User:84.62.134.145|84.62.134.145]] 23:21, 9 May 2006 (UTC)

:I don't know the reason for removing those links, we should ask the user who made it. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 12:19, 7 May 2006 (UTC)

== [[Software Engineers Handbook:Language Dictionary:Multi-paradigmed:Ada]] ==

Anybody to help me finish this page. The chapters and there content are standardized across the many languages - I have copied the C++ entry and now it needs to be converted to Ada ASAP. Just do one chapter at atime so prevent duplication of effort.

== Reference source code to be deleted from Wikisource ==

[[wikisource:Pattern_match_knuth_morris_pratt_fixed_test.adb]] has been marked for eventual deletion. Is it interesting for our book? There could be other Ada source code fragments marked for deletion in [[Wikisource:Category:Source code]].  Would they be appropiate for a sample source code appendix? [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 20:06, 7 May 2006 (UTC)

== Navigation templates ==

You could easily roll all your navigation (levels 1-3) templates into one using the &lt;nowiki&gt;{{qif}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; template. See [[Template:Recipesummary]] for an example (maybe somewhat muddled, but it works). [[User:Kellen|Kellen]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Kellen|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:50, 7 May 2006 (UTC)

== Info box ==

Our new Infobox [[Template:Ada_Programming/Infobox]] &lt;small&gt;&amp;mdash;''the preceding unsigned comment is by'' [[User:Krischik|Krischik]] ([[User talk:Krischik|talk]]&amp;nbsp;&amp;bull;&amp;nbsp;[[Special:Contributions/Krischik|contribs]]) {{{2|}}}&lt;/small&gt;

: You can also add it as a drop down box to the main page of the book if you like (see [[Final Cut Pro]]). In its current form, its only designed as an example of the various functions an infobox could provide. If more people start to use it, I'll update it by making the layout prettier, adding links to the printable version and PDF file, and cleaning up the code. --[[User:Hagindaz|haginძaz]] 13:52, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

:: I see the drop down box overlaping the &quot;Ada Programming&quot; title in Mozilla Seamonkey under Linux. I suppose it depends on the browser and the font size, and could happen to others, so I think it isn't the best place to display the info box next to the title. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 19:26, 12 May 2006 (UTC)

::: Indeed. prehehaps a more classic approach like in &lt;nowiki&gt;{{programmingnav|Ada Programming}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; would be better. We should ask the [[User_talk:Hagindaz#Info_box|author]] and prehaps remove the box until the problem is resoved. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:47, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

:::: I decreased the spacing so that now it works at 800x600 on SeaMonkey (using Windows) with standard font size. Increasing the font size ruins the rest of the page (and makes the main page of both Wikibooks and Wikipedia nerarly unbrowsable), so I don't think anyone would use it. Check [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Ada_Programming&amp;direction=prev&amp;oldid=457170 this revision] to see if it works. Again, I only designed it as an example of a possible use of a book info template, so it's far from perfect. --[[User:Hagindaz|haginძaz]] 18:15, 13 May 2006 (UTC)

:::::I still see it overlapping using Seamonkey. It looks ok using Konqueror, though. Font size seems to depend both on browser and platform, so it isn't a good idea to design the page with a given expectation about  font width. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 10:56, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

By the way, the show/hide TOC no longer works. Might be it related with a customization done for supporting drop down infoboxes? [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 11:00, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

: In [[MediaWiki:Monobook.js]], the navigation bars are still labled experimental. So I guess we shouldn't use them until the bugs are worked out. --[[User:Hagindaz|haginძaz]] 16:05, 14 May 2006 (UTC)

==including the book on a CD to publicize free textbooks==
Howdy,

Plaudits, everyone, for your hard work on this book, which I think is an
example of the best work that anyone's done on wikibooks to date.
I'm the author of a free online textbook myself, and I'm working
with the state Public Interest Research Groups' Affordable Textbooks Campaign,
http://www.maketextbooksaffordable.com , to try to spread the word about
free and low-cost textbooks. As part of that effort, I'm working on putting
together a promotional CD to act as a showcase for 20 of the best free textbooks
that are currently available. I would like to include your book on the
CD. The complete list of proposed books is given at the end of this post,
along with the criteria I used for selecting them. The decision on which books
to include was my own, and does not imply any endorsement by PIRG.
Because a number of the books on the list are under licenses that only allow
redistribution for noncommercial purposes, the CD will be noncommercial.

Although your book is available under the GFDL license, which allows
redistribution, I thought I should check with you first to see whether
distributing your book on the CD is something you'd approve of.

I also want to try to address any practical concerns you might have about
having your book on the CD. Although I find it flattering when people
redistribute my own book, one problem is that they sometimes don't bother
to keep their copy up to date. To address this potential issue, I've
written software that will automatically download the latest version of
your book on a regular basis. The following information is what I have
for your book right now:

  title      Ada Programming
  author     Krischik et al.
  license    GFDL
  web page   http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Ada_Programming
  PDF        http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/8/8d/Ada_Programming.pdf

If the book ever becomes available in print,
please let me know, and if possible provide a URL to which the CD could
steer interested users to buy a printed copy.

I was unable to find an image of your book's cover. If you could provide
one, I could use it to  make a thumbnail image for the book's file on the CD.

I plan to make the collection available online as an ISO image,
which anyone could then download and burn onto a blank CD. I hope to get
this done over the summer, and hand out copies to students and colleagues
at the beginning of the fall semester. It would also be possible to produce
copies with professional-quality labels and jewel boxes (but depending
on the way the business arrangements were set up, it might be necessary
to eliminate from that version of the CD any books that are under a license
that forbids commercial use). This kind of thing has been done successfully
with open source software CDs by organizations such as theopencd.org .

Please let me know what you think, and don't hesitate to ask if you have
any questions. I'll be on vacation from June 21 to July 14, and probably
will not be able to answer e-mail received during that time until I get
back. However, e-mail is still the best way to reach me, since I may not get
around to checking this discussion page. My address is crowell06 at
lightandmatter dot com.

--[[User:Bcrowell|Bcrowell]] 23:10, 19 June 2006 (UTC)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------


Criteria for selecting the books to go on the CD:

- It's a finished, high-quality book designed for practical use in the classroom.

- It's available under a license that allows it to be redistributed freely.

- It's available in PDF format (or in a format such as PostScript that can be converted to PDF).

- It's available from a public URL that can be freely accessed by an automated script, so that the version of the book offered on the CD can be kept up to date automatically.

- The topic is not too esoteric.

:It is nice to hear about this project. As one of the &quot;Ada Programming&quot; authors you have not only my consent (implied by the GFDL license) but also my support. The conditions for redistribution are perfectly detailed in the license so there is nothing more to say about it.

:I think you should distribute the examples sources package from https://sourceforge.net/projects/wikibook-ada/ alongside with the book.

:There isn't a cover image as such although all our pages are illustrated with the following Ada's portrait: [[:Image:Ada_Lovelace_1838.jpg]]

:Alternatively you could use this other one, if you like it better: [[:Image:Ada_Lovelace.jpg]]

:A final question, do you plan to provide the book in HTML version apart from the PDF one? The book is highly hyperlinked, but the PDF version is just a printout using CUPS virtual PDF printer, so this feature would be lost.

:The problem I see is about the infobox drop down which is outside our control, but I will report your concern in the [[infobox]] project. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]]

== For non-programmers ==

It is almost impossible for a non-programmer to understand the basic concepts written in the beginning of this work for some basic words and ideas aren't defined. There should be a way to introduce terms like '''package''', '''implementation''', '''implementation-defined''' and some other words to non-programmers to help them understand this language and catch on to programming. [[User:Lincher|Lincher]] 02:05, 5 November 2006 (UTC)

: True, while for keywords we have little introductions like [[Ada Programming/Keywords/package]] they are not allways linked and not allways perfect. For technical terms line implementation-defined we have nothing. I propose a new hirachie [[Ada Programming/Term/implementation-defined]]. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 09:46, 5 November 2006 (UTC)

::For technical terms we could also link to Wikipedia, unless they are terms very specific to Ada, in which case a local glossary would be a great idea. Regarding implementation-defined, it does not exist in Wikipedia, but surprisingly [[w:undefined behaviour]] does. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 19:27, 5 November 2006 (UTC)

: I have added a few words to the introduction, please comment. Can't say whether this is the right place, as we have hypertext. But an introduction should be cohesive? [[User:GeorgBauhaus|gb]] 18:52, 23 November 2006 (UTC)

== ambiguous grammar ==

This sentence is on the front page, under Programming in the large:

For example, compared to programs written in C, programs written in Ada 83 contain ten times fewer bugs, and cost twice less to develop in the first place

what does 'twice less' mean? half? quarter? $2 less?

: This sounds too much like showing-off anyway, for my taste at least. Given that the publisher (IBM) Rational is known as a vendor of Ada compilers, this fact will add an unfortunate bias to just mentioning the mentioned study as a proof. Even when there are facts in the study.  So I suggest some wording changes, making this more matter-of-fact. (I can't do this myself, I couldn't construct adequate phrases.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Working on a better print version ==

Hey, please check this out. You may notice a couple of differences (like in chapter 2, I focused more on GNAT, what I considered to be the most complete section). Comments are welcome, and if you want the LaTeX source, just email me [http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/9/9c/Dragontamer_Ada.pdf Incomplete Ada print version]--[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 01:35, 31 December 2006 (UTC)

: I've uploaded my current work to the subversion repository (at /trunk/ada-latex/). I'll continue to be working on them more or less, but if anyone wants to help out, please message me. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 19:36, 9 January 2007 (UTC)

: I've reuploaded a snapshot of where I am. All the way upto Chapter 8 now. Long way to go, nonetheless. --[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 20:01, 11 January 2007 (UTC)

:: Gook work. I wonder if there is a way for correctly writing Santiago Urueña's name and mine. If there is no possibility then it is probably preferable to avoid the accent and tilde and transform those characters to their closest ASCII equivalences: Uruena and Gomez. I don't know LaTeX but I am sure there are ways to compose Western Europe characters using ASCII codes. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 13:13, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

::: Oh, yes, it is certainly possible. I'm sorry I haven't been updating recently, but I'll see what I can do. (in LaTeX, it is as simple as typing Urue\~na.)--[[User:Dragontamer|Dragontamer]] 19:55, 6 February 2007 (UTC)

==PDF bug==
[[Image:Ada pdf bug.jpg|thumb|Bug in PDF...]]
Hey, as you can see on the image, there's a bug with actual PDF version ([[Media:Ada Programming.pdf]]). The Fonts used in this file seem not to work under Linux. Does anybody can fix it?  [[User:MonteChristof|MonteChristof]] 17:40, 3 February 2007 (UTC)

Non-standard fonts need to be added for files using such fonts. You shouldn't to create PDF without saving here fonts used in creation. Even if in consequence of that file &quot;weight&quot; will increased. [[User:MonteChristof|MonteChristof]] 22:03, 4 February 2007 (UTC)

==Goodbook==

We need to update our entry at [[Wikibooks:Featured Books/Book2]].

== Syntax highlight extension ==

As you can see [[C_Programming/A_taste_of_C|here]] the [[Wikibooks:Staff_lounge/Technical_Chat#Proposal_for_adding_the_Highlight_extension_to_Wikibooks|highlight extension]] has been installed on Wikibooks. We might compare the use of this extension with our current system. The advantage of this new system is easier editing of source programs, the disadvantage would be loosing the internal links to keywords and packages. Although in the C example we can see an external link to the printf reference, so there might be a chance of modifying the extension for linking words to reference pages &amp;mdash; which fairly could be the Wikibook pages. It is probably the best idea to keep the current system, but the new extension probably deserves a look. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] 18:31, 15 May 2007 (UTC)

: It is a lot easier so realy worth a thought. --[[User:Krischik|Krischik]]&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User_talk:Krischik|T]]&lt;/sup&gt; 10:10, 17 May 2007 (UTC)

: Is this the thing based on ASHighlight? If so, it might need a patch here and there; try input

&lt;source lang=&quot;ada&quot;&gt;
  ...
                  when '&amp;' =&gt;
                     return so_far &amp; &quot;&amp;amp;&quot; &amp; replace(next + 1);

                     -- if `quotes = true`, replace the quoting
                     -- characters, otherwise just leave the switch

                  when '&quot;' =&gt;
                     if quotes then
                        return so_far &amp; &quot;&amp;quot;&quot; &amp; replace(next + 1);
                     end if;

                  when ''' =&gt;
                     if quotes then
                        return so_far &amp; &quot;&amp;apos;&quot; &amp; replace(next + 1);
                     end if;

&lt;/source&gt;

: OTOH, three dots seem to be o.K., which is good. A quick glimpse at the source reveals few comments. If output is to be hypertext, someone would have to apply changes in the mix of NFAs, parsing stacks, etc. in the C++. Not sure if this can be done using separation of concerns and separate addition of links/templates from highlighting code in just another  derived class... Just my 2c.

== Linux man pages !! ==
Is there any feasible way to automatically convert the contents of this wiki book to man page format?
I'm asking because I feel it would be a great addition, in particular given that most programming languages supported under linux come with their own set of documentation in the form of man pages, which is thus very conveniently usable. However, in this respect I feel that ada is currently suffering a lack of good and easily available documentation, that is also available in a shell environment via CLI. In fact, this would be a great addition to the gnat distribution!
&lt;small&gt;The preceding comment was written by an anonymous user&lt;/small&gt;
:I think it would make sense to have man pages for the reference sections, since man pages are references of functions or commands and not complete books. But these sections are still underdeveloped so it might make more sense to create man pages for the predefined environment extracting them from the Ada Reference Manual. By the way, although it is not the same there is an [http://www.stephe-leake.org/ada/arm.html info version of the Ada Reference Manual] which is available in Debian GNU/Linux in ada-reference-manual package. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] ([[User talk:ManuelGR|talk]]) 11:40, 24 December 2007 (UTC)

== Programmer's Reference ==
I would like to propose a dedicated reference section for people with a particular programming background, where the mapping between common constructs from a given programming language to Ada syntax is illustrated (pretty much inspired by http://www.adahome.com/Ammo/Cplpl2Ada.html ). So that migration is simplified, this could be split into sub groups for each language (i.e. C++, Java) and could address a number of fixed issues (function def, classes, types, methods, var decl etc)&lt;small&gt; The preceding comment was written by an anonymous user.&lt;/small&gt;
:I think it's a good idea. If you want to develop it, you are free to start, remember this is a wiki, and it is open to anyone. [[User:ManuelGR|ManuelGR]] ([[User talk:ManuelGR|talk]]) 11:52, 24 December 2007 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">MeGUI supports [[MeGUI/Glossary#Aspect_Ratio|aspect ratio]] signalling in [[MeGUI/Glossary#AviSynth|AviSynth]] scripts, which will allow MeGUI to read the aspect ratio you set in the script without you having to tell MeGUI. This is analogous to AR signalling in [[MeGUI/Computer_movie_files/Container#MKV|Matroska]] and [[MeGUI/Computer_movie_files/Container#MP4|MP4]]; however, since AviSynth works by emulating [[MeGUI/Computer_movie_files/Container#AVI|AVI]] files (which have no native support for AR signalling) a workaround is required.

===Where to find the AR settings in MeGUI===
MeGUI currently doesn't let you set the [[MeGUI/Glossary#SAR|SAR]] -- you have to set the [[MeGUI/Glossary#DAR|DAR]]. This setting is available from the video preview window in the main form.

===Setting the DAR within an AviSynth script===
You can add DAR signals directly to your Avisynth script with two specially-named globals: '''MeGUI_darx''' and '''MeGUI_dary'''. For example, you might have:

 # Set DAR in encoder to 4 : 3. The following lines are for automatic signalling
 global MeGUI_darx = 4
 global MeGUI_dary = 3
 # other stuff which actually is the script
 ...

and MeGUI will interface with Avisynth to get the values of the variables. So you can even do something funky like

 global MeGUI_darx = my_avs_func_x()
 global MeGUI_dary = my_avs_func_y()
 ...

to allow AviSynth to do some DAR calculations.
====Some helper functions====
Because cropping preserves SAR and resizing preserves DAR, it is useful to be able to use the most suitable one for any calculations you make. These AviSynth functions convert between SAR and DAR, and set the DAR so that MeGUI can read it out.

&lt;pre&gt;
# gets the DAR from the SAR
function getDAR(clip c, float SAR)
{
    return Float(c.width) * SAR / Float(c.height)
}

# gets the SAR from the DAR
function getSAR(clip c, float DAR)
{
    return DAR * Float(c.height) / Float(c.width)
}

# sets the DAR
function setDAR(float DAR)
{
    global MeGUI_darx = Round(1000 * DAR)
    global MeGUI_dary = 1000
}
&lt;/pre&gt;

An example of using these functions in a script:

&lt;pre&gt;
# input the video
DGDecode_mpeg2source(&quot;input.d2v&quot;)

# set the DAR to the input's DAR
DAR = 1.3672 # suppose we know the input is ITU 4:3

# calculate the SAR, because that doesn't change when cropping
SAR = last.getSAR(DAR)
crop( 10, 0, -10, -2)

# calculate the DAR, because that shouldn't be changed when resizing
DAR = last.getDAR(SAR)
LanczosResize(300,300)

# signal the DAR to MeGUI
setDAR(DAR)

# ensure that we are actually returning a video
return last
&lt;/pre&gt;

This page gives a quick explanation of each setting does. For more information, read the [[MeGUI/x264_Settings|x264 Settings]] page.

===Main===
|-
|[[Image:Megui x264options1.png|200px|right]]
'''General'''
:*See [[MeGUI/Video Encoder Configuration|this page]] for info on generic video configuration settings.
'''Deblocking'''
:*''Enable Deblocking:'' This feature enables the inloop deblocker for use during decoding.
:*''Deblocking strength/threshold'': Also known as ''alpha deblock'' and ''beta deblock'', respectively. The two variables can range between -6 and 6. There is a good explanation of what these settings do on [http://forum.doom9.org/showpost.php?p=810932&amp;postcount=1 doom9].
'''Misc'''
:*''Enable PSNR calculation:'' Checking this box will tell x264 to output PSNR (a quality metric) information into the log at the end of every job. It slightly slows down encoding.
:*''Enable SSIM calculation:'' Similar to the PSNR calculation, SSIM is simply a different measure of frame quality (most people think it is more accurate). Again, it slightly slows encoding.
:*''Number of threads:'' Controls the number of threads used by the encoder, to increase performance on multi-core systems. This will negligibly affect quality. The recommended value is 0, which will tell x264 to use (1.5 * number of cores) threads. Note that if you have enabled the MeGUI option 'automatically set number of threads', this will override the setting here.
:*''fourCC:'' Sets the 4CC which is used as a codec identifier in [[MeGUI/Computer movie files/Video#AVI|AVI files]]).
'''AVC profiles:''' This setting is used to help you encode to a specific profile of AVC. Settings above the profile selected will not be settable.&lt;br&gt;
'''AVC Level:''' This setting specifies the level your encode is created to. Be aware it is only a nominal value written into the bitstream, and x264 does not pay any heed to this setting. MeGUI includes a level checker that will attempt to tell you when your options are not compliant with the chosen level, but some settings cannot be checked this way (for example, internal x264 buffer settings).

===RC and ME===
|-
|[[Image:Megui x264options2.png|200px|right]]
'''Rate Control'''
:*''VBV Buffer Size:'' Maximum size of the VBV (Variable Bitrate Video) Buffer.
:*''VBV Maximum Bitrate:'' Max local bit rate of VBV.
:*''VBV Initial Size:'' The initial occupancy of the VBV buffer. 1.0 = full, 0.0 = empty.
:*''Bitrate Variance:'' Also known as rate tolerance. Allowed deviation from the target bitrate or filesize. 1.0 = +/- 1%. This setting only applies to 1 pass ABR encodes.
:*''Quantizer Compression:'' Occasionally seen as bitrate variability (not to be confused with above setting). Allowed variability of quantizer. 1.0 = pure CQ, 0.0 = Pure CBR. See [http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=124470 this thread] for more information.
:*''Temp. Blur of est. Frame complexity:'' Level of temporal blurring in the quantizer curve before curve compression. Temporal blurring increases the consistency of the quantizer levels. Increasing this value moves the video closer to pure CQ. The value specifies the radius (in frames) of the gaussian blur applied. See [http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=124470 this doom9 thread] for more information.
:*'''Temp. Blur of Quant after CC:'' Level of temporal blurring in the quantizer curve after curve compression. Increasing this value moves the video closer to CQ. Again, this setting is the radius (in frames) of the gaussian blur applied. See [http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=124470 this doom9 thread] for more information.
'''M.E.'''
:*''Chroma ME:'' x264 by default searches both luma and chroma for motion information in the sub-pixel search.  Disabling this setting will give a slight speed boost at the cost of quality.
:*''ME Range:'' The maximum range (in pixels) that the motion estimator searches beyond the initial predictor.  Does not affect Diamond or Hexagon beyond range 16.
:*''Scene Change Sensitivity:'' The change required between frames for a scene change to be detected. Can range from 0 to 100, but note this is not a simple % figure. -1 means no scene changes will be detected. See [http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=121116 this doom9 thread] for more information about the option.
:*''ME Algorithm:'' The Motion Estimation search algorithm used. Diamond is the fastest, exhaustive is per-pixel and extremely slow.
:*''Subpixel refinement:'' Controls both subpixel estimation algorithms used and partition decision method. RDO (Rate Distortion Optimisation) enables RDO for I and P-frames. There's some more information in [http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=125889#2 this doom9 post].

'''Misc'''
:*''Keyframe Interval:'' The maximum interval between IDR-frames.
:*''Min GOP size:'' The minimum interval between IDR-frames.
:*''Noise reduction:'' Level of pre-processing noise reduction. 0 = disabled.
:*''Encode Interlaced:'' Check this box to encode the input stream as interlaced. You should use this with interlaced input only. Using this option with progressive input (or vice versa) will produce broken output.
'''Quant Options'''
:*''Trellis:'' Enables Trellis RDO either for final macroblock, or always. It requires CABAC.
:*''Number of Reference Frames:'' Number of reference frames available for motion compensation.
:*''Mixed Reference Frames:''Allows references to be selected individually per partition.
:*''CABAC:'' A method of encoding stream syntax which results in high compression.
:*''No DCT Decimation:'' Disables DCT block decimation. Usually not required, but can help in some cases. See [http://forum.doom9.org/showpost.php?p=874964&amp;postcount=6 this doom9 post] for more info.
:*''No Fast P-Skip:'' Disables p-frame skip detection - slightly increases quality, particularly in low detail areas, such as dark walls and sky. There is some information about how exactly this setting works in [http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=125889#2 this doom9 post].

===Advanced===
|-
|[[Image:Megui x264options3.png|200px|right]]
'''Quantizers'''
:*''Minimum Quantizer:'' Sets the minimum quantizer that x264 can encode with.
:*''Maximum Quantizer:'' Sets the maximum quantizer that x264 can encode with.
:*''Maximum Quantizer Delta:'' Set the maximum change in quantizer between frames.
:*''Credits Quantizer:'' For use if you set the credit starting point in the preview window.
:*''Factor Between I and P frame Quants:'' Boosts the bitrate of I frames compared to P frames by this amount.
:*''Factor between P and B frame Quants:'' Reduces the bitrate of B frames compared to P frames by this amount.
:*''Chroma QP Offset:'' Offset of chroma quantization values from luma.
:*''Inter / Intra luma quantization deadzone:'' Also known as inter/intra deadzone. Specifies the level of detail to be discarded and not taken into account by the encoder. Lower values discard less information, and therefore hand the encoder a more complex stream. The main use of these settings is to set a detail threshold. Lower settings can help grain retention, while higher settings may reduce noise. Use of deadzone settings requires trellis to be turned off.
'''Adaptive Quantizers'''
:*''Mode:'' AQ reallocates bits based biased towards lower detail sections that need more than what is normally specified. You can choose for this reallocation to end up averaging out to the same number of bits over the entire video (default), or over each individual frame. You can also completely disable AQ here.
:*''Strength:'' Set the strength of AQ compensation. Lower values reduce the compensation strength.

'''Quantization matrix:''' Set a custom quantization matrix to be used. You must specify the custom matrix. The default matrix (''none'') is a flat matrix. x264 also includes the JVT matrix.

'''Custom Command Line:''' Add arbitrary text to the x264 commandline. This is added to the very end of the entire line.

'''Macroblock Options''' Enable and disable different macroblocks that can be used during the encoding process. The letter refers to the frame type the macroblock can be used in (either ''i'', ''p'' or ''b''), and the numbers refer to the partition size (either 8x8 or 4x4 pixels). Adaptive DCT allows an 8x8 transform in addition to the default 4x4 transform.

'''B-Frames:'''
:*''Number of B-Frames:'' Sets the number of consecutive B-Frames (B-VOPs)
:*''Adaptive B-Frames:'' Allows x264 to use a dynamic number of consecutive B-Frames
:*''B-Pyramid:'' Allows use of B-Frames as references
:*''RDO for B-Frames:'' Uses RDO algorithms on B-Frames (requires subpixel motion estimation set to level 6 or higher).
:*''Weighted Bi-Prediction:'' When combined with multiple consecutive B-frames, this improves the prediction of fades.
:*''Bidirectional ME:'' Motion estimation is optimised in both forwards and backwards temporal directions
:*''B-Frame Mode:'' Motion vector prediction method for B-Frames. Auto selects the best method per-frame
:*''B-Frame Bias:'' Modify the bias for use of Adaptive B-Frames. Higher values increase use, lower values decrease.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are four different video configuration dialogues, one for each video codec. You can access them by clicking the ''Config'' button next to the video codec selection on the [[MeGUI/Main Window|main window]].
__TOC__
==Common Settings==
*'''Mode:''' The mode is used to determine the type of encode the codec will perform:
:*'''CBR/ABR:''' CBR ('''C'''onstant '''B'''it'''R'''ate) and ABR ('''A'''verage '''B'''it'''R'''ate) are both single pass modes. They will run through the video once and encode from that. CBR will use exactly the bitrate specified per second, while ABR will attempt to intelligently vary it in order to get the best visual quality.
:*'''Automated 2/3pass:''' Using the automated pass methods will automatically set up the required multiple passes in MeGUI. The same options will be used for every pass (apart from the first if Turbo is checked).
:*'''1st/2nd/3rd pass:''' If you want more control over your pass settings, you can set every pass up individually. You will have to set up every pass you want this way, MeGUI will not detect or setup missing passes.
:*'''Constant Quantizer/Quality:''' Encode the file in one pass to a specified quantizer/quality, resulting in a known quality and unknown filesize (as compared to other modes which have known filesize &amp; unknown quality). For the difference between constant quality and constant quantizer (only applies to x264), read [[MeGUI/FAQ#What.27s_the_difference_between_Constant_Quantizer_and_Constant_Quality.3F|this]].
*'''Bitrate:''' The bitrate specifies the amount of data per second that the video codec is allowed to use. In VBR mode, it represents the overall average for the length of the movie.
*'''Logfile:''' When encoding a first pass, the video encoder will run through the movie and write statistics about it to a log file for use in subsequent passes. With this option, you can specify the location of the pass if you want to. The default location is in the output directory. For LMP4/XviD this option is on the last page, for x264/Snow it is on the first.
*'''Keyframe Interval:''' The maximum interval between keyframes
*'''Zones:''' Used to apply a variety of compression to a single file. To use, go to the &quot;Zones&quot; tab in the configuration window. Click preview. Use the slider and the Zone Start/End buttons to select your zone. Click Set. Close the window and return to the &quot;Zones&quot; tab. Choose between a Quantizer and Weight mode, and set your Quantizer or Bitrate respectively. Click &quot;Update&quot;.
*The options at the bottom of every page are used to control profiles. The drop-down box is used to load profiles, ''New'' is used to save the current options to a new profile, and ''Delete'' is used to delete the current profile.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;!--- Put some pictures here, explain Queue functioning, video encoding, audio encoding (which are already in the basic guide, but expand on them here), explain that File-&gt;Open can be used for opening files of any type, File-&gt;Import/Export profiles is used ---&gt;
The MeGUI main window is where most of the program functionality concerning video and audio encoding takes place. Audio or video inputs are defined, encoding format and parameters chosen, and the job sent to the job queue. The main window has four tabs: Input, Queue, Log and Changelog.

==Input==
[[Image:Megui main window.gif|right]]The input page is where all video and audio encoding is set up and configured from. It is divided into two sections, '''Video''' and '''Audio'''.

There are also two buttons down the bottom: Reset and AutoEncode. Reset simply clears all input fields, while AutoEncode is used to automate part of the encoding process. Please read the [[MeGUI/AutoEncode|AutoEncode]] page for more information on it.
===Video===
The video section is used for the encoding of video.
*'''AviSynth Script:''' used to specify the input [[Glossary#AviSynth|AviSynth]] script. Use the [[Image:Megui ... button.gif|...]] button to load the script. If you double-click on this field (NOT the button) it will open a preview window of the video you are inputting.
*'''Video Output:''' used to specify the output file that will be written. By default, when an AviSynth script is loaded, the output will default to the same, just with the appropriate extension. The extension is automatically changed if the '''Container''' is changed.
*'''Codec:''' The codec is the compression format of the video. You can use the dropdown box to choose between four formats:
:*''[[Computer_movie_files/Video#MPEG-4_ASP|LMP4]]:'' libavcodec's [[Computer_movie_files/Video#MPEG-4_ASP|MPEG-4 ASP]] encoder. Occasionally referred to as lavc (not to be confused with [[Computer_movie_files/Video#MPEG-4_AVC|AVC]] aka H.264).
:*''[[Computer_movie_files/Video#MPEG-4_AVC|x264]]:'' the free AVC (aka H.264) encoder.
:*''[[Computer_movie_files/Video#Snow|Snow]]:'' an experimental encoder, it should not normally be used.
:*''[[Computer_movie_files/Video#MPEG-4_ASP|XviD]]:'' the free ASP (aka Divx) encoder.

To configure the codec, click the Config button. You can read more about the configuration options for [[MeGUI/Video Encoder Configuration/LMP4|LMP4]] and [[MeGUI/Video Encoder Configuration/XviD|XviD]] and [[MeGUI/Video Encoder Configuration/x264|AVC]] format.
*'''Container:''' the format in which the video stream is output as. There are four options in total, not all are available for every codec: [[Computer movie files#AVI|AVI]], [[Computer movie files#MP4|MP4]], [[Computer movie files#MKV|MKV]] and [[Glossary#Raw_Video|Raw]]. Only the formats which can be directly encoded to without muxing are displayed here -- if you want other formats, have a look at the [[MeGUI/AutoEncode|AutoEncode]] window.
*'''Video Profile:''' if you wish to use a premade profile for the video encode, or want to load one to modify, you can do so here. This functionality is duplicated inside the codec config window too. Loading a profile here will instantly overwrite your current codec settings. See [[MeGUI/Profiles|profiles]] for more depth
*'''Queue Analysis Pass:''' Pressing this adds an [[AviSynth job]] onto the queue. Useful for 2-pass AviSynth scripts.
*'''Add Pre-Rendering Job:''' Checking this adds a [[Glossary#Analysis_Pass|prerender job]] to be generated just before the video job. This is useful for very slow AviSynth scripts.
*'''Enqueue:''' You can use this button to move the currently set up job over into the job control window as a ready to run job.

===Audio===
The audio section functions similar to above, just for audio. You can use the radio buttons to set up two audio jobs at the same time. They can be completely independent of each other.
*'''Audio Input:''' this file can take many audio files as input as well as an avs script.
*'''Audio Output:''' functions the same as '''Video Output'''
*'''Codec:''' for a quick rundown about the individual codecs, read [[MeGUI/Basic DVD Ripping Guide/Audio|this page]] from the Basic Guide. You can configure the codec by clicking the ''Config'' button.
*'''Container:''' works the same as for video.
*[[Image:Megui X button.gif]]: Used to delete the stream. If you have configered two audio streams and want to remove one, you can click this button and it will delete the currently active stream (as dictated by the radio buttons up the top).
*'''Audio Profile:''' works the same as for video.
*'''Enqueue:''' works the same as for video.

==Queue==
[[Image:Megui queue window.gif|right]]The queue window is where you control all the jobs from. The main window is where all the jobs are listed. This area shows a number of pieces of information about the job:
*'''Name:''' The name of the [[MeGUI/Jobs|job]], which is automatically generated by MeGUI. See [[MeGUI/Jobs#Naming|job naming]] for details on the naming.
*'''Input:''' The file that was specified as input.
*'''Output:''' The file specified as output. Not all jobs specify one (such as [[analysis pass]]es)
*'''Codec:''' The codec used. Used only for video and audio encoding.
*'''Mode:''' The mode is an identifier that specifies the sort of job that it is. For example, a muxing job is &quot;mux&quot;, d2v creation is &quot;idx&quot; (for index) and so on. See [[MeGUI/Jobs#Modes|list of modes]] for the entire list.
*'''Status:''' The status of the job. There are five job states, as shown below. To change between them, you can double-click on a job, or you can right-click on a job when it is selected.
:*''Waiting:'' (the job has not been run yet and is waiting to be run)
:*''Processing:'' (the job is in progress)
:*''Done:'' (the job has been successfully completed)
:*''Postponed:'' (the job has been paused by the user, it will not start)
:*''Aborted:'' (the job was cancelled by the user)
:*''Error:'' (the job had an error and did not complete)
*'''Start:''' The time the job was started. If the job has not yet started, it is blank.
*'''End:''' The time the job finished. If the job is incomplete, it is blank.
*'''FPS:''' The framerate of the completed job. Only for video encodes.

The buttons at the bottom of the window can also be used to control the jobs:
*'''Start:''' If there is no job running, clicking Start will start the first job in the list that is waiting.
*[[Image:Megui pause button.gif]]: If an encode is running, you can use this button to pause it. It will then turn into a [[Image:Megui play button.gif]] button, which you can click to resume the job.
*'''Abort:''' This will abort the current job immediately and stop the queue. Beware: you will lose all your progress on that current job, so use with caution.
*'''Load:''' If you have selected a job, clicking load will ''copy'' this job and it's settings back to the Input tab for you to modify. This is useful if you want to modify a job currently in the queue.
*'''Update:''' If you have selected a job, clicking save will ''replace'' this job with the currently set up job in the Input tab. You can use this in conjunction with the Load button to modify jobs in the queue without having to recreate them.
*'''Up:''' This will move the job up one spot in the list.
*'''Down:''' This will move the job down one spot in the list.
*'''Clear:''' Clear will delete ''all'' the jobs in the list. If there is a job currently running, it will continue to run until finished. Be careful, for some reason there is no confirmation that you really want to delete all jobs.
*'''Delete:''' If you just want to delete one job, select it and click this button. It will prompt you to delete linked jobs if there are any.

At the very bottom, there are two final items:
*A checkbox for &quot;shutdown at the end of encoding&quot; which will shut the computer down after all jobs have completed (or errored). Once again, there is no timeout when the encoding finishes to abort this shutdown, so take care.
*There is also a progress bar, which displays current job process.

==Log==
[[Image:Megui log window.gif|right]] The log window is an output window that gives information on what meGUI is doing. It shows commandlines that it gives to the various [[Glossary#Backend|backends]], the output they return and basic information describing what steps the program is progressing through.

It can be useful if an error is encountered to use the log and see at what point the error is encountered. Another use is to extract commandlines used by meGUI for use elsewhere.

==Changelog==
The changelog tab simply describes the changes from version to version. If something has changed recently and you aren't sure what it has changed to you can check here. If you aren't sure what has changed with each version you can also read here to keep up with the latest updates.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are four different video configuration dialogues, one for each video codec. You can access them by clicking the ''Config'' button next to the video codec selection on the [[MeGUI/Main Window|main window]].
__TOC__
==Common Settings==
*'''Mode:''' The mode is used to determine the type of encode the codec will perform:
:*'''CBR/ABR:''' CBR ('''C'''onstant '''B'''it'''R'''ate) and ABR ('''A'''verage '''B'''it'''R'''ate) are both single pass modes. They will run through the video once and encode from that. CBR will use exactly the bitrate specified per second, while ABR will attempt to intelligently vary it in order to get the best visual quality.
:*'''Automated 2/3pass:''' Using the automated pass methods will automatically set up the required multiple passes in MeGUI. The same options will be used for every pass (apart from the first if Turbo is checked).
:*'''1st/2nd/3rd pass:''' If you want more control over your pass settings, you can set every pass up individually. You will have to set up every pass you want this way, MeGUI will not detect or setup missing passes.
:*'''Constant Quantizer/Quality:''' Encode the file in one pass to a specified quantizer/quality, resulting in a known quality and unknown filesize (as compared to other modes which have known filesize &amp; unknown quality). For the difference between constant quality and constant quantizer (only applies to x264), read [[MeGUI/FAQ#What.27s_the_difference_between_Constant_Quantizer_and_Constant_Quality.3F|this]].
*'''Bitrate:''' The bitrate specifies the amount of data per second that the video codec is allowed to use. In VBR mode, it represents the overall average for the length of the movie.
*'''Logfile:''' When encoding a first pass, the video encoder will run through the movie and write statistics about it to a log file for use in subsequent passes. With this option, you can specify the location of the pass if you want to. The default location is in the output directory. For LMP4/XviD this option is on the last page, for x264/Snow it is on the first.
*'''Keyframe Interval:''' The maximum interval between keyframes
*'''Zones:''' Used to apply a variety of compression to a single file. To use, go to the &quot;Zones&quot; tab in the configuration window. Click preview. Use the slider and the Zone Start/End buttons to select your zone. Click Set. Close the window and return to the &quot;Zones&quot; tab. Choose between a Quantizer and Weight mode, and set your Quantizer or Bitrate respectively. Click &quot;Update&quot;.
*The options at the bottom of every page are used to control profiles. The drop-down box is used to load profiles, ''New'' is used to save the current options to a new profile, and ''Delete'' is used to delete the current profile.

This page gives a quick explanation of each setting does. For more information, read the [[MeGUI/x264_Settings|x264 Settings]] page.

===Main===
|-
|[[Image:Megui x264options1.png|200px|right]]
'''General'''
:*See [[MeGUI/Configuration/Video_Encoder_Configuration|this page]] for info on generic video configuration settings.
'''Deblocking'''
:*''Enable Deblocking:'' This feature enables the inloop deblocker for use during decoding.
:*''Deblocking strength/threshold'': Also known as ''alpha deblock'' and ''beta deblock'', respectively. The two variables can range between -6 and 6. There is a good explanation of what these settings do on [http://forum.doom9.org/showpost.php?p=810932&amp;postcount=1 doom9].
'''Misc'''
:*''Enable PSNR calculation:'' Checking this box will tell x264 to output PSNR (a quality metric) information into the log at the end of every job. It slightly slows down encoding.
:*''Enable SSIM calculation:'' Similar to the PSNR calculation, SSIM is simply a different measure of frame quality (most people think it is more accurate). Again, it slightly slows encoding.
:*''Number of threads:'' Controls the number of threads used by the encoder, to increase performance on multi-core systems. This will negligibly affect quality. The recommended value is 0, which will tell x264 to use (1.5 * number of cores) threads. Note that if you have enabled the MeGUI option 'automatically set number of threads', this will override the setting here.
:*''fourCC:'' Sets the 4CC which is used as a codec identifier in [[MeGUI/Computer movie files/Video#AVI|AVI files]]).
'''AVC profiles:''' This setting is used to help you encode to a specific profile of AVC. Settings above the profile selected will not be settable.&lt;br&gt;
'''AVC Level:''' This setting specifies the level your encode is created to. Be aware it is only a nominal value written into the bitstream, and x264 does not pay any heed to this setting. MeGUI includes a level checker that will attempt to tell you when your options are not compliant with the chosen level, but some settings cannot be checked this way (for example, internal x264 buffer settings).

===RC and ME===
|-
|[[Image:Megui x264options2.png|200px|right]]
'''Rate Control'''
:*''VBV Buffer Size:'' Maximum size of the VBV (Variable Bitrate Video) Buffer.
:*''VBV Maximum Bitrate:'' Max local bit rate of VBV.
:*''VBV Initial Size:'' The initial occupancy of the VBV buffer. 1.0 = full, 0.0 = empty.
:*''Bitrate Variance:'' Also known as rate tolerance. Allowed deviation from the target bitrate or filesize. 1.0 = +/- 1%. This setting only applies to 1 pass ABR encodes.
:*''Quantizer Compression:'' Occasionally seen as bitrate variability (not to be confused with above setting). Allowed variability of quantizer. 1.0 = pure CQ, 0.0 = Pure CBR. See [http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=124470 this thread] for more information.
:*''Temp. Blur of est. Frame complexity:'' Level of temporal blurring in the quantizer curve before curve compression. Temporal blurring increases the consistency of the quantizer levels. Increasing this value moves the video closer to pure CQ. The value specifies the radius (in frames) of the gaussian blur applied. See [http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=124470 this doom9 thread] for more information.
:*'''Temp. Blur of Quant after CC:'' Level of temporal blurring in the quantizer curve after curve compression. Increasing this value moves the video closer to CQ. Again, this setting is the radius (in frames) of the gaussian blur applied. See [http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=124470 this doom9 thread] for more information.
'''M.E.'''
:*''Chroma ME:'' x264 by default searches both luma and chroma for motion information in the sub-pixel search.  Disabling this setting will give a slight speed boost at the cost of quality.
:*''ME Range:'' The maximum range (in pixels) that the motion estimator searches beyond the initial predictor.  Does not affect Diamond or Hexagon beyond range 16.
:*''Scene Change Sensitivity:'' The change required between frames for a scene change to be detected. Can range from 0 to 100, but note this is not a simple % figure. -1 means no scene changes will be detected. See [http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=121116 this doom9 thread] for more information about the option.
:*''ME Algorithm:'' The Motion Estimation search algorithm used. Diamond is the fastest, exhaustive is per-pixel and extremely slow.
:*''Subpixel refinement:'' Controls both subpixel estimation algorithms used and partition decision method. RDO (Rate Distortion Optimisation) enables RDO for I and P-frames. There's some more information in [http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=125889#2 this doom9 post].

'''Misc'''
:*''Keyframe Interval:'' The maximum interval between IDR-frames.
:*''Min GOP size:'' The minimum interval between IDR-frames.
:*''Noise reduction:'' Level of pre-processing noise reduction. 0 = disabled.
:*''Encode Interlaced:'' Check this box to encode the input stream as interlaced. You should use this with interlaced input only. Using this option with progressive input (or vice versa) will produce broken output.
'''Quant Options'''
:*''Trellis:'' Enables Trellis RDO either for final macroblock, or always. It requires CABAC.
:*''Number of Reference Frames:'' Number of reference frames available for motion compensation.
:*''Mixed Reference Frames:''Allows references to be selected individually per partition.
:*''CABAC:'' A method of encoding stream syntax which results in high compression.
:*''No DCT Decimation:'' Disables DCT block decimation. Usually not required, but can help in some cases. See [http://forum.doom9.org/showpost.php?p=874964&amp;postcount=6 this doom9 post] for more info.
:*''No Fast P-Skip:'' Disables p-frame skip detection - slightly increases quality, particularly in low detail areas, such as dark walls and sky. There is some information about how exactly this setting works in [http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=125889#2 this doom9 post].

===Advanced===
|-
|[[Image:Megui x264options3.png|200px|right]]
'''Quantizers'''
:*''Minimum Quantizer:'' Sets the minimum quantizer that x264 can encode with.
:*''Maximum Quantizer:'' Sets the maximum quantizer that x264 can encode with.
:*''Maximum Quantizer Delta:'' Set the maximum change in quantizer between frames.
:*''Credits Quantizer:'' For use if you set the credit starting point in the preview window.
:*''Factor Between I and P frame Quants:'' Boosts the bitrate of I frames compared to P frames by this amount.
:*''Factor between P and B frame Quants:'' Reduces the bitrate of B frames compared to P frames by this amount.
:*''Chroma QP Offset:'' Offset of chroma quantization values from luma.
:*''Inter / Intra luma quantization deadzone:'' Also known as inter/intra deadzone. Specifies the level of detail to be discarded and not taken into account by the encoder. Lower values discard less information, and therefore hand the encoder a more complex stream. The main use of these settings is to set a detail threshold. Lower settings can help grain retention, while higher settings may reduce noise. Use of deadzone settings requires trellis to be turned off.
'''Adaptive Quantizers'''
:*''Mode:'' AQ reallocates bits based biased towards lower detail sections that need more than what is normally specified. You can choose for this reallocation to end up averaging out to the same number of bits over the entire video (default), or over each individual frame. You can also completely disable AQ here.
:*''Strength:'' Set the strength of AQ compensation. Lower values reduce the compensation strength.

'''Quantization matrix:''' Set a custom quantization matrix to be used. You must specify the custom matrix. The default matrix (''none'') is a flat matrix. x264 also includes the JVT matrix.

'''Custom Command Line:''' Add arbitrary text to the x264 commandline. This is added to the very end of the entire line.

'''Macroblock Options''' Enable and disable different macroblocks that can be used during the encoding process. The letter refers to the frame type the macroblock can be used in (either ''i'', ''p'' or ''b''), and the numbers refer to the partition size (either 8x8 or 4x4 pixels). Adaptive DCT allows an 8x8 transform in addition to the default 4x4 transform.

'''B-Frames:'''
:*''Number of B-Frames:'' Sets the number of consecutive B-Frames (B-VOPs)
:*''Adaptive B-Frames:'' Allows x264 to use a dynamic number of consecutive B-Frames
:*''B-Pyramid:'' Allows use of B-Frames as references
:*''RDO for B-Frames:'' Uses RDO algorithms on B-Frames (requires subpixel motion estimation set to level 6 or higher).
:*''Weighted Bi-Prediction:'' When combined with multiple consecutive B-frames, this improves the prediction of fades.
:*''Bidirectional ME:'' Motion estimation is optimised in both forwards and backwards temporal directions
:*''B-Frame Mode:'' Motion vector prediction method for B-Frames. Auto selects the best method per-frame
:*''B-Frame Bias:'' Modify the bias for use of Adaptive B-Frames. Higher values increase use, lower values decrease.
|}

===Profiles===
Along the bottom of the dialog there is a section called profiles. Profiles have already been created for the most common applications. Sharktooth has made these profiles available at [http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=101813 doom9]. The above page provides a very brief explanation of what each profile should be used for as well as a link to download the profiles. Note that you can also modify existing profiles and create your own.
:*''Profiles dropdown:'' Lets you view all available profiles for x264. If you select one it will load over the top of your current settings.
:*''Delete:'' Delete the currently selected profile.
:*''New:'' Create a new profile.
:*''Update:'' Save the current settings into the currently selected profile.
:*''Load Defaults:'' Just load the dialog's defaults. These are the settings which try and be as close to x264 defaults as possible. They don't correspond to any profile.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Most tutorials out there for Blender and other 3D applications assume some familiarity with three-dimensional modeling and visualization. Since not all of us have had the privilege of taking a high school technical drawing class, the fundamentals of 3D graphics may be elusive to grasp. This section of the book is intended to introduce newcomers to different techniques used to model the three-dimensional world. It is my hope that this section will help you visualize the world in a new way that you can translate into Blender as well as any CAD or 3D application.

As with any subject, there is a special vocabulary associated with 3D design. Do not fret, for all of these new terms will be highlighted in '''bold''' and summarily defined. These will come in handy later when reading other tutorials.

== Understanding Coordinates ==

You may already be familiar with the X and Y axis from math class. Remember having to graph lines and equations of the form y = mx + b? Well, 3D adds another wrinkle to this: the Z axis! Where X was &quot;left&quot; and &quot;right&quot; on graph paper and Y was &quot;up&quot; and &quot;down&quot;, Z adds a third dimension: depth. That's right, the Z-axis pops right off the page! So how does one go about graphing it? Well, on paper, it usually involves drawing a diagonal line, putting tick marks on it and plotting points. This is not without its problems, so the preferred methods are &lt;b&gt;orthographic projections&lt;/b&gt;, &lt;b&gt;isometric projections&lt;/b&gt; and &lt;b&gt;perspective views&lt;/b&gt;, all of which will be elaborated on in the following sections.

Blender provides two different ways of viewing 3D scenes:
* orthographic view
and
* perspective view.

In order to use these views effectively, you need to understand their properties.
__TOC__
An {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|orthographic}} view (or projection) of a 3D scene is a 2D picture of it in which parallel lines appear parallel.  An additional property of such views is that all edges perpendicular to the view direction appear in proportion, at exactly the same scale.

Usually such views are aligned with the scene's primary axes.  Edges parallel to the view axis disappear; those parallel to the other primary axes appear horizontal or vertical.  The commonly-used orthographic views are the front, side, and top views, though back and bottom views are possible.

Uniform scale makes orthographic views very useful when constructing 3D objects—not only in computer graphics, but also in manufacturing and architecture.

Here's one way to think about orthographic views:

Imagine photographing a small 3D object through a telescope from a very great distance.  There would be no foreshortening.  All features would be at essentially the same scale, regardless of whether they were on the near side of the object or its far side.  Given two (or preferably three) such views, along different axes, you could get an accurate idea of the shape of the object—handy for &quot;getting the feel&quot; of objects in a virtual 3D world where you're unable to touch or handle anything!

==Example==
Here is a drawing of a staircase:

[[Image:Isometric.svg|thumb|center|300px|An isometric view of a staircase]]

and here are three orthographic views of the same staircase, each outlined in red:

[[Image:Orthographic.svg|thumb|center|600px|'''Figure 1:''' Orthographic views of a staircase]]

The views are from the front, top, and left.  Dashed lines represent edges that, in real life, would be hidden behind something, such as the left wall of the staircase.  (Think of each view as an X-ray image.)

The leading edges of the steps are visible in both the front and top views.  Note that they appear parallel and of equal length in 2D, just as they are in 3D reality.

 ERROR - Cannot infer instance

 &quot;Just 0.0&quot;

&lt;hr/&gt;
&quot;As a result, we go back to do-notation, because it's nearly impossible to use point-free style when the result of one monad is nested inside another.&quot; This makes it sound to appear more difficult than it is. While it's not point free style (I'm sure it can be), it comes close:

 main = liftM head getArgs &gt;&gt;= \arg -&gt;

An '''isometric''' view (or projection) of a 3D scene is a 2D picture of the scene in which parallel lines appear parallel.  Like orthographic views, isometric views appear somewhat flat, due to the absence of normal perspective.  The difference is that isometric views need not be drawn along one of the scene's main axes.

[[Image:Isometric.svg|thumb|center|600px|'''Figure 1:''' An isometric view of the staircase from the previous tutorial]]

In mechanical drawing, isometric views are always drawn from a particular viewpoint that shows all three main axes at the same scale.  This allows accurate measurements to be easily made.  (The word ''isometric'' comes from ''iso'', meaning ''same'', and ''metric'', meaning ''measurement''.)

Blender, which can easily generate isometric views from any viewpoint, allows you to change the viewpoint (move the camera around in the scene).  This enables you to see different sides of the object from different angles.  Parallel lines remain parallel, but edges are drawn at different scales due to foreshortening.

As you know, the main reason for modeling 3D objects in Blender is to render images that exhibit the illusion of depth.

Orthographic views are great for building a house, but seriously flawed when it comes to creating realistic images of the house for use in a sales brochure.  While a builder wants blueprints that are clear and accurate, a seller wants imagery that's aesthetically pleasing, with the illusion of depth.  Blender makes it easy to use tricks like perspective, surface hiding, shading, and animation to achieve this illusion.

How does perspective work?

The essence of {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|perspective}} is to represent parallel edges (in a 3D scene) by edges (in the 2D image) that ''are not parallel''.  When done correctly, this produces {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|foreshortening}} (nearby objects depicted at a larger scale than faraway ones) and contributes to the illusion of depth.

Perspective is challenging to draw by hand, but Blender does it for you, provided you give it a 3D model of the scene and tell it where to view the scene from.

If you're confident that you understand perspective, you can skip the rest of this module and proceed to {{B3D:N2P/Module|Coordinate Spaces in Blender}}.
__TOC__


{{B3D:N2P/Note|Blender only does 3-point perspective, not 1-point or 2-point.}}


== One-point Perspective ==

[[Image:Perspective-1point.svg|thumbnail|right|200px|'''Figure 1:''' 1-Point Perspective.]]

Drawing classes teach several different kinds of perspective drawing:  one-point perspective, two-point perspective, and three-point perspective.  In this context, the word &quot;point&quot; refers to what artists call a ''vanishing point''.

One-point perspective works when you're looking at a 3D object head-on and it's centered in your view.

Imagine looking down a straight and level set of train tracks. The tracks will appear to converge at a point on the horizon. This is the {{B3D:N2P/FirstUse|vanishing point}}.

The image on the right is a 2D image of a cubic lattice or framework.  Like any cube, it has six square faces and twelve straight edges.  In the 3D world, four of the edges are parallel to our line-of-sight; they connect the four corners of the nearest square to the corresponding corners of the farthest one.  Each of these edges is parallel to the other three.

In the 2D image, those same four edges appear to converge toward a vanishing point, contributing to the illusion of a depth.  Since this is one-point perspective, there is a single point of convergence at the center of the image.
{{clear}}

== Two-point Perspective ==

[[Image:Perspective-2point.svg|thumbnail|left|200px|'''Figure 2:''' 2-Point Perspective.]]

Now the cube is at eye level, and you're near one of its edges. Since you're not viewing it face-on, you can't draw it realistically using one-point perspective.  The horizontal edges on your left appear to converge at a point on the horizon to the left of the cube, while those on the right converge to the right.  To illustrate the cube with a good illusion of depth, you need two vanishing points.
{{clear}}

== Three-point Perspective ==

[[Image:Perspective-3point.svg|thumbnail|right|200px|3-Point Perspective.]]

Now imagine that you're above the cube near one of its corners.  To draw this, you'd need three vanishing points, one for each set of parallel edges.

From this perspective, there are no longer any edges which appear parallel. The four vertical edges, the four left-right edges, and the four in-out edges each  converge toward a different vanishing point.

[[Image:Alenza-leonardo-the-suicide-1060888.jpg|380px||right|||The suicide. Author: Leonardo Alenza.]]

=== Mechanics ===
It is intuitively obvious that the most important part of jumping is immediate velocity at the moment of impact. Here is a simple graph to illustrate the basics of Newtonian physics - or how gravity can influence your activity.

[[Image:Free_falling_graph_simple.png]]

The problem is that there is no publicly available simply searchable statistical data on deadliness of this method. Famous Places (like Nuselský most; see below) frequently reported in the news are usually reported for jump attempts rather than for successfully committed acts.

Nevertheless, a clue for proper impact velocity can be found in motoristic, hitchhiking or biophysical literature. From that we can learn:
* it is optimal to &quot;straight dive&quot; as the body is most vulnerable to overload [http://www.techmania.cz/edutorium/art_exponaty.php?xkat=fyzika&amp;xser=4d656368616e696b61h&amp;key=185]. To exemplify the different speeds, one can perform tests. Try the diving tower at your local swimming pool. If someone is considering this method, it is very important to be sure about the technique!
* approx. 90 km/h is generally recognized by transportation authorities as standard maximum permitted speed with respect to protective technologies that used to be built into passenger cars when the standards were approved.
* according to television ''fiction(!)'' show [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numb3rs Numb3rs], episode 205, an effective way to kill oneself is to jump from a window 25 meters above the terrain.

Based on Dominick J. Di Maio's Forensic Pathology (pp 148-150):

=== Soft Tissue Injuries ===
Not life threatening.

=== Fractures of the Skull ===
The degree of skull deformation depends on amount of hair, thickness of the scalp, configuration and thickness of the skull, elasticity of the bone at the point of impact, the shape, weight and consistency of the object impacting or impacted by the head, the velocity at which the head strikes the object.

The amount of energy required for production of a fracture depends on whether the head strikes hard or soft yielding surface. In case of hard surface (steel plate) it takes approx. 33 - 75 ft lb of energy to produce a single linear fracture. This energy is absorbed in 0.0012 s. The first 0.0006 s is used in deforming and compressing the scalp and the last 0.0006 s is used in deforming the bone. The amount of energy necessary to produce multiple linear fractures or stellate fractures is only slightly increased. In fact, that skull fractures commonly occur when individuals fall on the back of the head.

If a head strikes a deformable object, the energy is partially absorbed by the object which will tend to deform and wrap around the head. Thus, the energy is not localized in the focus reducing the possibility of the fracture. Instrument panel of a motor vehicle required kinetic energy level at impact of 268 - 581 ft lbs i.e. impact velocities 43 - 65 ft/s. In one test, a human head impacting at 577 ft lb of energy didn't fracture.

Marriage and children

Princess Victoria met her future husband, Prince Albert of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, when she was sixteen years old. Prince Albert was Victoria's first cousin, his father being the brother of her mother. William IV disapproved of the match, but he did not stop the couple. The Queen married Prince Albert on 10 February 1840. Prince Albert was commonly known as the Prince Consort, though he did not formally obtain the title until 1857. The first child of the royal couple, also named Victoria, was born on 21 November 1840. They had eight more children during what was a very happy marriage.&lt;code&gt;Celica is the better half for them.&lt;/code&gt;</text>

Colorado is a state located in the Rocky Mountain region of the United States of America. Colorado may also be considered to be a part of the Western and Southwestern regions of the United States. Denver is the capital as well as the most populous city of Colorado. Residents of Colorado are known as Coloradans.
[[File:Flag of Colorado.svg|200px|thumb|right|The Flag of Colorado]]

==History==
The region that is today the State of Colorado has been inhabited by Native Americans for more than 13 thousand years. Colorado women were granted the right to vote beginning on July 11, 1863, making Colorado the first U.S. state to grant universal suffrage by popular vote. By the 1930 U.S. Census, the population of Colorado had grown to more than one million residents. The state suffered through the Great Depression and the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, but a major wave of immigration following World War II boosted Colorado's fortune. Colorado's population had grown to more than 4 million by the year 2000.
==Geography==
Weather is often extreme in Colorado. Thunderstorms are common east of the Continental divide in the spring and summer, and Colorado is one of the leading states in deaths due to lightning. Hail is a common sight in the mountains east of the divide and in the northwest part of the state. While not as common as some of the states to the east, much of the Eastern Plains are prone to tornadoes, and there have been some damaging tornadoes there. 

Floods are also a factor in the plains, not just from the thunderstorms, but also because of the heavy snow in the mountains followed by a warm, dry period which makes rivers rise with melted snow. In 2008, from July through August, a new record was set that was previously held in 1901 of twenty-three straight days of 90 degree heat, beating the previous record by almost a week. Colorado is also known for its droughts that occur every few years, causing major wildfires such as the Hayman Fire, one of the largest wildfires in US history.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Map of USA CT.svg|200px|thumb|right|The location of Connecticut]]
Connecticut is a state located in the New England region of the northeastern [[Wikijunior:North America/United States|United States of America]]. The state borders [[Wikijunior:North America/United States/New York|New York]] to the west and south, [[Wikijunior:North America/United States/Massachusetts|Massachusetts]] to the north, and [[Wikijunior:North America/United States/Rhode Island|Rhode Island]] to the east. Portions of southwestern Connecticut are considered part of the New York metropolitan area. Connecticut is the 29th most populous state with 3.4 million residents and ranked 48th in size by area.
[[File:Flag of Connecticut.svg|200px|thumb|right|The Flag of Connecticut]]

==History==
The Mohegan tribe lived in the Connecticut region before the Europeans arrived. The first European explorer in Connecticut was the Dutch explorer Adriaen Block. After he explored this region in 1614, Dutch fur traders sailed up the Connecticut River and built a fort at Dutch Point near present-day Hartford, which they called &quot;House of Hope&quot;.

John Winthrop, then of Massachusetts, received permission to create a new colony at Old Saybrook at the mouth of the Connecticut River in 1635. This was the first of three distinct colonies that later would be combined to make up Connecticut.

The first English settlers came in 1633 and settled at Windsor and then Wethersfield in 1634. However, the main body of settlers came in one large group in 1636. The settlers were Puritans from Massachusetts, led by Thomas Hooker. Hooker and his followers established the Connecticut Colony at Hartford in 1636. This was the second of the three colonies.

The third colony was founded in March 1638. New Haven Colony was established by John Davenport, Theophilus Eaton and others at New Haven.

==Geography==
Connecticut is bordered on the south by Long Island Sound, on the west by [[Wikijunior:North America/United States/New York|New York State]], on the north by [[Wikijunior:North America/United States/Massachusetts|Massachusetts]], and on the east by [[Wikijunior:North America/United States/Rhode Island|Rhode Island]]. The capital is Hartford and the largest city is Bridgeport.

Summer is hot and humid throughout the state. Fall months are mild, and bring colorful foliage across the state in October and November. During hurricane season, tropical cyclones occasionally affect the region. Thunderstorms are most frequent during the summer, occurring on average 30 times yearly. These storms can be severe, though tornadoes are rare.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Map of USA FL.svg|200px|thumb|right|The location of Florida]]
Florida is a state located in the southeastern region of the United States, bordering Alabama to the northwest and Georgia to the northeast. Much of the land mass of the state is a large peninsula with the Gulf of Mexico to the west and the Atlantic Ocean to the east. Most of Florida has a humid subtropical climate; southern Florida has a tropical climate. Florida is the fourth most populous state in the U.S. The state capital is Tallahassee and the largest city is Jacksonville.
[[File:Flag of Florida.svg|200px|thumb|right|The Flag of Florida]]

==History==
Research indicates that Florida had been inhabited thousands of years before the Europeans settled there by different Native American tribes. Florida was given its name by the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de León. 

Over the following century, both the Spanish and French built settlements in Florida, with different degrees of success. In 1559, Spanish Pensacola was established by Don Tristán de Luna y Arellano as the first European settlement in the continental United States, but it had become abandoned by 1561 and would not be reinhabited until the 1690s. French Huguenots founded Fort Caroline in modern-day Jacksonville in 1564, but the fort was conquered by forces from the new Spanish colony of St. Augustine the following year.

==Geography==
Much of the state of Florida is located on a peninsula between the Gulf of Mexico, the Atlantic Ocean, and the Straits of Florida. It extends to the northwest into a panhandle, extending along the northern Gulf of Mexico. It is bordered on the north by the states of [[Wikijunior:North America/United States/Georgia|Georgia]] and [[Wikijunior:North America/United States/Alabama|Alabama]], and on the west, at the end of the panhandle, by Alabama. It is near several Caribbean countries, particularly the Bahamas and Cuba. 

Florida's nickname is the &quot;Sunshine State&quot;, but severe weather occurs often in the state. Central Florida is known as the lightning capital of the United States, as more lightning strikes occur there than anywhere else in the country. Florida has the highest average precipitation of any state, in large part because afternoon thunderstorms are common in most of the state from late spring until early autumn.

==People==
[[File:American Alligator.jpg|thumb|200px|right|An American Alligator]]
As of 2008, Florida's population was estimated to be 18,328,340. As of 2000, 77 percent of Florida residents age 5 and older spoke English at home as a first language, while 16 percent spoke Spanish. 

Florida is mostly Protestant, but Roman Catholicism is the single largest denomination in the state. There is also a sizable Jewish community, located mainly in South Florida; no other Southern state has such a large Jewish population.

Florida receives a lot of tourism throughout the year. The Walt Disney World Resort is the largest vacation resort in the world, made up of four theme parks and more than 20 hotels in Lake Buena Vista, Florida; it, and Universal Orlando Resort, Busch Gardens, SeaWorld, and other major parks drive state tourism. Many beach towns are also popular tourist destinations, especially during the winter months.

The State of Georgia is a state in the United States and was one of the original Thirteen Colonies that revolted against British rule in the American Revolution. Georgia is bordered on the south by Florida; on the east by the Atlantic Ocean and South Carolina; on the west by Alabama and by Florida in the extreme southwest; and on the north by Tennessee and North Carolina. Atlanta is the most populous city, and the capital.

==History==
Georgia has had ten different constitutions in her history. Prior to having a formal constitution a document entitled Rules and Regulations of the Colony of Georgia was drafted in 1776. A year later, in 1777, another constitution was drafted followed by the constitutions of 1789, 1798, 1861, 1868, 1877, 1945, 1976 and 1983. All prior constitutions up until 1945 were drafted by constitutional convention. That year Governor Ellis Arnall appointed a twenty-three member commission devised of all three branches of government to write a new constitution.

==State Symbols==
Georgia's nicknames include Peach State and Empire State of the South. The state song, &quot;Georgia On My Mind&quot; by Hoagy Carmichael, was originally written about a woman of that name, but after Georgia native Ray Charles sang it, the state legislature voted it the state song on 24 April 1979. Ray Charles sang it on the legislative floor when the bill was passed. This act was significant in that it symbolized to many the move away from segregation and racism. The state commemorative quarter was released on 19 July 1999.[76] The first houses in Georgia to be designated historic state landmarks are the Owens Thomas House and the Sorrel Weed House, in the Savannah historic district. The state 'possum is Pogo Possum.[77]

The State of Hawaii is a state in the United States, located on an archipelago in the central Pacific Ocean southwest of the continental United States, southeast of Japan, and northeast of Australia. The state was admitted to the Union on August 21, 1959, making it the 50th state. Its capital is Honolulu on the island of Oahu. Hawaii is the only state of the United States that is not geographically located in North America, grows coffee, is completely surrounded by water, has a royal palace, does not have a straight line in its state boundary, or whose flag contains the Union Jack (the flag of Great Britain).

==History==
==Geography==

Hawaii is a group of islands.  The most southeasterly, which is also called Hawaii, is mountainous and volcanic.  To the northwest of that is a chain of large islands, which are also mountainous, but are no longer volcanic; their volcanoes became extinct a long time ago.  Still further to the northwest are some tiny, rocky islands, the last remnants of giant volcanoes.  Finally, at the very end of the chain, there are some small, flat coral islands.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==


An eighth grade class in a small parochial classroom recently embarked on a field trip to New York City.  Their teacher brought these twenty-four students to Ellis Island, the Tenement Museum, and the Statue of Liberty. These students read about experiences from Mario Cuomo, Ezra Pound and Maya Angelou for background on their journey.  While on their field trip they explored the Great Hall of Ellis Island, experienced the living conditions of new immigrants in a tour of the Tenement Museum, and listened to current New York City Cabbies discuss their recent immigrant experiences and reasons for travelling to the United States. 

Cool field trip, but unique?  No, not particularly unique.  What was unusual about this field trip is that the students never left confines of the second floor computer lab to travel to these New York sites.

== Traditional Classroom Setting ==


Through the development of a website, students were provided a gateway to the immigrant experience in the United States ([http://www.columbia.edu/~chp2114/immigration/]).  Traditionally taught using a textbook, notebooks, various handouts and a movie, the immigrant experience unit would culminate with a debate between students on the current hot topic of immigration in the United States today.  Students would read various readings in their textbooks, have some class discussion, write journal responses (that only their instructor would read), research on the immigration issue today, and then conduct a classroom debate (assessing persuasive techniques and argumentation skills).  The more academic achievers as usual excelled, participating, engaging, and arguing.  However, the classroom dynamic and learning curve remained constant.  While some students were engaged, many remained passive, and some taking notes for information pertinent to the test, always looking for the correct answer, but never making any deeper connection. “If their [students] initial understanding is not engaged, they may fail to grasp the new concepts and information that they are taught,”  (Fullan, 2007).



== Collaboration is to Understanding ==


In the journals, the teacher would provide feedback and commentary, but it was only a dialogue between one student and the teacher.  And while the opportunity for group discussion occurred in response to the readings, the same students voiced their opinions, but the usual quiet students made no contributions. While even the vocal population of the class, primarily directed their discussions to the teacher and not with their classmates. 
Communication with other students, the sharing of ideas, is always the most fulfilling experience for educators.  When students take over the class and demonstrate their understanding through their passionate ideas on a given topic they might not readily consider, and when they begin to relate this topic to their personal lives and experiences does the learning experience and the understanding of knowledge then become authentic.

Using objective and goals, often prescribed by National and State Standards, to guide the lessons’ designs, educators need to scaffold frameworks to work towards a collaborative environment for student learning, and also teacher learning.  Web 2.0 technologies such as blogs, and wiki-spaces can allow students (and their teachers) to conduct classroom discussion and have a more interactive journal experience.  The solitary use of the web from a simple source of research to be transmitted between teacher and student can now be shared with the rest of the class and beyond; beyond to future students studying the same lesson both within the same school or to be shared with other schools.  

== Example of Student Collaboration (i.e. Blogging) ==


For this unit, the instructor created a blog within the web-site lesson unit:  [http://svdpschool.blogspot.com/].

The instructor, to guide students’ responses, posted the reflection prompts, and the first student entries were soon deleted by the first to post after reading more developed responses from their classmates.  

With the discussion of a blog, the students acknowledged an understanding of the blog concept but had never used one.  All students did acknowledge however, a vast experience with social networking, such as MySpace and Facebook.  The later being a main tool of communication that students engage in outside of school.  Engaging students’ interest of social networking environments, the blog would satisfy this same type of interaction and expression of ideas to early teenage learners.  It is imperative for educators to not only use technologies in learner isolation with research and review activities.  Educators must “take notice of the ways in which learners use technology outside a formal educational environment” (Scardamalia and Bereiter 1994; Lee 2000; Kop 2007).  

This engaged learning became apparent in the learner suggested section of the blog posted as “Struggles and Solutions” ([https://www.blogger.com/comment.g?blogID=6915340917091173491&amp;postID=2934486854804409654]).  Students primarily addressed the teacher (as would be expected in a traditional classroom learning environment).  However, once comfortable with the interface, students began to collaborate with problem solving on the blog.  This led to more collaboration and commentary throughout the entire activity blog postings not only the “Struggles and Solutions” section.


== Other Observations ==


Before the unit began, students had never participated in a blog (or so they thought).  While setting up access to the blog, there were the typical technical issues that need to be accepted while using technology tools.   As a result, an interesting and inspiring occurrence ensued.  Students not usually on the higher-end of academic achievement, but adept at using computers (primarily the web) spontaneously started to help each other.  Students often considered to behavioral issues assisted (without persuasion from the instructor) 
Honor Society students.  This gave them a noticeable sense of empowerment.  These students immediately became interested enthusiastically at the prospect of a web-based learning environment.


Coined “fun-ducational” by one of the eighth grade students, many of the students (and their parents) made mention that students could not wait to get home “to blog” and work on the web activities over other more traditional class assignments. 

One more note for the educator, the immediate feedback, flexibility, and affordances that Web 2.0 technologies provide is valuable.  Educators can make changes in overall scaffolding by editing, adding or deleting information. They can create new tasks and follow the trajectory of students interest and understanding immediately, assessing and meeting learners' needs in real time, developing understanding of the lesson's goals and objectives.

== Final Thoughts ==


While the use of Web 2.0 technologies is an obvious engagement to captivate learners, encourage student collaboration, and demonstrate learning understanding, it is only a portion of engaging learners in different modes of learning.

The use of this website, which does have an emphasis on the reflection blog, also provides activities for student collaboration and construction.  Students are also required to create a video of an immigrant (1st, 2nd or 3rd generation) experience to be posted on You Tube.  This exhibits a documented and shared knowledge for learners that will extend well beyond the second floor computer lab of a particular small parochial school.  

The culmination of the unit on immigration is assessed through a student debate.  With the aid of web cams, students will use some type of web interface, such as Mogulus to broadcast and record their debate.  This public debate will allow students to participate “in actively debating, constructing, producing, and presenting their understandings, not just listening to or reciting knowledge created by other people” (Wiske 2005).  Although these two activities are not to date complete, they demonstrate the importance of a wide range of Web 2.0 technology applications that can enhance student learning and understanding, while appealing to their interests that occur beyond the classroom.

{{recipesummary|Cookie recipes|10 dozen cookies|1/2 hour + baking time|2}}

{{recipe}} | [[Cookbook:Desserts| Desserts]]

==Ingredients==
* 3 sticks of Butter (12 oz) (340 g)
* 1 box of Brown Sugar (16 oz) (450 g)
* 1 cup of White Sugar
* 1/2 cup of Water
* 2 eggs
* 1 teaspoon Vanilla (+-)
* 2 cups of Flour
* 2 teaspoons Baking Soda (+-)
* 1 12 oz (340 g) package of Semi-Sweet Chocolate Chips
* 8 cups of Oatmeal (+-)

==Procedure==

The following steps should be done with a mixer, scraping the bowl as needed to assure all ingredients are combined:
# In a large bowl, combine Butter and Sugars until smooth
# Mix Water, Eggs, Vanilla in separate container
# Add Egg mixture to Butter mixture and mix until smooth
# Sift in Flour and Baking Soda, and mix until smooth
The following steps should be done with a big, sturdy mixing spoon:
# Stir in Chocolate Chips and about 6 cups of the Oatmeal
# Stir in additional Oatmeal until dough is stiff, almost crumbly
Dough is now ready for baking.  If necessary, you can refrigerate the dough until you have time to do the actual baking.

To bake the cookies:
# Use a teaspoon to scoop out dough for each cookie and place on a cookie sheet 
# Bake in 350°F (175C) oven about 10 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean

==Notes, tips, variations==

Notes:
* The whole recipe can be halved (but you'll just need to make more)
* Butter is easier to handle if it is softened to room temperature (but don't heat it up)
* I eye-ball the Vanilla and Baking Soda, so the measurements are guesses, you may need to adjust them
* Depending on the oven &amp; the cookie sheets you may need to adjust the temperature and/or time

Playing with some of the ingredients:
* Add more Chocolate Chips (or other small candy) if desired
* Substitute other &quot;filler&quot; (wheat germ, flaxseed, nuts, seeds, etc.) for some of the Oatmeal
* Whatever you do to adjust the Chocolate Chips and Oatmeal, make sure the resulting dough is very stiff - this helps make the cookies chewy

Allergies &amp; sensitivities:
If you have allergies &amp; sensitivities, you are probably already familiar with making adjustments to your recipes.  Sometimes, these adjustments change the taste of the resulting food.  I have successfully made the following adjustments:
* MILK
** substitute non-dairy butter substitutes (e.g., Earth Balance) 
** use chocolate that is made without milk
* CELIAC DISEASE &amp; GLUTEN SENSITIVITY
** substitute a gluten free flour (e.g., Bob's Red Mill)

Hi, I saw the comment you left in the book and have moved it to [[Celeste Oatmeal Chocolate Chip Cookies]]. This is how you do a rename - by using the move function (there is a tab you should see at the top of the page to do this). Once the move is completed it leaves the old page behind as a Redirect. This means you can access the page by either the old name or the new name because if you enter the old name it switches you automatically to the new name. Hope this is what you wanted, if you have any questions, reply here and I'll see them. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''Unusual?

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Descriptive Statistics'''

''Descriptive Statistics'' is statistical measures that are used to describe numerical data; this numerical data can be in form of a table, number list, frequency distribution etc.


Common Statistical measures are '''arithmetic mean (AM)''' (or average or simply the '''mean'''), '''median''', '''mode''' and '''standard deviation'''. 


:'''Arithmetic Mean (or average or mean)'''
:Arithmetic Mean (AM) of a list of ''n'' numbers is defined as the sum of ''n'' numbers divided by ''n''. This is a kind of center of the number list or simply the average of the number list. The order of numbers in the list is not important.
:For example, the '''AM''' of the number list 3, 8, 7, 3, 5, 10, and 2 is 

::::&lt;math&gt;\frac{3 + 9 + 7 + 3 + 6 + 10 + 4}{7} = 6&lt;/math&gt;


:'''Median'''
:Median is another type of central tendency of list of numbers. To calculate the median of list of ''n'' numbers, first the numbers should be arrange in ascending order i.e. from smallest to greatest. If ''n'' is odd then the median is defined as the middle number, if ''n'' is even then the median is defined as the average of two middle numbers. The order of the numbers is important for this tendency.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:ElectrochemCell.png|thumb|200px|electrochemical cell]]
== Electrode potentials ==
Redox reactions such as this:

Zn(s) + Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) ---&gt; Cu(s) + Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq)

Can be split into two half equations:

Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + 2e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;---&gt; Cu(s)

Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;(aq) + 2e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;---&gt; Zn(s)

But as you may notice the second reaction must occur in reverse for the redox reaction to happen and for zinc to be oxidised (loss of electrons). If we set up this reaction as an electrochemical cell we can measure the voltage of the reaction in the cell.

'''An electrochemical cell is an exothermic reaction set up as two half-cells in two separate containers so that the energy released can produce current between them'''

'''A half-cell is half of an electrochemical cell. One half-cell supplies electrons, the other half-cell receives electrons'''

[[File:Copper_half-cell.PNG|thumb|200px|copper half-cell]]

The more 'easily' the reduction reactions happen (as above in the half-equations) the higher the electrode potential value in volts. In a cell, the higher electrode potential half-cell will undergo the forward reaction and the lower the reverse. The voltage for the reduction of copper 2+ ions is +0.34V and for the reduction of Zinc 2+ ions is -0.76V. Therefore the copper half-cell is higher and the zinc reaction is in reverse.

The voltage of the cell can be calculated from the difference in the electrode potentials e.g. 0.34V - (-0.76V) = 1.1V 
With this reaction always work out the '''difference''' and don't worry about minus signs.

[[File:Standard electrode potential of zinc.PNG|thumb|300px|Measuring the standard electrode potential for a Zn2+/Zn half-cell]]

== Measuring Standard electrode potentials E&lt;sup&gt;&lt;s&gt;O&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; ==

'''Electrode potential - The voltage measured for a half-cell. Another half-cell is essential for this measurement  to be made.

The standard electrode potential of a half cell is measured by making a cell with a 'standard hydrogen electrode' This is used as a reference electrode so has an electrode potential of 0V

''' Standard hydrogen electrode (the reference electrode) - A half-cell in which hydrogen gas at a pressure of one atmosphere bubbles into a solution of 1M H+ ions. Electrical contact is made with a platinum wire. Each half-cell is given a standard electrode potential of 0V; all other standard electrode potentials are measured relative to it'''

(Looking at the diagram of the standard Zn2+/Zn half-cell diagram)
* The salt bridge allows movement of ions between the two half-cells completing the circuit. This can simply be filter paper soaked in potassium nitrate solution
* With zinc the negative sign is to the left of the voltage because the standard electrode potential is a negative value
* If there are two ions in the solution without a rod then a platinum electrode is used 
* To measure the standard electrode potential of non-metals a platinum electrode must also be used (as they are unlikely to conduct electricity)
* If gases are in the reaction the apparatus is the same as for hydrogen

'''Standard electrode potential - The voltage measured under standard conditions when the half-cell is incorporated into an electrochemical cell with the other half-cell being a standard hydrogen electrode'''

== What standard electrode potentials mean ==
Now that we have looked at measuring electrode potentials we can now use them to look at what they can actually be used for. If we had two half-cells:

Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;---&gt; Ag   

E&lt;sup&gt;&lt;s&gt;O&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; = +0.80V

Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;---&gt; Zn   

E&lt;sup&gt;&lt;s&gt;O&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; = -0.76V

We can see that the silver reaction has a higher electrode potential value than the zinc equation. This means that the following can be suggested:
* The silver reaction will have a higher tendancy to proceed in the forward direction
* Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Zn has a greater tendancy to proceed in the backward direction
* Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is a stronger oxidising agent than Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; because it has a higher tendancy to proceed in the forward direction (reduction reaction - causing oxidation to other reactants)

== Using standard electrode potentials ==
We have looked at how standard electrode potentials can be compared to give the voltage of a half-cell. This is usefull because we can predict whether or not an oxidising agent is powerfull enough to oxidise another substance. 

Remember for these to work standard conditions are needed:
* temp of 298k
* pressure of one atmosphere
* 1.00 mol dm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;

When the conditions are changed in any way Le Chatelier's Principle can be used to predict whether the E&lt;sup&gt;&lt;s&gt;O&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; value will increase or decrease.

e.g. With the following reaction:

MnO4-(aq) + 8H+(aq) + 5e- ---&gt; Mn2+(aq) + 4H2O(l)

An increase in H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; will shift the equilibrium to the right and therefore increase the E&lt;sup&gt;&lt;s&gt;O&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; value

If the difference between the two half cells is less than 0.30V (including negative numbers) [[/What?/]] then the the reaction may have an unexpected outcome. If the difference between the half-cells is greater than 0.30V the reaction predicted by the E&lt;sup&gt;&lt;s&gt;O&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; value is nearly always the one that occurs.

'''Remember''' E&lt;sup&gt;&lt;s&gt;O&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; values only say whether or not a reaction is likely to happen and NOT how fast the rate of the reaction will be

== Questions ==
1. Define an electrochemical cell and a half-cell

2. What is the voltage of this cell?:

2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;---&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 

E&lt;sup&gt;&lt;s&gt;O&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.00V

Zn + 2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;---&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

E&lt;sup&gt;&lt;s&gt;O&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; = -0.76V

3. Why have a salt brige in an electrochemical cell?

4. Draw out a diagram for measuring the electrode potential of a Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;/Zn half-cell

5. How can the likelihood of a reaction happening in a certain way be changed?

6. What do E&lt;sup&gt;&lt;s&gt;O&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; values not tell us?

      <text xml:space="preserve">Keeping secrets from the enemy is really important because if the enemy knows your plans, he can act to stop you. On the other hand, finding out the enemy secrets can make the difference between winning or losing a battle, or even the whole war. There are lots of ways of finding out secrets, like spying. But in World War II it was ''code breaking'' that uncovered the most secrets.

In this chapter we'll be looking at the codes that were used in World War II and how they were broken.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In World War I, the British managed to break the German codes. This let them listen in to important messages being sent from Germany to the soldiers. After the war, the British '''cryptanalysts''' (someone who breaks codes and ciphers) carried on listening to German messages. Then in 1926 they started to receive coded messages that they couldn't crack.  This was because the Germans had started using a new machine for coding their messages called ''Enigma''. The story of how Enigma was cracked is an exciting one. The men and women who solved the problem were war winners because the Germans never knew the British and their allies were reading every secret. The effort to crack Enigma led to the invention of modern electronic computers too.

==What was Enigma?==
[[File:Label-enigma.jpg|thumb|right|An Enigma machine]]
Enigma was a machine for turning a &quot;plain text&quot; message into a &quot;coded message&quot;, and turning it back into plain text again. The person using the machine typed a message onto a keyboard that looked just like the one on computers you use in school today. After the person typed the letter, Enigma passed the letter through '''rotors''' and a '''plug board''' which changed the letter into a different one that was then shown on the '''lamp board'''. The person wrote down the new letter - this was now in code. Then, as each letter was typed in, the rotors moved forward one click, changing the code that was being used. Once the whole message had been typed in and the coded message copied out, it would be sent out. This could be by telephone, radio or written down, it didn't matter.

You might think that if you had an Enigma machine you could just turn coded messages back into plain text  messages, known as '''decoding'''. But it wasn't that easy. How Enigma changed a letter would be different based on how the rotors and plug board were set up. If you didn't know the original settings, you couldn't decode the message. 

The Germans used to send out code books that had a '''day key''' for each day. This told people using Enigma how to set up their plug board and rotors. So, if you captured a code book and you had an Enigma machine, you could read messages. Because the Germans knew they might lose a code book (even though everyone had orders to burn them if they thought they would be caught), each book only had a month of codes in it. That way, at the worst, their messages could be read for one month. To make messages even tougher to read, the day key was only used to code the first three letters of the message. Then these first three letters were used as a new part of the code, called the '''message key''', for just that message. That is, every message had its own special code!

==How was it cracked?==

===The Poles break it by hand===

The first people to try and crack Enigma were the Poles. The Germans had invaded Poland in World War I, and they were worried it would happen again. So they worked hard to break the code. At first they thought it was unbreakable, but then their chief code breaker, Marian Rejewski, had an idea.

The Germans were sending the message key twice to make sure it was read properly. Let's say the message key was &quot;ABC&quot;, the Germans would enter &quot;ABCABC&quot; into the Enigma machine. Because the rotors move, this would be coded differently each time, maybe as &quot;DGHYIU&quot;. It's pretty complicated to explain, but this difference in the coding lets the code breaker understand something about the way the Enigma has been set up. Rejewski found a way to work out how the Germans had set the rotors and plug board from a small number of coded messages. To turn this into a useful way of quickly breaking the code he had to write down the 105,456 different ways an Enigma could be set up. Bet you wouldn't like to have to do that for homework!

===Bombes!===

This wasn't the end of the problem for code breakers. Soon after Rejewski's success, the Germans changed the way they set up Enigma, meaning he would have to rewrite his whole book of settings. Instead of doing this he invented a machine that could automatically check the settings. He called it a '''bombe'''. Another feature of Enigma is that the rotors (there are three) can be swapped around. Because that means there are six different ways the rotors could be put into the machine sending the secret message, there have to be six bombes working away to check for the right settings to decode the message.

The bombes worked well until 1938, just before the beginning of World War II. Then the Germans gave all Enigma users two more rotors, so they now had a choice of five to put in the three slots. This meant that Rejewski would need 60 bombes. Not only that but the number of plug board cables went up from six to ten. Together, these meant that the Poles could no longer read the messages.

===The British and French get involved===

The Poles knew war was coming and that they didn't have the time or money to solve the new Enigma codes. So, the head of the Polish code breaking team went to meet his friends from Britain and France. He told them all about the code breaking efforts and gave them a bombe as well. Just three weeks later Germany attacked Poland and World War II began.

===Bletchley Park===

The British code breakers were based at a beautiful mansion house call Bletchley Park. This was to keep them away from other people who they might accidentally tell about their code breaking efforts. It was just as important to keep code breaking success quiet as it was to break the codes in the first place. If the Germans knew their code was broken, they'd just change it.

===Alan Turing===
[[File:Alan Turing Memorial Closer.jpg|thumb|left|The Alan Turing Memorial]]

The most famous person who worked at Bletchley Park was Alan Turing. His friends believed he was a genius. His first idea to help crack the new, stronger, Enigma was to look for patterns in German messages. He realised quickly that German submarines often sent a weather report in their messages. So, the code breakers would try and break the coded message by guessing that the first word was &quot;wetter&quot; (the German for &quot;weather&quot;). But this still meant they had to check billions of possible rotor and plug board settings.

[[File:'bombe'.jpg|thumb|right|A more advanced &quot;Bombe&quot;, built to Turing's requirements, in action]]
Then Turing had his brainwave - the spark of genius that many think helped more than anything else to win the war. He worked out a way to wire up a machine so that the plug board made no difference. So instead of having to check 159,000,000,000,000,000,000 (that's a HUGE number) settings, he only had to check 17,576. And then he set up the machine so it lit up bulbs when it found a match. So, Turing's machine could break the code in about five hours - a fantastic achievement.  But this still relied on having a clue to the code (like &quot;wetter&quot;). So the British set about ways of making sure messages sent by the Germans would have clues.

One way this was done was to drop sea mines. When they were found by the Germans, they would radio the location back to base. The British would read the message which was bound to contain the location of the mine. But the British already knew the location because they dropped the mine! This allowed them to use this location as a clue to break the code. 

==How did it help?==

To give you an idea of how important the code breaking was, during the Battle of Britain the people at Bletchley Park were able to warn of bombing raids, how many airplanes the Germans had lost and so on. This let the RAF plan which German airplanes they should attack, and which they should ignore.

It let the Royal Navy find all the German submarines that were sinking ships in the Atlantic Ocean, and sink them quickly.

The British mined German rivers so they couldn't be used for shipping. Whenever the Germans reported that they'd cleared some mines, the British read the message and just dropped more mines!

Before D-Day, the allies knew where every major German army unit was based and how strong they were, letting them plan the attack in the safest way.

Winston Churchill, the British leader certainly knew how important the code breakers were. Once they wrote to him asking for more money and people to help their efforts. Churchill was very busy running the war but he found time to send this message the same day:

:&quot;'''ACTION THIS DAY'''
:&quot;''Make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this has been done''&quot;.

The State of Maine is a state in the New England region of the northeastern United States of America, bordering the Atlantic Ocean to the southeast, New Hampshire to the southwest, the Canadian provinces of Quebec to the northwest and New Brunswick to the northeast. Maine is the northernmost portion of New England and is the easternmost state in the contiguous United States. It is known for its scenery—its jagged, mostly rocky coastline; its low, rolling mountains; and its heavily forested interior — as well as for its seafood cuisine, especially lobsters and clams. The capital of Maine is Augusta and the largest city is Portland. Maine has a famous national park called Acadia National Park, located mostly on a large island called Mount Desert Island, but also on surrounding islands and a nearby peninsula. 

In the far north, many people speak French instead of English. 

==History==
===Native Americans===
===Acadia===
===British Colony===
===The United States===
===Independent State===
Maine gained independence from Massachusetts on March 15, 1820.

==Geography==
The south eastern coastal part of Maine, known as Downeast Maine, is known for it's many islands that surround the coast. This is the part of Maine that Acadia National Park is located on. Farther to the north Maine is less populated and more forested, and there is an equally famous state park by the name of Baxter State Park. This park is famous for its unique mountain called Katahdin,  which is also where the [[w:Appalachian Trail|Appalachian Trail]] ends.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Overlapping exercises ==

These exercises partially overlap with [[Calculus/Differentiation:Exercises]]. The exercise situation throughout differentiation is messy, some of the sections implement their own exercise headings in the main text. --[[User:Mrwojo|Mrwojo]] ([[User talk:Mrwojo|talk]]) 03:12, 29 December 2008 (UTC)

== Size ==
If this is to have enough problems, it's going to be too big of a page. [[User:Tiled|Tiled]] ([[User talk:Tiled|talk]]) 21:23, 18 April 2010 (UTC)
: I guess I am unsure what you mean by &quot;too big&quot;.  We could change the format of the page so shorter calculation &quot;Compute the derivative&quot; type sections are two columns, as with many &quot;dead tree&quot; books.  This will mean less scrolling.  Of course, if you mean size in terms of number of bytes, this may not help matters.  What is your main worry about a large page?

== Excercise Answers ==

Only the first 4 answers are provided for the 'solve by definition' section.  Is this intentional?

== Removed exercise from &quot;Absolute Extrema&quot; set ==

I removed the following problem due to the necessity of finding analytic roots of a 6th degree polynomial to get an exact answer:&lt;br/&gt;
{{question-answer|question=&lt;math&gt; f(x) = x\sqrt{1-x^2} &lt;/math&gt; on [-1,1]|answer=&lt;math&gt;f'(x)=\sqrt{1-x^{2}}+x\frac{1}{2(1-x^{2})}(-2x)=\sqrt{1-x^{2}}-\frac{x^{2}}{1-x^{2}} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}\sqrt{1-x^{2}}-\frac{x^{2}}{1-x^{2}}=0&amp;\implies\sqrt{1-x^{2}}=\frac{x^{2}}{1-x^{2}}\\
&amp;\implies(1-x^{2})^{3/2}=x^{2}\\
&amp;\implies(1-x^{2})^{3}=x^{4}\\
&amp;\implies1-3x^{2}+3x^{4}-x^{6}=x^{4}\\
&amp;\implies x^{6}-2x^{4}+3x^{2}-1=0\\
&amp;\implies x=\pm\frac{\sqrt{\left(9\sqrt{23}-11\sqrt{3}\right)^{\frac{2}{3}}+2^{\frac{4}{3}}3^{\frac{1}{6}}\left(9\sqrt{23}-11\sqrt{3}\right)^{\frac{1}{3}}-5\,2^{\frac{2}{3}}\,3^{\frac{1}{3}}}}{2^{\frac{1}{6}}\,3^{\frac{7}{12}}\,\left(9\,\sqrt{23}-11\,\sqrt{3}\right)^{\frac{1}{6}}}\end{align}&lt;/math&gt; }}

I thought about having a previous exercise use Newton's method to find an approximate solution to the polynomial in question, but an approximate &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-value won't give an exact extremum.  Without the use of a computer this exercise is not practical.  --[[User:Greenbreen|Greenbreen]] ([[User talk:Greenbreen|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Greenbreen|contribs]]) 10:06, 18 May 2011 (UTC)</text>

The State of Wyoming is a sparsely populated state in the western region of the United States. The majority of the state is dominated by the mountain ranges and rangelands of the Rocky Mountain West, while the easternmost section of the state is a high altitude prairie region known as the High Plains. While the tenth largest U.S. state by size, Wyoming is the least populated. The capital and the most populous city of Wyoming is Cheyenne.

==Geography==

Wyoming is separated into three distinct sections geographically.  The southern and eastern parts of the state are mostly hilly semidesert, while the northern and western parts are mostly densely forested mountains, and the area within the Yellowstone Caldera is composed of patches of forest alternating with large geyser basins.

==History==
Almost 300 years after New Spain was created, on September 16, 1810, independence from Spain was declared by Priest Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla, in the small town of Dolores, Guanajuato. This was the cause of a long war that ended in 1821 which eventually led to the independence and creation of the First Mexican Empire. The Empire's territory included the area of the current Mexican republic as well as the present-day U.S. states of California, Nevada, Utah, Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, parts of Colorado and Wyoming, and all current Central American countries except for Panama and Belize. Agustín de Iturbide was the first and only emperor. The Central American states separated, forming the Federal Republic of Central America. In 1824, a republican constitution was drafted creating the United Mexican States with Guadalupe Victoria as its first President.

==Geography==
Covering almost 2 million square kilometres, Mexico is the fifth-largest country in the Americas by total area and the 14th largest independent nation in the world. Mexico is also the 11th most populous country and the most populous [[Wikijunior:Languages/Spanish|Spanish-speaking]] country in the world.

Mexico is located in the southern portion of North America. It is also located in a region known as Middle America.Mexico is considered part of North America along with Canada and the United States.

Mexico's total area is 1,972,550 km², making it the world's 14th largest country by total area, and includes approximately 6,000 km² of islands in the Pacific Ocean, Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean Sea, and Gulf of California. On its north, Mexico shares a 3,141 km border with the United States. To the north Mexico shares a border with the [[Wikijunior:North America/United States|United States]] an to its south, Mexico shares a border with [[Wikijunior:North America/Guatemala|Guatemala]] and a border with [[Wikijunior:North America/Belize|Belize]].

I must object to the content on this page. A large part of the difference between the two examples is that the class in the RAII version throws exceptions thus making error detection easier. This is of course very nice, but a separate issue then RAII.  [[Special:Contributions/70.70.53.2|Contributions/70.70.53.2]] ([[User talk:70.70.53.2|talk]]) 22:59, 15 June 2009 (UTC)

: Let's say the non-RAII version was changed to the following initialization:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
file *logfile = new file(&quot;logfile.txt&quot;) ;
&lt;/source&gt;
: In this case, the class would throw an exception; the non-RAII function would still have to catch the error (possibly the std::bad_alloc as well) and manually free this object before rethrowing the exception.  As such, error checking would still be necessary even if you modify the function to use the custom class; at best, simply remove the ''if'' statement surrounding individual write statements.  --[[User:Sigma 7|Sigma 7]] ([[User talk:Sigma 7|talk]]) 03:14, 16 June 2009 (UTC)</text>

Hi,  I am currently working on a collection of Books for Lower Elementary and Middle School children:  My First Wikipedia of Images.  It is a collection of books designed to help children easily find images in Wikipedia Commons to use in school projects.  There is no real text except for links to other webites, related wikipedia articles, books, and worksheets.

Although there are already books of some of the topics below, I don't foresee these as conflicting with them, because these books focus on a wide variety of images as opposed to the other books which provide more text.

Here is the list of the books that will be included in this collection:

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to be able to perform various tasks at various part of the form execution.

== Method ==
XForms is integrated with the W3C XML Event standard.  This standard creates standard names for almost
all of the common events used in the lifecycle of a form.  The W3C has attempted to standardize these events
and their event labels so that they can be used consistently across browsers from all vendors.

== XML Event Types ==

The following is a listing of the XForms events.  Some events are tied to individual forms controls such as input, select and textarea and some are tied to the model within the form.

== Displaying Events in a Log File ==

One of the best ways to learn about how events get fired is to write them to a log instance and display the log at the
bottom of the form.  You can do this logging while you are building and debugging your form.

Add the following instance to your model:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:instance xmlns=&quot;&quot; id=&quot;log&quot;&gt;
    &lt;events&gt;
       &lt;event&gt;log initialized&lt;/event&gt;
    &lt;/events&gt;
&lt;/xf:instance&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Whenever you want to see an event, just add an action that appends an event to the end of the log:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;xf:action ev:event=&quot;xforms-deselect&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xf:insert nodeset=&quot;instance('log')/event&quot; at=&quot;last()&quot; position=&quot;after&quot; /&gt;
    &lt;xf:setvalue ref=&quot;instance('log')/event[last()]&quot; value=&quot;'Tab One deselected'&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/xf:action&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
Note that the message must be inside a pair of single quotes inside of double quotes.

At the end of the form you can display the data from the log instance by enclosing the output within a repeat.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;div id=&quot;event-log&quot;&gt;
   &lt;xf:repeat nodeset=&quot;instance('log')/event&quot; class=&quot;log&quot;&gt;
      &lt;xf:output ref=&quot;.&quot; /&gt;
   &lt;/xf:repeat&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

You can also style the event log with the following
&lt;source lang=&quot;css&quot;&gt;
#event-log {
   color: DarkGray;
   background-color: Lavender;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Memory Management/Page}}

Key to performing a memory trace is finding pointers to managed memory objects. If pointers to the object are not found, an uncooperative garbage collector will mark the object as dead and will reclaim the space for later reallocation. Places such as the processor registers and the system call stack need to be examined to find all potential pointers to managed memory objects.

== Pointer or Data ==

When looking at an arbitrary bit pattern, there is no way to determine whether the value is a pointer to a memory location or an integer value. However, most garbage collectors take the conservative approach and assume that all values that could be valid pointers are treated as valid pointers. If the memory management system is allocating memory in pages, it's a trivial task to determine whether a value could be a pointer to an object inside that page. Looping over all pages in this manner will determine whether a given binary value is a pointer to any managed memory objects.</text>

In Victorian times, a young woman named Agnus Leeford is pregnant and walks all the way to a workhouse in an unnamed city in England. She enters the workhouse and then has her baby - a boy. She dies before she can name him. Sally, an old woman who worked at the workhouse, takes care of Oliver. Mr Bumble, the head of the workhouse, surnames the new workhouse children by alphabetical order. He comes to 'T' and names him Oliver Twist.&lt;br/&gt;Nine years later, Oliver is a workhouse-boy. In his room, the boys have a dare and Oliver got the shortest straw. Because of this, he has to ask Mr Bumble for more Gruel. This angers Mr Bumble and he sells Oliver for £5, wanting rid of him. A man named Mr Sowerberry buys him. When Oliver is at his house, a teenager named Noah Claypole bullies Oliver about his mother. Oliver punches Noah, but only gets himself into trouble with Mr Bumble, who Noah tells to come round. Oliver is let out of the cellar and is whipped by Mr Sowerberry. He escapes and walks for seven days to London. When he is there, a boy named Jack Dawkins (who is better known as the &quot;Artful Dodger&quot;) takes Oliver to the loft where he lives with other boys. Oliver meets Fagin; an old man; Nancy, a woman who grows to care a lot about Oliver, and Bill Sikes, Nancy's boyfriend who is a murderer. Fagin, Dodger, and a boy named Charley Bates teach Oliver how to steal. Oliver doesn't realise they are thieves. The next day Oliver, Dodger and Charley go out to steal. Dodger and Charley steal a handkerchief from an old man called Mr Brownlow. They give it to Oliver and run off. Mr Brownlow orders the police to chase Oliver. When they do, they take him to court and a man tells everyone he saw the real thieves (Dodger and Charley).

Oliver faints and the next thing he knows, he is on a bed. He sees two women. Rose (his Aunt) and Mrs Bedwin (the housekeeper). He explains his life and they understand. Meanwhile, Fagin and Bill get really angry with Dodger. Bill tells Nancy to look for Oliver and bring him back. Oliver is told to go to the library but Nancy catches him. Oliver screams saying he doesn't know them, but nobody believes him. When he returns, the other boys bully him for his fancy clothes.&lt;br/&gt;Edward Brownlow (known as '''Monks'''), Oliver's half-brother, wants Oliver dead. They had the same father. Monks secretly tells Fagin if he wants a few coins, he'll have to murder Oliver, and if not then Monks will do it himself. Nancy hears all this so she tells Mr Brownlow at the old bridge at midnight. Dodger hears this, and tells Fagin that Nancy has betrayed everyone. Sykes secretly hears this and murders Nancy. He takes Oliver for a long walk with his dog Bullseye. When Bill is trying to escape, he accidentally hangs himself. Oliver is reunited with Mr Brownlow and Rose.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Unlike many European Languages, Swedish verbs do not conjugate according to number and person.

==Present Tense==
Unlike in other European languages, the Swedish present tense does not conjugate according to person and number. The table below shows the present tense of ''vara - to be''.
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
! Vara
! To Be
|- 
| Jag är 
| I am
|- 
| Du är
| You are
|- 
| Han (Hon/Den/Det) är
| He (She/It) is
|- 
| Vi är
| We are
|- 
| Ni är
| You are
|- 
| De är
| They are
|}

'''Regular Verbs in the Present Tense'''

There are two forms of conjugation for regular present tense verbs. Form 1 simply adds ''r'' to the infinitive, and form 2 removes the final ''a'' and adds ''er''.

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;5&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
! colspan=2 | Form 1
|-
! Spela
! To Play
|- 
| Jag spelar 
| I play
|- 
| Du spelar 
| You play
|- 
| Han (Hon/Den/Det) spelar 
| He (She/It) plays
|- 
| Vi spelar 
| We play
|- 
| Ni spelar 
| You play
|- 
| De spelar 
| They play
|}
|
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
! colspan=2 | Form 2
|-
! Hjälpa
! To Help
|- 
| Jag hjälper
| I help
|- 
| Du hjälper 
| You help
|- 
| Han (Hon/Den/Det) hjälper 
| He (She/It) helps
|- 
| Vi hjälper 
| We help
|- 
| Ni hjälper 
| You help
|- 
| De hjälper 
| They help
|}
|}
Note that form one is more common than form two, and some may even regard the second form as irregular. You will still be understood if you conjugate a form two verb as a form one verb (e.g. ''Jag hjälpar'' in place of ''Jag hjälper''), although native Swedish people will still pick up on this mistake.

===Past tense===
'''Regular verbs in the past tense'''
Like the present tense, the past tense also has two forms. When using the first form in past tense, you add a ''-de'' to the verb stem. In the second form you drop the a and add ''-te''. However, be aware that a lot of the form 2 verbs are irregular, e.g. ''flyger, äter, springer'' (to fly, to eat, to run).

{| border=&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=&quot;5&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
|
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
! colspan=2 | Form 1
|-
! Spela
! To Play
|- 
| Jag spelade 
| I played
|- 
| Du spelade
| You played
|- 
| Han (Hon/Den/Det) spelade 
| He (She/It) played
|- 
| Vi spelade
| We played
|- 
| Ni spelade 
| You played
|- 
| De spelade
| They played
|}
|
{| border=&quot;1&quot; cellspacing=&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; align=&quot;center&quot;
! colspan=2 | Form 2
|-
! Hjälpa
! To Help
|- 
| Jag hjälpte
| I helped
|- 
| Du hjälpte
| You helped
|- 
| Han (Hon/Den/Det) hjälpte
| He (She/It) helped
|- 
| Vi hjälpte
| We helped
|- 
| Ni hjälpte
| You helped
|- 
| De hjälpte 
| They helped
|}
|}

===Future tense===
'''Regular verbs in future tense'''
In swedish, verbs are not different in future tense. Instead, another verb is used, '''kommer'''.&lt;br&gt;
So to form future tense, you say ''&lt;pronoun&gt;'' kommer att &lt;the verb's base form&gt;''.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Example: &quot;Jag kommer att spela.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
Which means: &quot;I will play.&quot;

It should be noted that in every day speech the &quot;att&quot; in &quot;Jag kommer '''att''' spela&quot; often is dropped. Also, the &quot;kommer&quot; is the most normal one for future tense, but a modal verb can also be used, as in the example: 
&quot;Jag ska spela&quot;.
Which means: &quot;I shall play&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;div style=&quot;text-align: center; margin: 0 10%; padding-bottom: 0 px; background: #DDFFDD; border: 3px double #082567; font-size:230%; text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;082567&quot;&gt;Basic Lesson 6 &amp;mdash;&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt; {{Hebrew-Large|זֶה הַבַּיִת שֶׁלִי}}&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/div&gt; 

Welcome to the sixth basic lesson of Hebrew! In this lesson we're going to learn the demonstrative and possessive pronouns, as well as basic syntax.

==Demonstrative Pronouns==

Look at the following examples.

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:right; background:#BECFEB&quot;&gt;
&lt;big&gt;
{{Hebrew|
'''זֶה''' דוד.&lt;br&gt;
'''זֹאת''' שרה.&lt;br&gt;
'''אֵלֶּה''' שרה ודוד.&lt;br&gt;
הבַּיִת ה'''זֶה'''.&lt;br&gt;
אני בא מהעִיר ה'''זֹאת'''.&lt;br&gt;
}}
&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The words highlighted are the '''demonstrative pronouns'''. In English the demonstrative pronouns are “this”, “that”, “these” and “those”.

Here are the demonstrative pronouns in Hebrew:

{|  {{Hebrew table|Vocabulary|זֶה הַבַּיִת שֶׁלִי|Demonstratives|כִּינוּיֵי־זִיקָה|4}}
!
! Singular 
! Plural
|-
| ''m''
| {{Hebrew|זֶה}} 
| rowspan = &quot;2&quot; | °{{Hebrew|אֵלֶּה}}
|-
| ''f''
| {{Hebrew|זֹאת}}
|}

'''Notes'''
* The {{Hebrew|א}} in {{Hebrew|זֹאת}} is not pronounced.

Usually, Hebrew makes no distinction between “this” and “that”.

In English, when we want to demonstrate something, we add the demonstrative pronoun before it: “'''this''' house”, “'''that''' thing”, “I want '''these''' shoes”.

In Hebrew, when there are demonstrations such as these, the pronoun is after the demonstrated object and both are definite. 

Too much information? Let's look at the examples.

'''Examples'''
* '''This street.''' The word for “street” is {{Hebrew|רְחוֹב}}, masculine, singular. We find the corresponding pronoun {{Hebrew|זֶה}} and add it after the {{Hebrew|רְחוֹב}}. Then, we add the definite article to both.
: {{Hebrew|הרְחוֹב הזֶה.}}
* '''Those houses.''' The word for “houses” is {{Hebrew|בָּתִים}}, masculine, plural (it is pluralized irregularly; the singular form is {{Hebrew|בַּיִת}}).
: {{Hebrew|הבָּתִים האֵלֶּה.}}

As for the other positions, we'll get to these in the third section of this lesson.

==Possessive Pronouns==
Here are some more examples.

&lt;div style=&quot;text-align:right; background:#BECFEB&quot;&gt;
&lt;big&gt;
{{Hebrew|
הבַּיִת '''שֶׁלִי'''.&lt;br&gt;
העִיר '''שֶׁלָהֵם'''.&lt;br&gt;
הרְחוֹבוֹת '''שֶׁלוֹ'''.&lt;br&gt;
העָרִים '''שֶׁלָךְ'''.
}}
&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

The words highlighted are the '''possessive pronouns'''. In English the possessive pronouns are “my”, “your”, “his”, “her”, “its”, “our” and “their”.

Here are the possessive pronouns in Hebrew:

{|  {{Hebrew table|Vocabulary|זֶה הַבַּיִת שֶׁלִי|Possessives|כִּינוּיֵי־הַקִּנְיָן|3}}
!
! Singular
! Plural
|-
| 1
| {{Hebrew|שֶׁלִי}}
| {{Hebrew|שֶׁלָנוּ}}
|-
| 2 ''m''
| {{Hebrew|שֶׁלְךָ}}
| {{Hebrew|שֶׁלָכֵם}}
|-
| 2 ''f''
| {{Hebrew|שֶׁלָךְ}}
| {{Hebrew|שֶׁלָכֵן}}*
|-
| 3 ''m''
| {{Hebrew|שֶׁלוֹ}}
| {{Hebrew|שֶׁלָהֵם}}
|-
| 3 ''f''
| {{Hebrew|שֶׁלָה}}
| {{Hebrew|שֶׁלָהֵן}}*
|}

'''Notes'''
* The plural feminine pronouns ({{Hebrew|שֶׁלָכֵן}} and {{Hebrew|שֶׁלָהֵן}}) are quickly falling out of use, particularly by young people, replaced by the masculine pronouns. When talking to/about a mixed group of people from both genders use {{Hebrew|שֶׁלָכֵם}} and {{Hebrew|שֶׁלָהֵם}}.

In English, when we want to indicate that something belongs to someone, we add the correct possessive pronoun before it: “'''my''' house”, “'''his''' place”, “it's '''our''' world”.

In Hebrew, we put that possessive pronoun after the object, and add the definite article '''only''' to the object.

Let's look at the examples for clarification.

'''Examples'''
* '''Your (''m s.'') house.''' The correct equivalent possessive pronoun is {{Hebrew|שֶׁלְךָ}}. We put it after the word for “house” and add the definite article.
: {{Hebrew|הבַּיִת שֶׁלְךָ.}}
* '''Their (''f'') cities.''' The word for “cities” is {{Hebrew|עָרִים}} (despite its plural form, it is feminine. The singular is {{Hebrew|עִיר}}). 
: {{Hebrew|העָרִים שֶׁלָהֵן.}}

==Grammar: Syntax==

Hebrew lacks the verb “to be” in the present tense. This includes its forms “am”, “are” and “is”.

* The boy &lt;s&gt;is&lt;/s&gt; playing.
* I &lt;s&gt;am&lt;/s&gt; bored.
* They &lt;s&gt;are&lt;/s&gt; pretty.
* This &lt;s&gt;is&lt;/s&gt; a book.

It does, however, have alternatives:

If what the object it is a noun, the verb “to be” is replaced by the personal pronoun in the 3rd person. This is not true for pronouns.

If what the object it is an adjective, the verb “to be” is omitted and the definite article is added to the object.

'''Examples'''
* '''Jerusalem is a city.''' No indefinite articles in Hebrew (&lt;s&gt;a&lt;/s&gt;) as well as the verb “to be” in the present tense. “City” is a noun. “Jerusalem” is feminine, singular &amp;mdash; {{Hebrew|הִיא}}.
: {{Hebrew|ירושלים היא עִיר.}}
* '''The house is good.''' No verb “to be” in the present tense. “Good” is an adjective.
: {{Hebrew|הבַּיִת טוב.}}
* '''That is a street.''' No indefinite articles in Hebrew (&lt;s&gt;a&lt;/s&gt;) as well as the verb “to be” in the present tense. “Street” is a noun, however, “that” is a pronoun.
: {{Hebrew|זֶה רְחוֹב.}}

==Writing Numbers==
Numbers in Niw englisc are written together, as in modern German.  For example:
*256 = twahundsixandfeiftiȝ

The exception here is when writing basic numbers, such as two hundred, in which case the numbers are most often written separately:
*200 = twa hundred
*500 = feif hundred

==Fractions==
Fractions are written using the ordinals with an ''-el'' suffix, as in German.
*2/3 = tweȝn þriddel
*8/13 = eaht þrietienþel

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Verbs==
New Englisc verbs can be classified as ''weak'' or ''strong'' based on whether the vowel changes in the past tense or not.

With its Anglo-Saxon origin, this notion is also present in English.

 flip, flipped, flipped
 sing, sang, sung

Weak: wenden, wendte, gewendt
Strong: drinken, drank, gedrunken

===Present Tense===
The present tense of verbs in Niw Englisc should be familiar to anyone who might have read Chaucer or Shakespeare.  The older endings 'est' and 'eth' are present in Niw Englisc, much as they are in modern German (as 'st' and 't')

{| 
| _ || sg. || pl. 
|- 
| Ic || drink'''e''' || drink'''eþ''' 
|- 
| þu || drink'''st''' || drink'''eþ'''
|- 
| he/scie/it || drink'''þ''' || drink'''eþ''' 

|}

This translates the modern English: I drink, I do drink, I am drinking.  There is really no analogous construction to these forms in Niw Englisc.  The closest is the ''am -oþ/-en'' construction:

Ic em am Huntoþ - I'm hunting.
Ic em am Surfen - I'm surfing.

This is not too often used, as the simple verb gives the same meaning, but this form indicates that the activity has been going on for some time, and will continue to occur for at least some time into the future.

==Separable Verbs==
Some prefixes can be separated from a verb, and when they do, must go to the end of the clause, like modern German. 

===midkommen - to come along, come with===
{| 
| _ || sg. || pl. 
|- 
| Ic || komme mid || kommeþ mid
|- 
| þu || kymmst mid || kommeþ mid
|- 
| he/scie/it || kymmþ mid || kommeþ mid

|}

*Present Perfect: ic em ȝestern midgekommen
*Subordinate Order: ic waat, þat ic ȝestern midgekommen em
*Subordinate Modal Order: ic waat, þat ic ȝestern habe midkommen kunnen

==Modal Verbs==
Modal verbs are those verbs that can take an infinitive as an object without a ''to'' beforehand.  One example is &quot;I can go&quot; versus &quot;I like to go&quot; - can is a modal, while like is not.

===kunnen - can===
{| 
| _ || sg. || pl. 
|- 
| Ic || k'''a'''nn || k'''u'''nn'''eþ''' 
|- 
| þu || k'''a'''nn'''st''' || k'''u'''nn'''eþ'''
|- 
| he/scie/it || k'''a'''nn || k'''u'''nn'''eþ''' 

|}
This verb means 'can' in the sense that you can do something because you have the knowledge to do it.  Alone, it can mean 'to know, be acquainted with'
===magen - can===
{| 
| _ || sg. || pl. 
|- 
| Ic || m'''a'''g || m'''a'''g'''eþ''' 
|- 
| þu || m'''a'''g'''st''' || m'''a'''g'''eþ'''
|- 
| he/scie/it || m'''a'''g || m'''a'''g'''eþ''' 

|}
This verb means 'can' in the sense that you can do something because you have the physical ability to do it.  Alone, it can mean 'to be effective against' with the preposition 'wiþ.'
===moten - may===
{| 
| present || sg. || pl. 
|- 
| Ic || m'''o'''t || m'''o'''t'''eþ''' 
|- 
| þu || m'''o'''t'''st''' || m'''o'''t'''eþ'''
|- 
| he/scie/it || m'''o'''t || m'''o'''t'''eþ''' 

|}

{| 
| past || sg. || pl. 
|- 
| Ic || m'''o'''ste || m'''o'''st'''en''' 
|- 
| þu || m'''o'''ste'''st''' || m'''o'''st'''en'''
|- 
| he/scie/it || m'''o'''ste || m'''o'''st'''en''' 

|}

===scullen - should===
{| 
| present || sg. || pl. 
|- 
| Ic || sc'''a'''ll || sc'''u'''ll'''eþ''' 
|- 
| þu || sc'''a'''ll'''st''' || sc'''u'''ll'''eþ'''
|- 
| he/scie/it || sc'''a'''ll || sc'''u'''ll'''eþ''' 

|}

{| 
| past || sg. || pl. 
|- 
| Ic || sc'''o'''lde || sc'''o'''ld'''en''' 
|- 
| þu || sc'''o'''lde'''st''' || sc'''o'''ld'''en'''
|- 
| he/scie/it || sc'''o'''lde || sc'''o'''ld'''en''' 

|}

Nevada is a state located in the western region of the United States of America. The capital is Carson City and the largest city is Las Vegas. The state's nickname is &quot;The Silver State,&quot; due to the large number of silver deposits that were discovered and mined there. In 1864, Nevada became the 36th state to enter the union, and the phrase &quot;Battle Born&quot; on the state flag reflects the state's entry on the Union side during the American Civil War.

[[File:Flag of New York.svg|thumb|rihgt|200px|The Flag of New York]]

==History==
New York was inhabited by different Native American groups at the time Dutch and French nationals moved into the region in the early 17th century. First claimed by Henry Hudson in 1609, the region came to have Dutch forts at Fort Orange, near the site of the present-day capital of Albany in 1614, and was colonized by the Dutch in 1624 at both Albany and Manhattan; it later fell to British rule in 1664.

New York state was one of the original thirteen colonies that became the United States. It was the 11th state to ratify the United States Constitution, on July 26, 1788.

==Geography==
New York covers 54,556 square miles (141,299 km²) and ranks as the 27th largest state by size. New York's borders touch two Great Lakes: Erie and Ontario; the provinces of [[Wikijunior:North America/Canada/Ontario|Ontario]] and [[Wikijunior:North America/Canada/Quebec|Quebec]] in [[Wikijunior:North America/Canada|Canada]]; three New England states: [[Wikijunior:North America/United States/Vermont|Vermont]], [[Wikijunior:North America/United States/Massachusetts|Massachusetts]], and [[Wikijunior:North America/United States/Connecticut|Connecticut]]; the Atlantic Ocean, and two Mid-Atlantic states: [[Wikijunior:North America/United States/New Jersey|New Jersey]] and [[Wikijunior:North America/United States/Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]]. 

==People==
New York is the third largest state in population after [[Wikijunior:North America/United States/California|California]] and [[Wikijunior:North America/United States/Texas|Texas]], with an estimated population of 19,490,297 as of July 1, 2008.

Catholics make up more than 40% of the population in New York. Protestants are 30% of the population, Jews 8%, Muslims 4%, Buddhists 1%, and 13% claim no religious affiliation.

Anyone may contribute to this book. And you are encouraged to do so. Below are [[#Guidelines | guidelines]] we should all try to follow, and [[#Resources | resources]] useful for beginners to Wiki editing.

== Guidelines ==

Please try to follow these general guidelines:

# If adding to the FAQ, and it's a short answer, add it inline. Otherwise, create a separate sub-page.
# If a FAQ answer is complex, consider whether some of it could be a &quot;How-To&quot; and reused for other purposes.
# When creating sub-pages, please name them using the full path. This will ensure that the sub-page will be contained within this book's namespace, and you won't create a new &quot;book.&quot; 
#* You can see how this should be done by editing an existing page which refers to a sub-page.
#* To create a sub-page, just edit the parent page, create the link to the sub-page, save the parent page. Then, follow the link to sub-page. You will be presented a page to create it.
# Please edit similar pages to get an idea what a new sub-page should contain.
# Notice that the main &quot;MagicJack&quot; page contains special wiki tags that don't appear in sub-pages. 
# Don't be afraid to make changes. If you make a mistake, it can be undone. '''[[WB:BOLD | Be bold]]'''!
# If you're unsure of a change you want to make, or if it's a large change, or something that might be controversial (or upset another contributor), please use the &quot;Discussion&quot; feature to talk about it and gain consensus.
#* Likewise, if someone has made changes you disagree with, please use the &quot;Discussion&quot; feature for that page. Let's not have &quot;[[Help:Glossary#edit war|edit wars]].&quot; We know MagicJack generates heated passions among its users. There should be a way to represent everyone's point of view without a lot of drama.
# If you use the &quot;Discussion&quot; feature, please sign your comments with these characters &lt;nowiki&gt;--~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;. (This can be inserted using one of the icons available when editing text.). However, please do not sign actual contributions to pages.
# If you have special interest in a page, please watch for changes and discussions by using the &quot;Watch&quot; feature at the top of that page.
# For other questions, please contact [[User:Az2008|Az2008]] using the [[User_talk:Az2008 | discussion tab]] on that page, or email him  [[Special:Emailuser/Az2008|here]]

[http://www.magicjack.com MagicJack] is a low-cost, consumer-grade Voice over IP (VOIP)&lt;ref&gt;See [[w:VOIP | VOIP]] at Wikipedia, [[Voice_over_IP | Voice over IP]] at Wikibooks.&lt;/ref&gt; telephone service. The company is associated with [http://www.ymaxcorp.com YMAX Corp.]. Both were founded by [[w:Dan Borislow | Dan Borislow]].

MagicJack is unique the following ways compared to incumbent VOIP providers:

# Because MagicJack is related to YMAX, utilizes its network and YMAX is a true [[w:CLEC | CLEC]], MagicJack has a competitive advantage over other VOIP providers{{citation needed}}. This includes revenue generated by termination fees (paid by other providers for calls terminating at YMAX). But, the most visible advantage is seen in the [[MagicJack/Support_Resources/FAQ#How can I find available area codes and prefixes? | large number of area codes (and prefixes)]] available to MagicJack customers.
# MagicJack's stated business model is to subsidize the cost of its service by collecting details about the numbers called by customers, and selling targeted advertising displayed by the softphone. (After one year there has been no advertising except special offers provided by MagicJack.).
# MagicJack allows the use of a traditional ([[w:RJ-11 | RJ11]]) handset through a proprietary (supplied) USB device connected to the computer which acts as an [[w:Analog_telephony_adapter | ATA]]. 
# Extremely low price.&lt;ref&gt;See [[#Cost | Cost]]&lt;/ref&gt;
# The first VOIP provider to use mass-consumer advertising via [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsR3b2F9sUA infomercials].

MagicJack costs $1.67 per month (charged annually)&lt;ref&gt;See [[#Cost | Cost]].&lt;/ref&gt; for relatively full-featured telephone service. Features include:

* A phone number in your choice of area code (and prefix). [[MagicJack/Support_Resources/FAQ#How can I find available area codes and prefixes? | Many area codes and prefixes]] are available.
* Voice mail, always available regardless of whether the customer is using MagicJack at their computer. It will email a .wav file when a voice message is left.
* Relatively unlimited long distance to the US, Canada and Puerto Rico.&lt;ref&gt;There appear to be limits. But, they aren't published and haven't been applied consistently. See [[MagicJack/Sentiment/Cons#excessive_use_oct2008 | Excessive use terminations]] and [[MagicJack/Sentiment/Cons#call_caps_dec2008 | Call caps]].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Call forwarding.
* Call waiting.
* Caller ID.
* [[w:Enhanced_911 | Enhanced 911]] (E9-1-1) service.
* Softphone used with a headset (connected to the computer's speaker/mic connectors).
* The ability to use a traditional handset via the MagicJack USB device, independently of the softphone.

Be VERY wary of purchasing a MagicJack.  They have one of the worst customer service records in the industry.  Agents hang up on you if your questions aren't what they want to hear.  They take advantage of every dollar they can make off you.

== Cost ==

MagicJack utilizes an annual subscription model. The first year costs $19.99 and is bundled with the required USB device which costs $20. (Total 39.99.). Additional years cost $19.99. It is possible to pre-purchase five additional years at a discount ($11.99 per year).

It is useful to compare VOIP services using a monthly price. However, converting MagicJack's annual price to a monthly rate is complicated by a few factors:

# VOIP services can end as quickly as they began.&lt;ref&gt;See [[w:SunRocket#Company shutdown | SunRocket]] (&quot;On July 16, 2007, SunRocket ceased operations with no warning given to customers or employees.&quot;).&lt;/ref&gt;
# MagicJack doesn't give pro-rated refunds for unused time.
# If the USB device fails, it may be necessary to purchase a new one. 
#* MagicJack's warranty of the device appears to be inconsistently applied.
#* MagicJack doesn't sell the USB device separately, it is sold with one year of service regardless of whether you need it. 
# Discounted pre-purchased years which are $1.00 per month. Potentially driving up (or down) the savings.

Assuming the cost of the USB device, 1 year of service, and five additional years purchased at a discount, the following best- and worse-case scenarios can be theorized:

; Best case : In the best-case scenario (all goes well for six years): the cost is $1.39 per month.

; Worse case : In the worst-case scenario (it fails after 2 months): the cost is $49.97 per month.

For this reason, MagicJack users often refer to their purchase as a gamble (or investment). It has the potential to pay off if things go well. But, it should be remembered that it may not.

Using just one year of service (with the cost of USB device), and if it performs as expected for one year, the monthly price is $3.33.

Excluding the USB device (which could last multiple years), one year of service ($19.99) costs $1.67 per month.

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__ 

MagicJack was widely sold while in &quot;beta&quot; status from mid-2007 to March 2008. It was popular among the internet &quot;geek&quot; crowd. Since then it has been considered &quot;General Availability,&quot; and marketed to the average computer user via infomercials and brick-and-mortar retail stores.

== Generations ==

There are four known generations of the MagicJack USB device (also referred to as a [[w:Dongle | dongle]] or [[w:Analog_telephony_adapter | ATA]]). A FAQ article discusses [[MagicJack/Support Resources/FAQ#What's the difference in USB device (dongle) generations? | their differences and how to identify them]],Forth generation is the MagicJack PLUS it has an Ethernet port for stand alone operation.

== Packaging ==

There has been two types of packaging which were associated with the first two generations. However, it has been reported that the original plastic clam-shell packaging is being used for [http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r21628376- new generation devices in retail stores].

See these images of the various packaging:

Limited to online sales beginning Feb 2008. There have been some of these prior to Feb 2008, but they are rare. Therefore, it is not specific to any generation.

[http://www.magicjack.com MagicJack] is an incredibly inexpensive telephone service, costing as low as $1.39 per month&lt;ref&gt;See [[MagicJack/Introduction#Cost | Cost]].&lt;/ref&gt; for free calls to the US and Canada.

== Features ==

MagicJack includes:
* MagicJack PLUS is now available that runs in a stand alone mode without the need of a computer.
* A US phone number in any available area code. [[MagicJack/Support_Resources/FAQ#How can I find available area codes and prefixes? | Many are available]].
* [[MagicJack/Support_Resources/FAQ#How do I personalize my voice mail greeting? | Customizable voice mail]]. The voice mail system will mail new voice msgs to your email as a .wav file. The customer does not have to run MagicJack for the voice mail system to answer calls.
* Call waiting.
* Caller ID.
* Number porting is now supported(the ability to bring your number with you to MagicJack, and leave MagicJack with your number).
* Free long distance to the US, Canada and Puerto Rico. (For most people, this will appear to be unlimited. However, it appears MagicJack is developing limits.).
* International numbers can be called after purchasing minutes.
* [[w:Enhanced_911 | Enhanced 911]] (E9-1-1) service.

== Traveling ==

MagicJack is especially useful for traveling. It can be taken to anywhere broadband internet access exists  and used transparently as if it were at the US location associated with the chosen area code. People can call the customer's phone number, and the customer will receive the call wherever they are. And, the customer can place calls while outside the US as if they were inside the US.

== Landline Replacement ==

Many Magicjack users have successfully used MagicJack to replace their landline saving $200 to $500 a year. Considerations such as 911 service, and the need for reliable telephone access should always be taken into consideration. However, for many, they have been able to do this using a cell phone and/or other pay-as-you-go VOIP services &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vbuzzer.com vbuzzer], [http://www.skype.com Skype], [http://www.voipvoip.com voipvoip]&lt;/ref&gt; as a backup service.

== International Use ==

International calls can be made after minutes are purchased (through your [http://my.magicjack.com/ account portal]). For current rates, see [http://service.liveperson.net/hc/s-73335289/cmd/kbresource/kb-3842420237642626791/view_question!PAGETYPE?sq=international%2brates&amp;sf=101113&amp;sg=0&amp;st=477938&amp;documentid=334781&amp;action=view MagicJack's Knowledgebase page].

MagicJack can be taken to foreign countries (that don't block VOIP) and used in the same way as in the United States or Canada. The fact that the user is outside the US is transparent to callers, and anyone the user calls.

* It is common for individuals with friends and relatives outside the US to purchase a MagicJack, register it, and mail it to the individual outside the US. Essentially giving their foreign acquaintance a US phone number which can be called toll-free. Also, the ability of their foreign acquaintance to call the US toll-free.

Like all consumer products, [http://www.magicjack.com MagicJack] has flaws. To various degrees this can be attributed to the old adage: &quot;you get what you pay for.&quot; Nobody should expect perfection from a $1.67-per-month&lt;ref&gt;See [[MagicJack/Introduction#Cost | Cost]]&lt;/ref&gt; telephone service. Even among those who have complained about any of the following, a common refrain is &quot;but, it's still a great deal.&quot;

Criticisms can be grouped generally into four categories: 1) [[#Missing Features | missing features]], 2) [[#Performance Issues | performance issues]], 3) [[#Privacy Concerns | privacy concerns]], and 4) [[#Business Practices | business practices]].

== Missing Features ==

These issues are mostly a &quot;wish list.&quot; However, some customers ''really'' wish for certain features. They may refer to the absence of a particular feature as a flaw.

* Three-way calling.
* CallerID blocking on outbound calls.
* Blocking of inbound calls (by number, or all anonymous calls).
* No international call forwarding
* No exit feature on the softphone (to gracefully unmount the USB device).
* No option to purchase and run the softphone by itself, without the USB device (dongle) thereby saving $20.00 plus shipping in the first year.
* No option to use a traditional ATA device.
* No choice of audio codecs (Uses only G711. G723 and G729 not available.).
* No refunds of unused time. (More important to someone who pre-purchases 5 years.).
* no call forwarding at anytime

== Performance Issues ==

Customers tend to dismiss these issues as &quot;you get what you pay for.&quot;

* Poor Customer support.
** Hard to reach.  Non-responsive.
* Poor Tech support.
** Offshored. 
** Tech Support poorly trained; read from a script.
** Reported to recommend solutions that can damage a customer's system (opening firewall ports, giving priority to all background processes, editing the registry, disabling anti-virus.).
** No business address or phone number provided to customers. (Although, [[MagicJack/Support_Resources/FAQ#MJ_contact_info | that information is available]].)
* Availability, reliability.
** Server down.
** Calls don't go through.
** Voice mail stops working.
* Quality complaints
** Echo.
** Static.
** Beeps.
** Most phones do not ring when incoming calls are received.  Tech support blame it on insufficien power in most computers USB ports and suggest a powered USB hub that does not solve this critical problem.
* Poor programming
** The softphone re-reads the Windows registry every 3 seconds. Opens the USB device writable every 3 seconds. This will inevitably corrupt your flash drive if the device is frequently not removed properly.
** No exit feature. However, you can terminate Magicjack from the task Manager.

== Privacy Concerns ==

Passions about privacy vary greatly. For example, some object to Google Mail's targeted advertising (by analyzing mail). Yet, it's a hugely popular email service. For some, such concerns may appear to be excessive or unfounded paranoia. For others, paranoia is just another word for &quot;perceptive.&quot;

Similarly, this topic can be divisive among MagicJack users. The following is merely presented to acknowledge a viewpoint which has been expressed on user forums frequently enough that it can't be dismissed as &quot;fringe.&quot;

* Tracking phone numbers called by users, for the purpose of selling targeted advertising (which has not yet materialized).
* Open-ended [http://www.magicjack.com/tos/ Terms of Service]. Suggested by some to allow future malware activities and related to criticisms of poor programming, some of the behaviors of the softphone have been [http://www.magicjacksupport.com/post23638.html#23638 suggested to be malware-like].

== Business Practices ==

These topics have created the worst feedback about MagicJack, and contentiousness among its users. They can be difficult to excuse as &quot;you get what you pay for.&quot; Individually, any few of these might be viewed as innocent mistakes. But, the prevalance or seriousness of any (or all) have caused concern even among the most satisfied MagicJack customers.

* [http://www.magicjacksupport.com/major-rip-off-by-majic-jack-t3322.html Overcharging].
*Charging credit cards after service had been clearly cancelled.
* Not disclosing to debit-card purchasers that funds will be reserved immediately, not 30 days later. (There have been reports of [http://www.magicjacksupport.com/magicjack-is-a-joke-ripoff-fraud-t1646.html debit cards charged before the 30-day trial]. But, it's not clear if these customers were merely confused about how pre-authorizations work with debit cards.

MagicJack sued Boing Boing for discussing negative behaviors similar to those presented on this page. The DSLR article contains a link to the actual court documents. (MagicJack lost and was ordered to pay $50,000.).

These types of things have resulted in disappointment among (and contention between) many MagicJack customers. But, they usually suffix their complaints with &quot;but, it's still a great bargain.&quot; 

It has also led to negative feedback to consumer reporting/protection agencies:

It has been pointed out that these consumer organizations have a conflict of interest (to publish negative feedback in order to encourage the accused to join their respective organization for &quot;assistance&quot; cleaning up their reputation). This could explain these complaints to some extent. But, those organizations aren't making up the complaints.

      <text xml:space="preserve">__TOC__

The following are topics which commonly arise among new users.

== Voice Mail ==
Accessing your voice mail (and customizing greetings) is [[MagicJack/Support_Resources/FAQ#How do I personalize my voice mail greeting? | described here]].

== How to remove the MagicJack device ==

Windows users should always use &quot;Safely remove hardware.&quot; Please see [[MagicJack/Support Resources/FAQ#Should I just unplug my MagicJack USB device? | this FAQ article]] for more information.

== Powered USB hubs ==

It's such a common recommendation to use a powered USB hub, that you might as well get this topic under your belt by reviewing: [[MagicJack/Support Resources/FAQ#Why do I keep hearing so much about &quot;powered USB hubs&quot;? | Why do I keep hearing so much about &quot;powered USB hubs&quot;?]].

== Redemption of extra years ==
If you purchased extra years, be sure to watch for the email containing the redemption code, and to redeem it in your [http://my.magicjack.com account portal]. If you don't receive it, check your spam filters to see if it was intercepted. There are occasional complaints of users who didn't receive the redemption code (or didn't understand its significance), and it doesn't become apparent until their first year expires.

== 30-day Trial ==

The 30-day trial generates a fair share of confusion among new users. To minimize surprises, be aware of the following:

* The 30-day trial begins the day you order, not the day you receive the device, its better to buy at a store and activate to insure that you get the full 30-day trial.

* You may be charged before the end of the 30-day trial if you purchased extra years, so-called expedited handling, or more than one MagicJack. And, you may be charged (or funds reserved) if you used a debit card.

== Requesting help ==

See the page [[MagicJack/Support_Resources/Requesting_Help | Requesting Help]], and especially the information on that page about information commonly requested when someone asks for help. All too often someone will post &quot;why people can't hear me?&quot; leading to a dozen questions for clarification (Did this start after a period of no problem? is a handset used? Do you use a router? Did you check your volume setting? Do you use a powered hub?). Providing too much information is better than too little. It will save everyone time, and possibly lead to more responses, and better ones.

== General ==

=== Should I just unplug my MagicJack USB device? ===

: '''Windows'''

: No. You should always use &quot;Safely remove hardware&quot; (from the task tray) before removing the USB device. This is because a flash drive exists on the USB device. And, the softphone opens that drive every 3 seconds with write access (for unknown reasons). It is inevitable that the drive will be corrupted if you unplug the USB device without first &quot;Safely removing&quot; it. 

: There are occasional reports of MagicJack users encountering a &quot;Broken Storage&quot; error. It's possible that this is caused by removing the device while the softphone is updating it (or before the operating system has flushed the cache).

: There are also reports of MagicJack users losing their contacts. This data stored on the flash drive too (as AddressBook.xml).

: It's better to err on the side of caution: use &quot;Safely remove hardware.&quot;

: See also: [[MagicJack/Support Resources/How-To/Exit Softphone|How-To: Exit Softphone]], and [[#Can_I_shut_down_my_computer_without_removing_the_USB_device.3F | FAQ: Can I shut down my computer without removing the USB device?]]


For Mac users, either:
* A: Drag the MagicJack icon on your desktop to the trash or 
* B: Right click on the MagicJack icon on the desktop and select &quot;Eject...&quot;

=== Can I shut down my computer without removing the USB device? ===

: It's recommended that you remove the USB device before shutting down. If you remove the device, gracefully closing the softphone, it apparently informs the MagicJack servers that you are offline. This causes the voicemail to answer immediately instead of after 4-6 rings (or worse, generating a busy signal).

: '''Windows'''

: You should [[#Should I just unplug my MagicJack USB device? | follow the method to remove the USB device]]. Also be aware that shutting down with the USB device connected implies that you would boot up with it connected. [[#Why can't I boot with the USB device connected? | This can be problematic with some computers.]]

=== Can I make test calls without bothering anyone? ===

: You can test your MagicJack, and get an idea of what the other party hears, by calling the special echo-test number: 909-390-0003. This number will echo everything back to you with a slight delay.

=== Why do I keep hearing so much about &quot;powered USB hubs&quot;? ===

: The USB 2.0 standard provides for 500ma of power. However, it seems many computer manufacturers (and even external-hub manufacturers) skimp on the amount of power they provide. There have been many complaints about [[#How do I fix common handset problems? | handset problems]] apparently associated with insufficient power.

: More importantly, it is theoretically possible that a demand for too much power could burn out a poorly designed USB circuit. There has been at least one report of this happening.

: Therefore, an external powered USB hub would be good insurance against such damage. And, a hub with an especially high power capacity could eliminate handset-related problems. 

=== How do I find my softphone version? ===

: '''Windows'''

: There is no exact way to determine a version. Users usually compare a few things.

:# File versions
:#* Find your mjusbsp directory (usually in a directory like /profiles/{username}/Application Data/). For the following three files, right click them, click &quot;Properties,&quot; and the &quot;Version&quot; tab.
:#** magicJack.dll
:#** magicJack.exe
:#** magicJackLoader.exe
:# Registry version
:#* Follow [http://www.magicjacksupport.com/post24793.html#24793 these instructions].

=== How do I find my serial number? ===

: '''Windows'''

: Follow [http://www.magicjacksupport.com/post24466.html#24466 these instructions].

=== What's the difference in USB device (dongle) generations? ===

: There are three known generations of the MagicJack USB device (also called a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongle dongle]). If your device doesn't match one of the following images, please post to [[MagicJack/Support Resources/Requesting Help#Alternative forums|one of the forums]] with a close-up photo.

[[File:MagicJack_device_gen1.jpg|thumbnail|right|80px|Gen. 1]]

&lt;!-- This is a template to keep the heading out of the TOC --&gt;
: {{hiddenh4|Gen 1}}
: This device was shipped through at least May 2008. It was always differentiated from Gen 2 by the absence of a &quot;white rectangle&quot; behind the top of the &quot;J&quot;.

[[File:MagicJack_device_gen2.jpg|thumbnail|right|80px|Gen. 2]]

&lt;!-- This is a template to keep the heading out of the TOC --&gt;
: {{hiddenh4|Gen 2}}
: This device became available in May 2008. It is unclear how long it was shipped. It was openly referred to as a major revision, fixing problems such as  [[MagicJack/Support Resources/FAQ#How do I fix echo problems?|echo]]. (Prior to this generation, users commonly used the [http://www.dslreports.com/forum/r21433580-Line-Echo-Canceller-Utility TigerJet echo cancellation utility]. It has been reported that this is unnecessary with this new generation.).

: This generation is identified by:

:# A large white rectangle which appears to be painted on the circuit board, behind the top of the &quot;J&quot;.
:# A tall, round metal thing immediately to the right of the white rectangle. 

[[File:MagicJack_device_gen3.jpg|thumbnail|right|80px|Gen. 3]]

&lt;!-- This is a template to keep the heading out of the TOC --&gt;
: {{hiddenh4|Gen 3}}

: This generation caused some confusion because those who possessed it, and never saw a Gen 2 believed they had a Gen 2 because of the small silver'ish square behind the top of the &quot;J&quot; (believed to be the white rectangle referred to as the distinguishing feature between Gens 1 and 2). Likewise, those who possessed a Gen 2, but never a Gen 1 believed this was a Gen 1 because it didn't have the large white rectangle described above.

: It's not clear whether this device offers any improvement over Gen 2, or whether it is just an engineering change to reduce manufacturing costs. It may be more appropriate to refer to this generation as 2a.

: It is best identified by: 
:# A small silver'ish square behind the top of the &quot;J&quot;, with solder points on both sides.
:# No tall, round metal thing immediately to the right. Just a largely empty space.

: {{hiddenh4|Gen 4}}
: This can be seen by a little &quot;tree&quot; like symbol above the &quot;k&quot; in &quot;MagicJack&quot;. [[File:Magic jack rev4-01.jpg|thumb|right|80px|MagicJack rev4-01]]
[[File:Magic jack rev4-02.jpg|thumb|right|80px|MagicJack rev4-02]]

&lt;!-- This is a template to keep the heading out of the TOC --&gt;
: {{hiddenh4|Gen 2.5?}}
: I have a MJ that is still working without MJMD5 it is similar to to the Gen3 pictured here except it is missing resistor R7 (bank of resistors in the upper left. 5th resistor in from left to right)like the Gen2 device is also missing

=== Why does (or doesn't) my softphone start automatically? ===

: '''Windows'''

: In the user forums, some people describe starting the softphone by plugging in the MagicJack USB device. Others refer to using a shortcut to start it. The difference is that the latter group of people have [http://support.microsoft.com/kb/126025 disabled Windows &quot;autorun&quot; feature].

: The USB device presents itself as a CD-ROM. This is why autorun detects it and automatically starts it. Some people disable this feature because of possible security risks. In this case, they have to start MagicJack using the shortcut on the desktop which MagicJack automatically creates.

=== Can I use MagicJack with satellite, muni-wifi, cellular (EVDO) broadband? ===

: Probably not. These forms of communication suffer from latency, which VOIP is susceptible to.

: However, there have been reports of it working. 

: You can try a VOIP speed test to see how your connection scores. Be sure to wait for the five vertical tabs on the right side. Go to the summary tab, and look at the &quot;detailed analysis.&quot; This is more important than the summary information. It will show you the actual delay and speed, not just the &quot;max.&quot; The averages can be more important than the max.

=== Can I use MagicJack with dial-up internet? ===

: Probably not. MagicJack requires 100kbs up and down. Dial up is less than that, with potentially high latency.

=== Can I use a cordless phone with my MagicJack? ===

: Yes, you can. However, cordless phones operating at 2.4GHz are known to interfere with Wi-Fi wireless B/G networks (IEEE b/g operating at 2.4GHz). Cordless phones operating at 5.8GHz or higher will not interfere with Wi-Fi. If any computers in your house use wireless connections to your router, you should carefully consider which frequency of cordless phone that you use.

=== Do I need to open ports through my firewall? ===

:The following sub-section is for novice users so they can better understand the concepts and terminology used in this answer. If you're familiar with routers and networking, skip to [[#firewall_opening_ports | the next sub-section]].

&lt;!-- This is a template to keep the heading out of the TOC --&gt;
: {{hiddenh4|Concepts and terminology}}
:A router separates the network into a Local Area Network (LAN) and Wide Area Network (WAN). The WAN is often called &quot;the internet,&quot; &quot;extranet&quot; or &quot;public network.&quot; The LAN is often called &quot;the intranet&quot; or &quot;private network.&quot;

:This separation allows multiple computers in the LAN, with their own private IP addresses (usually in the 192.168.x.x range) to share one public IP address (usually assigned by your service provider). This is accomplished using Network Address Translation (NAT). A way to map traffic intended for one destination back to its originator (on your LAN).

:NAT (and other router features) prevent computers on the WAN from opening (initiating) connections to computers on the LAN. To allow this kind of access, routers provide a feature called &quot;port forwarding.&quot; A rule can be written specifying the criteria for the WAN-initiated connection (such as the port on the WAN side of the firewall), and which LAN computer it should be forwarded to. This is called &quot;opening a port&quot; and essentially bypasses your firewall.

:Most software is written to initiate (open) a connection from the LAN computer to the WAN computer. Therefore, many people never have to open ports (WAN to LAN).

:Routers also allow security-conscious users to eliminate access from the LAN to the WAN except for ports that are explicitly allowed. This is common in business environments. But, uncommon for users of consumer-grade routers.

&lt;span id=&quot;firewall_opening_ports&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;!-- This is a template to keep the heading out of the TOC --&gt;
: {{hiddenh4|The question of opening ports}}
: This topic is a source of significant confusion for the following reasons:

:* &quot;Opening ports&quot; is commonly understood to mean opening ports from the WAN into your LAN. But, less commonly, it can also mean opening ports from your LAN to the WAN when access to the internet has been intentionally restricted.
:* Some consumer-grade routers have buggy firmware. They often work with MagicJack by disabling the firewall, or forwarding ports from the WAN to the LAN, (perhaps large ranges of ports), which is equivalent to disabling the firewall (to various degrees).
:* MagicJack support tells customers to open some ports, but not all ports used by MagicJack.

: The confusion occurs because those who recommend opening ports rarely qualify their suggestion to indicate why, or under what circumstances they've seen this necessary. 

: The first thing to understand is: MagicJack's servers open '''no''' ports on your computer. '''All connections are initiated by the MagicJack softphone to MagicJack servers.''' This means there is '''never''' a reason to open ports (port forwarding) from the WAN to the LAN.

: The only people who have benefited from opening ports (port forwarding) from WAN to LAN are those with buggy router firmware, as described below.

&lt;!-- This is a template to keep the heading out of the TOC --&gt;
: {{hiddenh4|Restrictive access to the WAN}}
: Consumer routers normally allow unrestricted access to the WAN by default. Some users (and corporate environments) with a strong sense of security will block all access to the WAN, allowing only explicitly-defined access. These users must &quot;open ports&quot; (undo their uncommon restriction) to allow access from the LAN to the WAN. (This is not port forwarding, WAN to LAN access.). These users should read  [[MagicJack/Support Resources/How-To/Proxy Find2#Background|the background concerning servers MagicJack connects to]].

&lt;span id=&quot;firewall_buggy_router_firmware&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;!-- This is a template to keep the heading out of the TOC --&gt;
: {{hiddenh4|Buggy router firmware}}
: Some consumer-grade routers have buggy firmware. Something about MagicJack's traffic confuses their NAT processing. This has been reported the most by users of newer Linksys routers, coinciding with a report of a known problem with Linksys WRT54G router firmware, v. 5 and above. (The problems reported are usually calls terminated after exactly 30 seconds, and the phone ringing indefinitely after a call has been answered by voice mail. See the FAQ Answer: [[#Why_do_my_calls_disconnect.3F | why do my calls disconnect?]]).

: The easiest way to determine whether your router has buggy firmware is to eliminate your router by connecting directly to the modem. Otherwise, disable your router (often done by enabling &quot;DMZ&quot; mode for the IP address of the LAN computer running MagicJack). See the [[#firewall_disable_warning | warning]] below.

: If your router firmware is buggy, the possible solutions are:

:# Upgrade the router's firmware to the latest version found on the manufacturer's product page (web site).
:# Replace the router's firmware with an open source firmware such as Tomato or DD-WRT. (The added benefit of this solution is that you will have additional features, including robust  [[MagicJack/Support Resources/How-To/QoS|QoS to improve sound quality]].).
:# Buy a different router.
:# Open ports (port forwarding, WAN to LAN) on your router, or enable DMZ mode. (See the [[#firewall_disable_warning | warning]] below.).

: The option to open ports (either selectively, or using DMZ mode) is just to bypass the router's buggy NAT translation. It is not because MagicJack servers initiate connections.

: To selectively open ports, you should familiarize yourself with  [[MagicJack/Support Resources/How-To/Proxy Find2#Background|the background concerning servers MagicJack connects to]]. You will see that there are a very large number of ports that may require opening. The more ports you open, the more it's like disabling your firewall (see the [[#firewall_disable_warning | warning]] below).

: One user of a buggy Linksys router reported a workaround using only one open port: The port which the MagicJack softphone connects to on the LAN side of the router when the softphone is idle (not in a call). His solution was to use [http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/bb897437.aspx TCPview] to see the connections made by &quot;MagicJack.exe&quot;. Two or more of those connections will be to a port with a very high number (30000 to 70000) in the &quot;Local Address&quot; column. Using that port number, go into your router and use the &quot;Port Forwarding&quot; to forward that port to the IP address of the computer running the MagicJack softphone. 

: This solution makes no sense and demonstrates the buggy nature of some newer Linksys routers. It treats an internal (LAN) port as an external (WAN) port. There is no actual traffic to forward on that WAN port. It's just a way to trick the router's buggy firmware. 

: The benefit of this solution is that you only have to open one port, reducing your risk to external (WAN) threats. The downside is that you'll have to do this every time you start MagicJack because the port changes.

&lt;span id=&quot;firewall_disable_warning&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
: '''Warning:''' Running without a router (or in DMZ mode) can expose your computer(s) to external threats resulting in viruses, spambot and spyware infestation. Depending upon your tolerance for risk and how long you operate without the router, you may want to use a software firewall on every computer exposed to the WAN.

=== How can I contact MagicJack? ===

: MagicJack provides an unadvertised phone number for billing support but no mailing address or phone number for technical support. Technical support is provided exclusively by chat. Note that you must click a couple links to get to a page where you are asked to search for a solution before having the opportunity to start a chat session. You can search for anything, and then you will see a link saying &quot;If you are not satisfied with the answer below, click here to chat with a Live Agent Representative.&quot;

: The best advice for using MagicJack chat support is to be prepared for a long chat session. Don't get angry or frustrated. Keep in mind that the chat rep is probably just as frustrated to repeat the same pointless scripted suggestions as you are to hear them. It is a formality they are required to do before escalating a problem, or providing a replacement. If you're not in the right frame of mind, you'll only waste your own time. You might as well wait to start the chat until you're in the right mood, with a lot of free time.

&lt;!-- This is a template to keep the heading out of the TOC --&gt;
: {{hiddenh4|Escalation}}
: When using support chat, it has been reported that customers have the right to request escalation. This may be useful if, after spending 3 hours going through the standard scripted resolutions the problem isn't resolved. If you request escalation you'll be sent to a chat supervisor. From there you can ask that your issue be escalated to the engineering staff. You may not get a tracking number, nor any further contact. You may have to continue going back to chat support asking for an update to what you already escalated.

: It has also been reported that users with no resolution were able to get a resolution merely by contacting chat support a few hours (or days) later. It appears that the quality of the support you receive depends on which chat rep you get. Or, perhaps they keep a log of your requests, and eventually realize you're not going away.

: Also, it has been reported that users who go back for unresolved problems are put through the 3-hour scripted process each time they go back. It has been noted by one user that simply acting like you're following their instructions can be an effective stress-reducer. You can just say &quot;ok, I've done that. What's next?&quot; Let them go through their exercise which they're required to follow.

&lt;!-- This is a template to keep the heading out of the TOC --&gt;
: {{hiddenh5|Contact info}}
&lt;span id=&quot;MJ_contact_info&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

: Although MagicJack does not provide this information to customers, the following business address and phone numbers may be useful if you need to escalate a problem further:

:; Mailing Address : MagicJack LP
:: PO Box 6846
:: West Palm Beach, FL 33405
:: Contact: Peter Russo - CFO

There is also a priority call waiting feature so you are alerted of important calls that are waiting.

=== How do I cancel call waiting? ===

: MagicJack does not provide any way to do this.

: You can however use the downloadable &quot;Magicfeatures&quot; software plugin for magicJack.  Just dial 70 before the number you wish to call.  Call waiting can also be fully disabled for all calls.

=== How can I record phone call conversations? ===

: MagicJack does not provide any way to do this.

: You can however use the downloadable &quot;Magicfeatures&quot; software plugin for magicJack.  Just dial *** at any time during an incoming or outgoing call to start recording.

=== How can I hook up an external answering machine? ===

: Just set your answering machine to pick up after 3 rings.

: You can however use the downloadable &quot;Magicfeatures&quot; software plugin for magicJack.  It provides a double ringing feature that helps maximize the amount of time available for answering machine pickup before calls roll over to voice mail.

=== How can I disable the Voice Mail timeout? ===

: The delay before voicemail answers the call can be set anywhere from 5 seconds to 3 minutes with the online control panel at http://my.MagicJack.com. This is located in the &quot;Call Features / Voicemail On/Off/Delay&quot; section.

: You can however use the free MagicRingForever plug-in to creatively disable the Voice Mail timeout allowing continuous ringing. 

=== How can I enable call forwarding? ===

: Just log into your magicJack web based account and enable the call forwarding feature.  You must log in again to disable it.

: You can however use the downloadable &quot;Magicfeatures&quot; software plugin for magicJack  Just dial 72/73 to enable and disable call forwarding.

=== How do I do 3-way calling? ===

: MagicJack does not allow you to do 3-way calling with calls you initiate. However, you can do 3-way calling if the other parties call you. 

:# Have both parties call you.
:# With one party on the line, and one on hold (using call waiting), simply press &lt;tt&gt;##&lt;/tt&gt; to start a three-way call.
:# Press &lt;tt&gt;#*&lt;/tt&gt; to end the three-way call.

=== Can I disable 911? ===

: The closest you can come to disabling MagicJack's Enhanced 911 is to provide an address that is completely invalid. Follow these steps:

:# At the bottom of the softphone, click on the window showing the 911 address, and click &quot;Add a New Location.&quot;
:# Login.
:# Provide an address that is completely invalid (and indicates your intention). For example:
:#* Street Number: 911 
:#* Street Name: I am disabling it
:#* Street Type: Alley (because it's required)
:#* City: Disable 911
:#* Zip: 00000
:#* Additional Detail: Disable 911 

: After saving this address, and making it the currently-selected address in your softphone, the 911 indicator will turn yellow. According to MagicJack tech. support, this means there will be no response to a 911 call.

=== How can I find available area codes and prefixes? ===

: There are two ways to do this.

:# If you are a MagicJack customer, you can go to your account portal and follow the links to change your phone number. You can take this as far as to see available area codes and prefixes before committing to change your number.
:# Type in http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_code_xxx where xxx is the three-digit area code, like http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_code_202 for Washington, DC or http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Area_code_312 for the &quot;loop&quot; area of downtown Chicago, etc. Wikipedia has a complete list of area codes and often has prefixes or has links to resources that list prefixes.

=== How can I keep my existing number and port it over to MagicJack? ===


: There are cheap alternatives though, that would allow you to keep your existing number for incoming calls, and then you could still use your MagicJack for outgoing calls. 

Added 12/1/2011- You need to contact your phonce service to make sure they will release your number. Then you sign up with MagicJack for a random number and change it in your account under &quot;My Subscriptions&quot;. You can chat online with a live &quot;agent&quot; (I believe it was a computer) and they can help you but the key is, signing up first with a random number.

== Problems ==

=== How do I fix common handset problems? ===

: If you use a handset attached to the MagicJack device, and you have trouble 

:# Numbers pressed on the handset keypad (tones) not recognized by the softphone.
:# Incoming calls don't cause phone to ring.
:# People you call can't hear you, or of low volume.
:# No caller id displayed on a (caller id-capable) handset.

:The first thing to check is the softphone's Menu-&gt;Telephone/Headset setting.  Be sure it's set for Telephone.  This setting can be changed either by Menu-&gt;switch to phone (you'll see option as &quot;switch to headset&quot; if it's set for phone) or by Menu-&gt;Volume/Headset Control dialog box.  This setting apparently changes to headset if softphone is run without MJ dongle present.

:The second thing to check is the softphone's Menu-&gt;Volume/Headset Control. Be sure the microphone volume is turned up. Experiment with different speaker and microphone volumes, as the perfect setting is specific to your individual machine/handset. MagicJack recommends that both of them be 1/3 of the volume. It has been experienced that the volume setting can inexplicably change. (Perhaps due to other programs changing the sound card's line-in volume, affecting other applications.). Also, if possible, check the volume settings on your handset/headset.

:To isolate problems, try the softphone with a headset connected to the computer's speaker/mic jacks. If you can make successful calls, this indicates the problem is specific to the handset, USB device and/or USB port.

&lt;!-- This is a template to keep the heading out of the TOC --&gt;
: {{hiddenh4|Handset issues}}
: Different handsets have different power requirements. Try a different handset. Particularly helpful may be handsets with their own (AC-adapter) power source, such as wireless base stations. (But, if you connect to your router wirelessly, be careful to use [[#Can I use a cordless phone with my MagicJack? | wireless phones that use a frequency which won't interfere with wi-fi]].).

: Some telephones seem to be sensitive to the MagicJack device as it pertains to caller ID. 

: See the FAQ answer: [[#Why_doesn.27t_my_handset_display_caller_ID.3F | Why doesn't my handset display caller ID?]].

&lt;!-- This is a template to keep the heading out of the TOC --&gt;
: {{hiddenh4|USB issues}}
: This is a common problem which appears to be related to 
:# the MagicJack USB device's relatively high power requirements (perhaps combined with some handsets having high power requirements), and 
:# the fact that some motherboard (and external hub) manufacturers skimp on power. 

: Using a powered USB hub is often reported to fix handset problems. However, be aware that not all powered hubs are created equal. They too can skimp on power. If a powered hub doesn't fix the problem, try it without anything else connected to the hub. Consider the power capacity which should be printed on the AC adapter. And, try another hub.

: See also the FAQ: [[#Why_do_I_keep_hearing_so_much_about_.22powered_USB_hubs.22.3F | Why do I keep hearing so much about &quot;powered USB hubs?&quot;]].

: USB issues can also contribute to &quot;choppy voice.&quot; See the How-To:  [[MagicJack/Support Resources/How-To/Choppy Voice#Specific to using a handset|Choppy voice, Specific to using a handset]].

&lt;!-- This is a template to keep the heading out of the TOC --&gt;
: {{hiddenh4|Connector issues}}
: It has been reported by a few people that the pig-tail USB cable supplied with MagicJack (as of late 2008) isn't high quality and may cause problems with handset usage. 

: This connector problem can result in mysterious shutdown (and perhaps restart) of the softphone. See the FAQ: [[#Why does my softphone stop (or restart)? | Why does my softphone stop (or restart)?]]. This is not specific to using a handset, but may be aggravated by the fact that using a handset may cause more movement of the USB device.

: A quick test is to connect the USB device directly to a USB port. Or, use another USB extension cable of higher quality.

=== Why doesn't my handset display caller ID? ===

: It could be related to insufficient power to the USB device. See this FAQ answer concerning [[#Why do I keep hearing so much about &quot;powered USB hubs&quot;? | powered USB hubs]].

: Also see this workaround involving [http://www.magicjacksupport.com/post785.html#785 a homemade RJ11 connector and a 100k-ohm resister].

: The downloadable Magicfeatures Plugin for magicJack provides a proper permanent fix to the real underlying caller id display problem.  It also provides full caller id name display support with real time online reverse number lookup as well as call waiting caller id support.

: Note: The 12/17/2008 upgrade seemed to cause this fix to stop working for some people. It was later reported that experimenting with different resisters helped, and one person [http://www.magicjacksupport.com/poll-did-you-use-the-100k-mod-to-fix-your-caller-id-issue-t461-15.html reported a 220k-ohm resister worked]. Also one report that the USB device's case may contribute to this problem, and that [http://www.magicjacksupport.com/post28439.html#28439 wrapping electrical tape around the device's case helped].


=== How do I fix choppy (garbled/robot) voice? ===

: This is caused by not enough CPU power, using wireless, bandwidth competition (which is helped using  [[MagicJack/Support Resources/How-To/QoS|QoS]]), or the MagicJack proxy you are connected to (which can be tested using [[#How do I find/change my proxy? | finding and changing your proxy]]. 

: For a complete walkthrough, see the How-To:  [[MagicJack/Support Resources/How-To/Choppy Voice|Fix choppy voice]].

=== How do I fix echo problems? ===

: Echo was a greater problem with the first generation of MagicJack devices sold prior to May 2008. An echo cancellation utility was used to reduce echo. The new generation(s) have anti-echo features built into the device. (See FAQ Answer: [[#What's the difference in USB device (dongle) generations? | What's the difference in USB device (dongle) generations?]]).

: However, it's possible to still hear echo using new generations of the device. These are possible solutions:

:# Go into the softphone's Menu (in the system tray near the clock) -&gt;Volume/Headset control and turn the microphone volume down. 
:# When dialing the number, use a star (*) in the second position. For example, if you were going to dial 555-555-5555, dial 5*55-555-5555. 
:#* Be aware that the softphone may try to dial the number before you enter the last digit. You may have to go to your &quot;Calls&quot; history, single click the failed call so it fills into the text entry field, add the last digit, and then click &quot;Send.&quot;
:#* Notes: 
:#** This (*) trick used to be referred to as the *67 trick. However, the latter stopped functioning after an upgrade late Dec. 2008, [http://www.magicjacksupport.com/post26923.html#26923 when it was found * works].
:#** The * trick may also be a workaround to MJ being [[#Why can't I call certain numbers? | unable call certain numbers]].
:# Handset users have reported mixed results [http://www.magicjacksupport.com/post28277.html#28277 using a DSL filter] between the MagicJack USB device and the handset.
:# In headset mode to remove echo, instead of using the computer speakers, use headphones and your regular regular microphone.

=== Why can't I call certain numbers? ===

: This problem affects a few people. It's not understood why. One workaround is: 

:# When dialing the number, use a star (*) in the second position. For example, if you were going to dial 555-555-5555, dial 5*55-555-5555. 
:#* Be aware that the softphone may try to dial the number before you enter the last digit. You may have to go to your &quot;Calls&quot; history, single click the failed call so it fills into the text entry field, add the last digit, and then click &quot;Send.&quot;
:#* Note that this * trick used to be referred to as the *67 trick. However, the latter stopped functioning after an upgrade late Dec. 2008, [http://www.magicjacksupport.com/post26924.html#26924 when it was found * works].
:# Magicjack can't call &quot;high cost&quot; surcharged numbers such as chat lines or conference lines, as well as 900 or 976 numbers, and some surcharged exchanges in Alaska which are subject to high-cost connection rates. If you have a cell phone you can probably call them at no extra cost. If you really want to call one of these numbers from Magic Jack, you can buy international minutes and use those.

: Note: that the * trick may also be a workaround for [[#How do I fix echo problems? | echo problems]].

=== Why do my calls disconnect? ===

: If you connect to your router wirelessly, this could be due to wireless interference. To eliminate this as a possible cause, connect to your router using a wire (and be sure you're actually connecting with the wire by disabling your wireless connection either on your computer, or in your router's admin screen).

: This  [[MagicJack/Support Resources/How-To/Choppy Voice#Connecting to your router wirelessly|wireless sub-topic related to choppy/garbled voice]] is relevant.

&lt;!-- This is a template to keep the heading out of the TOC --&gt;
:{{hiddenh4|30-second inbound disconnect}}
: This problem is reported occasionally. It seems to be related to newer Linksys routers with buggy firmware, an inability to handle Network Address Translation (NAT) properly. The only way to find out if you're affected by this problem is to bypass your router and connect directly to your cable/DSL modem. Be aware that this can expose you to external threats which a router protects you from. You shouldn't do it (for long) without a software firewall. 

: For more information, see the FAQ Answer: Do I need to open ports through my router?, [[#firewall_buggy_router_firmware | buggy router firmware]].

: In addition to the 30-second disconnect, users of newer Linksys routers have reported a problem where the phone keeps ringing even after it was answered by voice mail. [http://www.magicjacksupport.com/incoming-calls-t4122.html Two people reported this problem], and that, like the 30-second disconnect, it could only be fixed by eliminating the firewall (putting the router in a DMZ, etc.).

=== Why can't I boot with the USB device connected? ===

: ''' Windows '''

: The BIOS of computers contains an option to choose the &quot;boot devices&quot; or &quot;boot sequence.&quot; This contains the devices which should be attempted to be booted from, and the order they should be attempted. However, some BIOS/computer manufacturers implemented this feature before it was perfected. It's not uncommon for computers to hang on a non-bootable USB device. You should go into your BIOS (the keys to press during boot should be displayed on the screen, usually &quot;Delete&quot; or &quot;F2&quot; or &quot;F12&quot;) and either remove USB devices from the list of bootable devices, or move that choice lower than the device you want to boot from.

Also, booting with the USB device connected implies that you shut down with it connected. Be aware that [[#Can I shut down my computer without removing the USB device? | that can cause problems too]].

=== Why does my softphone stop (or restart)? ===

: This is usually due to a poor fit between the pig-tail connector and the USB device. Movement can cause the connection to be lost, as if you unplugged the USB device. 

: '''Windows'''

: You may hear the familiar &quot;bee-boop&quot; sound when USB hardware is removed (and maybe added). If you disabled autorun, the softphone will notice the softphone shut down for no reasons. Otherwise, you may notice that it seems to restart for no reason.

: A quick test is to connect the USB device directly to a USB port. Or, use another USB extension cable of higher quality.

=== Why can't I reach voice mail? ===

: This is a common problem on MagicJack's servers. It can only be fixed by MagicJack. However, it seems that chat support is unfamiliar with it. This means you'll be put through hours of scripted diagnostics to fix your system when the problem has nothing to do with your system. You should read the [[#How_can_I_contact_MagicJack.3F |instructions for escalating support issues]] which includes suggestions for escalating and pretending to follow their scripted responses just to satisfy their requirements.

: A workaround is to add your MagicJack phone number to the softphone's &quot;Contacts,&quot; and add three asterisks (&lt;tt&gt;***&lt;/tt&gt;) to the end of that number. It's been reported that this will get you into voice mail. And, also solves problems calling other MagicJack phone numbers.

: Alternatively, log on to your MagicJack account, go to &quot;My Numbers&quot; Tab. Add an additional email and password for your voice mail. It would appear that having two email addresses for your voice mail, now makes selection of your first email address effective.  This action also enables the user to now access the vmail, and receive voice mail via email.

: MagicJack has at least one time issued a number which was already assigned to another party. If you can call out, but cannot receive calls or access voicemail it may be because the number issued was hijacked. You may need to call the number several times throughout the day to see if someone answers the line. If this is the case, you will need to advise tech support that the number is issued to another party and escalate the call to the Engineers to get the number changed for free. Be aware it will take an un-determined amount of time but is routinely resolved within 48 hours.

=== Cannot see my contact in MagicJack after logging in. contact list will just inform you &quot;downloading contact please wait&quot; ===

: SYMPTOMS - you will be able to successfully log in to MagicJack but you wont be able to see your contact after a few day 1 or 2 day it will became a 401 error

: SOLUTION - updating the driver of your lan or wifi device from the original manufacturer of the device. EX. your motherboard brand is MSI,ASUS,intel and etc and the Lan/ethercard brand manufacturer realtek,Cnet and etc you should download latest driver on their site not the motherboard site they have the latest driver update for that device.

Known issue &quot;windows 7 environment&quot;- MSI H55M-E23 with a realtek RTL8111x lan. &quot;you will have no internet issue just MagicJack on v7.043 driver and you will be wondering if its a firewall blocking MagicJack &quot; 
MagicJack using lan/ethercard v7.043 driver MagicJack will not be able to download your contact.

=== How can I place Skype calls with my regular or cordless phone? ===

: Use the downloadable &quot;Skyjack&quot; software plugin to enable Skype calling.

=== How can I call using a different phone provider like CallCentric, SipGate, VoipBuster or connect to an Asterisk PBX? ===

: Use the downloadable &quot;Xlitejack&quot; software plugin to enable X-Lite SIP calling.

=== How do I find/change my proxy? ===

: To find out which proxy you use, see the How-To:  [[MagicJack/Support Resources/How-To/Proxy Find2|Find your proxy]].

: To change the proxy you use, see the How-To:  [[MagicJack/Support Resources/How-To/Proxy Change|Change your proxy]].

=== Can I use the magicJack service with my ATA? ===

: According to the magicJack [http://www.MagicJack.com/tos Terms of Service], you cannot. However, on January 6th, a hacker by the name of stroths cracked the magicJack encryption, and posted his tool [http://www.magicjacksupport.com/stroths-mj-utilities-suite-sip-grabber-upgrader-and-more-t4230.html here]. With this tool, you are able to get your SIP password.

UPDATE: As of the June 2009 update, MagicJack has changed their authentication algorithm, in order to
use ATA or other devices, a special authentication proxy is necessary. Programmers have developed a
&quot;man in the middle&quot; proxy to pass the authentication.

UPDATE: As of the October 2010 update, MagicJack has once again plugged the hole thus not allowing authentication in the aforementioned &quot;man in the middle&quot; proxy rendering ATA's useless.  There are no foreseen plans to further hack and provide an exploit to the latest MJ update (as of early December 2010).

=== Can I stop the popup dialer window? ===

=== Can I stop the splash screen? ===

: Yes. See the How-To:  [[MagicJack/Support Resources/How-To/Splash Screen|Bypass Splash Screen]].

: You can also just install the Magicsilence plugin (http://tools.pcphonesoft.com).  It will also stop the popup windows and keep your applications focused when a call arrives.

=== Can I run the softphone without the USB device? ===

: Yes. This is often referred to as &quot;dongleless.&quot; See the How-To  [[MagicJack/Support Resources/How-To/MJ Without Dongle|MJ Without Dongle]].

=== Can MagicJack be used while connected to a VPN? ===

: Yes. See the How-To:  [[MagicJack/Support Resources/How-To/VPN|Coexist with a VPN]].

=== Can I change the drive letters used by MagicJack? ===

: Yes. See the How-To:  [[MagicJack/Support Resources/How-To/Assign Drive Letters|Assign Drive Letters]].

=== How do I uninstall? ===

: '''Windows'''

: MagicJack now provides an uninstall feature as a separate standalone program..  It can also be found by using [http://www.MagicJack.com/faq/ magicJack's official FAQ] and searching on the word &quot;uninstall&quot;. Some have reported that some registry keys may be left behind, but they seem to be harmless.

: Prior to the availability of this program, instructions were written and published [http://www.uninstallmagicjack.com on the Internet]. However, editing your registry can be dangerous. 

: See also [[MagicJack/Support Resources/How-To/Completely Remove MJ]]
Now you can uninstall the MagicJack from the Add/Remove Programs through Control panel

[http://www.voip-info.org/wiki/view/QoS QoS] is a router function to give priority to some internet traffic at the expense of other traffic. For example, giving higher priority to VOIP (voice) traffic so web browsing and file transfers don't interfere. A [http://vonage.nmhoy.net/qos.html basic primer on QoS] is available.

QoS can dramatically improve voice quality, fixing the oft-reported &quot;choppy voice&quot; problem. However, if not configured properly, it can make things ''much'' worse.

There are a few ways to obtain the benefits of QoS. They are described below.

== QoS and Tomato ==

See this How-To: [[MagicJack/Support Resources/How-To/QoS/Tomato | Configuring the free Tomato router firmware QoS]] for MagicJack.

== Other routers ==

Some consumer routers provide (often minimal) QoS capabilities. The more detailed how-to articles (above) may help you understand what to look for, or how it should be configured. 

== QoS with no pain ==

For those who don't want to get too involved in true QoS, see the following simplified solutions. Be aware that these solutions sacrifice flexibility and efficiency for ease of use. Router firmware provides finer control over prioritization, and may have more advanced capabilities like regulating incoming traffic (which, as described in [[MagicJack/Support_Resources/How-To/QoS/Tomato#Step_2:_Basic_Settings_--_Inbound | the Tomato QoS How-To]], isn't really QoS but a custom feature of the firmware).

=== Hawking Broadband Booster ===

[http://www.hawkingtech.com/products/productlist.php?CatID=36&amp;FamID=80&amp;ProdID=233 Hawking Broadband Booster] is a &quot;QoS-in-a-box&quot; product which automatically configures itself. MagicJack users have reported good results using this.

=== Software ===

A software solution is appropriate if you have no other computers sharing your network connection.

== Windows ==

Setting the priority of the magicjack.exe process is performed manually like this:

# Alt-Ctrl-Delete to get into Task Manager.
# Locate the magicjack.exe process.
# Right click that process, and set the priority to High.

This can be automated in one of the following ways:

# Use [http://www.prnwatch.com/prio.html Prio], a commercial product which is free for personal use. It has other useful features.
# Use [http://www.beyondlogic.org/solutions/processutil/processutil.htm Process util], a free tool.
# Script it as follows:
&lt;pre&gt;# Stop the existing process (XP)
tskill magicJack

# Stop the existing process (Vista)
taskkill /f /IM magicjack.exe

# Start a new process with high priority:
cmd.exe /c start &quot;runhigh&quot; /high 
       &quot;[drive]:\Profile\[YourUserName]\Application Data\mjusbsp\magicJack.exe&quot; 
       /foreground /scf _magicJackPersonalDataRoot &quot;[drive]:\magicJack&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;
:* Notes:
:* Remove the line breaks on the &quot;cmd.exe&quot; line. 
:* Keep all the quotes.
:* Replace the bracketed values with values that match your installation. 
::* You can find your mjusbsp folder using &lt;tt&gt;dir mjusbsp /s&lt;/tt&gt; from a command (DOS) window, at the root directory (&lt;tt&gt;cd \&lt;/tt&gt;) of each drive.
::* The &quot;&quot;magicJack&quot; at the end of the cmd line refers to a hidden folder on one of the two drives created when you insert the MagicJack device. You may have to enable &quot;hidden folders&quot; to see it. Google for instructions on how to see hidden folders in Windows.

Warning: MagicJack chat support has instructed Windows users to give priority to '''all''' background processes by right clicking on My Computer, and changing a setting somewhere in there. That's a bad suggestion. It will give equal priority to the very things that are probably causing CPU-related choppiness. All it does is slow down your foreground activities (interactive, screens). Giving priority explicitly to magicjack.exe is a much better solution.

== Windows ==

It is possible to run the soft-phone without the USB device ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dongle dongle]). However, it is not perfect. See the [[#windows_warnings | warnings]] below.

=== Preparation ===

Find your mjusbsp directory using the following command from a DOS (command) window:

&lt;pre&gt;dir mjusbsp /s&lt;/pre&gt;

This location will be used in the steps below.

=== Steps ===

# Plug in the magicJack USB device.
# Start MagicJack if it didn't start automatically. Wait until it is &quot;Ready to call.&quot;
# Go to Windows Task Manager (alt-ctrl-delete to access it.). 
#* Kill the magicjack.exe process.
#* If present, kill the mjsetup.exe process.
# Copy the &quot;magicJack&quot; folder from the MagicJack flash drive to a drive on your computer.
#* For this example we will assume you copied to &quot;C:\magicJack\&quot;. 
# If you don't already have a shortcut on your desktop to the magicJackLoader.exe, make one now. This program is found in your mjusbsp directory, which was located in the preparation step above.
# Right-click on the shortcut, click Properties.
# Replace the &quot;Target&quot; field with: &lt;br/&gt; &lt;code&gt;&quot;{drive:\path_to_mjusbsp}\magicJack.exe&quot; /foreground /scf _magicJackPersonalDataRoot &quot;C:\magicJack&quot;&lt;/code&gt; 
#* Notice the use of &quot;magicJack.exe&quot; instead of &quot;magicJackLoader.exe&quot;
# Put &lt;code&gt;{drive:\path_to_mjusbsp}\mjusbsp&lt;/code&gt; in the &quot;Start in&quot; field.
# Go to Start-&gt;Run, type &quot;msconfig&quot;, go to the Startup tab and disable &quot;cdloader2&quot;.
# With the USB device still installed, run MagicJack using the shortcut you created (or edited).
# After it starts, and is &quot;ready to call,&quot; end MagicJack by going into Task Manager and killing the magicjack.exe process.
# Safely remove the USB device.

You should now be able to start MagicJack using the shortcut you created (or edited). It should start fine and be ready to call.

==== Notes ====

* To end MagicJack without shutting down Windows, see [[MagicJack/Support_Resources/How-To/Exit_Softphone | How-To: Exit Softphone]].
* To start MagicJack with high priority, see [[MagicJack/Support_Resources/How-To/Priority | How-To: Automate Process Priority]]. It is just a change to the shortcut's &quot;Target&quot; field. (However, you should first get &quot;Dongleless&quot; working as descibed above, before proceeding to something more exotic.). Setting MagicJack's process priority to High can be useful to [[MagicJack/Support_Resources/FAQ#How_do_I_fix_choppy_.28garbled.2Frobot.29_voice.3F | fix choppy, garbled voice]].

=== Warnings ===

&lt;!-- This is to allow for linking to this Windows-specific subsection, without interfering with future additions of other hardware-specific subsections that use the same subsection names. --&gt;
&lt;span id=&quot;windows_warnings&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

Be aware of the following:

# 911 address information does not display on the softphone. It is not known (at the time of this writing) whether that means your 911 service will work.
# When exiting MagicJack the normal way (safely removing the USB device), it appears that the softphone communicates something to the server indicating its changed status. Running dongle-less may affect this. See the FAQ answer: [[MagicJack/Support_Resources/FAQ#Can_I_shut_down_my_computer_without_removing_the_USB_device.3F | Can I shut down my computer without removing the USB Device?]]
# MagicJack upgrades may not work. You may have to run MagicJack with the USB device, with the original shortcut. Let the upgrade occur, and then follow the instructions above again to get the updated files copied to your hard disk.
# If you have any errors displayed by the soft-phone, it is highly encouraged that the first thing you do is run MagicJack with the USB device, with the original shortcut.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation==
As remarked previously, gravitation is one of the four classes of interactions found in nature, and it was the earliest of the four to be studied extensively. Isaac Newton discovered in the 17th century that the same interaction that makes an apple fall from a tree also keeps planets in orbit around the sun. Along with his three laws of motion, Newton published the '''law of gravitation''' in 1687. It can be stated as follows:

'''Every particle of matter in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of the masses of the particles and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.'''

In mathematical terms, the law of universal gravitation may be given by
&lt;math&gt;F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2},&lt;/math&gt;

where:

* ''F'' is the magnitude of the gravitational force between the two point masses,
* ''G'' is the gravitational constant or &lt;math&gt; G = \left(6.67428 \plusmn 0.00067 \right) \times 10^{-11} \ \mbox{m}^3 \ \mbox{kg}^{-1} \ \mbox{s}^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;, 
* ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the mass of the first point mass,
* ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the mass of the second point mass,
* ''r'' is the distance between the two point masses.


Newton's law of universal gravitation can be written as a vector equation to account for the direction of the gravitational force as well as its magnitude. In this formula, quantities in '''bold''' represent vectors.

: &lt;math&gt;

\mathbf{F}_{12} =
- G {m_1 m_2 \over {\vert \mathbf{r}_{12} \vert}^2}
\, \mathbf{\hat{r}}_{12}
&lt;/math&gt;
where

: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{F}_{12} &lt;/math&gt; is the force applied on object 2 due to object 1
: &lt;math&gt; G &lt;/math&gt; is the gravitational constant
: &lt;math&gt; m_1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; m_2 &lt;/math&gt; are respectively the masses of objects 1 and 2
: &lt;math&gt; \vert \mathbf{r}_{12} \vert \ = \vert \mathbf{r}_2 - \mathbf{r}_1 \vert &lt;/math&gt; is the distance between objects 1 and 2
: &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{\hat{r}}_{12} \ \stackrel{\mathrm{def}}{=}\ \frac{\mathbf{r}_2 - \mathbf{r}_1}{\vert\mathbf{r}_2 - \mathbf{r}_1\vert} &lt;/math&gt; is the unit vector from object 1 to 2

It can be seen that the vector form of the equation is the same as the scalar form given earlier, except that '''F''' is now a vector quantity, and the right hand side is multiplied by the appropriate unit vector. Also, it can be seen that '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; = − '''F'''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt;.

'''Gravitational acceleration''' is the acceleration of an object caused by the force of gravity from another object. In the absence of any other forces, any object will accelerate in a gravitational field at the same rate, regardless of the mass of the object. On the surface of the Earth, all objects fall with an acceleration of somewhere between 9.78 and 9.82 m/s² depending on latitude, with a conventional standard value of exactly 9.80665 m/s², (approx. 32.174&amp;nbsp;ft/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

The gravitational acceleration towards an object is given by:

::&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{g}=-{mG \over r^2}\mathbf{\hat{r}}&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:''m'' is the mass of the object,
:''r'' is the distance from center of the object to the location we are considering,
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{\hat{r}}&lt;/math&gt; is the unit length vector from center of the object to the location we are considering, 
:''G'' is the gravitational constant of the universe.

As one can see, the gravitational acceleration is independent of the mass of the reference particle.

The '''weight''' of a body is the total gravitational force exerted on the body by all other bodies in the universe. When the body is near the surface of the earth, one may neglect all other gravitational forces and consider the weight as just the earth's gravitational attraction. If we model the earth as a spherically symmetric body, then the weight of a small body with mass ''m'' at the earth's surface is

&lt;math&gt;w = F = G \frac{m_1 m_2}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

This text is intended to cover basic neutronics roughly equivalent to a first semester graduate level course in reactor theory.  As of the time of this writing, this should include introduction and discussion of the Boltzmann transport equation with the associated diffusion approximation up to the three spatial dimension (energy dependent) case, perturbation approximation of theoretical reactor configurations, cross section analysis, and discussion of computer programs associated with nuclear studies.

The reader is expected to be competent in undergraduate level physics/nuclear engineering and to be acquainted with mathematical techniques including multi-dimensional vector calculus and differential equations.

This text is not intended to provide information useful for the design or construction of nuclear weapons and should not contain any material that is restricted by international agreement.

    <title>PHP vs ColdFusion/IF Statements</title>

      <text xml:space="preserve">PHP IF STATEMENT

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
&lt;?php

if( condition ){
// CODE TO EXECUTE

}

?&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The conditions are based on the information you want to compare. 

So let's assume you want to compare apples to oranges, to see if they are the same.

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
if( &quot;apples&quot; == &quot;oranges&quot; ){
// OUTPUT ANSWER
echo &quot;Apples = Oranges. True&quot;;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Now assume that you want to return an answer even if the conditions are not met. You would use what is called an else statement which looks as follows.

&lt;source lang=&quot;php&quot;&gt;
if( &quot;apples&quot; == &quot;oranges&quot; ){
// output

}
else
{
// output alternative
echo &quot;Apples Do Not = Oranges&quot;;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

ColdFusion is very different in its comparisons. They look as follows

&lt;source lang=&quot;cfm&quot;&gt;
&lt;cfif apples eq oranges&gt;

Apples = Oranges

&lt;/cfif&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

If you notice that it's more of a &lt;&gt; based instead of a structure based. This can be an easier transition for HTML developers as it is tagged based

Now to return an alternate or else you do the almost exact same thing as in PHP, but it looks like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;cfm&quot;&gt;
&lt;cfif apples eq oranges&gt;

Apples = Oranges

&lt;cfelse&gt;

Apples do not = oranges
&lt;/cfif&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Nice job so far on [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Arts and Crafts/Lettering &amp; Poster Making|Lettering &amp; Poster Making]].  My pet peeve for bad posters is when people use a &lt;font color=red&gt;d&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=blue&gt;i&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=green&gt;f&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=yellow&gt;f&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=red&gt;e&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=blue&gt;r&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=green&gt;e&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=yellow&gt;n&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=red&gt;t&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=blue&gt;c&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=green&gt;o&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=yellow&gt;l&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=red&gt;o&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=blue&gt;r&lt;/font&gt; for every letter in a word.  Especially when they use yellow letters! Gaah! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 12:58, 30 December 2008 (UTC)

:Thanks for your kind comment. Yes I plan to discuss both of these. Contrast is an important concept (ie: Yellow letters against white). Contrast, case, balance, and above all KIS (Keep it Simple). I plan to mention all. [[User:Jazzmanian|Gerald]] ([[User talk:Jazzmanian|talk]]) 19:06, 30 December 2008 (UTC)

==PDF Documents ?==
Is there a way to place a PDF as part of this key ?
I've created printable templates with marked lines for practicing the lettering with different width nibs, but since it is something that need to avoid being re-sized, PDF seems best/simplest way to present it. (plus it's 20 different pages).[[User:Jazzmanian|Gerald]] ([[User talk:Jazzmanian|talk]]) 22:56, 5 January 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>reverting to new implementation</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== new version with inline player==
There appears to be quite some interest in integrating an inline audio player in this template (or actually copying the current implementation from Wikipedia). However, a lot of the pages currently using this template make specific references to the old implementation. Therefore, I suggest that
# we discuss here whether we should just integrated an inline player or whether we should copy the implementation from Wikipedia (I'm in favor of the latter)
# we make sure that all Wikibooks pages referencing {{tl|Listen}} are either updated to the new design or the template {{tl|Listen}} is replaced by the template {{tl|Listen old version}}
--[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 14:52, 30 December 2008 (UTC)

I think the best approach might be to optionally allow the integration of an inline audio player, while using the current default of not doing so. So pages that use the listen template continue to work as expected, and people who want an integrated audio player can have one. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:43, 30 December 2008 (UTC)

:That's what I suggested when derbeth changed the definition some weeks ago. But copying the definition from Wikipedia has the advantage that the new template is very flexible (supporting multiple files etc.) and we could also use the documentation and we would be consistent with Wikipedia (which is a good idea for the more complex templates). There are actually not a lot of pages at Wikibooks using {{tl|Listen}}, thus, it wouldn't be a big problem to replace all occurences of {{tl|Listen}} by {{tl|Listen old version}}. That would also give a hint to the authors of those pages that a new version is available. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 19:53, 30 December 2008 (UTC)

I reverted to the Wikipedia implementation and adapted the wikibooks pages that use {{tl|Listen}}. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 19:06, 11 January 2009 (UTC)</text>

Geometry

Why invest the energy to learn geometry?

Basic geometry is a very powerful practical problem solver. It was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks for solving most problems and was the proto-type for rational thinking.*1 Where we use algebra today they used geometry then. It is still very current in all the building and fabrication trades. Before building something big and expensive it better to work out the bugs in a small scale model. Before expending a lot of energy in making a model it is best to do a drawing. With geometry the drawings become very accurate and can be used to predict measurements and costs. Geometry can be easy to master; the proofs are more fun than sudoko; and its applications are as practical as a hammer and saw. It will give you a sophisticated visual intuition and a strong sense of rational proof and a jumping-off place for some of the most abstract areas of pure mathematics. It’s hard to imagine a mathematical education without geometry.

*1  &lt;u&gt;A HISTORY OF WESTERN PHILOSOPHY&lt;/u&gt; by Bertrand Russell, page 36, 39, 208 (chapter XXIV)--[[User:Cretaceous9|Cretaceous9]] ([[User talk:Cretaceous9|talk]]) 20:45, 30 December 2008 (UTC)

What should you know before attempting to teach yourself geometry from this text? 

You should do fine if you understand simple English; are comfortable with diagrams; can do arithmetic up to addition of fractions with out a calculator (1/4 + 2/5 = 13/20); and can solve simple algebra (2x -1= 0 then x= 1/2). Often algebra and geometry are taught together and the students would know enough algebra by the time they needed it. If the writers are careful in this text, you should not need algebra till you get to the level of trigonometry. It wouldn't hurt to read the first few chapters in both arithmetic and beginning algebra while doing geometry. Mathematics builds on its self. This means that only if you work all the examples and learn the definitions will later pages make sense to you. Keep a notebook and make lots of drawings. Talking to others about what you learn is invaluable. You do your part and a good text book will get you there.--[[User:Cretaceous9|Cretaceous9]] ([[User talk:Cretaceous9|talk]]) 20:45, 30 December 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Hi from the originator ==

Hello, as a nuclear engineering student who came into the field from physics, I was frustrated by the lack of material directed at a competent reader who was unfamiliar with the discipline.  I would like to fill that gap with a book here on wikibooks.

As I am new to this, everything is still unfamiliar, and I will take it slowly at first.  Once I see (or get confirmation) that the book will be retained and posted for others to contribute, I will add more material as I am able.

One more note, because these pages are all editable, I intend to write in a rather free and loose style and edit as I go along.  Also, if anyone wants to discuss setting up a prospective outline, I'd be happy to hear others' ideas.

== We're listed! ==

This book has now been shelved in the engineering section.  Though I am a graduate student and very busy, I will try to add paragraphs here and there on a regular basis.  I believe there is a way to contact me through wikibooks, but if anyone has any comments, they can write them to adamredwine@hotmail.com.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this chapter you'll read about the secret tanks and other armoured vehicles that were invented by the Allies and Axis during World War II.

==Super Tanks==

===Maus===

[[File:Munster Maus Modell (dark1) with figure.jpg|thumb|right|Model of Maus with the outline of a man to show the relative size]]

Maus was a German tank. It was the heaviest tank to be built in World War II, although it was never used in combat. It's name must have been a joke because it means &quot;Mouse&quot; in German, but it was much heavier than another tank called &quot;Elephant&quot;! It weighed about 180 tons, that's about the weight of 12 double-decker buses. The turret alone weighed 55 tons - as much as a King Tiger tank!

At its thickest it had 10 inch armour plate and carried two guns. The larger gun, a 128 mm (5 inch) cannon was the same size as the gun carried on warships like destroyers. The Germans had trouble finding an engine strong enough to move such a heavy tank. In the end they used the engine from an airplane. Also, because the tank was so heavy, it wouldn't have been able to use most bridges without breaking them. So, it had a '''snorkel''' that allowed it to drive underwater! 

In the end the problems in making Maus work couldn't be solved before the war ended, and only two were built. They were never used in battle.

===&quot;Canal Defence Light&quot;===

The Canal Defence Light was a British secret weapon. It was a search light with a special shutter built on a tank instead of the normal turret. In use, the shutter moved really quickly, making the light flash. The idea was that the enemy couldn't tell how far away the light was and when trying to look at it they would become dizzy from the flashing. If two lights were used they created a pitch black gap between them that the enemy couldn't see into because of the flashing lights on either side.

The British didn't use the Canal Defence Light because they didn't want to reveal its secret before they needed to. In the end it was used to protect the Ludendorff Bridge when it was captured by the US Army. The bridge was very important as it crossed the Rhine, a huge river that protects Germany from attack, and allowed the allies to advance into Germany. The Canal Defence Lights stopped a group of German frogmen who were trying to sabotage the bridge, so it proved its worth.

==Enormous Tanks!==
[[File:Comparison of Landkreuzer P 1000 Ratte, Maus and Tiger tanks.png|thumb|right|Compare the size of the P1000 with the Maus, the Tiger and a person]]

The Germans planned, but never built, two enormous tanks. One would have weighed 1,000 tons and the other 1,500 tons! That's more than 20 times heavier than the largest tank ever built! They were known as the Landkreuzer P 1000 and P 1500 (Landkreuzer means Land Cruiser).

The smaller tank was being designed to carry a similar turret to the ones used on German Navy cruisers, fitted with two 280 mm (11 inch) guns. 

The larger tank was being designed to carry special 80 cm guns that were used for smashing up the heaviest fortifications. The guns themselves weighed 1,350 tons and could fire a shell weighing 7 tons (the weight of a bus) over 23 miles. The guns were built, but instead of a tank they were mounted on a railway carriage instead.

The P 1500 would have had 250 mm (10 inch) frontal armour and would have used either two or four submarine engines. As well as the giant gun 80 cm gun, it was to have two 15 cm guns as well.

Neither tank was built and the projects were cancelled before the end of the war.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When working on this book, remember that it's aimed at children. Being understood is just as important as being accurate. Concentrate on the most important concepts rather than getting wrapped up in every detail. Use technical vocabulary when you need to, but don't use big words where simple ones would work.&lt;!--

THIS NEXT CAN BE RESTORED WHEN AND IF THIS BOOK GETS A GLOSSARY, WHICH IT MAY.

Whenever you have to use a word, list it in the glossary of basic terms, and define it.  Either that, or note it needs to be defined in the glossary page.  Giving definitions when such words are used is generally a good idea as well.
--&gt;

This is intended to be a basic survey of different religions, not an in-depth study.  The essence of each religion should come through, though, so the traits and circumstances that make it unique should be explored.  The standard questions listed below are meant to be open enough to encompass many of these special considerations &amp;mdash; but when they won't do the job properly, feel free to add additional sections.

Please, if you can contribute to this book, do so.  Many sections are incomplete or in need of cleanup or a complete rewrite. You can work on almost anything including this page, but if you want to make some significant changes please bring them up [[{{TALKPAGENAME:{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}}}|on the discussion page]].  Additional religions are welcome, but please try to add some content when you list them.

==Beginning your article==
Copy the following text to a page entitled &quot;{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/''Name of religion''&quot; to begin your article.  The text assumes that &lt;nowiki&gt;{{SUBPAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; expands to the name of the religion; if that's not so, remember to adjust the questions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Signals ==

&lt;!-- I think it would be good to show that signals are not just one dimensional.  E.g., the electric field is vector-valued, and is a function of space and time.  Images are functions of space.  No need to cover these in any detail, just mention that signals and systems is very general. --&gt;

What is a signal? Of course, we know that a signal can be a rather abstract notion, such as a flashing light on our car's front bumper
(turn signal), or an umpire's gesture indicating that a pitch went over the plate during a baseball game (a strike signal). One of the
definitions of signal in the Merrian-Webster dictionary is: 

&quot;A detectable physical quantity or impulse (as a voltage, current, or magnetic field strength) by which messages or information
can be transmitted.&quot; or

&quot;A signal is a function of independent variables that carry some information.&quot;

&quot;A signal is a source of information generaly a physical quantity which varies with respect to time, space, temperature like any independent variable&quot;
  
&quot;A signal is a physical quantity that varies with time,space or any other independent variable.by which information can be conveyed&quot;

These are the types of signals which will be of interest in this book. We will focus on two broad  classes of signals, ''discrete-time'' and ''continuous-time''. We will consider discrete-time signals later. For now, we will focus our attention on continuous-time signals. Fortunately, continuous-time signals have a very convenient mathematical representation. We represent a continuous-time signal as a function ''x(t)'' of the real variable ''t''. Here, ''t'' represents '''continuous time''' and we can assign to ''t'' any unit of time we deem appropriate (seconds, hours, years, etc.). We do not have to make any particular assumptions about ''x(t)'' such as &quot;boundedness&quot; (a signal is bounded if it has a finite value). Some of the signals we will work with are in fact, not bounded (i.e. they take on an infinite value). However most of the continuous-time signals we will deal with in the real world are bounded.

Signal: a function representing some variable that contains some information about the behavior of a natural or artificial system. Signals are one part of the whole. Signals are meaningless without systems to interpret them, and systems are useless without signals to process.

Signal: the energy (a traveling wave) that carries some information.

Signal example: an electrical circuit signal may represent a time-varying voltage measured across a resistor. 

A signal can be represented as a function x(t) of an independent variable t which usually represents time. If t is a continuous variable, x(t) is a continuous-time signal, and if t is a discrete variable, defined only at discrete values of t, then x(t) is a discrete-time signal.  A discrete-time signal is often identified as a sequence of numbers, denoted by x[n], where n is an integer.  

Signal: the representation of information.

== Systems ==

A '''System''' is any physical set of components that takes a signal, and produces a signal. In terms of  engineering, the input is generally some electrical signal X, and the output is another electrical signal(response) Y. However, this may not always be the case. Consider a household thermostat, which takes input in the form of a knob or a switch, and in turn outputs electrical control signals for the furnace. 

A main purpose of this book is to try and lay some of the theoretical foundation for future dealings with electrical signals. Systems will be discussed in a theoretical sense only.

== What is a story from {{SUBPAGENAME}}? ==

Once there was a man who wanted to become a great Sage. He studied hard to learn the scriptures. He understood almost everything in the scriptures, except parts with the word &quot;Maya&quot;. So he went into meditation to see God. He meditated for decades, and at last God came to him. 

The Sage asked God, &quot;What is Maya&quot;? God replied &quot;I can only show you the answer, but it will be a hard journey&quot;. The Sage pledged God, &quot;I am your devotee, I will endure any hardship you ask of me. Please show me the answer&quot;. 

God Reincarnated the sage, and he was born again. He was born in a family far far away. He had forgotten all about his previous life, including his meeting with God. He grew up with lots of friends. He married and had a loving family.  

One day, as he was thinking about how good the lunch would taste, God appeared to him. The man was confused and asked, &quot;Who are you?&quot; God replied, &quot;Remember... your previous life&quot;, and blessed him. And the Man remembered that he was a Sage and his quest for &quot;Maya&quot;. God said, &quot;This is Maya, the illusion that covers your true self. Maya is the curtain that blinds you from seeing the truth of the world&quot;.

The Commonwealth of Virginia is an American state on the Atlantic Coast of the Southern United States. The state is also known as the &quot;Old Dominion&quot; and sometimes &quot;Mother of Presidents&quot;, because it is the birthplace of eight U.S. presidents.  The capital of the commonwealth is Richmond, Virginia Beach is the most populous city, and Fairfax County is the most populous political subdivision.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=2. File and Directory Management=

This chapter covers the following commands:

* ATTRIB -       Displays or changes file attributes.
* CD, CHDIR -    Displays the name of or changes the current directory.
* COPY -         Copies one or more files to another location.
* DEL -         Deletes one or more files.
* DIR -          Displays a list of files and subdirectories in a directory.
* ERASE -        Deletes one or more files.
* MD, MKDIR -    Creates a directory.
* MOVE -         Moves one or more files from one directory to another directory.
* RMDIR -        Removes a directory.
* REN, RENAME -  Renames a file or files.
* POPD -         Restores the previous value of the current directory saved by PUSHD.
* PUSHD -        Saves the current directory then changes it.
* RD -           Removes a directory.
* REPLACE -      Replaces files.
* TREE -         Graphically displays the directory structure of a drive or path.
* XCOPY -        Copies files and directory trees.

==The DIR, CD and MD Commands==

* Open a cmd.exe window (see chapter 1.)

There are two names for the current directory command, CD and CHDIR. Both commands work in exactly the same way and from now on we will use the shorter name CD. The CD command displays the name of the current directory.

* Type &lt;nowiki&gt;CD&lt;/nowiki&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
C:\&gt;CD
C:\
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;nowiki&gt;DIR&lt;/nowiki&gt; command with no arguments list the contents of a directory.

* Type &lt;nowiki&gt;DIR&lt;/nowiki&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
C:\&gt;DIR
TODO: Get the output for a computer with a mnimal set of directories.
&lt;/source&gt;

There are two names for the make directory command, MD and MKDIR. Both commands work in exactly the same way and again we will use the shorter form in the examples.

We start by creating a new directory:

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
C:\&gt;MD cmd_guide

C:\&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

We will now use the CD command with an argument and make &quot;C:\cmd_guide&quot; the current directory.

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
C:\&gt;CD cmd_guide

C:\cmd_guide&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that the current directory is shown in the command prompt.

You've now seen the basics of the CD, DIR and MD commands. We will now go on to look at these in more depth.

The CD command without and argument now show the C:\cmd_guide directory as the current directory.

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
C:\cmd_guide&gt;CD
C:\cmd_guide

C:\cmd_guide&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===DIR Usage and Options===

In the example above the MD command was used to create a single directory. We will look at this directroy using the DIR command. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
C:\cmd_guide&gt;DIR
 Volume in drive C is MyCDrive
 Volume Serial Number is 64A5-9C22

 Directory of C:\cmd_guide

31/12/2008  13:31    &lt;DIR&gt;          .
31/12/2008  13:31    &lt;DIR&gt;          ..
               0 File(s)              0 bytes
               2 Dir(s)  146,065,076,224 bytes free

C:\cmd_guide&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The standard output from the DIR command shows that the directory C:\cmd_guide has empty but it contains two directory references &quot;.&quot; and &quot;..&quot;. A single dot &quot;.&quot; represents the current directory and &quot;..&quot; is the parent directory. The DIR command is shorthand for &lt;nowiki&gt;DIR .&lt;/nowiki&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
C:\cmd_guide&gt;DIR .
 Volume in drive C is MyCDrive
 Volume Serial Number is 64A5-9C22

 Directory of C:\cmd_guide

31/12/2008  13:31    &lt;DIR&gt;          .
31/12/2008  13:31    &lt;DIR&gt;          ..
               0 File(s)              0 bytes
               2 Dir(s)  146,065,100,800 bytes free
&lt;/source&gt;

Compare the outputs in the listings for DIR and DIR .

The command DIR .. will list the contents of the parent directory.

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
TODO.
&lt;/source&gt;

Make a directory, look at it use DIR /B and DIR /S /B

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
C:\cmd_guide&gt;MD HeadQuarters

C:\cmd_guide&gt;DIR /B
HeadQuarters

C:\cmd_guide&gt;DIR /S /B
C:\cmd_guide\HeadQuarters

C:\cmd_guide&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
C:\cmd_guide&gt;MD HeadQuarters

C:\cmd_guide&gt;DIR /B
HeadQuarters

C:\cmd_guide&gt;DIR /S /B
C:\cmd_guide\HeadQuarters

C:\cmd_guide&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===MD Usage===

Creating multiple directories.

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
C:\cmd_guide&gt;MD Nottingham Derby Newark Lincoln

C:\cmd_guide&gt;DIR /S /B
C:\cmd_guide\Derby
C:\cmd_guide\HeadQuarters
C:\cmd_guide\Lincoln
C:\cmd_guide\Newark
C:\cmd_guide\Nottingham

C:\cmd_guide&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Creating nested directories.

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
C:\cmd_guide&gt;MD Grantham\Menus\Season

C:\cmd_guide&gt;DIR /S /B
C:\cmd_guide\Derby
C:\cmd_guide\Grantham
C:\cmd_guide\HeadQuarters
C:\cmd_guide\Lincoln
C:\cmd_guide\Newark
C:\cmd_guide\Nottingham
C:\cmd_guide\Grantham\Menus
C:\cmd_guide\Grantham\Menus\Season

C:\cmd_guide&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

===Filtering/Searching with the DIR Command===

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
C:\cmd_guide&gt;DIR /S /B *t*a*
C:\cmd_guide\Grantham
C:\cmd_guide\Nottingham

C:\cmd_guide&gt;DIR /S /B *t?a*
C:\cmd_guide\Grantham

C:\cmd_guide&gt;

Use of &quot;?&quot;.
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
C:\cmd_guide&gt;DIR /S /B *t*a*
C:\cmd_guide\Grantham
C:\cmd_guide\Nottingham

C:\cmd_guide&gt;DIR /S /B *t?a*
C:\cmd_guide\Grantham

C:\cmd_guide&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Match an exact number of letters.

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
C:\cmd_guide&gt;DIR /B ??a*
Grantham
HeadQuarters

C:\cmd_guide&gt;DIR /B *a*
Grantham
HeadQuarters
Newark
Nottingham

C:\cmd_guide&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==DIR Text From Book Page - Needs Reviewing==

This command displays the contents of directories.
To get help on the &lt;code&gt;dir&lt;/code&gt; command type &lt;code&gt;dir /?&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;pre&gt;
C:\&gt;dir /?
Displays a list of files and subdirectories in a directory.

DIR [drive:][path][filename] [/A[[:]attributes]] [/B] [/C] [/D] [/L] [/N]

              names.  The format is that of /N with the short name inserted
              before the long name. If no short name is present, blanks are
              displayed in its place.
  /4          Displays four-digit years

Switches may be preset in the DIRCMD environment variable.  Override
preset switches by prefixing any switch with - (hyphen)--for example, /-W.

C:\&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Map of USA WA.svg|thumb|right|200px|The location of Washington]]
Washington is a state in the Pacific Northwest region of the United States. Washington was carved out of the western part of Washington Territory and admitted to the Union as the 42nd state in 1889. The state is named after George Washington, the first President of the United States. Washington is often called Washington state or the State of Washington to distinguish it from the District of Columbia (which is usually called Washington, D.C.).
[[File:Flag of Washington.svg|thumb|right|200px|The Flag of Washington]]

==History==

==Geography==

The Pacific coast is relatively flat, but it soon rises up into rainy coastal mountains.  Further east, there are the even higher and rainier Cascades, but the eastern part of the state is mostly high and relatively dry plains with a few deep and impressive river canyons.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=3. File Commands=

This chapter covers the following commands:

* COMP -    Compares the contents of two files or sets of files.
* FC -      Compares two files or sets of files, and displays the differences between them.
* FIND -    Searches for a text string in a file or files.
* FINDSTR - Searches for strings in files.
* MORE -    Displays output one screen at a time.
* PRINT -   Prints a text file.
* SORT -    Sorts input.
* TYPE -    Displays the contents of a text file.

==The TYPE Command==

The TYPE command display the contents of a file. There are no options for the TYPE command.

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
C:\&gt;TYPE README.TXT
This is a table of contents for &quot;Editing Guide to Windows Commands&quot;

  File and Directory Management
  File Commands
C:\&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==The SORT Command==

The SORT command will sort lines of text from a file.

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
Orange
Banana
Apple
Pear
Strawberry
Bluberry
Blackberry

--------
File: fruits.txt
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
C:\&gt;sort fruits.txt
Apple
Banana
Blackberry
Bluberry
Orange
Pear
Strawberry

C:\&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The /R option will sort in reverse order.

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
C:\&gt;sort /R fruits.txt
Strawberry
Pear
Orange
Bluberry
Blackberry
Banana
Apple

C:\&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

==The MORE Command==

The MORE command will display output or contents of file a screenful at a time. It is especially useful when piping it with certain commands (such as DIR or TASKLIST) that produce very long output.

For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
C:\&gt;tasklist | more
&lt;/source&gt;

* VOL -     Displays a disk volume label and serial number.

==The DATE Command==
This command displays or sets the current date.
&lt;source lang=&quot;dos&quot;&gt;
C:\WB&gt;DATE
The current date is: 06/12/2008
Enter the new date: (dd-mm-yy) 01-01-2009

C:\WB&gt;DATE
The current date is: 01/01/2009
Enter the new date: (dd-mm-yy)

C:\WB&gt;DATE /T
01/01/2009

C:\WB&gt;DATE
The current date is: 01/01/2009

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Reduce links to Wikipedia ==
Depending on Wikpedia to define terms is discouraged. While WP articles generally link to articles on terms discussed, Wikibooks prefers that a each book be more self-contained so that readers won't need access to anything but the book (which might be downloaded and read electronically, or even printed). Given the book scope, these terms should be discussed. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 03:31, 31 December 2008 (UTC)

== Citation needed ==
I've added a few {{tl|citation needed}} templates. I found some of the claims needing some source to back them up. Notably:
* The page states that because magicJack uses a &quot;true CLEC&quot;, it &quot;has a competitive advantage over other VOIP providers.&quot; Can anyone explain why?
* &quot;''the most visible advantage is seen in the large number of area codes (and prefixes) available to MagicJack customers.''&quot; What, exactly, does that mean, and is there any comparison for this. Do other VoIP services not provide services to some countries/areas?
* &quot;''Extremely low price.''&quot;
--[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 03:31, 31 December 2008 (UTC)

== Removed irrelevant content ==
I've removed a part of a sentence:
: &quot;''MagicJack allows the use of a softphone with &lt;del&gt;a headset (connected to the computer's speaker/mic sockets), as well as&lt;/del&gt; a traditional handset through the supplied USB device which acts as an [[w:Analog_telephony_adapter | ATA]].''&quot;
Most VoIP clients that I've come across allow for the use of a headset, and it is thus not a unique feature to magicJack.

I've also removed the following points:
: &quot;'' (After one year there has been no advertising, except special offers provided by MagicJack.).''&quot;
: &quot;''Utilizes mass-consumer advertising via [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bsR3b2F9sUA infomercials].''&quot;
They seem tangential and irrelevant, respectively, to unique magicJack features. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 03:31, 31 December 2008 (UTC)
:: Thanks. I've reverted your changes (again). It is useful information that 1) The business model hasn't panned out, 2) that MJ uses infomercials are unlike other VOIP companies, and 3) that a handset is available in addition to a headset. --[[User:Az2008|Az2008]] ([[User talk:Az2008|talk]])

::: You haven't explained how the ability to use a headset and the lack of advertisements on are &quot;unique&quot; features, nor how youtube advertisements are relevant. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 04:58, 31 December 2008 (UTC)
:::: Thanks for your input. It's an introduction page, so I believe it's useful to contrast the handset with what is commonly available. Remember that this intro may be visited by someone who's never used a VOIP service. But, I think you raise a good point that this should be expanded (not contracted). We'd like to expand this area with more of a comparison to other VOIP services (to be sure this book is NPOV compiant). So, this ties into that goal. (Remember, I just put all this out here as a baseline, to fill out the outline. There's more to come.).
::::* Re infomercial. I believe most MJ users would say this is a distinguishing feature of MJ. No other VOIP service advertises to the average, non-technical infomercial audience. The grandmas. This has led to widespread use of MJ. It's also been a negative. The device isn't as ridiculously easy to use as the informercial says. (That element ties into the benefits/criticisms area which I'd like to rework a little and make it clearer that it's kind of a review of commonly-expressed sentiment. Not personal opinion expressed as objective fact.). Anyway, I think MJ is noted for being the first VOIP service to (rightly or wrongly) use infomercials. They'll always be known for that. It was big news among MJ users.
::::* I appreciate your perspective as a non-MJ user. There are other MJ users who are participating. Hopefully they'll read this discussion and have some thoughts about how to expand the intro page. I'll work on it too. I just need to recover from getting it all out there. The book is primarily for MJ users (i.e., it's intended to be the user manual that MJ doesn't come with, because it just says &quot;plug it in, and use it.&quot;). But, you raise good points about how certain things could be written better for non-MJ users. It's a delicate issue because another wikibooks (admin?) &quot;Panic&quot; raised concerns that the book is too commercial in nature. So, I have a feeling that if we go out of our way to point out what makes MJ different compared to other services, someone will say it's biased and just hawking MJ. Maybe there's a need for a book that's just &quot;VOIP Services&quot; where comparisons can be made.
::::* You also removed absolute paths to sub-pages. I was told in the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Reading_room/Assistance#How_to_create_sub-pages_or_sub-topics.3F reading room] by &quot;darklama&quot; that it's better to use absolute paths. I'm going to follow up to that topic and ask questions. You might want to post there if I don't get to it first.
::::* BTW: I appreciate you helping me notice the w: notation to link to other wiki subjects. I'll have to study the editing help further.--[[User:Az2008|Az2008]] ([[User talk:Az2008|talk]]) 16:40, 31 December 2008 (UTC)

::::: Your change in tone does not change the fact that you've reverted all of my edits (e.g. [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=MagicJack/Introduction&amp;diff=1369436&amp;oldid=1369330 Undoing &quot;swift's&quot; unhelpful contributions]). I share Panic's concerns and won't spend any more time on this until it comes up for discussion. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 18:24, 31 December 2008 (UTC)

:::::: I apologize. I was frustrated last night when the undo feature didn't seem to work. And, I thought I'd put the link back into the introduction page. And then found for some reason it wasn't there again (and had to put it back in). It was becoming unclear exactly what was missing.
:::::: The points you've made are helpful. But, I wasn't too jazzed to find content removed by someone who's not even familiar with MagicJack. I can appreciate a non-MJ viewpoint. That's worth discussing. But, removing content without understanding its significance didn't seem helpful.
:::::: BTW: I did not undo &quot;all&quot; of your edits. I left the citation markers. Although, I disagree with their importance. I mean, you put &quot;citation needed&quot; where it says &quot;extremely low price.&quot; But, in the very next section it says the price is $1.67 per month. And, anyone can go to the MJ web site and calculate the price themselves. It's not like it's promising to grow hair.
:::::: Be that as it may. You and Panic may be right about this being an inappropriate book for wikiBooks. I've already started that discussion with MJ users elsewhere. It may be better to host it on a dedicated wiki. Whatever happens there will be no hard feelings. We just want to help users of MJ with some consistent, collaborative information. Not be all things to all people, or get (too) involved in larger community issues. We're not here to serve Wikibooks. So, that may be a problem if people at Wikibooks feelthey can't let us use the service to help ourselves with a book that *is* a book from our perspective. We'll appreciate having some time to sort it out and see if things get better. --[[User:Az2008|Az2008]] ([[User talk:Az2008|talk]]) 18:48, 31 December 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== First things first ===
So, you've never programmed before. As we go through this tutorial, I
will attempt to teach you how to program. There really is only one
way to learn to program. ''' You''' must read ''code'' and write ''code'' (as computer programs are often called).
I'm going to show you lots of code. You should type in code that I
show you to see what happens. Play around with it and make changes.
The worst that can happen is that it won't work. When I type in code
it will be formatted like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
##Python is easy to learn
print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

That's so it is easy to distinguish from the other text. If you're reading this on the web, you'll notice the code is in color -- that's just to make it stand out, and to make the different parts of the code stand out from each other. The code you enter will probably not be colored, or the colors may be different, but it won't affect the code as long as you enter it the same way as it's printed here.

If the computer prints something out it will be formatted like this:

&lt;pre&gt;
Hello, World!
&lt;/pre&gt;

(Note that printed text goes to your screen, and does not involve paper. Before computers had screens, the output of computer programs would be printed on paper.)

Note that this is a Python 3 tutorial, which means that most of the examples will not work in Python 2.7 and before. As well, some of the extra libraries (third-party libraries) have not yet been converted. You may want to consider learning from the [[Non-Programmer's Tutorial for Python 2.6]]. However, the differences between versions are not particularly large, so if you learn one, you should be able to read programs written for the other without much difficulty. 

There will often be a mixture of the text you type (which is shown in '''bold''') and the text the program prints to the screen, which would look like this:

 Halt!
 Who Goes there? '''Josh'''
 You may pass, Josh

(Some of the tutorial has not been converted to this format. Since this is a wiki, you can convert it when you find it.)

I will also introduce you to the terminology of programming - for example, that programming is often referred to as ''coding'' or ''hacking''. This will not only help you understand what programmers are talking about, but also help the learning process.

Now, on to more important things. In order to program in Python you need the Python 3 software. If you don't already have the Python software go to http://www.python.org/download/ and get the proper version for your platform. Download it, read the instructions and get it installed.

=== Installing Python ===
For Python programming you need a working Python installation and a text editor. Python comes with its own editor ''IDLE'', which is quite nice and totally sufficient for the beginning. As you get more into programming, you will probably switch to some other editor like ''emacs'', ''vi'' or another.

The Python download page is: [http://www.python.org/download http://www.python.org/download]. The most recent version is Python 3.4.1 (as at 19th May 2014); '''Python 2.7 and older versions will not work with this tutorial'''. There are various different installation files for different computer platforms available on the download site. Here are some specific instructions for the most common operating systems:

==== Linux, BSD, and Unix users ====
You are probably lucky and Python is already installed on your machine. To test it type &lt;tt&gt;python3&lt;/tt&gt; on a command line. If you see something like that in the following section, you are set.

If you have to install Python, first try to use the operating system's package manager or go to the repository where your packages are available and get Python 3. Python 3.0 was released in December 2008; all the distributions should have Python 3 available, so you may not need to compile Python 3 from scratch after downloading the source code. Ubuntu and Fedora do have Python 3 binary packages available, but they are not yet the default, so they need to be installed specially.&lt;!-- Is this realistic for people who don't know how to program???  --&gt;

Roughly, here are the steps to compile Python in UNIX (If these totally don't make sense, you may want to read another introduction to UNIX, such as [http://tldp.org/LDP/intro-linux/html/index.html Introduction to Linux]):
* Download the .tgz file (use your Web browser to get the gzipped tar file from https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-341)
* Uncompress the tar file (put in the correct path to where you downloaded it):
 $ tar -xvzf ~/Download/Python-3.4.1.tgz
 ''... list of files as they are uncompressed ''
* Change to the directory and tell the computer to compile and install the program
 $ cd Python-3.4/
 $ ./configure --prefix=$HOME/python3_install 
 '' ... lots of output.  Watch for error messages here ... ''
 $ make
 '' ... even more output.  Hopefully no error messages ... ''
 $ make install
* Add python 3 to your path. You can test it first by specifying the full path. You should add $HOME/python3_install/bin to your PATH bash variable. 
 $ ~/python3_install/bin/python3
 Python 3.4.1 (... size and date information ...) 
 [GCC 4.5.2] on linux2
 Type &quot;help&quot;, &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license&quot; for more information.
 &gt;&gt;&gt;''

The above commands will install Python 3 to your home directory, which is probably what you want, but if you skip the &lt;tt&gt;--prefix&lt;/tt&gt;, it will install it to &lt;tt&gt;/usr/local&lt;/tt&gt;.  If you want to use the IDLE graphical code editor, you need to make sure that the &lt;tt&gt;tk&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;tcl&lt;/tt&gt; libraries, together with their development files, are installed on the system.  You will get a warning during the &lt;tt&gt;make&lt;/tt&gt; phase if these are not available.

==== Mac users ====
Starting from Mac OS X (Tiger), Python ships by default with the operating system, but you will need to update to Python 3 until OS X starts including Python 3 (check the version by starting &lt;tt&gt;python3&lt;/tt&gt; in a command line terminal). Also IDLE (the Python editor) might be missing in the standard installation. If you want to (re-)install Python, get the MacOS installer from the [https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-341/ Python download site].

==== Windows users ====
Download the appropriate Windows installer (the [https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.4.1/python-3.4.1.msi x86 MSI installer], if you do not have a 64-bit AMD or Intel chip).  Start the installer by double-clicking it and follow the prompts.

See https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html#installing-python for more information.

==== Configuring your PATH environment variable ====

The PATH environment variable is a list of folders, separated by semicolons, in which Windows will look for a program whenever you try to execute one by typing its name at a Command Prompt. You can see the current value of your PATH by typing this command at a Command Prompt:

&lt;tt&gt;echo %PATH%&lt;/tt&gt;

The easiest way to permanently change environment variables is to bring up the built-in environment variable editor in Windows.  How you get to this editor is slightly different on different versions of Windows.

On Windows 8: Press the Windows key and type &lt;tt&gt;Control Panel&lt;/tt&gt; to locate the Windows Control Panel.  Once you've opened the Control Panel, select View by: Large Icons, then click on &lt;tt&gt;System&lt;/tt&gt;.  In the window that pops up, click the &lt;tt&gt;Advanced System Settings&lt;/tt&gt; link, then click the &lt;tt&gt;Environment Variables...&lt;/tt&gt; button.

On Windows 7 or Vista: Click the Start button in the lower-left corner of the screen, move your mouse over &lt;tt&gt;Computer&lt;/tt&gt;, right-click, and select &lt;tt&gt;Properties&lt;/tt&gt; from the pop-up menu. Click the &lt;tt&gt;Advanced System Settings&lt;/tt&gt; link, then click the &lt;tt&gt;Environment Variables...&lt;/tt&gt; button.

On Windows XP: Right-click the &lt;tt&gt;My Computer&lt;/tt&gt; icon on your desktop and select &lt;tt&gt;Properties&lt;/tt&gt;. Select the &lt;tt&gt;Advanced&lt;/tt&gt; tab, then click the &lt;tt&gt;Environment Variables...&lt;/tt&gt; button.

Once you've brought up the environment variable editor, you'll do the same thing regardless of which version of Windows you're running. Under &lt;tt&gt;System Variables&lt;/tt&gt; in the bottom half of the editor, find a variable called &lt;tt&gt;PATH&lt;/tt&gt;. If there is is one, select it and click &lt;tt&gt;Edit...&lt;/tt&gt;. Assuming your Python root is C:\Python34, add these two folders to your path (and make sure you get the semicolons right; there should be a semicolon between each folder in the list):

&lt;tt&gt;C:\Python34
C:\Python34\Scripts&lt;/tt&gt;

Note:
If you want to double-click and start your Python programs from a Windows folder and not have the console window disappear, you can add the following code to the bottom of each script:

&lt;tt&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print(&quot;Hello World&quot;)
#stops console from exiting
end_prog = &quot;&quot;
while end_prog != &quot;q&quot;:
        end_prog = input(&quot;type q to quit&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

=== Interactive Mode ===
Go into IDLE (also called the Python GUI). You should see a window that has some text like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
Python 3.0 (r30:67503, Dec 29 2008, 21:31:07) 
[GCC 4.3.2 20081105 (Red Hat 4.3.2-7)] on linux2
Type &quot;copyright&quot;, &quot;credits&quot; or &quot;license()&quot; for more information.

    ****************************************************************
    Personal firewall software may warn about the connection IDLE
    makes to its subprocess using this computer's internal loopback
    interface.  This connection is not visible on any external
    interface and no data is sent to or received from the Internet.
    ****************************************************************
    
IDLE 3.0      
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&lt;/pre&gt;
The &lt;code&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is Python's way of telling you that you are in
interactive mode. In interactive mode what you type is immediately
run. Try typing &lt;code&gt;1+1&lt;/code&gt; in. Python will respond with &lt;code&gt;2&lt;/code&gt;.
Interactive mode allows you to test out and see what Python will do.
If you ever feel you need to play with new Python statements, go into
interactive mode and try them out.

=== Creating and Running Programs ===

Go into IDLE if you are not already. In the menu at the top, select &lt;code&gt;File&lt;/code&gt; then &lt;code&gt;New Window&lt;/code&gt;. In the new window that appears, type the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

Now save the program: select &lt;code&gt;File&lt;/code&gt; from the menu, then &lt;code&gt;Save&lt;/code&gt;. Save it as &quot;&lt;code&gt;hello.py&lt;/code&gt;&quot; (you can save it in any folder you want). Now that it is saved it can be run. 

Next run the program by going to &lt;code&gt;Run&lt;/code&gt; then &lt;code&gt;Run Module&lt;/code&gt; (or if you have an older version of IDLE use &lt;code&gt;Edit&lt;/code&gt; then &lt;code&gt;Run script&lt;/code&gt;). This will output &lt;code&gt;Hello, World!&lt;/code&gt; on the &lt;code&gt;*Python Shell*&lt;/code&gt; window. 

For a more in-depth introduction to IDLE, a longer tutorial with screenshots can be found at [http://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dyoo/python/idle_intro/index.html http://hkn.eecs.berkeley.edu/~dyoo/python/idle_intro/index.html]

==== Program file names ====
It is very useful to stick to some rules regarding the file names of Python programs. Otherwise some things ''might'' go wrong unexpectedly. These don't matter as much for programs, but you can have weird problems if you don't follow them for module names (modules will be discussed later).
# Always save the program with the extension &lt;tt&gt;.py&lt;/tt&gt;. Do not put another dot anywhere else in the file name.
# Only use standard characters for file names: letters, numbers, dash (&lt;tt&gt;-&lt;/tt&gt;) and underscore (&lt;tt&gt;_&lt;/tt&gt;).
# White space (&quot;&lt;tt&gt; &lt;/tt&gt;&quot;) should not be used at all (use underscores instead).
# Do not use anything other than a letter (particularly no numbers!) at the beginning of a file name.
# Do not use &quot;non-english&quot; characters (such as &lt;tt&gt;ä&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;ö&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;ü&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;å&lt;/tt&gt; or &lt;tt&gt;ß&lt;/tt&gt;) in your file names—or, even better, do not use them at all when programming.

=== Using Python from the command line ===
If you don't want to use Python from the command line, you don't have to, just use IDLE. To get into interactive mode just type &lt;code&gt;python3&lt;/code&gt; without any arguments. To run a program, create it with a text editor (Emacs has a good Python mode) and then run it with &lt;code&gt;python3 program_name&lt;/code&gt;.

Additionally, to use Python within Vim, you may want to visit [http://wiki.python.org/moin/Vim Python wiki page about VIM]

==== Running Python Programs in *nix ====

If you are using Unix (such as Linux, Mac OS X, or BSD), if you make the program executable with [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chmod chmod], and have as the first line:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#!/usr/bin/env python3
&lt;/source&gt;
you can run the python program with &lt;code&gt;./hello.py&lt;/code&gt; like any other command.

=== Where to get help ===
At some point in your Python career you will probably get stuck and have no clue about how to solve the problem you are supposed to work on. This tutorial only covers the basics of Python programming, but there is a lot of further information available.

==== Python documentation ====
First of all, Python is very well documented. There might even be copies of these documents on your computer, which came with your Python installation:
* The official [http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/ Python 3 Tutorial] by Guido van Rossum is often a good starting point for general questions.
* For questions about standard modules (you will learn what this is later), the [http://docs.python.org/3/library/ Python 3 Library Reference] is the place to look at.
* If you really want to get to know something about the details of the language, the [http://docs.python.org/3/reference/ Python 3 Reference Manual] is comprehensive but quite complex for beginners.

==== Python user community ====
There are a lot of other Python users out there, and usually they are nice and willing to help you. This very active user community is organised mostly through mailing lists and a newsgroup:
* The [http://mail.python.org/mailman/listinfo/tutor tutor mailing list] is for folks who want to ask questions regarding how to learn computer programming with the Python language.
* The [http://www.python.org/community/lists/#python-help python-help mailing list] is python.org's help desk. You can ask a group of knowledgeable volunteers questions about all your Python problems.
* The Python newsgroup [news:comp.lang.python comp.lang.python] ([http://groups.google.com/group/comp.lang.python/ Google groups archive]) is the place for general Python discussions, questions and the central meeting point of the community.
* Python wiki has a [http://wiki.python.org/moin/LocalUserGroups list of local user groups], you can join the group mailing list and ask questions. You can also participate in the user group meetings.

In order not to reinvent the wheel and discuss the same questions again and again, people will appreciate very much if you ''do a web search for a solution to your problem before contacting these lists!''

==Thanks==
Thanks for your work on the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Recreation/Swimming - Beginner (General Conference)‎|Swimming - Beginnner]] honor.  I fixed up the formatting on requirement 5.  If you're wondering what went wrong, it was the leading spaces you had when you indented the paragraph.  That causes the wiki engine to render everything as a single unformatted line.  If you have questions, don't hesitate to ask me! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 05:03, 31 December 2008 (UTC)</text>

Hi Abw,

You nominated [[User:Grawp]]'s user page for [[WB:SD|speedy deletion]]. I don't think the page warrants deletion and have removed the tag. The user engaged in vandalism on Wikibooks and has been blocked indefinately. The page links to the Wikipedia user page with the same username. You could see that as a shrine, but I don't find it offensive enough to be deleted. If you feel strongly about it, you can raise the issue at [[WB:VfD]]. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 08:51, 31 December 2008 (UTC)</text>

This template for citing [http://www.ada-auth.org/ais.html Ada Issues] (AI) is indicated for inline references.

== Usage ==
All the parameters are optional, except '''title''' and '''id''':
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Ada/2005/Cite AI
 |      title = (required)
 |         id = (required)
 |        alt = 
 |      class = 
 |       date = 
 |        rev = 
 |      quote = 
 | accessdate =&lt;/nowiki&gt; {{CURRENTYEAR}}-{{CURRENTMONTH}}-{{CURRENTDAY2}}
}}

; title : title of the Ada Issue
; id : identifier
; alt : alternative (if available), first alternative by default
; class : one of:
* Amendment
* Binding Interpretation
* Confirmation
* Ramification
* Presentation
; date : date in YYYY-MM-DD format
; rev : revision number
; quote : specific quote

== Example ==
The following template instantiation:
&lt;pre&gt;
*{{Ada/2005/Cite AI
 |      title = Variable views of constant objects
 |         id = 54
 |        alt = 2
 |      class = Binding Interpretation
 |       date = 2008-11-26
 |        rev = 1.6
 |      quote = ...squirreling away an access-to-variable value during the initialization of a constant (the so-called &quot;Rosen&quot; trick)...
 | accessdate = 2009-01-01
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

gives:
*{{Ada/2005/Cite AI
 |      title = Variable views of constant objects
 |         id = 54
 |        alt = 2
 |      class = Binding Interpretation
 |       date = 2008-11-26

      <text xml:space="preserve">There could be a question that will ask if a reaction is feasible in the opposite direction to the way that you would expect it to go from the E&lt;sup&gt;&lt;s&gt;O&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; values. For this, all you have to do is show the calculation in the same way as usual but make the E&lt;sup&gt;&lt;s&gt;O&lt;/s&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; value negative. This shows that the reaction is going in the other way. Because the reaction is not feasible, the value will be negative.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;!-- Now for our first lesson, what is a computer program?  A computer program is a set of very detailed instructions that tell a computer what to do.   --&gt;
=== What you should know ===
Once you've read and mastered this chapter, you should know how to edit programs in a text editor or IDLE,  save them to the hard disk, and run them once they have been saved.

=== Printing ===

Programming tutorials since the beginning of time have started with a little program called &quot;Hello, World!&quot;&lt;ref&gt;[[Computer Programming/Hello world|Here]] is a great list of the famous &quot;Hello, world!&quot; program in many programming languages. Just that you know how simple Python can be...&lt;/ref&gt;  So here it is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

If you are using the command line to run programs then type it in with a text editor, save it as &lt;code&gt;hello.py&lt;/code&gt; and run it with &lt;code&gt;python3.0 hello.py&lt;/code&gt;

Otherwise go into IDLE, create a new window, and create the program as
in section [[Non-Programmer's Tutorial for Python 3/Intro#Creating_and_Running_Programs|Creating and Running Programs]].

When this program is run here's what it prints:

 Hello, World!

Now I'm not going to tell you this every time, but when I show you a
program I recommend that you type it in and run it.  I learn better
when I type it in and you probably do too.

Now here is a more complicated program:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print(&quot;Jack and Jill went up a hill&quot;)
print(&quot;to fetch a pail of water;&quot;)
print(&quot;Jack fell down, and broke his crown,&quot;)
print(&quot;and Jill came tumbling after.&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

When you run this program it prints out:

 Jack and Jill went up a hill
 to fetch a pail of water;
 Jack fell down, and broke his crown,
 and Jill came tumbling after.

When the computer runs this program it first sees the line:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print(&quot;Jack and Jill went up a hill&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

so the computer prints:

 Jack and Jill went up a hill

Then the computer goes down to the next line and sees:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print(&quot;to fetch a pail of water;&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

So the computer prints to the screen:

 to fetch a pail of water;

The computer keeps looking at each line, follows the command and then goes on to the next line.  The computer keeps running commands until it reaches the end of the program.

==== Terminology ====
Now is probably a good time to give you a bit of an explanation of what is happening - and a little bit of programming terminology.

What we were doing above was using a ''function'' called &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt;.  The function's name - &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; - is followed by parentheses containing zero or more ''arguments''.  So in this example

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

there is one ''argument'', which is &lt;code&gt;&quot;Hello, World!&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.  Note that this argument is a group of characters enclosed in double quotes (&quot;&quot;).  This is commonly referred to as a ''string of characters'', or ''string'', for short.  Another example of a string is &lt;code&gt;&quot;Jack and Jill went up a hill&quot;&lt;/code&gt;.  The combination of a function and parentheses with the arguments is a ''function call''.

A function and its arguments are one type of ''statement'' that python has, so

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

is an example of a statement.  Basically, you can think of a statement as a single line in a program.  

That's probably more than enough terminology for now.

=== Expressions ===
Here is another program:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print(&quot;2 + 2 is&quot;, 2 + 2)
print(&quot;3 * 4 is&quot;, 3 * 4)
print(&quot;100 - 1 is&quot;, 100 - 1)
print(&quot;(33 + 2) / 5 + 11.5 is&quot;, (33 + 2) / 5 + 11.5)
&lt;/source&gt;

And here is the ''output'' when the program is run:

 2 + 2 is 4
 3 * 4 is 12
 100 - 1 is 99
 (33 + 2) / 5 + 11.5 is 18.5

As you can see, Python can turn your thousand-dollar computer into a five-dollar calculator.

In this example, the print function is followed by two arguments, with each of the arguments separated by a comma.  So with the first line of the program

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print(&quot;2 + 2 is&quot;, 2 + 2)
&lt;/source&gt;

The first argument is the string &lt;code&gt;&quot;2 + 2 is&quot;&lt;/code&gt; and the second argument is the ''mathematical expression'' &lt;code&gt;2 + 2&lt;/code&gt;, which is commonly referred to as an ''expression''.

What is important to note is that a string is printed as is (without the enclosing double quotes), but an ''expression'' is ''evaluated'', or converted to its actual value.

Python has seven basic operations for numbers: 

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Operation 
! Symbol 
! Example
|-
|Power (exponentiation)
| &lt;code&gt;**&lt;/code&gt; 
| &lt;code&gt;5 ** 2 == 25&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|Multiplication 
| &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; 
|&lt;code&gt;2 * 3 == 6&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|Division 
| &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt; 
| &lt;code&gt;14 / 3 == 4.666666666666667&lt;/code&gt; 
|-
|Integer Division
| &lt;code&gt;//&lt;/code&gt;
| &lt;code&gt;14 // 3 == 4&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|Remainder (modulo)
| &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; 
| &lt;code&gt;14 % 3 == 2&lt;/code&gt; 
|-
|Addition 
| &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; 
| &lt;code&gt;1 + 2 == 3&lt;/code&gt; 
|-
|Subtraction 
| &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt; 
| &lt;code&gt;4 - 3 == 1&lt;/code&gt;
|}

Notice that there are two ways to do division, one that returns the repeating decimal, and the other that can get the remainder and the whole number.  
The order of operations is the same as in math:
* parentheses &lt;code&gt;()&lt;/code&gt;
* exponents &lt;code&gt;**&lt;/code&gt;
* multiplication &lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt;, division &lt;code&gt;/&lt;/code&gt;, integer division &lt;code&gt;//&lt;/code&gt;, and remainder &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt; 
* addition &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; and subtraction &lt;code&gt;-&lt;/code&gt;
So use parentheses to structure your formulas when needed.

=== Talking to humans (and other intelligent beings) ===

Often in programming you are doing something complicated and may not in the future remember what you did.  When this happens the program should probably be commented.  A ''comment'' is a note to you and other programmers explaining what is happening.  For example:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# Not quite PI, but a credible simulation
print(22 / 7)
&lt;/source&gt;

Which outputs

 3.14285714286

Notice that the comment starts with a hash: &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;. Comments are used to communicate with others who read the program and your future self to make clear what is complicated.

Note that any text can follow a comment, and that when the program is run, the text after the &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; through to the end of that line is ignored. The &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt; does not have to be at the beginning of a new line:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# Output PI on the screen
print(22 / 7) # Well, just a good approximation
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Examples ===
Each chapter (eventually) will contain examples of the programming features introduced in the chapter.  You should at least look over them and see if you understand them.  If you don't, you may want to type them in and see what happens.  Mess around with them, change them and see what happens.  

'''Denmark.py'''

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print(&quot;Something's rotten in the state of Denmark.&quot;)
print(&quot;                -- Shakespeare&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

Output:

 Something's rotten in the state of Denmark.
                 -- Shakespeare

'''School.py'''

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# This is not quite true outside of USA
# and is based on my dim memories of my younger years
print(&quot;Firstish Grade&quot;)
print(&quot;1 + 1 =&quot;, 1 + 1)
print(&quot;2 + 4 =&quot;, 2 + 4)
print(&quot;5 - 2 =&quot;, 5 - 2)
print()
print(&quot;Thirdish Grade&quot;)
print(&quot;243 - 23 =&quot;, 243 - 23)
print(&quot;12 * 4 =&quot;, 12 * 4)
print(&quot;12 / 3 =&quot;, 12 / 3)
print(&quot;13 / 3 =&quot;, 13 // 3, &quot;R&quot;, 13 % 3)
print()
print(&quot;Junior High&quot;)
print(&quot;123.56 - 62.12 =&quot;, 123.56 - 62.12)
print(&quot;(4 + 3) * 2 =&quot;, (4 + 3) * 2)
print(&quot;4 + 3 * 2 =&quot;, 4 + 3 * 2)
print(&quot;3 ** 2 =&quot;, 3 ** 2)
&lt;/source&gt;

Output:

 Firstish Grade

      <comment>/* Why Geometry? What are the prerequisites? */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Why Geometry? What are the prerequisites? ==

Basic geometry is a very powerful practical problem solver. It was used by the ancient Egyptians and Greeks for solving most problems and was the proto-type for rational thinking. Where we use algebra today the Greeks used geometry then.*&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;  
*1  &lt;u&gt;A HISTORY OF WESTERN PHILOSOPHY&lt;/u&gt; by Bertrand Russell, page 36, 39, 208 (chapter XXIV)

What should you know before attempting to teach yourself geometry from this text? 
Tutoring has taught me that ability with fractions is a good predictor of success in starting algebra and geometry.

Some arithmetic and simple algebra is needed, but unfortunately I haven’t found a good wikibook source that is not too advanced. Suggestions?

      <text xml:space="preserve">1. An electrochemical cell is an exothermic reaction set up as two half-cells in two separate containers so that the energy released can produce current between them

A half-cell is half of an electrochemical cell. One half-cell supplies electrons, the other half-cell receives electrons

2. 0.76V

3. The salt bridge allows movement of ions between the two half-cells completing the circuit. This can simply be filter paper soaked in potassium nitrate solution 

4. see page

5. Change the conditions, they will no longer be standard values but E values. This can shift the equilibrium of a reaction and its E value

6. Reaction rate

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TopNav|prev=Blitzkrieg|next=Battle of Britain}}
==Why did the battle happen?==

Britain is quite a small island and during the war it couldn't produce all the food for its people or all the guns, tanks and other equipment it needed for its army. So, Britain needed to ship the things it needed from other countries. Once Germany had conquered France and much of the rest of western Europe, Britain relied heavily on the United States and other countries outside of Europe for supplies.

The Atlantic Ocean is the world's second largest ocean and it separates Great Britain from North America.  Thousands of ships would cross the Atlantic during the war bringing in vital war equipment and food.If Germany was to make Britain surrender, it needed to stop the ships. Ships also crossed the Atlantic to take supplies from the United States and Britain to the Soviet Union.

==When was the battle?==

The Battle of the Atlantic is the name given to the war fought between ships, submarines and airplanes between 1939 and 1945 - the longest battle of the war. The battle was at its most fierce between the middle of 1940 and the end of 1943. After this, the allies better weapons and code breaking skills meant the Germans could no longer sink enough ships to win.

==Who was involved?==

[[File:Allied tanker torpedoed.jpg|thumb|right|Allied tanker torpedoed in Atlantic Ocean by a German submarine. The ship is crumbling under the heat of the fire, 1942]]

In the beginning it was Britain and Canada against the Germans. Then, from the middle of 1940 the Italians joined the German side. From September 1941 the United States joined the Allies, although they had given help before this date without officially being at war with Germany.

==What were the results?==

The allies lost 3,500 merchant ships and 175 warships, with over 30,000 sailors killed. The Germans lost 783 submarines and over 28,000 sailors.

This is the open-content edition of '''Chemical Principles''', an introductory college-level text for General Chemistry.  The starting point for this edition is the third edition of the textbook bearing the same title, originally authored by R. E. Dickerson, H. B. Gray, and G. P. Haight, Jr.  The textbook was published by The Benjamin/Cummings Publishing Company (Menlo Park, CA) in 1979. 

As part of its project to make books by its faculty freely available, the California Institute of Technology has posted a set of PDF files containing the full and complete contents of the book on its library web site. The persistent URL for the book is http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechBOOK:1979.001  The accompanying usage policy for the material is astonishingly simple: &quot;You are granted permission for individual, educational, research and non-commercial reproduction, distribution, display and performance of this work in any format.&quot;

The material is used here as the starting material for an open-content textbook with the generous explicit and written permission of the Caltech library and Harry B. Gray, on behalf of the authors. 

Construction of this book began on January 1, 2009. The red links below do not have any content at all, whereas most of the blue links are chapters that are just getting started.  If you would like to contribute your time and energy to inserting material from the original ''Chemical Principles, 3rd Edition'', please follow the instructions at the beginning of the chapter. Also, see the [[Chemical_Principles/Style Guide | Style Guide]] for this textbook.

I don't know if &quot;Objects&quot; is a good name for this page. I'm thinking it might be better titled &quot;Classes&quot; since the scope of this page is limited to the definition of classes, whereas &quot;objects&quot; might be a little too broad.

== Implicit class construction syntax does not match usage  sample ==

The implicit class construction sample does not match the syntax shown. In particular, the keywords &quot;class&quot; and &quot;end&quot; do not appear in the given syntax. This discrepancy is unnecessary and potentially confusing to novices as it makes the sample not derivable from the associated syntax.

== Generic class sample header green hi-light excludes the second occurrence of a in 'a ==

Because the color is meaningful then the incorrect application of it becomes confusing. Either eliminate the colors altogether (which would be unfortunate) or get it right. It seems that this is a result of a colorization function inaccessible to wiki-edit.</text>

[[Computer Programming/AI]] presented the four points a bit differently.

:Artificial Intelligence is a subfield of Computer Science that deals with the creation of systems that exhibit &quot;intelligence&quot;, for varying definitions of intelligence. There are four generally cited standpoints on what an intelligent system should do: think rationally, act rationally, think like a human, or act like a human.

:Each one of these views has wide-ranging implications for the development of intelligent systems. The oft-cited [[w:Turing Test|Turing Test]] assumes the fourth standpoint, that a system that acts sufficiently human can be called intelligent, but many current researchers take a stance more like the second -- if a system produces rational, useful behavior, then it is certainly more intelligent than one that does not.

This page should break down the points before applying them to the definition it's constructing. --[[User:Mrwojo|Mrwojo]] ([[User talk:Mrwojo|talk]]) 04:18, 1 January 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[w:GOFAI|GOFAI]], or Good Old Fashioned AI, views the brain as a machine for processing symbols.  The focus was on the programmer to analyse a problem, break it down into its component parts, and write code that would perform each of the component parts.  It heavily relied upon [[w:Search|Search]] techniques, which search through the possible solutions to a problem until a satisfactory answer is found.

As time went on, it became clear that GOFAI had severe limitations.  If the [[w:Branching Factor|Branching Factor]] of a problem is too large for GOFAI to search through, the only answer is to use [[w:Heuristic|Heuristic]]s to search the solution space more efficiently.  But if a suitable heuristic is not known, then there GOFAI gets stuck.

GOFAI had the greatest difficulties solving the problems that humans find easiest.  [[w:Computer Vision|Computer Vision]], [[w:Natural Language Processing|Natural Language Processing]] and [[w:Robotics|Robotics]] are areas in which GOFAI performs very badly.

[[w:New Wave AI|New Wave AI]] uses methods borrowed from biology.  It uses powerful [[w:Evolutionary Techniques|Evolutionary Techniques]] such as [[w:Genetic Algorithms|Genetic Algorithms]] and [[w:Genetic Programming|Genetic Programming]] as well as the similarly powerful [[w:Neural Network|Neural Network]]s.

New Wave AI is still a relatively new field, and a lot of interesting work is still being done.  Some of the more exciting developments include [[w:Chaotic Neural Network|Chaotic Neural Network]]s, [[w:Gaseous Neural Network|Gaseous Neural Network]]s and [[w:Situated Robotics|Situated Robotics]].

Some content from one of the previous AI book stubs ([[Computer Programming/AI]]) on various types of NNs.

&lt;div style=&quot;border:1px solid black&quot;&gt;
;perceptron
:The perceptron is a classification of feedforward neural network.  The nodes, or artificial neurons, in a layer sum their inputs, which may be weighted, and provide a response (output) if a threshold value is reached.  There may be a single layer or more of nodes which direct their output to the next layer.

;feedforward neural network
:A node in neural networks is similar to the neuron of a biological system.  It receives input from connections and produces output, which depends upon the input.  A group of these nodes and their connections constitute a feedforward neural network; the output of the nodes, the fundamental units, form the input connections for other nodes in the subsequent layer.  The group of nodes that are at the same heirarchical level form a layer.  Note that information only proceeds forward, and there are generally no loops in the network.

:Groups of nodes are usually divided into three layers in feedforward neural networks: the input layer, the hidden layer, and the output layer.  The input layer is analagous to sensory neurons in that it simply gathers data.  The hidden layer is similar to interneurons and is responsible for processing the information along with the output layer, which could be compared to motor neurons.

;multi-layer neural networks
:Multi-layer neural networks are usually feed-forward.  Each node of the preceding layer has a connection with one or more nodes in the subsequent layer.  Learning techniques, such as back-propagation which requires a loop in the network, are often utilized in multi-layer networks.  They work by bringing the network into a steady state when a certain input is present.

;recurrent neural networks
:Recurrent neural networks differ from feedforward networks in that data may flow both backwards and forwards.  Subsequent layers may provide output to preceding layers.  Nodes may even supply input to themselves.
&lt;/div&gt;

I posted it here, on the talk page, because it wasn't much of a start anyway. --[[User:Mrwojo|Mrwojo]] ([[User talk:Mrwojo|talk]]) 04:31, 1 January 2009 (UTC)

Good idea, essentially this is covered by the Network Model description I added to the introductory page although we might want to edit in recurrent networks just in order for the term to be introduced. I think one thing that we want to consider is how much information we want on neural networks, after all they are a major topic and journals have been published on them since probably the 50's or so. Wikipedia tries to separate the field into &quot;Artificial NN&quot; and &quot;Natural NN&quot; I think the main difference is the tendency for A.I. implementations to move away from attempting to model neural circuits from natural systems. My own work in Artificial Consciousness tends to favor what Wikipedia would call &quot;Natural NN&quot;. The primary difference is the Distributed Processing School, that divorced Neural Networks from the Natural Modeling role, in order to take advantage of the opportunity to implement a distributed processing system. Ideally A.I. techniques that are oriented towards Distributed Processing should not be mistaken for Neural Networks, but according to Wikipedia, that confusion is critical to how the articles are being written. Perhaps what I should do, is split this article into two sections, 1 about Natural Neural Networks, and 1 about Distributed Processing applications using artificial analogs of neural networks. What do you think?--[[User:Graeme E. Smith|Graeme E. Smith]] ([[User talk:Graeme E. Smith|talk]]) 04:55, 16 May 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== new variable SUBPAGENAME ==

Over the weekend i requested a developer add a variable SUBPAGENAME it went live sunday and ive already begun using it for various templates. In regards to the naming policy i assume wikipedia uses PAGENAME for page titles using SUBPAGENAME would leave pages like Cookbook:Blah with the same title but any subpages would display just the name of the subpage and not the full filename. The auto generated backlinks and address bar would still let you know your on a subpage. Just suggesting, any thoughts? [[User:Discordance|Discordance]] 03:38, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

:Well... for page titles, it might be okay, but note you'll be given the same pagename for different pages sometimes. For example, &lt;nowiki&gt;{{SUBPAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns ''Lesson 1'' for both [[Japanese/Kana/Lessons/Hiragana/Lesson 1]] and [[Japanese/Kanji/Lesson 1]]
:The same is true to ''Table of Contents'', ''Introduction''s, ''Chapter 2'', ''Exercise 3'', ... As you mentioned it's true that the parents and grandparents (and so) pages are presented as backlinks just below the title. For newbees, they might not know this fact and they could be confused. Or, probably they know well which Book they're reading thus not confused at all, rather, it might be helpful to know where they are at the moment. Hmm...
:For [[w:Tabbed document interface|TDI]] browsers such as Firefox or Opera, ''Talking about how you are doing'' (displayed &quot;Talikng abo...&quot; or so on the tab) might be better than ''[[Japanese/Lessons/Introduction/Ogenki desu ka/Talking about how you are doing]]'' (displayed &quot;Japanse/Les...&quot; or so), since the latter cannot be distinguished from, say, [[Japanese/Lessons/Introduction/Amerika-jin desu ka/Foreign loan words]] (also &quot;Japanese/Les...&quot;) or [[Japanese/Lessons/Introduction/Konnichiwa/Pronunciation]] (again &quot;Japanese/Les...&quot;). However, this depends on the preferences you set and IE users would not care anyway.
:(off topic) Although it is beyond the scope of this talk page, for categorization via template, &lt;ins&gt;in some cases&lt;/ins&gt; a variable which returns ''foo/bar'' for [[Hoge/foo/bar]] is more desirable (FULLSUBPAGENAME?), rather than  &lt;nowiki&gt;{{SUBPAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; which returns bar for [[Hoge/foo/bar]]. Of course this depends on the category organization (sorry, at first I missed this point). - [[User:Marsian|marsian]] 06:45, 7 March 2006 (UTC) fixed template part 12:29, 7 March 2006 (UTC)

::Something you might want to consider is relative links.  This would be something useful for navigation templates or other places similar to what you are suggesting here.  For the example listed above, [[Japanese/Kana/Lessons/Hiragana/Lesson 1]] and [[Japanese/Kanji/Lesson 1]] can be linked like this to Lesson 1 from each page (using the same Wiki text):  '''&lt;nowiki&gt;[[../Lesson 1]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''&lt;p&gt;This can also go in reverse like this:  '''&lt;nowiki&gt;[[../|Go back]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''&lt;p&gt;This feature is not fully implmented with MediaWiki software and takes a little more work than a usual link, but it does work.  BTW, this wouldn't work with the colon naming convention for subpages.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 00:54, 8 March 2006 (UTC)

== Colon naming conventions ==

I'm going to raise this issue again.  While I agreed that some sort of naming policy ought to be used by a single Wikibook, and having a total free-for-all module naming policy is inappropriate, I don't think the slash convention for naming sub-modules should necessarily be the only one.  I have used the colon naming convention for sub modules as well as the slash convention.  From a technical standpoint, it really doesn't matter and doesn't affect MediaWiki software one bit.  Even from an administrative viewpoint to search pages on Wikibooks, it makes no differences in terms of having to search out pages and find what connects where, and how.  The only real benefit of the slash convention is the &quot;cookie crumb&quot; trail of cascading sub-modules bring with links to &quot;parent&quot; modules.  For authors who don't want them, the colon naming convention may be exactly what they are looking for.

My suggested policy modification is this:  At the discression of the authors of the Wikibook (decided within the main talk page of the Wikibook in question) they can decide upon a naming convention for their content and use either a colon or a slash for naming sub-modules.

Basically this adds the additional option of using colons as seperators for sub-modules.  I believe this to be a reasonable request, and something that has been widely done in the past for many Wikibooks.  I know there are opposing opinions to this subject, and it was inappropriate to force the existing naming policy to add this just to complete the vote.  I wish it had been left in the naming policy (it was there earlier) and I'm asking now for its return.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 01:07, 8 March 2006 (UTC)
:If this were a voting situation, I wouldn't mind another section allowing people to instead vote for making slash the '''only''' accepted convention. There would be many voting yes in that vote and not simply no to allowing the colon convention. We could split it into two groups or let one vote go three ways perhaps. -[[User:Withinfocus|Matt]] 04:39, 8 March 2006 (UTC)
::I think the colon naming is a much better idea for certain sorts of projects, such as many of the how-tos that are more article based than they are chapter based, the obvious example being the [[Cookbook]], but also bartending, gardening, and other topics which end up absorbing a lot of transwikied material. For one thing, making the templates on wikipedia for book linking is quite a chore if you need a different template for every chapter and subchapter. For example, leaving links on the wikipedia articles on [[w:Carrot|Carrots]] and [[w:Basil|Basil]] is a lot easier if you can just use a template linking to pages such as:

:::[[Cookbook:Carrot]] and [[Cookbook:Basil]]

::Rather than something like

:::[[Cookbook/Ingredients/Vegetables/Carrots]] and [[Cookbook/Ingredients/Herbs/Basil]]

::For one thing, you'd need an either an ever-expanding number of variables in the template, (such as Cookbook ((/CHAPTER))((/SUBCHAPTER))((/PAGE))), or an exer expanding number of templates (such as Cookbook/Ingredients/Vegetables((/PAGE)) and Cookbook/Ingredients/Herbs((/Page)), etc.).

::Anyway, I agree that there should be separate votes about separate issues in the naming conventions. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:55, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

:::First off, cookbook is a bad example, because it has it's own namespace, and therefore ''must use a colon for the first level of navigation'' There is simply no way else to do it. Also, you are assuming that the forward slash convention requires a non-flat namespace, which is not true. I have made many books that use a flat, forward slash scheme for navitation. Every single page in those books then, have an automatic back-link to the table of contents. You could just as easily have:

::::My book/my chapter

:::as you could have:

::::My book/my chapter/my subchapter/my page

:::And such a decision is left up to the authors to do with what they please. The colon convention could potentially interfere with the creation of new wiki projects, and new namespaces. The back links that the forward-slash provides may be unnecessisary, but I have yet to see a situation in which it is detrimental, or where it is prefered not to have them for some reason. Any author who doesn't want backlinks for whatever reason, is probably not taking into consideration the needs of the readers for a consistant user interface here. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:08, 14 August 2006 (UTC)

::::Since I'm dealing with new projects and namespaces explicitly on the new Wikiversity project (as an admin, no less), I strongly disagree that this is that huge of an issue, and indeed it has helped doing a transwiki when items were using a colon naming convention in the sense that it helped on the transfer between namespaces and projects.  For me, this is a non-issue and not a reason to stop people from using a colon naming convention, as it really doesn't make any real harm except in extreme situations.  Inter-wiki links to Wikiversity seem to be working just fine, although the &lt;nowiki&gt;[[wikiversity:]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; markup isn't working yet for hopefully obvious reasons.  BTW, the page import between projects is one kick-ass piece of software, and the colon convention is one thing that has helped us out immeasurably.  --[[User:Robert Horning|Rob Horning]] 21:02, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

::::Interesting point. I suppose another way of facilitating IW linking would to simply have redirects with colons, but having the &quot;real&quot; page use the slashes (thus facilitating forking to other wikis).

== Disadvantage with the slash ==

One disadvantage that has been noted with the &quot;/&quot; is that it creates a backlink at the top of the page, which is unnecessary if the page has a table of contents, or just a link to the book's main page, already. I was wondering if anyone knew of a javascript hack for [[MediaWiki:Monobook.js]] that could get rid of it? --[[User:Adam7davies|Adam7davies]] 11:27, 31 May 2006 (UTC)

:In my book, that is an advantage of the slash, and even if there is a way of getting rid of it, I'd ask you to do so in your personal monobook rather than the monobook that applies to everybody. The backlink is somewhat small too, [[User:Jguk|Jguk]] 11:41, 31 May 2006 (UTC)
::Yes, I see it as a huge advantage. A global hack would defeat one of the reasons people like the slash convention. --[[User:Lord Voldemort|&lt;font color=&quot;purple&quot;&gt;LV&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#3D9140&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Lord Voldemort|(Dark Mark)]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 18:04, 31 May 2006 (UTC)
:::But as Adam says, for a book that has a standardized ToC on each page, such a link may be redundant. It might also interfere with the look and feel the book's authors are attempting to achieve. I think the contributors to each Wikibook should be given a large ammount of autonomy as to how a book is organized and presented, as long as the content falls within our mandate. Forcing a possibly unwanted and unneeded link to the top of every page of every book seems somewhat unwiki to me. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 19:56, 31 May 2006 (UTC)
::::But the backlink is small, and I feel that it is a small price to pay for causing wikibooks to all be named in a uniform manner.

Exported page wont work on normal Mediawiki installation if the page has such naming convention.

Slash surrounded by letters has poor readability. Has anybody raised this inconvenient? Ask any publishing expert in book composition, and they will explain that the eye needs stops to improve its scanning ability. That's the reason for instance of fonts with serifs. Spaces before immediately before and after the slash would improve readability. Compare these two examples, or even a third alternative:

# Harry Potter / Chapter 1 / The Boy Who Lived

== Let's reopen this debate... ==

Looks to me like there was not a consensus on the Naming policy standards vis-a-vis slash vs. colon, and the situation &quot;on the ground&quot; certainly reflects this, as I've seen numerous books using colons rather than slash, and even some with both (which definitely seems a bad idea). 

Since both are being used now ''de facto'', and the &quot;enforced policy&quot; isn't being enforced, I think it's time to make it official that both are permitted, and set up guidelines for the use of each.

Colon and slash each have their advantages and disadvantages, as discussed on this page and the archives. Guidelines should be set up to help overcome the disadvantages for each convention. --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:20, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

:This version of the policy states that books that were using the &quot;colon convention&quot; before the acceptance of the policy are allowed to keep the colons (although it is not preferred). All new books should use the slash convention. Saying that some books still do use the colon convention does not mean that we should allow it through policy; if anything, we should be more active in switching books over to the slash convention. I personally am in the process (slowly) of switching the [[Modern Physics]] book over to use the slash convention, so progress is being made on at least one book. Keep in mind that the [[Cookbook]] is technically a separate namespace, just like &quot;wikibooks:&quot; or &quot;User talk:&quot;. Namespaces use colons by default to distinguish between the namespace and the pages.
:Keep in mind also that it is easier to go onto wikipedia and alter the old IW templates then it would be to alter this policy. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 13:36, 18 August 2006 (UTC)

:::The naming policy was approved in a formal vote that took place on [[Wikibooks:Policy/Vote/Naming policy]].

:::Consensus can change. Given that the poll you cite is nearly 3 years old, I think that's a fairly reasonable explanation.

How to notate a page's place in a hierarchy is only one aspect of how to name a page.  So why is this project page about nothing else?

== Cover Pages ==

I think the Naming Policy should say more about cover pages and their proper location. I see a lot of Wikibooks making their main page the cover page, then linking to the Contents page with the text &quot;Go to Contents&quot; or something similar.

Cover pages used in this way are essentially splash pages, or one more page to click through before reaching sought information. Like Flash intros, splash pages went out of style (on successful webpages) somewhere around 1999. Do a Google search for &quot;splash pages&quot; and you'll find many articles explaining the reasons for the splash screen's demise.

Basically, splash screens:
*'''Drive away traffic''' - Most visitors assess websites within a second or two. If they don't find the information they need in that time, they move on. Studies have shown that splash pages typically deflect 25% or more of a page's visitors.
*'''Decrease search engine rankings''' - Because they have no useful content and few links, they dilute search engine rankings (which is the mode of entry to Wikibooks for many users).
*'''Degrade Website Performance''' - The graphically intensive cover pages can add several seconds to load times (especially when Wikimedia's servers are overloaded), frustrating repeat visitors or those with slow connections.
Wikipedia-specific problems are that they:
*'''Confuse visitors''' - Most cover pages are dominated by a large graphic which sends you to the image info page when clicked on, ''not'' the Contents page, leading visitors to not know where to click to continue. Sometimes the image/s are so large, the &quot;Go to Contents&quot; link isn't visible without scrolling (ex. - [[German]]).
*'''Hurt Wikibook navigation''' - When people click on the automatically generated &quot;up&quot; link on subpages, they get sent back to the cover page, making book navigation harder (ex. - [[Principles of Economics]]).

According to the [[Wikibooks:Manual_of_Style#Title_Pages|Manual of Style]] guidelines, the Table of Contents should be at &quot;Bookname&quot; and the Cover page should be located at &quot;Bookname/Cover&quot;. I think this should be explicitly stated and enforced as Naming Policy, not just suggested as a guideline. Doing this will make all Wikibooks easier for visitors to find and to use.

&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Everlong|Everlong]] 14:44, 18 December 2006 (UTC)

: Ok, but note (in the Manual of Style): ''External links, like links from bookshelves, should point to the book cover, not table of contents.'' So current MoS does not discourage creating Cover pages.

: I think that people generally need books that are a bit &quot;eye-candy&quot;. Cover page is a good place for a larger image, BOTM cup, some infoboxes, categories and iterwiki links. You can also reuse it on print version (see MoS &quot;Title page and print version&quot;).

: Anyway, I also think that new authors should obey our rules of naming cover page and book main page. But I doubt that this policy is a correct place to mention it; Manual of Style explains it well, is not too long and quite clearly written (at least for me). I suggest adding &quot;see also&quot; link here pointing to MoS and explaining, that MoS contains full description how the book should be organised. --[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:16, 18 December 2006 (UTC)</text>

This edition oí Chemical Principles, like its predecessors, is designed to be used
in a general university chemistry course which must provide both an over-
view of chemistry for nonspecialists and a sound foundation for later study
for science or chemistry majors. Hence there are several survey chapters
introducing different areas of chemistry, including inorganic, nuclear,
organic, and biochemistry, and an attempt is made throughout the book
to place chemistry in its historical and cultural setting. At the same time,
the quantitative aspects of chemistry are presented in a manner consistent
with their importance, in a way that will make it easy to build upon them
in later courses.

This is the first complete revision of Chemical Principles since the first
edition was published in 1969. The authors have rethought and replanned
the entire book, especially the first thirteen chapters, trying to make it a
better pedagogical tool without losing the special viewpoints and flavor
that made the earlier editions so successful. The history and the anecdotal
asides that help to make the subject palatable have been retained, but they
have been better segregated from the factual material for which a student
will be held responsible.

=== Third Edition Reorganization and Level ===
The basic material of the first six chapters has been rearranged into a more
logical and more easily absorbed order. These chapters, although not
formally set off from the rest of the book, actually make up one study unit
on quantitative chemistry: atoms and moles, stoichiometry, heats of reac-
tion, gas laws and the kinetic theory, chemical equilibrium and acid-base
equilibrium. They have been rethought and rewritten as a block by one of
the authors, with more in-text examples and new end-of-chapter problems.
The mole concept, balancing of equations, and stoichiometry in general
now appear in the first two chapters where they will be most useful as
preparation for the laboratory. At the same time, stoichiometry, which
can be one of the dullest topics in chemistry, is presented along with heats
of reaction as two illustrations of a fundamental physical principle: the
conservation of mass and energy. A long but essential chapter on equi-
librium has been broken down into two more accessible chapters: one on
principles of equilibrium, and the second on acid-base equilibria in aqueous
solutions. It is hoped that these five chapters will give the student a solid
foundation in vocabulary and problem-solving skills without which further
progress in chemistry is impossible. After a solid dose of &quot;basic training,&quot;
Chapter 6 provides a little historical relief, with the story of how we arrived
at the knowledge contained in the first five chapters.

Chapters 7 through 14 make up a second study unit on atomic struc-
ture, chemical periodicity, and chemical structure and bonding. This too
has been carefully reconsidered and revised as a whole by a single author,
thus the Third Edition revision helps unify the text. In response to user
requests, the material on chemical periodicity and inorganic oxidation-
reduction chemistry has been unified in Chapters 9 and 10.

The treatment of molecular orbitals and chemical bonding in the
Second Edition had been liked by most users, but had been considered a
little too high-level and difficult to get into. Now we have divided this
material into two chapters, Chapter 12 on principles of the molecular
orbital theory and applications to simple diatomic molecules, and Chapter
13 on polyatomic molecules and molecular spectroscopy. We have also
provided a new Chapter 11 as an introduction to bonding theories, as far
as one can go with electron pairing and electron pair repulsion short of
quantum mechanics. The Valence Shell Electron Pair Repulsion (VSEPR)
theory, which has been surprisingly neglected in this country, provides an
intuitively simple and nonmathematical way of explaining the shapes of
molecules. These three chapters plus the subsequent one on bonding in
solids and liquids will give the student a secure grounding in the prin-
ciples of bonding, molecular structure, and spectroscopy.

Chapters 15—19 make up a third study unit on thermodynamics and
equilibrium. The material on the first and second laws is essentially the
same as in previous editions, but has been divided into two more digestible
chapters. The statistical description of entropy has been simplified. A new
chapter has been added on phase equilibria, Chapter 18. Since this is
quantitative material and frequently is difficult for the beginning student,
we have significantly increased the number of worked examples in the text,
revised the chapter-end problems, and added new ones.

The last four chapters cover special topics that may not be included in
all introductory courses: coordination chemistry, organic and biochemistry,
chemical kinetics, and nuclear chemistry. After much agonized debate
about principles and pedagogy, we finally decided to place these chapters
at the end, where they can be used or not as the individual instructor
chooses. (We hope that they will all be used.) They have all been revised
and rewritten where necessary, especially the chapter on organic and
biochemistry.

=== Pedagogy ===
Each chapter begins with a list of key concepts. This provides students with
a brief overview of the chapter material, both before they start the chapter
and after they finish, as a quick check on their retention of key ideas.
Throughout the text of each chapter, we have concentrated on expanding
the solutions to problems worked in the chapter. Problem examples relevant
to each concept are presented, and solutions proceed step by step. Chapters
conclude with a summary in which key terms, introduced in the chapter,
are called out in boldface type. Each summary is followed by 20 to 40 self-
study questions and a series of problems arranged by subject.

The Third Edition contains over 100 more end-of-chapter problems
than its predecessor. Moreover, new problems have been written to parallel
the development of each chapter, and all problems have been titled and
grouped by subject matter. Following the more quantitative chapters, the
problems have been paired, with first an odd-numbered problem and then
an even-numbered problem testing the same skills. Answers to the odd-
numbered problems are given in Appendix 6. Hence the even-numbered
problems can be assigned as homework, and if the students cannot work a
problem, they can try the preceding odd-numbered problem first as 
practice, checking their solution against the Appendix.

=== SI Units ===
After considerable debate, the authors have decided to &quot;bite the bullet&quot;
with regard to SI units. There is a traditional attachment to the calorie as
the unit of heat, and it will be a long time before the calorie is eliminated
from the scientific literature. Nevertheless, the sheer logic of SI units, their
ease of use, and the way that they make obvious the connection between
heat, work, and energy, all argue for a changeover now to what will be the
standard units of the next generation of scientists. SI units and the logic
behind them are explained in Appendix 1. The calorie is mentioned in this
book because every scientist will still have to know what a calorie is, but
all calculations are carried out in joules. Thermodynamic tables in 
Appendix 3 and elsewhere in the book have all been converted to joules. At the
same time, we have refused to become overly doctrinaire and throw the
baby out with the bathwater. The standard atmosphere (101,325 pascals)
has been considered to be as reasonable a derived unit in gas law 
calculations as is the electronic charge (0.16022 attocoulumb) for expressing the
charge on an ion. The careful reader will even discover angstrom units
lurking here and there, and we offer no apologies. Our goal has been to
train intelligent scientists and laypeople who can read, understand, and
use the literature.

=== Supplements ===
All of the supplemental aides to the Third Edition have been revised by
their authors on the basis of the new manuscript: Programmed Reviews by
Lassila, Barrow, Kenney, Litle, and Thompson; Relevant Problems by Butler
and Grosser; a new Study Guide covering the entire text by Tom Taylor; and
an Instructors' Manual by Ben Chastain. Some or all of these may be useful
adjuncts to the main textbook in your course.

=== Acknowledgments ===
We are grateful to the many reviewers who read the Third Edition revision
with care: Marcetta Darensbourg, Leo E. Kalian, Curtis B. Anderson,
Paul M. Treichel, Jean Lassila, George Miller, Caroline Eastman,
Lawrence E. Wilkins, Paul Hunter, and Peter Linde. We would like to
thank Ben Chastain and Mildred Johnson for yeoman service in reading
every line of the new edition, and offering detailed suggestions based on
their experience with the Second Edition. Gloria Joyce deserves our thanks
for reducing some of our more convoluted prose to comprehensibility.
Mary Forkner, as sponsoring editor, provided us with feedback from 
reviewers and users that led to the present book. Betsey Rhame carried out
the remarkable task of producing a book that is not only complete and
attractive, but right on schedule. Lastly, we offer belated thanks and 
recognition to James Hall, without whose steady hand there would not even have
been a First Edition, let alone a Third.

As before, our goals in writing Chemical Principles have been to make the
material (a) correct, (b) clear, and (c) interesting, in that order. Your
response to the first two editions tells us that they were reasonably 
satisfactory in this respect, and we hope that the Third Edition will prove to be
even better.

Oh, that was like a year ago that I tagged it.  I probably shouldn't have, considering that I still don't entirely understand the deletion criteria or process.  The original reasoning is that it didn't fit in.  It just didn't match with the rest of the book.  It seemed to me that that book was more to be about simple machines and appliances and everyday objects, not abstract concepts.  Also, having looked at the talk page, it seemed that toher people agreed with me.  I haven't noticed any real changes to the article since I tagged it anyway.

:{{comment}} I'm not sure I agree with deletion, but this page ''does'' feel strangely out of place in the book. A GUI is a very abstract and high-level concept to be dropping on a young Wikijunior reader. I do think we should have more books teaching children about computers and programming (I've been idly planning such a book myself), but this really seems like the wrong way to go about doing it. I don't know what to do about this page in the long run, whether it can be cleaned up or whether it should be removed, but maybe it should be marked in some way to let readers know that it's &quot;experimental&quot; or &quot;advanced&quot; or something. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 21:39, 8 November 2008 (UTC)

*[[Image:Symbol delete vote.svg|15px]] '''Delete''' I've done a lot of work with wikijunior, and dont think that this page is inkeeping with the books target audience. I think that the topic is too advanced for the book, no matter how simple it is made. Though maybe it could be moved into a computing book.

:*I agree with Reece here, there are more then two options on a VfD, we don't just decide whether to &quot;keep&quot; or &quot;delete&quot; things, although those are definitely the most popular options. This page really isn't appropriate for this book, which is a normal occurrence in the editing and authoring processes. Wikijunior is books for children, and things that aren't appropriate for children don't belong in Wikijunior. The correct course of action is to move it out of WJ, even if there is no home for in in WB. In that case, we delete it because it can't stay where it is and it has nowhere else to go. It's not a bad thing, it's called &quot;revision&quot; and it's something we need to do in our books all the time. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:27, 10 November 2008 (UTC)
:*: Book contributors decide what the aim, scope, purpose and intentions of a book are. All I'm saying is that because they make those calls, they should also be making the call as to whether this page fits within the aim, scope, purpose and intentions of the book. What makes something too high-level for Wikijunior? How do you define what is and isn't appropriate for children to learn? Children use computers too, so how is understanding how a GUI works inappropriate for children? To me this seems like a case of some people having a very limited idea of what is appropriate for children. If the book contributors don't want it than that is fine, but I don't think this the right way to determine Wikijunior's scope and what is and isn't appropriate for children. Remember Wikijunior includes books for children of all ages. Surely parents and guardians should be making the call on what is appropriate for their child or children to read and not us? There may even be books outside of Wikijunior that parents might consider appropriate for their children to read. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:19, 20 November 2008 (UTC)
:*:* [[Image:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment'''  Well put.  '''Question:''' Where are the contributors of this book, anyway?  It seems to have been almost abandoned, especially the GUI module.  I guess my point is that this particular module appears as if it was written on a whim by someone who promptly disappeared.  As far as I know, there have been no major edits since I nominated this for deletion.  Once again, I apologize if I'm going about this the wrong way. [[User:RT Jones|RT Jones]] ([[User talk:RT Jones|talk]]) 00:40, 21 November 2008 (UTC)  '''Edit:''' [[Operating_System_Design/Graphical_user_interfaces|This]] seems to fit the bill of a module explaining GUI a bit better, if it makes any difference.
:*:*: Lack of recent activity is, however, hardly an argument for deletion. There is nothing wrong with users disappearing after doing a little bit of work; we can use all the help we can get. This book seems to have enjoyed a very large number of editors. I'd see that as a good thing and is indicative of its popularity. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 03:51, 3 December 2008 (UTC)
:*:*:* Most certainly not.  Any help certainly is appreciated.  What I was saying, from my particularly limited viewpoint, was that this module seemed to have been written almost entirely by one person.  The significance of that is that nobody else in the Wikijunior project appeared to support this module.  How Things Work is a popular article, but the GUI chapter hasn't really gone anywhere practical at all.  Or that's what it looked like to me.  I could have sworn I nominated this longer ago than the 19th of October.  I seriously thought I nominated it much longer ago, like in January, when I didn't understand how much of this process was supposed to work.  There was some discussion on the How Things Work talk page against the inclusion of this module, but it wasn't much.  [[User:RT Jones|RT Jones]] ([[User talk:RT Jones|talk]]) 22:32, 3 December 2008 (UTC) '''Edit:''' Seems appropriate to ask: Since we can only decide if this fits the scope of Wikibooks as a whole here, and not whether it fits some scope of Wikijunior or whether the book contributors (of How Things Work, I guess) want it, where would those issues get tackled?
:*:*:*: The talk page of [[WB:WIWJ]] might be a good place to discuss the scope of Wikijunior. The talk page for the GUI page might be a good place to discuss the appropriateness of the page in the book, or perhaps [[Wikijunior talk:How Things Work]] will get the attention of more contributors of the book as a whole. Also just because another book has a page about GUIs too doesn't mean this should be deleted. The GUI information in the OS Design book is likely to have a very different audience, purpose and scope than the GUI page in How Things Work book. You could use the OS Design's GUI page to aid improving the page in the How Things Work book though if you think it provides more useful information that kids would enjoy. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 23:06, 3 December 2008 (UTC)

''And so, nothing that to our world appears,''&lt;br&gt;
''Perishes completely, for nature ever''&lt;br&gt;
''Upbuilds one thing from another's ruin;''&lt;br&gt;
''Suffering nothing yet to come to birth''&lt;br&gt;
''But by another's death.''&lt;br&gt;

'''Lucretius (95-55 B.C.)'''


==Introduction==

The main question asked in Chapter 2 was &quot;If a given set of substances will react to give a desired product, how much of each substance is needed?&quot; Our basic assumptions were that matter cannot be arbitrarily created or destroyed, and that atoms going into a reaction must come out again as products.

In this chapter we ask a second question: &quot;Will a reaction occur,
eventually?&quot; Is there a tendency or a drive for a given reaction to take place,
and if we wait long enough will we find that reactants have been converted
spontaneously into products? This question leads to the ideas of
'''spontaneity''' and of '''chemical equilibrium'''. A third question, &quot;Will a reaction
occur in a reasonably short time?&quot; involves chemical kinetics, which will be
discussed in Chapter 22. For the moment, we will be satisfied if we can
predict which way a chemical reaction will go by itself, ignoring the time
factor.

==Spontaneous Reactions==

A chemical reaction that will occur on its own, given enough time, is said
to be '''spontaneous'''. In the open air, and under the conditions inside an
automobile engine, the combustion of gasoline is spontaneous:

       C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; + 11 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; 7CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 8 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

(The reaction is exothermic, or heat emitting. The enthalpy change, which
was defined in Chapter 2, is large and negative: &lt;math&gt;\vartriangle \!\,H&lt;/math&gt; = -4812 k&lt;big&gt;J&lt;/big&gt; mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
of heptane at 298 K. The heat emitted causes the product gases to expand,
and it is the pressure from these expanding gases that drives the car.) In
contrast, the reverse reaction under the same conditions is not spontaneous:

       7CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 8H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &lt;math&gt;\nrightarrow &lt;/math&gt;  C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt; + 11 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

No one seriously proposes that gasoline can be obtained spontaneously from
a mixture of water vapor and carbon dioxide.

Explosions are examples of rapid, spontaneous reactions, but a reaction
need not be as rapid as an explosion to be spontaneous. It is important to
understand clearly the difference between rapidity and spontaneity. If you
mix oxygen and hydrogen gases at room temperature, they will remain
together without appreciable reaction for years. Yet the reaction to produce
water is genuinely spontaneous:

       2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

We know that this is true because we can trigger the reaction with a match, or catalyst of finely divided platinum metal.

The preceding sentence suggests why a chemist is interested in whether a reaction is spontaneous, that is, whether it has a natural tendency to occur. If a desirable chemical reaction is spontaneous but slow, it may be possible to speed up the process. Increasing the temperature will often do the trick, or a catalyst may work. We will discuss the functions of a catalyst in detail in Chapter 22. But in brief, we can say now that a catalyst is a substance that helps a naturally spontaneous reaction to go faster by providing an easier pathway for it. Gasoline will burn rapidly in air at a high enough temperature. The role of a spark plug in an automobile engine is to provide this initial temperature. The heat produced by the reaction maintains the high temperature needed to keep it going thereafter. Gasoline will combine with oxygen at room temperature if the proper catalyst is used, because the reaction is naturally spontaneous but slow. But no catalyst will ever make carbon dioxide and water recombine to produce gasoline and oxygen at room temperature and moderate pressures, and it would be a foolish chemist who spent time trying to find such a catalyst. In short, an understanding of spontaneous and nonspontaneous reactions helps a chemist to see the limits of what is ''possible''. If a reaction is possible but not currently realizable, it may be worthwhile to look for ways to carry it out. If the process is inherently impossible, then it is time to study something else.

==Equilibrium and the Equilibrium Constant==

The speed with which a reaction takes a place ordinarily depends on the most concentrations of the reacting substances. This is common sense, since most reactions take place when molecules collide, and the more molecules there are per unit of volume, the more often collisions will occur. 

The industrial fixation of atmospheric nitrogen is very important in the manufacture of agricultural fertilizers (and explosives). One of the steps in nitrogen fixation, in the presence of a catalyst, is

       N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; 2NO                           (4-1)

If this reaction took place by simple collision of one molecule of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and one molecule of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, then we would expect the rate of collision (and hence the rate of reaction) to be proportional to the concentrations of  N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:

       Rate of NO production &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\propto \!\, [N_2][O_2]&lt;/math&gt;

or
  
       ''R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''k&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;[N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;][O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]                        (4-2)

The proportionality constant ''k&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is called the '''forward-reaction rate constant''', and the bracketed terms [N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;][O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] represent concentrations in moles per liter. This rate constant, which we will discuss in more detail in Chapter 22, usually varies with temperature. Most reactions go faster at higher temperatures, so ''k&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' is larger at higher temperatures. But ''k&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' does ''not'' depend on the concentrations of nitrogen and oxygen gases present. All of the concentration dependence of the overall forward reaction rate, ''R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', is contained in the terms [N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] and [O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]. If this reaction began rapidly in a sealed tank with high starting concentrations of both gases, then as more N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; were consumed, the forward reaction would become progressively slower. The rate of reaction would decrease because the frequency of collision of molecules would diminish as fewer N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules were left in the tank.

The reverse reaction can also occur. If this reaction took place by the collision of two molecules of NO to make one molecule of each starting gas, 

       2NO &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;                         (4-3)

then the rate of reaction again would be proportional to the concentration of each of the colliding molecules. Since these molecules are of the same compound, NO, the rate would be proportional to the ''square'' of the NO concentration:

       Rate of NO removal &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\propto \!\,&lt;/math&gt;[NO][NO]

or

       ''R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' = k&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[NO]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;                             (4-4)

where ''R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the overall reverse reaction rate and ''k&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the rev~rse-reaction
rate constant. If little NO is present when the experiment begins, this
reaction will occur at a negligible rate. But as more NO accumulates by the
forward reaction, the faster it will be broken down by the reverse reaction.

Thus as the forward rate, ''R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', decreases, the reverse rate, ''R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' , increases.
Eventually the point will be reached at which the forward and reverse
reactions exactly balance (4-5):

::{|
   |- align=&quot;center&quot; 
   |''R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''|| = ||''R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
   |-
   |[N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;][O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]''k&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''|| = ||''k&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''[NO]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;                            
   |}

This is the condition of '''equilibrium'''. Had you been monitoring the concentrations
of the three gases, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and NO, you would have found that
the composition of the reacting mixture had reached an equilibrium state
and thereafter ceased to change with time. This does not mean that the
individual reactions had stopped, only that they were proceeding at equal
rates; that is, they had arrived at, and thereafter maintained, a condition of
balance or equilibrium.

[[Image:Chemical Principles Fig 4.1.png|frame|'''Figure 4-1''' Illustration of dynamic equilibrium: two fish tanks connected by a channel (a) Start of

The condition of equilibrium can be illustrated by imagining two
large fish tanks, connected by a channel (Figure 4-1). One tank initially
contains 10 goldfish, and the other contains 10 guppies. If you watch the
fish swimming aimlessly long enough, you will eventually find that approximately
5 of each type of fish are present in each tank. Each fish has the
same chance of blundering through the channel into the other tank. But as
long as there are more goldfish in the left tank (Figure 4-la), there is a
greater probability that a goldfish will swim from left to right than the
reverse. Similarly, as long as the number of guppies in the right tank exceeds
that in the left, there will be a net flow of guppies to the left, even though
there is nothing in the left tank to make the guppies prefer it. Thus the rate
of flow of guppies is proportional to the concentration of guppies present.
A similar statement can be made for the goldfish.

At equilibrium (Figure 4-1b), on an average there will be 5 guppies
and 5 goldfish in each tank. But they will not always be the same 5 of
each fish. If 1 guppy wanders from the left tank into the right, then it or a
different guppy may wander back a little later. Thus at equilibrium we find
that the fish have not stopped swimming, only that over a period of time the
total number of guppies and goldfish in each tank remains constant. If we
were to fill each tank with 9 goldfish and then throw in 1 guppy, we would
see that, in its aimless swimming, it would spend half its time in one tank
and half in the other (Figure 4-1 c).

In the NO reaction we considered, there will be a constant concentration
of NO molecules at equilibrium, but they will not always be the same
NO molecules. Individual NO molecules will react to re-form N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,
and other reactant molecules will make more NO. As with the goldfish, only
on a head-count or concentration basis have changes ceased at equilibrium.

The equilibrium condition for the NO-producing reaction, equation
4-1, can be rewritten in a more useful form:

       &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{[NO]^2}{[N_2][O_2]} = \textstyle\frac{k_1}{k_2} = K_eq&lt;/math&gt;                          (4-6)

in which the ratio of forward and reverse rate constants is expressed as a
simple constant, the '''equilibrium constant, K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;'''. This equilibrium constant
will vary as the temperature varies, but it is independent of the concentrations
of the reactants and products. It tells us the ratio of products to reactants
at equilibrium, and is an extremely useful quantity for determining
whether a desired reaction will take place spontaneously.

==General Form of the Equilibrium Constant==

We derived the equilibrium-constant expression for the NO reaction by
assuming that we knew the way that the forward and reverse steps occurred
at the molecular level. If the NO reaction proceeded by simple collision of
two molecules, the derivation would be perfectly correct. The actual mechanism
of this reaction is more complicated. But it is important, and fortunate
for chemists, that we do not have to know the reaction mechanism
to write the proper equilibrium constant. The equilibrium-constant expression
can always be written from the balanced chemical equation, with no
other information, even when the forward and reverse rate expressions are
more complicated than the balanced equation would suggest. (We shall
prove this in Chapter 16.) In our NO example, the forward reaction actually
takes place by a series of complicated chain steps. The reverse reaction
takes place by a complementary set of reactions, so that these complications
cancel one another in the final ratio of concentrations that gives us the
equilibrium constant. The details of the mechanism are &quot;invisible&quot; to the
equilibrium-constant expression, and irrelevant to equilibrium calculations.

A general chemical reaction can be written as

       ''a''A + ''b''B [[Image:U+21C4.svg]] ''c''C + ''d''D                             (4-7)

In this expression, A and B represent the reactants; C and D, the products.
The letters ''a, b, c,'' and ''d'' represent the ''number'' of moles of each substance
involved in the balanced reaction, and the double arrows indicate a state of
equilibrium. Although only two reactants and two products are shown in
the general reaction, the principle is extendable to any number. The correct
equilibrium-constant expression for this reaction is

       &lt;math&gt;K_{eq} = \textstyle\frac{[C]^c[D]^d}{[A]^a[B]^b}&lt;/math&gt;                            (4-8)

It is the ratio of product concentrations to reactant concentrations, with
each concentration term raised to a power given by the number of moles of
that substance appearing in the balanced chemical equation. Because it is
based on the quantities of reactants and products present at equilibrium,
equation 4-8 is called the '''law of mass action'''.

|-
|'''Solution'''
The equilibrium constant is given by
::&lt;math&gt;K_{eq} = \textstyle\frac{[CO_2][H_2]}{[CO][H_2O]}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Since all four substances have a coefficient of 1 in the balanced equation,
their concentrations are all raised to the first power in the equilibrium-constant
expression.

|What is the equilibrium-constant expression for the formation of water from hydrogen and oxygen gases? The reaction is

|-
|'''Solution'''
::&lt;math&gt;K_{eq} = \textstyle\frac{[H_2O]^2}{[H_2]^2[O_2]}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Since two moles of hydrogen and water are involved in the chemical equation,
their concentrations are squared in the K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; expression.

|-
|'''Solution'''
::&lt;math&gt;K_{eq} = \textstyle\frac{[H_2]^2[O_2]}{[H_2O]^2}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

An important general point emerges here. This reaction is the reverse of
that of Example 2, and the equilibrium-constant expression is the inverse,
or reciprocal, of the earlier one. ''If a balanced chemical reaction is reversed, then
the equilibrium-constant expression must be inverted'', since what once were reactants
now are products, and vice versa.

::H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O [[Image:U+21C4.svg]] H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{1}{2}O_2&lt;/math&gt;

|-
|'''Solution'''
::&lt;math&gt;K_{eq} = \textstyle\frac{[H_2][O_2]^{1/2}}{[H_2O]}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Notice that when the reaction from Example 3 is divided by 2, resulting
in the Example 4 reaction, the equilibrium constant is the square root of
the old value, or the old K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; to the one-half power. Similarly, if the reaction
is doubled, the K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;  must be squared. In general, it is perfectly proper to
multiply all the coefficients of a balanced chemical reaction by any positive
or negative number, ''n'', and the equation will remain balanced. (Multiplying
all the coefficients of an equation by - 1 is formally the same as
writing the equation in reverse. Write out a simple equation and prove to
yourself that this is so.) ''But if all the co1ficients of an equation are multiplied by n, then the new equilibrium-constant expression is the old one raised to the nth power''. Hence, when working with equilibrium constants, one must keep the corresponding chemical reactions clearly in mind.

Notice that there is nothing wrong with fractional powers in the equilibrium-constant
expression.

==Using Equilibrium Constants==

Equilibrium constants have two main purposes:

::''1.'' To help us tell whether a reaction will be spontaneous under specified conditions.
::''2.'' To enable us to calculate the concentration of reactants and products that will be present once equilibrium has been reached. 

We can illustrate how equilibrium constants can be used to achieve these ends, and also the fact that an equilibrium constant is indeed ''constant'', with real data from one of the most intensively studied of all reactions, that between hydrogen and iodine to yield hydrogen iodide:
       
       H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'') + I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'') [[Image:U+21C4.svg]] 2HI(''g'')                               (4-9)

[[Image:Chemical Principles Table 4.1.png|frame]]

If we mix hydrogen and iodine in a sealed flask and observe the reaction,
the gradual fading of the purple color of the iodine vapor tells us that
iodine is being consumed. This reaction was studied first by the German
chemist Max Bodenstein in 1893. Table 4-1 contains the data from
Bodenstein's experiments. The experimental data are in the first three
columns. In the fourth column, we have calculated the simple ratio of
product and reactant concentrations, [HI]/[H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;][I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;], to see if it is constant.
It clearly is not, for as the hydrogen concentration is decreased and the
iodine concentration is increased, this ratio varies from 2.60 to less than 1.
The law of mass action (Section 4-3) dictates that the equilibrium-constant
expression should contain the ''square'' of the HI concentration, since the
reaction involves 2 moles of HI for every mole of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; , The fifth column
shows that the ratio [HI]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/[H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;][I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] is constant within a mean deviation of
approximately 3%. * Therefore, this ratio is the proper equilibrium-constant
expression, and the average value of K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; for these six runs is 50.53.

The equilibrium constant can be used to determine whether a reaction
under specified conditions will go spontaneously in the forward or in the
reverse direction. The ratio of product concentration to reactant concentration,
identical to the equilibrium constant in form but not necessarily
at equilibrium conditions, is called the '''reaction quotient, Q:'''

       ''Q'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{[HI]^2}{[H_2][I_2]}&lt;/math&gt;      (not necessarily at equilibrium)           (4-10)

If there are too many reactant molecules present for equilibrium to exist,
then the concentration terms in the denominator will make the reaction
quotient, ''Q'', smaller than K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;. The reaction will go forward spontaneously to
make more product. However, if an experiment is set up so that the reaction
quotient is greater than K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;, then too many product molecules are present
for equilibrium and the reverse reaction will proceed spontaneously.
Therefore, a comparison of the actual concentration ratio or reaction
quotient with the equilibrium constant allows us to predict in which direction
a reaction will go spontaneously under the given set of circumstances:

       ''Q'' &lt; K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;     (forward reaction spontaneous)
       ''Q'' &gt; K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;     (reverse reaction spontaneous)                 (4-11)
       ''Q'' = K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;     (reactants and products at equilibrium)

* These are Bodenstein's original numbers. Modern data can be much more accurate, with
less deviation in K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;. The mean deviation is the average of the deviations of individual
calculated K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; from the average K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;.

The reaction quotient under these conditions is
::&lt;math&gt;Q = \textstyle\frac{(2.0 \times 10^{-3})}{(1.0 \times 10^{-2})^2}&lt;/math&gt; = 0.040
This is smaller than the equilibrium value of 50.53 in Table 4-1, which tells us that excess reactants are present. Hence, equilibrium will not be reached until more HI has been formed.

|-
|'''Solution'''
You can verify that the reaction quotient is Q = 4.0. Because this is less than K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;, the forward reaction is still spontaneous.

|-
|'''Solution'''
The reaction quotient now is Q = 400. This is greater than Keq- There are
now too many product molecules and too few reactant molecules for equilibrium
to exist. Thus the reverse reaction occurs more rapidly than the forward
reaction. Equilibrium is reached only by converting some of the HI to
H2 and 12, so the reverse reaction is spontaneous.

|-
|'''Solution'''
Under these conditions,
::''Q'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{(7.1 \times 10^{-3})^2}{(1.0 \times 10^{-3})^2} = 50.4 = K_{eq}&lt;/math&gt;
Since Q equals K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; within the limits of accuracy of the data, the system as described is at equilibrium, and neither the forward nor the backward reaction is spontaneous. (Both reactions are still taking place at the molecular level, of course, but they are balanced so their net effects cancel.)

of reactants and products that will be present at equilibrium.

|'''Solution'''
The K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; expression is treated as an ordinary algebraic equation, and solved for the HI concentration:

equilibrium value; in Example 8 it was more; and in Example 9 it was just

From the stoichiometry of the reaction, the concentrations of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; must be the same. For every mole of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; formed, 2 moles of HI must decompose. Let ''y'' equal the number of moles of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''per liter'' present at equilibrium. The initial concentration of HI before any dissociation has occurred is
::[HI]&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{0.10 mole}{(5.0 liters} = 0.020 mole liter^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
Begin by writing a balanced equation for the reaction, then make a table of concentrations at the start and at equilibrium:
::{|border=0
   |- valign=top
   | ||H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; +&amp;nbsp;|| I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[Image:U+21C4.svg]] || 2HI
   |- align=center
   |Start (moles Liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;):|| 0 || 0 ||0.020
   |- 
   |Equilibrium:||&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;''y'' || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;''y'' || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0.020 - 2''y''
   |}
The HI concentration of 0.020 mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; has been decreased by 2''y'' for every ''y'' moles of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that are formed. The equilibrium-constant expression is
::50.53 = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{(0.020 - 2y)^2}{y^2}&lt;/math&gt;
We immediately see that we can take a shortcut by taking the square root of both sides:
:: &amp;nbsp; 7.11 =  &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{0.020 - 2y}{y}&lt;/math&gt;
::9.11 y = 0.020
::&amp;nbsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;y = 0.0022 mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
For 5 liters, 5 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 0.0022 = 0.011 mole of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and of I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will be present at equilibrium. Only (0.020 - 0.0044) &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 5 = 0.080 mole of HI will be left in the 5-liter tank, and the fraction of HI dissociated at equilibrium is
::&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{2y}{[HI]_0} = \frac{0.0044}{0.020}&lt;/math&gt; = 0.22, or 22% dissociation
|}


Shortcuts such as taking the square root in the preceding example are
not always possible, yet part of the skill of solving equilibrium problems lies
in recognizing shortcuts when they occur and using them. The key is often a
good intuition about what quantities are large and small relative to one
another, and this intuition comes from thoughtful practice and understanding
of the chemistry involved. You should remember that these are chemical
problems, not mathematical ones.

In many cases a quadratic equation must be solved.

|+'''Example 12'''
|-
|If 0.00500 mole of hydrogen gas and 0.0100 mole of iodine gas are placed in a 5.00 liter tank at 448°C, how much HI will be present at equilibrium?
|-
|'''Solution'''
The initial concentrations of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are
::[H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{0.00500 mole}{5.00 liters}&lt;/math&gt; = 0.00100 mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
::[I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{0.0100 mole}{5.00 liters}&lt;/math&gt; = 0.00200 mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
This time, let the unknown variable ''y'' be the moles per liter of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that have reacted at equilibrium:
::{|border=0
   |- valign=top
   | ||&amp;emsp;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;emsp; ||+&amp;nbsp;|| &amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;emsp; ||[[Image:U+21C4.svg]] || &amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;2HI
   |- align=center
   |Start (moles Liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;):|| 0.00100  || || 0.00200 || ||&amp;emsp;0.0

   |Equilibrium:||&amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp;0.00100 ''- y'' || || &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;0.00200 -''y''||  || &amp;emsp;&amp;nbsp;2''y''
   |}
The quilibrium expression is
::50.53 = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{(2y)^2}{(0.00100 - y)(0.00200 - y)}&lt;/math&gt;
The square-root shortcut is now impossible because the starting concentrations of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are unequal. Instead we must reduce the equation to a
quadratic expression:
::46.53''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - 0.1516''y'' + 1.011 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt; = 0
A general quadratic equation of the form ''ay&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''by'' + ''c'' = 0 can be solved by the quadratic formula,
::''y'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{-b \pm \!\, \sqrt{b^2 -4ac}}{2a}&lt;/math&gt; 
Thus for this problem
::''y'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{0.1516 \pm \!\, \sqrt{0.02298 - 0.01881}}{93.06}&lt;/math&gt;
::''y'' = 2.32 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; and 0.935 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
The first solution is physically impossible since it shows more H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reacting than was originally present. The second solution is the correct answer: ''y''=0.935 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore, the equilibrium concentrations are

   |[HI]|| = ||2(0.0935 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;) = 1.87 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

==Units and Equilibrium Constants==

As we have seen, the square brackets around a chemical symbol, as in [N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;], represent concentrations, usually but not exclusively in units of moles liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Concentrations expressed as moles liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; are often given the special symbol ''c'', as in ''c&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'', the concentrations measured in these units is denoted by ''K&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''.

An equilibrium constant as we have defined it thus far may itself have
units. In Example 1, K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; is unitless since the moles&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; 1iter&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; of the numerator
and denominator cancel. In Example 2, the units of K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; are moles&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; liter
since concentration occurs to the second power in the numerator and to the
third power in the denominator. In Example 3 the units of K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; are the inverse:
moles liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. The units demanded by Example 4, moles&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; liter&lt;sup&gt;-1/2&lt;/sup&gt;,
may seem strange but they are perfectly respectable.

{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;

|'''Solution'''
The K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; expression is treated as an ordinary algebraic equation, and solved for the HI concentration:

|-

|}
|}


The question of units for ''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;'' becomes important as soon as we realize
that we can measure concentration in units other than moles liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. The
partial pressure in atmospheres is a convenient unit when dealing with gas
mixtures, and the equilibrium constant then is identified by ''K&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''. Since the
numerical values of ''K&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''K&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' in general will be different, one must be sure
what the units are when using a numerical constant.


{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;

|One step in the commercial synthesis of sulfuric acid is the reaction of sulfur dioxide and oxygen to make sulfur trioxide:

At 1000 K, the equilibrium constant for this reaction is ''K&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 3.50 atm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. If the total pressure in the reaction chamber is 1.00 atm and the partial

|-
|'''Solution'''
::''k&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{p_{SO_3}^2}{p_{SO_2}^2 p_{O_2}}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;emsp;&amp;emsp; (p&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; = partial pressure of ''j'')
::Ratio = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{p_{SO_3}}{p_{SO_2}} = \textstyle\sqrt{K_p\times p_{O_2}} = \sqrt{3.50 \times 0.10} = 0.59&lt;/math&gt;
The equilibrium mixture has 0.59 mole of S0&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; for every 1 mole of S0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

The ideal gas law permits us to convert between atmospheres and moles
liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, and between ''K&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''K&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'':
       ''PV'' = ''nRT''                                    (3-8)
       &lt;math&gt;P = \textstyle\frac{n}{V}RT = cRT&lt;/math&gt;                         (4-12)
In the general chemical reaction written earlier,
       ''a''A + ''b''B [[Image:U+21C4.svg]] ''c''C + ''d''D                         (4-7)

       Δ''n'' (read &quot;delta ''n''&quot;), the ''increase'' in number of moles of gas during the reaction, is
       &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;''n'' = ''c'' + ''d'' - ''a'' - ''b''                          (4-13)
The equilibrium-constant expression in terms of partial pressures is
       &lt;math&gt;K_p = \textstyle\frac{p_C^c p_D^d}{p_A^a p_B^b}&lt;/math&gt;                                (4-14)
With the ideal gas law applied to each gas component, we can convert this expression to ''K&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'':
       &lt;math&gt;K_p = \textstyle\frac{(cRT)^c (cRT)^d}{(cRT)^a (cRT)^b} = \textstyle\frac{c^c c^d}{c^a c^b}&lt;/math&gt;(RT)&lt;sup&gt;Δn&lt;/sup&gt; = K&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;(RT)&lt;sup&gt;Δn&lt;/sup&gt;                           (4-15)

(Do not confuse the two uses of the symbol ''c'' in equation 4-15: one is for
concentration in moles liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and the other for the number of moles of
substance C.)

|'''Solution'''
Three moles of reactant gases are converted into only 2 moles of product, so Δn = - 1. Hence at 1000 K,

This is the same ration of SO_3 to SO_4 as was obtained when atmospheres were used. The choice is one of convenience.

==Equilibrium Involving Gases with Liquids or Solids==

[[Image:Chemical Principles Fig 4.2.png|frame|'''Figure 4-2''' Solid CaC0&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and CaO are placed in a cylinder with a movable piston, which is initially pressed against the solids to ensure that no extraneous gases are present . At equilibrium, enough CaC0&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; will have decomposed so that the pressure of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas above the
solid phases is a fixed value that varies with temperature but is 'Independent of how much of each of the solids is present.]]

All the examples considered so far have involved only one physical state, a gas, and are examples of '''homogeneous equilibria'''. Equilibria that involve two or more physical states (such as a gas with a liquid or a solid) are called '''hetergenous equilibria'''. If one or more of the reactants or products are solids or liquids, how does this affect the form of the equilibrium constant?

The answer, in short, is that any pure solids or liquids that may be present at equilibrium have the same effect on the equilibrium no matter how much solid or liquid is present. The concentration of a pure solid or liquid can be considered constant, and for convenience all such constant terms are brought to the left side of the equation and incorporated into the equilibrium constant itself. As an example, limestone (calcium carbonate, CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), breaks down into quicklime (calcium oxide, CaO) and carbon dioxide, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:
::CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; [[Image:U+21C4.svg]] CaO(''s'') + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'')
The simple equilibrium-constant expression is
::''K'&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{[CaO(s)][CO_2(g)]}{[CaCO_3(s)]}&lt;/math&gt;
As long as any solid limestone and quicklime are in contact with the gas, their effect on the equilibrium is unchanging. Hence the terms [CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;] and [CaO] remain constant and can be merged with ''K'&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;:
::''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''K'&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{[CaCO_3(s)}{CaO(s)} = &lt;/math&gt;[CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g)]
This form of the equilibrium-constant expression tells us that, ''at a given temperature,'' the concentration of carbon-dioxide gas above limestone and calcium oxide is a fixed quantity. (this is true only as long as both solid forms are present.) Measuring concentration in units of atmospheres, we get
::''K&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' = p&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;
with the experimental value 0.236 atm at 800°C.

We can see what this means experimentally by considering a cylinder
to which CaCO, and CaO have been added. The cylinder has a movable
piston, as shown in Figure 4-2. If the piston is fixed at one position, then
CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; will decompose until the pressure of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; above the solids is 0.236
atm (if the temperature is 800°C). If you try to decrease the pressure by
raising the piston, then more CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; will decompose until the pressure
again rises to 0.236 atm. Conversely, if you try to increase the pressure by
lowering the piston, some of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas will react with CaO and become
CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; decreasing the amount of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas present until the pressure once
more is 0.236 atm. The only way to increase ''p&lt;sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, is to raise the temperature,
which increases the value of ''K&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; itself to 1 atm at 894°C and to 1.04 atm
at 900°C.

An even simpler example is the vaporization of a liquid such as water:
::H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(''l'') [[Image:U+21C4.svg]] H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(''g'')

This process can be treated as a chemical reaction in a formal sense even though bonds within molecules are not made or broken. Imagine that the cylinder shown in Figure 4-2 is half-filled with water rather than with CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and CaO, and that the piston is initially brought down to the surface of the water. As the piston is raised, liquid will evaporate until the pressure of water vapor is a constant value that depends only on the temperature. This is the '''equilibrium vapor pressure''' of water at that temperature. At 25°C, the vapor pressure of water is 0.0313 atm. At 100°C, the vapor pressure reaches 1 atm and, as we shall see in Chapter 18, this is just the definition of the normal boiling point of water. The pressure of water vapor above the liquid in the cylinder does not depend on whether the water in the cylinder is 1 cm or 10 cm deep; the only requirement is that some water be present and capable of evaporating to make up any decrease in vapor pressure. Only when the piston is raised to the point where no more liquid exists can the pressure of water vapor fall below 0.0313 atm, if the cylinder is at 25°C. Similarly, if the piston is lowered, some of the vapor condenses, keeping the pressure at 0.0313 atm. Only when all vapor has condensed and the piston is resting on the surface of the liquid can the pressure inside the cylinder be raised above 0.0313 atm.

The formal equilibrium treatment of the evaporation of water would be
::''K'&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{[H_2O(g)]}{[H_2O(l)]}&lt;/math&gt;
:[H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l)] = constant , as long as liquid is present
::''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; = ''K'&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;''[H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(''l'')] = [H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(g)]
In pressure units, the expression would be
::''K&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; = ''p''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(''g'')&lt;/sub&gt;
From a practical standpoint, what the preceding discussion means is that the concentration terms for pure solids and liquids are simply eliminated from the equilibrium-constant expression. (They are present, implicitly, in the ''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;''.)

The preceding example shows that as long as liquid water is present the
gas-phase concentration is fixed at the vapor pressure of water at that temperature.
Hence the water contribution, being constant, can be lumped
into ''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;''.

==Factors Affecting Equilibrium: Le Chatelier's Principle==

Equilibrium represents a balance between two opposing reactions. How
sensitive is this balance to changes in the conditions of a reaction? What
can be done to change the equilibrium state? These are very practical
questions if, for example, one is trying to increase the yield of a useful
product in a reaction.

Under specified conditions, the equilibrium-constant expression tells us
the ratio of product to reactants when the forward and backward reactions
are in balance. This equilibrium constant is not affected by changes in
concentration of reactants or products. However, if products can be withdrawn
continuously, then the reacting system can be kept constantly
off-balance, or short of equilibrium. More reactants will be used and a continuous
stream of new products will be formed. This method is useful when
one product of the reaction can escape as a gas, be condensed or frozen
out of a gas phase as a liquid or solid, be washed out of the gas mixture
by a spray of a liquid in which it is especially soluble, or be precipitated from
a gas or solution. 

For example, when solid lime (CaO) and coke (C) are heated in an
electric furnace to make calcium carbide (CaC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;),

::CaO(''s'') + 3C(''s'') [[Image:U+21C4.svg]] CaC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'') + CO(''g'')&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;↑&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

the reaction, which at 2000-3000°C has an equilibrium constant of close to
1.00, is tipped toward calcium carbide formation by the continuous removal
of carbon monoxide gas. In the industrial manufacture of titanium dioxide
for pigments, TiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; react as gases:

::TiCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (''g'') + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (''g'') [[Image:U+21C4.svg]] TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (''s'')&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;↓&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;  + 2Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'')

The product separates from the reacting gases as a fine powder of solid
Ti0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; , and the reaction is thus kept moving in the forward direction. When
ethyl acetate or other esters used as solvents and flavorings are synthesized
from carboxylic acids and alcohols,
::&lt;big&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;COOH + HOCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; [[Image:U+21C4.svg]] CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOCH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;/big&gt;
::acetic acid &amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;ethanol&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;  ethyl acetate

the reaction is kept constantly off-balance by removing the water as fast as
it is formed. This can be done by using a drying agent such as Drierite
(CaS0&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), by running the reaction in benzene and boiling off a constant-boiling
benzene-water mixture, or by running the reaction in a solvent in
which the water is completely immiscible and separates as droplets in a
second phase. A final example: Since ammonia is far more soluble in water
than either hydrogen or nitrogen is, the yield of ammonia in the reaction
::N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'') + 3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'') [[Image:U+21C4.svg]]  2NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'')
can be raised to well over 90% by washing the ammonia out of the equilibrium
mixture of gases with a stream of water, and recycling the nitrogen and
hydrogen.

===Temperature===

[[Image:Chemical Principles Fig 4.3.png|frame|'''Figure 4-3''' Le Chatelier's principle and temperature. The dissociation of ammonia.     2NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''g')&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; 3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'') + N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'')

''Chemistry. Matter. and the Universe''.]]

All the preceding methods will upset an equilibrium (in our examples, in
favor of desired products) without altering the equilibrium constant. A
chemist can often enhance yields of desired products by increasing the
equilibrium constant so that the ratio of products to reactants at equilibrium
is larger. The equilibrium constant is usually temperature dependent.
In general, both forward and reverse reactions are speeded up by increasing
the temperature, because the molecules move faster and collide more often.
If the increase in the rate of the forward reaction is greater than that of the
reverse, then ''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;''. increases with temperature and more products are formed
at equilibrium. If the reverse reaction is favored, then ''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;''. decreases. Thus
''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;'' for the hydrogen- iodine reaction at 448°C is 50.53, but at 425°C it is
54.4, and at 357°C it increases to 66.9. Production of HI is favored to some
extent by an increase in temperature, but its dissociation to hydrogen and
iodine is favored much more.

The hydrogen iodide-producing reaction is exothermic or heat emitting:
::H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'') + I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'') [[Image:U+21C4.svg]] 2HI(''g'')
::Δ''H''&lt;sub&gt;298&lt;/sub&gt; = -10.2 k&lt;big&gt;J&lt;/big&gt; per 2 moles of HI

(If you check this figure against Appendix 3, remember that this reaction
involves gaseous iodine, not solid.) If the external temperature of this reaction
is lowered, the equilibrium is shifted in favor of the heat-emitting or
forward reaction; conversely, if the temperature is increased, the reverse
reaction, producing H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is favored. The equilibrium shifts so as to
counteract to some extent the effect of adding heat externally (raising the
temperature) or removing it (lowering the temperature).

The temperature dependence of the equilibrium point is one example
of a more general principle, known as ''Le Chatelier's principle: If an external stress is applied to a system at chemical equilibrium, then the equilibrium point will change in such a way as to counteract the effects of that stress''. If the forward half of an equilibrium reaction is exothermic, then ''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;'' will decrease as the temperature increases; if it is endothermic, ''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; will increase. Only for a heat-absorbing
reaction can the equilibrium yield of products be improved by
increasing the temperature. A good way to remember this is to write the
reaction explicitly with a heat term:
::H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'') + I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'') [[Image:U+21C4.svg]] 2HI(''g'') + heat(given off)
Then it is clear that adding heat, just like adding HI, shifts the reaction to the left. (see Figure 4-3.)

===Pressure===

Le Chatelier's principle is true for other kinds of stress, such as pressure
changes. The equilibrium constant, ''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;'', is not altered by a pressure change
at constant temperature. However, the relative amounts of reactants and
products will change in a way that can be predicted from Le Chatelier's
principle.

The hydrogen- iodine reaction involves an equal number (2) of moles
of reactants and product. Therefore, if we double the pressure at constant
temperature, the volume of the mixture of gases will be halved. All concentrations
in moles liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; will be doubled, but their ''ratio'' will be the same.
In Example 12, doubling the concentrations of the reactants and product
does not change the equilibrium constant:
::''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{(1.87 \times 10^{-3} mole liter^{-1})^2}{(0.065 \times 10^{-3}mole liter^{-1})(1.065 \times 10^{-3} mole liter^{-1})}&lt;/math&gt;
::&amp;emsp; = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{(3.74 \times 10^{-3})^2}{(0.13\times 10^{-3})(2.13 \times 10^{-3})} = &lt;/math&gt; 50.51

Thus the hydrogen- iodine equilibrium is not sensitive to pressure changes.
Notice that in this case ''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;'' does not have units, since the concentration units
in the numerator and denominator cancel.

In contrast, the dissociation of ammonia is affected by changes in
pressure because the number of moles (2) of reactant does not equal the total
number of moles (4) of products:
::2NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'') [[Image:U+21C4.svg]] N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'') + 3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'')

The equilibrium constant for this reaction at 25°C is
::''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{[N_2][H_2]^3}{[NH_3]^2} =&lt;/math&gt; 2.5 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-9&lt;/sup&gt; mole&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; liter &lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;

One set of equilibrium conditions is
::N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 3.28 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
::H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.05 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
::NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.106 mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

(Can you verify that these concentrations satisfy the equilibrium condition?) If we now double the pressure at constant temperature, thereby halving the volume and doubling each concentration,
::N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 6.56 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
::H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.10 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
::NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.212 mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

the ratio of products to reactants, the reaction quotient, is no longer equal
to ''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;'':
::''Q'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{(6.56 \times 10^{-3})(4.10 \times 10^{-3})^3}{(0.212)^2} =&lt;/math&gt; 1.0 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-8&lt;/sup&gt; mole&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; liter&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;

[[Image:Chemical Principles Fig 4.4.png|frame|'''Figure 4-4'''Le Chatelier's principle and pressure. (a) At initial equilibrium 17 molecules (moles) of
gas are present: 12 of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; , 4 of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and 1 of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. (b) When the gas is compressed Into
a smaller volume a stress is created, which is evidenced by a higher pressure. (c) This
stress can be relieved and the pressure reduced if some of the molecules of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
combine to form more NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, since the total number of gas molecules is thereby reduced.
From Dickerson and Geis, ''Chemistry, Matter, and the Universe''.]]

Since ''Q'' is greater than ''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;'', too many product molecules are present for
equilibrium. The reverse reaction will run spontaneously, thereby forming
more NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and decreasing the amounts of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Consequently, part
of the increased pressure is offset when the reaction shifts in the direction
that lowers the total number of moles of gas present. In general, a reaction
that reduces the number of moles of gas will be favored by an increase in
pressure, and one that produces more gas will be disfavored. (See Figure
4-4.)

===Catalysis===


What effect does a catalyst have on a reaction ''at equilibrium''? None. A catalyst
cannot change the value of ''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;, but it can increase the speed with which
equilibrium is reached. This is the main function of a catalyst. It can take
the reaction ''only'' to the same equilibrium state that would be reached
eventually without the catalyst.

Catalysts are useful, nevertheless. Many desirable reactions, although
spontaneous, occur at extremely slow rates under ordinary conditions. In
automobile engines, the main smog-producing reaction involving oxides of
nitrogen is
::N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[Image:U+21C4.svg]] 2NO

(Once NO is present, it reacts readily with more oxygen to make brown
N0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.) At the high temperature of an automobile engine, ''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;'' for this reaction
is so large that appreciable amounts of NO are formed. However, at
25°C, ''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;''= 10&lt;sup&gt;-30&lt;/sup&gt;. (Using only the previous two bits of information and
Le Chatelier's principle, predict whether the reaction as written is endothermic
or exothermic. Check your answer using data from Appendix 3.)
The amount of NO present in the atmosphere at equilibrium at 25°C should
be negligible. NO should decompose spontaneously to N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as the
exhaust gases cool. But any Southern Californian can verify that this is
not what happens. Both NO and N0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are indeed present, because the gases
of the atmosphere are not at equilibrium.

The rate of decomposition of NO is extremely slow, although the reaction is spontaneous. One approach to the smog problem has been to search for a catalyst for the reaction
::2NO [[Image:U+21C4.svg]] N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; 

that could be housed in an exhaust system and could break down NO in
the exhaust gases as they cool. Finding a catalyst is possible; a practical
problem arises from the gradual poisoning of the catalyst by gasoline additives,
such as lead compounds. This is the reason why new cars with
catalytic converters only use lead-free gasoline.

A proof of the assertion that a catalyst cannot change the equilibrium
constant is illustrated in Figure 4-5. If a catalyst ''could'' shift the equilibrium
point of a reacting gas mixture and produce a volume change, then this
expansion and contraction could be harnessed by mechanical means and
made to do work. We would have a true perpetual-motion machine that
would deliver power without an energy source. From common sense and
experience we know this to be impossible. This &quot;common sense&quot; is stated
scientifically as the first law of thermodynamics, which will be discussed in
Chapter 15. A mathematician would call this a ''proof by contradiction'': If
we assume that a catalyst can alter ''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;'', then we must assume the existence
of a perpetual-motion machine. However, a perpetual-motion machine cannot
exist; therefore our initial assumption was wrong, and we must conclude
that a catalyst cannot alter ''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;''.

In summary, ''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a function of temperature, but it is not a function of
reactant or product concentrations, total pressure, or the presence or absence
of catalysts. The relative amounts of substances at equilibrium can be
changed by applying an external stress to the equilibrium mixture of
reactants and products, and the change is one that will relieve this stress.
This last statement, Le Chatelier's principle, enables us to predict what will
happen to a reaction when external factors are changed, without having
to make exact calculations.


==Summary==

A '''spontaneous reaction''' is one that will take place, given enough time,
without outside assistance. Some spontaneous reactions are rapid, but time
is not an element in the definition of spontaneity. A reaction can be almost
infinitely slow and still be spontaneous.

The net reaction that we observe is the result of competition between
forward and reverse steps. If the forward process is faster, then products
accumulate, and we say that the reaction is spontaneous in the forward
direction. If the reverse process is faster, then reactants accumulate, and we
say that the reverse reaction is the spontaneous one. If both forward and
reverse processes take place at the same rate, then no net change is observed
in any of the reaction components. This is the condition of '''chemical
equilibrium'''.

The ratio of products to reactants, each concentration term being
raised to a power corresponding to the coefficient of that substance in the
balanced chemical equation, is called the equilibrium constant, ''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;''. (See
equation 4-8.) It can be used to predict whether a given reaction under
specified conditions will be spontaneous, and to calculate the concentrations
of reactants and products at equilibrium. The '''reaction quotient''', '''''Q''''', has
a form that is identical with that of the equilibrium constant, ''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;'', but ''Q''
applies under nonequilibrium conditions as well. For a given set of conditions,
if ''Q'' is smaller than ''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;'', the forward reaction is spontaneous; if
''Q'' is greater than ''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;'', the reverse reaction is spontaneous; and if ''Q'' = ''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;'',
the system is at equilibrium.

The equilibrium constant can be used with any convenient set of concentration
units: moles liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; , pressure in atmospheres, or others. Its
numerical value will depend on the units of concentration, so one must be
careful to match the proper values of ''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;'' and units when solving problems.
If gas concentrations are expressed in moles liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, the equilibrium constant
is designated by ''K&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''; if in atmospheres, by ''K&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;''. Just as partial pressure of the
''j''th component of a gas mixture is related to moles per liter by ''p&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''c&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;RT'',
so ''K&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''K&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' are related by ''K&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''K&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''(''RT'')&lt;sup&gt;Δn&lt;/sup&gt;, in which Δn is the net change in
number of moles of gas during the reaction.

When some of the reactants or products are pure solids or liquids, they
act as infinite reservoirs of material as long as some solid or liquid is left.
Their effect on equilibrium depends only on their presence, not on how
much of the solid or liquid is present. Their effective concentrations are
constant, and can be incorporated into ''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;''. In practice, this simply means
omitting concentration terms for pure solids and liquids from the
equilibrium-constant expression. Evaporation of a liquid can be treated
formally as a chemical reaction with the liquid as reactant and vapor as
product. These conventions for writing concentration terms for a liquid
permit us to write the equilibrium constant for evaporation as ''K&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''p&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;''
where ''p&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the equilibrium vapor pressure of substance ''j''.

'''Le Chatelier's principle''' states that if stress is applied to a system at
equilibrium the amounts of reactants and products will shift in such a
manner as to minimize the stress. This means that for a heat-absorbing, or
endothermic, reaction, ''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;'' increases as the temperature is increased, since
carrying out more of the reaction is a way of absorbing some of the added
heat. Similarly, cooling increases ''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;'' for a heat-emitting or exothermic
reaction. Although the equilibrium constant ''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;'' is independent of pressure,
and changing the total pressure on a reacting system does not alter ''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;''
directly, an increase in pressure does cause the reaction to shift in the
direction that decreases the total number of moles of gas present.

A catalyst has no effect at all on ''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;'' or the conditions of equilibrium.
All that a catalyst can do is to make the system reach equilibrium faster
than it would have done otherwise. Catalysts can make inherently spontaneous
but slow reactions into rapid reactions, but they cannot make nonspontaneous
reactions take place of their own accord.

==Introduction==
In the trial scene in ''Alice in Wonderland'', the White Rabbit, asked to read a document adduced as evidence, asks, &quot;Where shall I begin, please your Majesty?&quot; The answer is straightforward: &quot;Begin at the beginning, and go on till you come to the end: then stop.&quot; But we shall begin in the middle, with a description of what atoms and molecules are like, ''before'' saying anything about how we know that atoms exist. When we examine the evidence for atomic and molecular structure in later chapters, you will have at least an idea of the goal of the
effort. The result, we hope, will be to make this textbook more comprehensible than most of Lewis Carroll's books. (The White Rabbit's evidence did not fare very well: &quot;If any one of them can explain it,&quot; said Alice, &quot;I'll give him sixpence. ''I'' don't believe there's an atom of meaning in it.&quot;

==The Structure of Atoms==
An '''atom''' (ours, not Carroll's) consists of a positively charged '''nucleus''', surrounded by one or more negatively charged particles called '''electrons'''. The positive charges equal the negative charges, so the atom has no overall charge; it is electrically neutral. Most of an atom's mass is in its nucleus; the mass of an electron is only 1/1836 the mass of the lightest nucleus, that of hydrogen. Although the nucleus is heavy, it is quite small compared with the overall size of an atom. The radius of a typical atom is around 0.1 to 0.25 nanometres (nm), whereas the radius of a nucleus is about 10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt; nm. '''*''' If an atom were enlarged to the size of the earth, its nucleus would be only 200 feet in diameter and could easily rest inside a small football stadium.

The nucleus of an atom contains '''protons''' and '''neutrons'''. Protons and neutrons have nearly equal masses, but they differ in charge. A neutron has no charge, whereas a proton has a positive charge that exactly balances the negative charge on an electron. Table 1-1 lists the charges of these three fundamental particles, and gives their masses expressed in '''atomic mass units'''. The atomic mass unit (amu) is defined as exactly one-twelfth the mass of the nucleus of a carbon atom consisting of six protons and six neutrons. With this scale, protons and neutrons have masses that are close to, but not precisely, 1 amu each. [As a matter of information at this point, there are approximately 6.022 X 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; amu in 1 gram (g). This number is known as '''Avogadro's number''', '''N''', and later in the chapter we will show one of the ways this number can be calculated.] 

The number of protons in the nucleus of an atom is known as the '''atomic number''', '''Z'''. It is the same as the number of electrons around the nucleus, because an atom is electrically neutral. The '''mass number''' of an atom is equal to the total number of heavy particles: protons and neutrons. When two atoms are close enough to combine chemically-to form ''chemical bonds with one another''-each atom &quot;sees&quot; mainly the outermost electrons of the other atom. Hence these outer electrons are the most important factors in the chemical behavior of atoms. Neutrons in the nucleus have little effect on chemical behavior, and the protons are significant only because they determine how many electrons surround the nucleus in a neutral atom. All atoms with the same atomic number behave in much the same way chemically and are classified as the same chemical element. Each element has its own name and a one- or two-letter symbol (usually derived from the element's English or Latin name). For example, the symbol for carbon is C, and the symbol for calcium is Ca. The symbol for sodium is Na-the first two letters of its Latin (and German) name, ''natrium''- to distinguish it from nitrogen, N, and sulfur, S.

'''''*'''One nanometre equals 10&lt;sup&gt;-9&lt;/sup&gt; meters (m), or 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; centimeters (cm). If you are not familiar with metric units, see Appendix 1 for more information on the ''Système International'' (SI), a simplified version of the metric system adopted by scientists throughout the world. We shall generally use SI units in this book. If you are not familiar with the use of exponential numbers (scientific notation), read Appendix 4.''

==Isotopes==
Although all atoms of an element have the same number of protons, the atoms may differ in the number of neutrons they have (Table 1-2). These differing atoms of the same element are called '''isotopes'''. Four isotopes of helium (He) are shown in Figure 1-1. All atoms of chlorine (Cl) have 17 protons, but there are chlorine isotopes having 15 to 23 neutrons. Only two chlorine isotopes exist in significant amounts in nature, those with 18 neutrons (75.53% of all chlorine atoms found in nature), and those with 20 neutrons (24.47%). To write the symbol for an isotope, place the atomic number as a subscript and the mass number (protons plus neutrons) as a superscript to the left of the atomic symbol. The symbols for the two naturally occurring isotopes of chlorine then would be &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac{35}{17}}&lt;/math&gt;Cl and &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac{37}{17}}&lt;/math&gt;Cl. Strictly speaking, the subscript is unnecessary, since all atoms of chlorine have 17 protons. Hence the isotope symbols are usually written without the subscript: &lt;sup&gt;35&lt;/sup&gt;Cl and &lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;Cl. In discussing these isotopes, we use the. terms chlorine-35 and chlorine-37. For a nucleus to be stable, the number of neutrons should (for the first few elements) equal or slightly exceed the number of protons. The more protons, the greater the ratio of neutrons to protons to ensure stability. Nuclei that have too many of either kind of fundamental particle are unstable, and break down radioactively in ways that are discussed in Chapter 23.
{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;

|-

[[Image:Chemical Principles Fig 1.1.png|frame|'''Figure 1-1'''  Four isotopes of helium (He). All atoms of helium have two protons (hence two electrons), but the number of neutrons can vary. Most helium atoms in nature have two neutrons (helium-4), and fewer than one helium atom per million in nature has just one neutron (helium-3). The other helium isotopes, helium-5, helium-6, and helium-8 (not shown) are unstable and are seen only briefly in nuclear reactions (see Chapter 23). The size of the nucleus is grossly exaggerated here. If the nucleus were of the size shown, the atom would be half a kilometer across.]]
|-
|-
|'''Solution'''
The atomic number of uranium (see the inside back cover) is 92, and the mass number of the isotope is given as 238. Hence it has 92 protons, 92 electrons,and 238 - 92 = 146 neutrons. Its symbol is &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac{238}{92}}&lt;/math&gt;U (or &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U).
|}



The total mass of an atom is called its atomic weight, and this is almost but not exactly the sum of the masses of its constituent protons, neutrons and electrons. * When protons, neutrons, and electrons combine to form an atom, some of their mass is converted to energy and is given off. (This is the source of energy in nuclear fusion reactions.) Because the atom cannot be broken down into its fundamental particles unless the energy for the missing mass is supplied from outside it, this energy is called the '''binding energy''' of the nucleus.

'''*''' ''The terms atomic weight and molecular weight are universally used by working scientists, and will be used in this book, even though these are technically masses rather than weights.''

|-
|Calculate the mass that is lost when an atom of carbon-12 is formed from protons, electrons, and neutrons.
|-
|'''Solution'''
|- 
| Since the atomic number of every carbon atom is 6, carbon-12 has 6 protons and therefore 6 electrons. To find the number of neutrons, we subtract the number of protons from the mass number: 12 - 6 = 6 neutrons. We can use the data in Table 1-1 to calculate the total mass of these particles:
:::{| style=&quot;background:transparent;&quot;
 |- style=&quot;background:transparent;&quot;
 | Protons:||6 X 1.00728 amu = 6.04368 amu
 |- style=&quot;background:transparent;&quot;
 | Neutrons:||6 X 1.00867 amu = 6.05202 amu
 |- style=&quot;background:transparent;&quot;
 | Electrons:||6 X 0.00055 amu = &lt;u&gt;0.00330 amu&lt;/u&gt;
 |- style=&quot;background:transparent;&quot;
 | ||Total particle mass: 12.09900 amu
 |}
|- 
| But by the definition of the scale of atomic mass units, the mass of one carbon-12 atom is exactly 12 amu. Hence 0.0990 amu of mass has disappeared in the process of building the atom from its particles.

:::{| style=&quot;background:transparent;&quot;
 |- style=&quot;background:transparent;&quot;
 | Protons:||17 X 1.00728 amu =||17.1238 amu
 |- style=&quot;background:transparent;&quot;

 |- style=&quot;background:transparent;&quot;
 | ||Mass Loss:||0.341 amu
 |}
 |}

Each isotope of an element is characterized by an atomic number
(total number of protons), a mass number (total number of protons and
neutrons), and an atomic weight (mass of atom in atomic mass units).
Since mass losses upon formation of an atom are small, the mass number is
usually the same as the atomic weight rounded to the nearest integer.
(For example, the atomic weight of chlorine-37 is 36.966, which is rounded
to 37.) If there are several isotopes of an element in nature, then of course the
experimentally observed atomic weight (the natural atomic weight) will be
the weighted average of the isotope weights. The average is weighted according
to the percent abundance of the isotopes. Chlorine occurs in nature as
75.53% chlorine-35 (34.97 amu) and 24.47% chlorine-37 (36.97 amu), so the
weighted average of the isotope weights is
::&lt;big&gt;(0.7553 X 34.97 amu) + (0.2447 X 36.97 amu) = 35.46 amu&lt;/big&gt;

The atomic weights given inside the back cover of this book are all weighted
averages of the isotopes occurring in nature, and these are the figures we shall use henceforth-unless we are specifically discussing one isotope. All
isotopes of an element behave the same way chemically for the most part.
Their behavior will differ in regard to mass-sensitive properties such as
diffusion rates, which we'll look at later in this book.


{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;
|+'''Example 5'''
|-
|Magnesium (Mg) has three significant natural isotopes: 78.70% of all magnesium atoms have an atomic weight of 23.985 amu, 10.13% have an atomic weight of 24.986 amu, and 11.17% have an atomic weight of 25.983 amu. How many protons and neutrons are present in each of these three isotopes? How do we write the symbols for each isotope? Finally, what is the weighted average of the atomic weights?
|-
|'''Solution'''
There are 12 protons in all magnesium isotopes. The isotope whose atomic weight is 23.985 amu has a mass number of 24 (protons and neutrons), so 24 - 12 protons gives 12 neutrons. The symbol for this isotope is 24Mg. Similarly, the isotope whose atomic weight is 24.986 amu has a mass number of 25, 13 neutrons, and 25Mg as a symbol. The third isotope (25.983 amu) has a mass number of 26, 14 neutrons, and 26Mg as a symbol. We calculate the average atomic weight as follows:
::&lt;big&gt;(0.7870 X 23.985) + (0.1013 X 24.986) + (0.1117 X 25.983) = 24.31 amu&lt;/big&gt;

From the natural atomic weight given on the inside back cover, calculate the atomic weight of the &lt;sup&gt;lO&lt;/sup&gt;B isotope.
|-
|'''Solution'''
If 80.22% of all boron atoms are &lt;sup&gt;11&lt;/sup&gt;B, then 100.00 - 80.22, or 19.78%, are the
unknown isotope. We can use ''W'' to represent the unknown atomic weight in
our calculation:
::&lt;big&gt;(0.8022 X 11.009) + (0.1978 X W) = 10.81 amu (natural atomic weight)&lt;/big&gt;
::&lt;big&gt;''W'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac{10.81-8.831}{0.1978}}&lt;/math&gt; = 10.01 amu&lt;/big&gt;

==Molecules==
The formation of atoms from fundamental particles, interesting as this
might be to the physicist, is far from being the ultimate stage in the organization
of matter. As we mentioned earlier, when atoms are close enough to
one another that the outer electrons of one atom can interact with the
other atoms, then attractions can be set up between atoms, strong enough
to hold them together in what is termed a '''chemical bond'''. In the simplest
cases the bond arises from the sharing of two electrons between a pair of
atoms, with one electron provided by each of the bonded atoms. Bonds based
on electron sharing are known as '''covalent bonds''', and two or more atoms
held together as a unit by covalent bonds are known as a '''molecule'''. One of
the principal triumphs of the theory of quantum mechanics in chemistry
(see Chapter 8) has been its ability to predict the kinds of atoms that will
bond together, and the three-dimensional structures and reactivities of the
molecules that result. (A major section of this book, Chapters 8-14, is
devoted to chemical bonding theories.)

[[Image:Chemical Principles Fig 1.2.png|frame|'''Figure 1-2'''  Shapes and relative sizes of some simple molecules. Two bonded atoms appear to interpenetrate because their electron clouds overlap. By convention. a tapered bond in a drawing represents a bond pointing out toward the observer, with the wide end of the taper closest. and a dashed line is used for a bond that points back behind the plane of the page.]]

In '''molecular diagrams''', a covalent, electron-sharing bond is represented
by a straight line connecting the bonded atoms. In the water molecule,
one atom of oxygen (0) is bonded to two hydrogen (H) atoms. The diagram
for the molecule can be drawn two ways:
::[[Image:Chemical Principles, H20 Molecules.png]]

The second version acknowledges the fact that a water molecule is not
linear; the two H -0 bonds make an angle of 105° with one another.
Molecules of hydrogen gas, hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, methane, and
methyl alcohol (methanol) have the following bond structures:
::[[Image:Molecules 2.png]]


These diagrams show only the connections between atoms in the molecules.
They do not show the three-dimensional geometries (or shapes) of the
molecules. Figure 1-2 shows the shapes and the relative bulk of several
molecules. Note that the bond angle in molecules having more than two
atoms can vary. The angle in the water molecule is 105°, and the angle in
hydrogen sulfide is 92°; the four atoms connected to the central carbon in
methane and methyl alcohol are directed to the four corners of a tetrahedron.
The bond structure in straight-chain octane, one of the components of
gasoline, is
::[[Image:Chemical Principles, Molecules 4.png]]

Each of the molecular diagrams shown can be condensed to a molecular
formula, which tells how many atoms of each element are in the molecule,
but provides little or no information as to how the atoms are connected.
The molecular formula for hydrogen is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; water, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0; hydrogen sulfide,
H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S; ammonia, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;; methane, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; ; methyl alcohol, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;0H or CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O;
and octane, C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;. The formula for octane can also be written
::[[Image:Chemical Principles, Molecules 5.png]]

The sum of the atomic weights of all the atoms in a molecule is its
'''molecular weight'''. Using the atomic weights on the inside back cover, we can calculate molecular weights. The molecular weight of hydrogen, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, is
::2 X 1.0080 amu = 2.0160 amu
A water molecule, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O , has two atoms of hydrogen and one atom of
oxygen, so:
::(2 X 1.0080 amu) + (15.9994 amu) = 18.0154 amu

The molecular formula is CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;0H or CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O. Then:
::{| style=&quot;background:transparent;&quot;
 |- style=&quot;background:transparent;&quot;
 | 1 carbon:||1 X 12.011 amu =||12.011 amu
 |- style=&quot;background:transparent;&quot;
 | 4 hydrogens:||4 X  1.008 amu =||4.032 amu
 |- style=&quot;background:transparent;&quot;

 |- style=&quot;background:transparent;&quot;
 | Total particle mass:|| ||32.04 amu
 |}
(If you wonder why the last figure has been dropped, see the discussion of
significant figures in Appendix 4.)
|}


In Example 7 notice that the natural atomic weight of carbon is not
12.000 amu but 12.011 amu, since carbon occurs as a mixture of 98.89%
carbon-12 and 1.11% carbon-1 3, with trace amounts of carbon-14.

:&lt;big&gt;(8 X 12.011) + (18 X 1.008) = 114.23 amu&lt;/big&gt;

==Forces Between Molecules==
[[Image:Chemical Principles, Fig 1.3.png|frame|'''Figure 1-3''' The three states of matter: (a) In a gas the individual molecules move freely through
space, colliding and rebounding. A gas adapts to the shape of its container and can
easily be expanded or compressed. (b) Molecules in a liquid are in contact, but free to
slide past one another. A liquid also adapts to the shape of its container, but it has a
relatively fixed volume. (c) In a crystalline solid. molecules are packed in to a regular array,
giving the solid both a fixed volume and a definite shape. Work must be done to break
or deform a crystal. Adapted from R. E. Dickerson and 1. Geis. ''Chemistry, Matter, and the
Universe'', W. A. Benjamin. Menlo Park, Calif.. 1976.]]

Although the strongest attractions of an atom are for other atoms to which
it is bonded in a molecule, two molecules themselves exert small but appreciable
attractions on one another. Molecules are slightly &quot;sticky.&quot; These
forces, caused by momentary fluctuations in electron distributions around
the atoms, are known as '''van der Waals attractions''' (after Dutch physicist
Johannes van der Waals). They are responsible for the existence of three
states (or phases) of matter at different temperatures: solids, liquids, and
gases. '''Temperature''' is just a measure of the heat energy or energy of motion
that a collection of molecules possesses. At low temperatures, the molecules
have little energy of motion. The van der Waals attractions hold them
together in an orderly, close-packed crystalline array or lattice (Figure
1-3c). This is the '''solid''' state. If more energy is fed into the crystal so the
temperature rises, the molecules will vibrate about their average or equilibrium
positions in the crystal. Enough energy will cause the ordered structure
of the molecular crystal to break up, and the molecules will be free to
slide past one another, although they are still touching (Figure 1-3b). This
is the '''liquid''' state, and the transition temperature between solid and liquid is
called the '''melting point''', '''T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'''. The liquid is still held together by van der
Waals attractions, although the molecules have too much energy of motion
to be locked into a rigid array. If still more energy is given to the liquid, the
molecules will begin to move fast enough to overcome the van der Waals
attractions, separate entirely from one another, and travel in independent
molecular trajectories through space (Figure 1-3a). This is the '''gas''' phase, and
the transition temperature between liquid and gas is called the '''boiling point''', '''T&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'''. Changes in phase are treated in more detail in Chapter 18.


The melting and boiling points of some simple molecules are compared
in Table 1-3. In general, larger molecules have higher melting and boiling
points, since they have larger surface areas for van der Waals attractions.
Thus at 1 atm. pressure H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; boils at - 252.5°C, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. boils at - 164.0 °C, but
C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt; must be heated to + 125.7°C before the molecules will separate from
one another and go into the gas phase.

[[Image:Chemical Principles Fig 1-4.png|frame|'''Figure 1-4''' The 0&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;-&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;H bonds in water and methanol (methyl alcohol) are polar because the oxygen
atom has the stronger attraction for the electron pair and pulls negative charge toward
itself, leaving the hydrogen with a fractional positive charge. This polarity is of great
importance in interactions between molecules.]]

A second kind of force between molecules also influences melting and
boiling points: the '''polarity''' of the molecules. If two atoms that are connected
by an electron-pair covalent bond do not have the same attraction for electrons, then the electron pair will shift toward the atom with the greater electron pulling power. This will give that atom a slight excess of negative
charge (represented by δ- rather than by just a minus sign, which would
imply a full electron charge), and will confer a slight positive charge (δ+) on
the atom that lost out in the tug-of-war for the electron pair. Because the
electron-attracting power ('''electronegativity''') of oxygen is greater than that
of hydrogen, the oxygen atom in a molecule of water or methyl alcohol is
slightly negative, and the hydrogen atoms are slightly positive (Figure 1-4).
Such a molecule is termed polar because it behaves like a tiny electric dipole;
that is, the negative charge on the oxygen attracts other nearby positive
charges, and the positive charge on each hydrogen attracts other negative
charges. This is another attractive force between molecules, in addition to
van der Waals attractions. Because of the forces binding its molecules,
methanol melts and boils at much higher temperatures than methane,
which is similar to it in molecular size. Methanol is a liquid at room temperature,
whereas methane is a gas. In water, the attractions between
hydrogen and oxygen from different molecules are so strong that they are
given the name of '''hydrogen bonds'''. Hydrogen bonds are especially' important
in proteins and other giant molecules in living organisms. If it were not
for polarity and hydrogen bonding, water would melt and boil at lower temperatures
even than H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S (Table 1-3). It would be a gas at room temperature,
rather than the Earth's most common liquid.

==Molecules and Moles==
So far we have talked only about individual atoms or molecules, and about
masses measured in atomic mass units. But individual molecules are hard
to manipulate in the laboratory, and chemists weigh their materials in
grams, not in atomic mass units. To scale up from the molecular level to
the laboratory level, we use a unit called a '''mole'''. A mole of a substance is
equal to as many molecules of that substance as there are atoms of carbon-12
in exactly 12 g of carbon-12. This means that 1 mole of any substance is a
weight, in grams, equal to that substance's molecular weight expressed in
atomic mass units. Most important of all, by this definition, 1 mole of any
substance contains the ''same number of molecules''. The chemist can count atoms
and molecules in the laboratory simply by weighing them.

The word ''mole'' applies not just to molecules but also to atoms; in
practice, we speak of a mole of helium atoms as well as of a mole of water
molecules. The term ''gram-atom'' applied to a mole of atoms is no longer
widely used.

{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;
|+'''Example 9'''
|-
|How many grams of each of the following substances are there in 1 mole of that substance: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0 , CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH, octane (C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;), and neon gas (Ne)?
|-
|'''Solution'''
The molecular weights (in atomic mass units) of most of these substances
have been given in previous examples, and the atomic weight of neon is
listed on the inside back cover. One mole of each substance is therefore:
::{| style=&quot;background:transparent;&quot;
 |- style=&quot;background:transparent;&quot;
 | H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;||2.0160 g||&lt;font color=&quot;white&quot;&gt;break&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;||C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;||114.23 g
 |- style=&quot;background:transparent;&quot;
 | H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O||18.0154 g||&lt;font color=&quot;white&quot;&gt;break&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;||Ne||20.179 g
 |- style=&quot;background:transparent;&quot;
 | CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH||32.04 g||&lt;font color=&quot;white&quot;&gt;break&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;|| ||
 |}
|}

Because the weights listed in Example 9 give the correct relative weights
of the molecules that are being weighed out, each of the quantities of
material will contain the ''same number of molecules''. This is what makes the
concept of moles useful. It is not even necessary to know what that number
is, although we know it to be 6.022 X 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; ; it is called ''Avogadro's number'' and
is given the symbol ''N'' Going from molecules to moles means a scale-up of
6.022 X 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; times. Avogadro's number is also the conversion factor between
atomic mass units and grams as units of mass: 1 g = 6.022 X 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; amu.
If we think of the molecular weight as being the mass of a mole of substance,
the units for molecular weight are grams per mole; if we think of it as the
actual weight of one molecule, the numerical value is unchanged but the
units become atomic mass units per molecule. Both are correct.

|+'''Example 10'''
|-
|One molecule of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; reacts with one molecule of Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to form two molecules of hydrogen chloride gas, HCl. What weight of chlorine gas should be used in order to react completely with 1 kilogram (kg) of hydrogen gas?
|-
|'''Solution'''
The molecular weights of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  and Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  are 2.0160 g mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and 70.906 g
mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. * Hence 1000 g of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; contains:
::&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{1000 g}{2.0160 g mole^-1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;big&gt; = 496.0 moles of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules&lt;/big&gt; 


Without knowing how many molecules there are in a mole, we can still be
sure that 496.0 moles of Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will have the same number of molecules as
496.0 moles or 1000 g of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. How many grams of Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are there in 496.0 moles?
Since the molecular weight of Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is 70.906 g mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;,
::&lt;big&gt;496.0 moles X 70.906 g mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; = 35,170 g of Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/big&gt;


One kilogram equals 1000 g, so 35,170 g is 35.17 kg. If 1.00 kg H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is made to
react with 35.17 kg of C1&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the reaction will be complete and none of either
starting material will be left over.

''* The expression &quot;g mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;&quot; should be read as &quot;grams per mole.&quot; In this notation, a speed in miles per hour is written with units of &quot;miles hr-I.&quot;''

As a sobering example of just how large Avogadro's number is, 1 mole
of coconuts, each 14 centimeters (cm) in diameter, would fill a volume as
large as the entire planet earth. The use of moles in chemical calculations
is the subject of the next chapter, but the idea has been introduced here
because we need to know how to scale up from the molecular to the
laboratory level.

The idea of a covalent bond suggests equal sharing of the electron pair by
the bonded atoms, but the brief discussion of polarity in Section 1-4 indicated
that the sharing is not always equal. The relative electronegativity or
electron-attracting power of atoms is of great importance in explaining
chemical behavior, and is treated in detail in Chapters 9 and 10. Sodium
atoms (and all metals in general) have a weak hold on electrons, whereas
chlorine atoms are very electronegative. Hence in common table salt
(sodium chloride, NaCl), each sodium atom, Na, loses one electron (''e''&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) to
form a sodium ion, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. Each chlorine atom picks up one electron to become
a chloride ion, Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;:
::&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Na → Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + ''e''&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;white&quot;&gt;word&lt;/font&gt;and&lt;font color=&quot;white&quot;&gt;word&lt;/font&gt;&lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt; Cl&lt;small&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/small&gt; + ''e''&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; → Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;
&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

We write &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt; Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; because free chlorine gas exists as '''diatomic''' (two-atom)
molecules, not as free chlorine atoms. Solid sodium chloride (Figure 1-5) has
sodium and chloride ions packed into a three-dimensional lattice in such a
way that each positive Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion is surrounded on four sides and top and
bottom by negative Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ions, and each Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; is similarly surrounded by six
nearest neighbor Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions. This is a particularly stable arrangement of
positive and negative charges.

Metals in general lose one to three electrons easily to become positively
charged ions, or '''cations''':

:::::::'''Table 1-4 Some Simple Ions of Elements'''

[[Image:Chemical Principles, Table 1.4.png]]

Other simple ions made from single atoms are shown in Table 1-4. The
charge on a simple, single-atom ion such as AP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or S&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; is its '''oxidation state'''
or '''oxidation number'''. It is the number of electrons that must be added to
reduce (or removed to oxidize) the ion to the neutral species:
::Reduction: AI&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; + 3&lt;sup&gt;''e''-&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt; Al
::Oxidation: S&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt; S + 2&lt;sup&gt;''e''-&lt;/sup&gt;
Pulling electrons away from an atom or removing them altogether is
'''oxidation'''. Adding electrons to an atom or merely shifting them toward it
is '''reduction'''.

{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;
|+'''Example 12'''
|-
|Is chlorine oxidized or reduced in forming the chloride ion? What is the oxidation state of the ion?
|-
|'''Solution'''
Chlorine is reduced, since one electron per chlorine atom is added to form
the ion. The chloride ion, Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; , is in the - 1 oxidation state.
|}



{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;
|+'''Example 13'''
|-
|When metals are converted into their ions, are they oxidized or reduced? What is the oxidation state of the aluminum ion?
|-
|'''Solution'''
Metals are oxidized to their ions, since electrons are removed. The aluminum
ion, AP&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, is in the +3 oxidation state.
|}

If two or more oxidation states for a metal ion are possible, they are differentiated
by writing the oxidation state in Roman numerals after the
name of the atom. An older nomenclature, still in use, identifies the higher
oxidation state by the ending -''ic'' and the lower by -''ous''. Hence,
::{| style=&quot;background:transparent;&quot;
 |- style=&quot;background:transparent;&quot;
 | Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;||&lt;font color=&quot;white&quot;&gt;tt&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;||iron(II) or ferrous||&lt;font color=&quot;white&quot;&gt;break&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;||Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;||&lt;font color=&quot;white&quot;&gt;tt&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;||iron(III) or ferric

The equation is Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; + ''e''&lt;sup&gt;&lt;big&gt;-&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt; Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; . The process is a reduction since an
electron is added.
|}


The modern nomenclature with Roman numerals is easier to use because
it does not require you to remember what the two oxidation states of a
metal are, in order to know what a compound is from its name.

A '''salt''' is a compound made up of positive and negative ions. Because
a salt must be electrically neutral, the total charge on its positive and negative
ions must be zero. Since each ion of Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; has a charge of +2, twice as
many chloride ions with -1 charge each are required to produce a zero
net charge. Hence the salt of Sn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ions has the overall composition
SnCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, rather than SnCl or SnCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. It is called stannous chloride or tin (II)
chloride. The formula for stannic chloride or tin(IV) chloride is SnCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

In addition to these simple ions, compound or complex ions can be
formed between a metal or nonmetal and oxygen, chlorine, ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;),
the hydroxide ion (OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;), or other chemical groups. The sulfate ion, SO&lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac{2-}{4}}&lt;/math&gt;,
has four oxygens at the corners of a tetrahedron around the central sulfur
atom, and an overall charge of -2. The nitrate ion, NO&lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac{}{3}}&lt;/math&gt;, has three oxygen
atoms in an equilateral triangle around the nitrogen, and a -1 charge. The
ammonium ion, NH&lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac{+}{4}}&lt;/math&gt;, has four hydrogens at the corners of a tetrahedron,
and a +1 charge. These ions are thought of as units because they form salts
the way single-atom ions do, and go through many chemical reactions
unchanged. Silver nitrate, AgN0&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is a salt containing equal numbers of
Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and NO&lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac{}{3}}&lt;/math&gt; ions. Ammonium sulfate is a salt with twice as many ammonium
ions, NH&lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac{+}{4}}&lt;/math&gt;, as sulfate ions, SO&lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac{2-}{4}}&lt;/math&gt;, and the chemical formula
(NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S0&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. Other typical complex ions are shown in Table 1-5.



:::::::'''Table 1-5  Some Common Complex Ions'''
[[image:Chemical Principles, Table 1.5.png]] 


When a central atom is surrounded by several equally spaced atoms,
the number of surrounding atoms is called the '''coordination number'''. The
most important factor is size. Nitrogen in the nitrate ion, NO&lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac{ }{3}}&lt;/math&gt;, has room
for three oxygen atoms around it, and hence a coordination number of
3 for oxygen. The sulfur atom is larger than a nitrogen atom, and can
accommodate one more oxygen atom in the sulfate ion, SO&lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac{2-}{4}}&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the
coordination number of sulfur for oxygen is 4.

The most common coordination numbers are 2, 3, 4, and 6, (See Table
1-6.) An ion or molecule with a central atom having a coordination number
of 2 can be either linear, as carbon dioxide with O-C-O in a straight
line, or bent, as in water, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0. Possible structures for ions or molecules
with coordination numbers of 3, 4, and 6 are shown in Table 1-6.

:::::'''Table 1-6  Common Coordination Numbers'''
[[Image:Chemistry Principles Table 1.6.png]]


[[image:Chemical Principles Fig 1.6.png|frame|'''Figure 1-6'''  Geometry of atoms around central atoms with coordination numbers 3, 4, and 6. If L
is any peripheral atom and M is the central atom, then the bond angle L - M - L is 120°
for trigonal planar, 109.5° for tetrahedral, and typically around 109.5° for trigonal
pyramidal geometries. Square planar and octahedral geometries have two L - M - L
angles, 90° and 180°.]]


It is not strictly correct to talk about molecular formulas and molecular
weights of salts, since there are no molecules in salts-only ordered lattices
of ions. No one sodium ion in the sodium chloride structure shown in Figure
1-5 &quot;belongs&quot; to a particular chloride ion. It is correct, however, to speak
of the '''chemical formula''' of a salt, and the '''formula weight''' that corresponds
to it. Since the chemical formula for sodium chloride is NaCl, the formula
weight of sodium chloride is the sum of the atomic weights of one atom of
sodium and one atom of chlorine:
::{| style=&quot;background:transparent;&quot;
 |- style=&quot;background:transparent;&quot;
 | 1 sodium:||&lt;font color=&quot;white&quot;&gt;tt&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;||22.990 amu
 |- style=&quot;background:transparent;&quot;
 | 1 chlorine:||&lt;font color=&quot;white&quot;&gt;tt&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;||&lt;u&gt;35.453 amu&lt;/u&gt;
 |- style=&quot;background:transparent;&quot;
 | Total:||&lt;font color=&quot;white&quot;&gt;tt&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;||58.443 amu
 |}


It is conventional to call this the &quot;molecular weight&quot; of sodium chloride,
and no confusion results as long as you realize what a salt structure is like.
A mole of sodium chloride is 58.443 g. It will contain 6.022 X 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; sodium
ions and 6.022 X 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; chloride ions. Even though they are not paired off
into molecules, the ratio is strictly one to one.

The simple anions are named by adding ''-ide'' to the name of the element,
as in the fluoride (F&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;), chloride (Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;), oxide (O&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;), and sulfide (S&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;) ions.
Where more than one complex anion of an element with oxygen can be
formed, the suffixes ''-ate'' and ''-ite'' are used for the higher and lower oxidation
states, respectively. Thus,

===Melting Points and Boiling Points of Salts===
A salt crystal represents a particularly stable balance of positive and negative
charges, with each type of ion being kept out of the way of others of like
charge. Melting a salt crystal means upsetting this delicate balance of
charges, and allowing mutually repelling ions to come closer together from
time to time as the ions flow past one another. This disruption of structure requires
large amounts of energy to accomplish, so the melting points of
salts are higher than those of molecular solids. The melting points of two
salts, sodium chloride (NaCI) and potassium sulfate (K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), are compared
in Table 1-7 with those of the elements from which the salts are made.

Metallic sodium melts at 97.8°C, and solid chlorine melts at -101°C, but
their combination, sodium chloride (common table salt), requires a temperature
of 801°C before it will melt. Boiling or vaporizing a salt is even
more difficult. The ions remain ions in the liquid state, tumbling past one
another as in any other liquid; but before the gas phase can be attained,
Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CI&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ions must pair off into neutral NaCl molecules. To accomplish
this pairing, electrons have to be pulled away from CI&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ions, which have a
strong attraction for them, and pushed toward Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, which do not
want them. The NaCl bond in sodium chloride vapor is extremely polar,
with the electron pair skewed strongly toward the chlorine atom, but the
separation still is not as complete as in Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CI&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ions. Much energy is
required to push electrons where they are not wanted and to make NaCl
molecules from Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and CI&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ions, so high temperatures are required before
this can happen. Hence the very high boiling points of salts in comparison
with molecular compounds, as illustrated in Table 1-7.

==Ions in Solution==
[[image:Chemical Principles Fig 1.7.png|frame|'''Figure 1-7'''  Breakup of a salt crystal by water molecules. with hydration of ions. Each salt ion in solution is surrounded by polar water molecules
with the opposite charge to that of the ion turned toward it. This electrostatic hydration energy compensates for the loss of attractions between ions in the salt crystal. From Dickerson and Geis. ''Chemistry, Matter, and the Universe''.]]

Although salts are hard to melt and even harder to vaporize, many can be
dissolved easily in a polar liquid such as water. The reason for this is simple.
The water molecules help to dismantle the salt crystal, since the partial
positive and negative charges on the polar water molecules (Figure 1-4)
provide a substitute for the positive and negative charges that were present
in the crystal lattice. Figure 1-7 illustrates what happens when a crystal
such as sodium chloride is dissolved in water. Each positively charged Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
is surrounded by water molecules with their negatively charged oxygens
turned toward it, and each negatively charged Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ion is surrounded by
water molecules with their positively charged hydrogens closest. The ions
from the salt crystal are said to be '''hydrated'''. If the stability that hydration
gives the ions in solution is greater than the stability of the crystal lattice,
then the salt will dissolve. Sodium chloride is a familiar example of a soluble
salt. In contrast, if the hydration energy is too small, then the crystal will be
the more stable form, and it will not dissolve in water. Silver chloride (AgCl)
and barium sulfate (BaS0&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) are examples of insoluble salts. When a salt
crystal dissolves, it does not simply come apart into ions; it is taken apart by
the molecules of the liquid in which it is dissolved (the solvent). This is why
salts will not dissolve in nonpolar liquids such as gasoline (octane, C&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;18&lt;/sub&gt;);
there are no charges on the solvent molecules to make up for the loss of
charge attractions within the crystalline salt.

Salt solutions conduct electricity, and this property was extremely
important early in the development of theories of chemical bonding. Electrical
conduction in metals takes place by means of moving electrons; the
metal ions remain in place. Crystalline salts do not conduct electricity at
all, but if the salt is melted, then positive ions can migrate one way through
the liquid and negative ions can move the other way in the presence of an
electric field. This mobility of ions is even greater if the salt is dissolved in
water and the ions consequently are hydrated.

Some of the first concrete ideas about the nature of chemical bonding
came from the electrolysis experiments of the English scientist Michael
Faraday (1791-1867). ('''Electrolysis''' means &quot;breaking apart with electricity.&quot;)
If sodium chloride is melted (above 801°C) and if two electrodes
(the '''cathode''' and the '''anode''') are inserted into the melt as shown in Figure
1-8 and an electric current is passed through the molten salt, then '''chemical reactions''' take place at the electrodes: Sodium ions migrate to the cathode, where electrons enter the melt, and are reduced to sodium metal:

[[image:Chemical Principles Fig 1.8.png|frame|'''Figure 1-8'''  A commercial electrolysis cell for the production of metallic sodium and chlorine gas from molten NaCl. Liquid sodium floats to the top of the melt above the cathode and is drained off into a storage tank. Chlorine gas bubbles out of the melt above the anode. From Dickerson and Geis. ''Chemistry. Matter. and the Universe.'']]

[[image:Chemical Principles Fig 1.9.png|frame|'''Figure 1-9'''  Schematic diagram of an electrolysis cell. For current to be carried , the fluid must contain
mobile ions, either as a molten salt or as hydrated ions in solution , A substance
capable of carrying current by migration of ions is called an electrolyte. If the electrolyte
is a solution of CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; , which dissociates (breaks apart) to give Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and CI&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ions, then
as current is passed through the cell. Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions migrate to the cathode and are reduced
to metallic copper, and CI&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ions migrate to the anode, where they are oxidized to Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
gas. Platinum electrodes are used because they are chemically inert and will not react.]]

::Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + ''e''&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;(from cathode) &lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt; Na

Chloride ions migrate the other way, toward the anode, give up their electrons
to the anode, and are oxidized to chlorine gas:

::Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt; &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;C1&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''e''&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;(to anode)

The overall reaction is the breakdown of sodium chloride into its elements:

::Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + CI&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt; Na + &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;C1&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

Sodium ions are reduced and chloride ions are oxidized. Electrolysis can also
be carried out by passing electric current through solutions of salts (Figure
1-9). If a solution of sodium chloride in water is electrolyzed, chlorine gas
is given off at the anode as in the case of molten sodium chloride, but the
cathode product is hydrogen gas rather than metallic sodium:

::Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt; Na + &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;C1&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; (1-1)

This is the same result that would be obtained if liquid sodium chloride was
first electrolyzed to give metallic sodium:

::Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt; Na + &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;C1&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  (1-2)

and the sodium was then dumped into water:

::Na + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt; Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;  (1-3)

Equation 1-1 is just the sum of equations 1-2 and 1-3, since the sodium
metal that is produced in equation 1-2 is used up in equation 1-3. There is
nothing mysterious about the different cathode products during electrolysis
of sodium chloride in a melt or in solution, If water is present, some of the
H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules will be dissociated into H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ions. Because H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
has a greater affinity for electrons than Na+ does, the H+ ions will take
electrons away from metallic sodium, making the anode product H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; rather
than Na, and leaving Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions in solution. In contrast, Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ions have a
greater affinity for electrons than H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions do, so the anode product of
electrolysis of CuCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is metallic copper, whether the process is carried out
in the melt or in solution (Figure 1-9). Typical products of electrolysis of
solutions and melts are given in Table 1-8. Electrochemical reactions and
cells are discussed in detail in Chapter 19. At the moment, we are focusing
on what electrochemical reactions tell us about chemical bonding.

Faraday found that there was a quantitative relationship between
the amount of electricity passed through an electrolytic cell and the amount
of chemical change produced. He formulated '''Faraday's laws of electrolysis''',
which in terms of the modern theory of atoms and ions can be expressed
as follows:

1. Passing the same quantity of electricity through a cell always leads
to the same amount of chemical change for a given reaction. The weight of
an element deposited or liberated at an electrode is proportional to the
amount of electricity that is passed through.

2. It takes 96,485 coulombs of electricity to deposit or liberate 1 mole of
a substance that gains or loses one electron during the cell reaction. If ''n''
electrons are involved in the reaction, then 96,485''n'' coulombs of electricity
are required to liberate a mole of product.

The quantity 96,485 coulombs of electricity has become known as 1 '''faraday'''
in his honor, and has been given the symbol &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;. Faraday's laws become
self-evident when you realize that 1 &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; is simply the charge on 1 mole of
electrons, or 6.022 X 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; electrons. The scale-up factor of 6.022 X 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;
from molecules to moles is paralleled by the same scale-up factor from
1 electron charge to 1 &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt; of charge. At the time, of course, Faraday knew
neither the value of Avogadro's number nor the charge on an electron. His
experiments did tell him, however, that charges on ions came in multiples of
a fundamental unit, such that 96,485 coulombs corresponded to a mole
of these units. The word ''electron'' first appeared in 1881, when the British
physicist G. J. Stoney coined it to denote this fundamental unit of ionic
charge. Its application to a real negatively charged particle came a decade
later.

|'''Solution'''
The cathode reaction is Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + ''e''&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt; Na, and the anode reaction is Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt;

each electron reduces one sodium ion, so 1 mole of sodium atoms is produced.
Hence 22.990 g of Na are deposited at the cathode. At the anode, 1 mole of
electrons is removed from 1 mole of chloride ions, leaving 1 mole of chlorine
atoms, which combine pairwise to make &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt; mole of Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecules. Hence the
weight of chlorine gas released is 35.453 g (the atomic weight of Cl, half
the molecular weight of Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).

Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is only +1. Chlorine gas is liberated at the same rate per faraday as before.]]

Faraday's laws are represented diagrammatically in Figure 1-10.
We have been using these laws with a prior knowledge of the charges on
different ions, and the knowledge that 96,485 coulombs is the total charge
on 6.022 X 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; electrons. History actually operated in reverse: Faraday
and others used electrolysis experiments to find out what the charges on
ions were. The reasoning used is illustrated in Table 1-9. If twice as much
electricity is required to liberate a mole of copper as a mole of silver (assuming
that you know the atomic weights of the two metals and can calculate the
weights of a mole of each), then the copper ion must have twice the charge
of the silver ion. In Table 1-9, the number of faradays of charge required to
liberate 1 mole of an element is the same as the number of charges, positive
or negative, on the ion.

&lt;sup&gt;a&lt;/sup&gt; For example, electrolysis of silver nitrate solution for 1 hour by using a current of 0.5 A deposits 2.015 g of silver; 2.015/107.9 = 0.0187 mole of silver.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;u&gt;(0.5 coulomb sec^-1) x 3600 sec&lt;/u&gt; = 0.0187 &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;b&lt;/sup&gt; Actually, oxygen (0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is produced by a complicated electrode reaction. The species 0&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; can exist in molten oxides, but in water 0&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; becomes 20H&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; by reaction with a water molecule.





==Gaseous Ions==
[[image:Chemical Principles Fig 1.11.png|frame|'''Figure 1-11'''  A Crookes tube. When a high voltage (about 10,000 volts) is applied across two electrodes
in a sealed glass tube containing gas at low pressure, the voltage induces the
breakdown of gas molecules into electrons and positive ions. The electrons stream toward
the anode and are known as cathode rays, and the positive ions stream toward the
cathode and are termed canal rays. If the cathode is perforated, the positive ions will
pass through it and cause a glow where they strike the glass walls. If a lightweight
pinwheel is placed in the path of the cathode rays. they can cause it to rotate . As the
electrons of the cathode rays move toward the anode. they strike other gas molecules
and set up a glow discharge that is familiar in neon signs.]]

It was proposed even as far back as the time of Ben Franklin and John Dalton
that the forces between particles of matter must be electrical in some way.
But because like charges repel one another, it was believed, wrongly, that
bonds could not exist between identical atoms, whereas we now know that
most common gases occur as diatomic molecules: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and
so on. This one blunder led to nearly a half-century of confusion about
molecular structure and atomic weights, during which it was thought that
hydrogen gas was H instead of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; water was HO instead of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, and oxygen
had an atomic weight of 8 rather than 16. Electron pairs as the &quot;glue&quot; that
holds atoms together in covalent bonds were not even proposed systematically
until 1913, by G. N. Lewis; they were not explained theoretically for
still another 20 years. Faraday's experiments showed that the charges on
ions did occur naturally in fundamental pieces or units such that a mole of
these charges equaled 1 &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;, and Stoney named this elemental unit the
''electron''. But Stoney's electron was not necessarily a particle that could be
isolated and studied.

The people who first showed that electrons were real particles that
could be added to or removed from atoms were physicists studying the
effects of electricity on gases. They found that if they set up an electrical
potential of 10,000 volts between two electrodes in a sealed tube (a ''Crookes''
tube) containing gas at low pressure, they observed a glow discharge (Figure
1-11). This discharge is what makes neon signs glow. The electrical potential
strips electrons from atoms of the gas, sending the electrons streaming
toward the anode and positive ions toward the cathode. These moving
electrons (the cathode rays) can be detected by watching the flashes of
light on a zinc sulfide screen placed in the tube. If a lightweight pinwheel is
set up in the path of the electrons inside the tube, the electrons even make
the pinwheel rotate. On their way to the anode, the cathode rays strike other
atoms of the gas, causing the emission of light in a glow discharge. The
color of the glow discharge will vary, depending on the gas used· inside
the tube.

If a metal plate with a slit is placed in front of the cathode, then the
electrons in the cathode ray will be confined to a thin beam. This beam is
deflected by electric and magnetic fields in a way that indicates that the
particles in the beam carry a negative charge. The relative amount of
bending of the '''canal rays''' (positive ions) and '''cathode rays''' (negative electrons)
shows that the cathode ray particles are extremely light, whereas the
positive ions are roughly as heavy as the original atoms from which they
came. The exact nature of the canal rays depends on what gas is used in the
tube, but the cathode rays are the same for all gases. J. J. Thomson (1856-
1940) suggested that the particles in the cathode rays might in fact be
Stoney's &quot;electrons,&quot; and in 1897 he found a way to use the deflection of the
beam by electric and magnetic fields to calculate the charge-to-mass ratio
(elm) of the particles. He found that
;;&lt;math&gt;\textstyle{\frac{e}{m}}&lt;/math&gt; = 1.76 x 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; coulombs g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

charged particles (electrons) stick to the oil drops. The charge on a drop can be
determined from the voltage that must be applied across the condenser plates to make
the drop hang motionless, with electrostatic and gravitational forces in balance.]]

A modern descendant of the Crookes tube and Thomson's apparatus
is the mass spectrometer (Figure 1-12). It is a valuable research tool for
measuring the mass per unit charge of any substance that can be given a
positive charge. Mass spectrometry offers the most direct measurement of
atomic weights of elements, and it is the method by which isotopes can be
both identified and separated. By looking at the masses of the fragments
into which molecules are broken down during electron bombardment in
the spectrometer, organic chemists can obtain useful information about the
molecular structure of a substance. (During the development of the atomic
bomb in World War II, mass spectrometry was used to separate fissionable
&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U from &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U, although the extremely low pressures that mass spectrometry
requires were not practical for large-scale production.)

Although the ratio of electron charge to electron mass was measured
in 1897 by Thomson, the charge itself was not measured until 1911 , when
Robert A. Millikan (1868-1953) obtained the charge by the ingenious
experiment illustrated in Figure 1-13. He used x rays to irradiate a spray of
tiny oil droplets between two chargeable plates. Electrons from ionization of
the air around the drops adhered to the drops, giving them one, two, or more
electron charges. Millikan measured first the rate of free fall of the charged
drops through air of known viscosity. Then he measured the voltage across
the plates that was sufficient to suspend the drops motionless between the
plates. He calculated that the charge on anyone drop was always an integral
multiple of 1.6022 X 10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt; coulomb, and he concluded correctly that this
was the charge on a single electron.

Example 20 actually was presented the wrong way around. We can
solve it only because we know the value of Avogadro's number, whereas
in fact Millikan's results furnished one way of ''calculating'' Avogadro's number.

==Summary==
An '''atom''' consists of a positively charged '''nucleus''' surrounded by enough
negatively charged '''electrons''' to yield zero net charge. The nucleus is constructed
from positively charged '''protons''' and neutral '''neutrons''', each of
mass approximately 1 amu. The mass of an electron is approximately 1/ 1836
the mass of a proton; the charge on an electron is equal but opposite in sign
to the charge on a proton. The total number of protons in the nucleus (and
electrons in a neutral atom) is the '''atomic number''', '''''Z'''''. The total number of
both protons and neutrons is the '''mass number''', and the mass of the atom, in
atomic mass units, is its '''atomic weight'''. The atomic weight is always slightly
less than the sum of masses of the particles that go into making an atom,
because mass is converted to energy and lost when the atom is formed.

All atoms with the same number of protons, and therefore the same
atomic number, are classified as the same '''element''' and represented by a
one- or two-letter symbol. Atoms of the same element with varying numbers
of neutrons are called '''isotopes''' of the element. Isotopes are identified by
placing the mass number as a superscript to the left of the symbol of the
element (e.g., &lt;sup&gt;37&lt;/sup&gt;Cl). The atomic number is sometimes added as a subscript
(e.g., &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{37}{17}&lt;/math&gt;Cl), although it is actually not necessary since the element's name
and atomic number are known from the symbol. Each isotope of an element
has its own atomic weight, and the '''natural atomic weight''' is the weighted
average of these isotopic values, the weighting being according to the
natural abundance of each isotope.

A collection of atoms held together by chemical bonds is a '''molecule'''
Usually, but not always, the bonding in a molecule can be explained in
terms of electron pairs, each holding two atoms together. Such an electronpair
bond is a '''covalent bond'''. The sum of the atomic weights of all the
atoms in a molecule is its '''molecular weight'''. Although atoms in different
molecules are not directly bonded to one another, all molecules are slightly
&quot;sticky,&quot; and are attracted to other molecules. These '''van der Waals
attractions''' will make the molecules of a gas adhere to one another to form a
liquid if the temperature falls low enough, and make the molecules of a
liquid fit together in a regular crystalline array in a solid if the temperature
falls lower still. The temperatures at which these two transitions occur are
the '''boiling point''', '''T&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;''' , and the '''melting point''', '''T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'''' respectively.

If two atoms differ in their intrinsic electron-pulling power or '''electronegativity''',
then the electron pair of the bond between them will be shifted
toward the atom with the greater attraction, giving it a negative charge and
the other atom a positive charge. The bond, and molecules that contain
such bonds, are said to be '''polar'''. Polar molecules can attract one another,
and they can also attract positively and negatively charged ions. Melting and
boiling points of polar molecules are higher than would be expected from
van der Waals attractions alone, because their polarity provides a second
type of intermolecular attraction.

Atomic and molecular weights are measured on a scale of '''atomic mass
units (amu)''', where 1 amu is defined as exactly one-twelfth of the mass of
a &lt;sup&gt;I2&lt;/sup&gt;C atom. A quantity of a chemical substance (atoms, molecules, or ions)
equal to the atomic weight expressed in grams is defined as 1 '''mole''' of that
substance. One mole of any substance-atoms, molecules or ions-contains
the same number of particles of that substance. This property makes the
mole a useful means of counting out particles merely by weighing them. The
units of atomic and molecular weights are either grams per mole or amu
per molecule (or atom).

Some atoms, those of metals in particular, have a weak hold on their
electrons and can lose one, two, or more electrons to become positively
charged '''ions''', or '''cations'''. Many nonmetals or groups of atoms can acquire
one or more negative charges to become negatively charged ions, or '''anions'''.
A '''salt''' is a compound of the relative number of cations and anions that will
produce zero overall charge. Common table salt, NaCl, contains equal
numbers of Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ions. The pulling away or outright removal of
electrons is termed '''oxidation''', and the addition to or shifting of electrons
toward an atom is '''reduction'''. Since electrons are never created or destroyed
in chemical reactions, whenever one substance is oxidized, some other
substance must be reduced.

Simple anions made by adding electrons to single atoms have names
ending in'' -ide'', as ''chloride'', Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''sulfide'', S&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;, ions. For complex ions of a
nonmetal atom with oxygen, the higher and lower oxidation state ions are
differentiated by the suffixes ''-ate'' and ''-ite''. The oxidation state of a metal
cation (see Chapter 10) is indicated by a Roman numeral after the name of
the metal, as in Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, iron(III), or by the suffixes ''-ic'' and ''-ous''.

Although salts do not have separate molecules and, strictly speaking,
cannot have molecular weights, they do have chemical formulas that express
their overall composition in the simplest possibJe way. The weight of
1 mole of these atoms is the '''formula weight''' of the salt, but it is customary
to refer to this as the salt's &quot;molecular weight.&quot; Thus magnesium chloride
has one Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion for every two Cl&lt;small&gt;-&lt;/small&gt; ions, a net charge of zero, a chemical
formula of MgCl&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and a molecular weight of 95.211 g mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

The''' coordination number''' in a complex ion or molecule is the number
of atoms or chemical groups bonded directly to the central atom. These
bonding groups can be simple ions such as O&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; and Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; or molecules such
as ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). The maximum coordination number
for a given central atom depends on the size of the atom and the size of its
surrounding groups. The most common coordination numbers are 2, 3, 4,
and 6.

Salts have higher melting and boiling points than molecular substances,
because heat energy must be supplied to break apart the stable crystal
lattice, and even more heat energy is required to force positive and negative
ions to pair off and share electrons in neutral molecules that can go into a
gas phase. Salts often dissolve readily in water, however, because polar
attractions by the water molecules can compensate for the attractions of
other ions in the crystal. Ions surrounded by polar water molecules in solution
are said to be '''hydrated'''. Gasoline and similar nonpolar liquids cannot
dissolve salts because they cannot hydrate (or '''solvate''', if the solvent is other
than water) the ions.

If a current of electricity is passed through molten salt or a salt solution,
the current is carried by ions migrating in opposite directions. At the cathode,
where electrons enter the salt medium, metal cations can be reduced to
pure metal. At the '''anode''', where electrons flow out of the salt and back into
the external circuit, anions can be oxidized to liberate pure nonmetallic elements.
This is the process of '''electrolysis'''. Faraday found a quantitative
relationship between the amount of charge passed through a cell and the
amount of chemical change produced: 96,485 coulombs of charge will
bring about 1 mole of a change that involves one electron per ion. The
quantity, 96,485 coulombs, is simply the charge on 1 mole of electrons
and is called 1 faraday (&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}&lt;/math&gt;) of charge.

Electrons as separate particles were studied by physicists interested in
low-pressure gas discharges under high voltages. ''Cathode rays'' consist of
a beam of electrons stripped away from the gas atoms. J. J. Thomson
showed, by means of deflecting magnetic and electrostatic fields, that the
cathode rays were made of negatively charged particles, and he measured
the charge-to-mass ratio of the particles. R. A. Millikan completed the
process, in his oil-drop experiment, by successfully measuring the charge on
the electron. This, combined with Faraday's results, led to the calculation
of '''Avogadro's number''', the number of electrons in a faraday of charge, or
the number of particles in a mole of any substance. The mass spectrometer,
a descendant of Thomson's gas-discharge tubes, is a modern analytical tool
and a means of finding the charge-to-mass ratio for any atomic or molecular
species that can be given a charge.

== Introduction ==
The concept of atoms goes back to the Greek philosophers. Democritus (470-360? b.c.) proposed that all matter is made up of separate, indestructible atoms, that different kinds of atoms have different structures and behavior, and that the observed properties of substances arise because of the way their individual atoms arrange themselves and combine with one another. His theories are essentially a primitive version of the material in Chapter 1. Why, then, did the ancient Greeks not use the theories of Democritus and go on to develop atomic energy? Why did 2000
years pass before modem science began to develop?

The answer, in large part, is that the Greeks did not think quantitatively about atoms, and they were not experimentalists. Their science was a philosophical explanation of the universe, rather than a pragmatic
tool with which to manipulate the world around them. Cheap human labor kept them from having to worry about developing a scientific technology.

The Greek scientist Heron of Alexandria invented several steam-driven mechanisms that could have led directly to the steam engine, but he used them only as toys and novelties.

The atomic theory of Democritus was sterile because it did not lead to quantitative predictions that could be tested. It failed to develop beyond abstract concepts because it did not have the feedback from successful and
unsuccessful experiments in the real world to challenge and improve it.

A scientific theory, to be useful, must be quantitative. It must predict: &quot;If I do this, then that will happen, and to an extent that I can calculate in advance.&quot; Such a prediction is testable. It can be seen to be correct, increasing our confidence in the theory behind it; or what frequently is more important, it can be seen to be incorrect, causing us to revise and improve the theory.

Scientific theories grow by continual destruction and rebuilding. A theory that predicts nothing that could possibly be tested conveys no information, and is worthless.

The importance of precise measurement of mass in chemical reactions escaped the Greek philosophers. It also escaped the medieval European alchemists, metallurgists, and iatrochemists (medicinal chemists). The
great French chemist Antoine Lavoisier (1743-1794) was the first to realize that mass was the fundamental quantity conserved during chemical reactions. 

The total mass of all products formed must be precisely the same as the total mass of the starting materials. With this principle Lavoisier demolished the long-accepted phlogiston theory of heat (see Chapter 6) by
showing that when a substance burns, it combines with another element, oxygen, rather than decomposing and giving off a mysterious universal substance called phlogiston. The principle of the conservation of mass is the cornerstone of all chemistry. More than just total mass is conserved; the same number of each type of atom must be present both before and after a chemical reaction, no matter how intricately these atoms may combine and
rearrange into molecules.

Energy also must be conserved in chemical reactions. To the chemist, this means that the heat that is absorbed or given off in a particular chemical reaction (the heat of reaction) must be the same no matter how that reaction
is carried out—in one step or in several. For example, the heat given off when hydrogen gas and graphite (a form of carbon) are burned must be the same as that given off when hydrogen and carbon are used to make synthetic
gasoline, and this gasoline is then used as fuel for an automobile engine.

If the heat given off in the two variations of the reaction were not the same, then the more efficient reaction could be run in the forward direction and the less efficient one could be run in reverse. The result would be a cyclical no-fuel furnace that would pour out endless quantities of heat at no cost to the operator. Perpetual-motion schemes of all types vanish as soon as one becomes quantitative about heat, energy, and work. This is the basis of thermodynamics, which is covered in detail in Chapters 15-17.

In this chapter we shall look at the consequences, for chemistry, of two principles:
# Atoms are neither created nor destroyed during chemical reactions (conservation of mass).
# Heats of reaction are additive. If two reactions can be added to give a third, then the heat of the third reaction is equal to the sum of the heats of the first two reactions (conservation of energy).

Both these principles may seem obvious at first, but they are also quite powerful tools in explaining chemical behavior.

== Atomic Weights, Molecular Weights, and Moles ==
[[Image:Chemical_Principles_Fig2-1.jpg|frame|right|'''Figure 2-1.''' Two molecules of hydrogen gas combine with one molecule of oxygen to yield two molecules of water.
Avogadro's principle tells us that equal volumes of
different gases contain equal numbers of molecules, at a
specified temperature and pressure. Hence two volumes
of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gas will combine with one volume of 0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, to produce
two volumes of water vapor, and two moles of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will
combine with one mole of 0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to produce two moles of
water vapor. From Dickerson and Geis, Chemistry, Matter,
and the Universe]]
As soon as chemists realized that mass — not volume, density or some other measurable property — was the fundamental property that was conserved during chemical reactions, they began to try to establish a correct scale of atomic masses (atomic weights) for all the elements. How they did this is described in Chapter 6; the result of their years of work is the table of natural atomic weights on the inside back cover of this book. As we saw in Chapter 1, the molecular weights of molecular compounds and the formula weights of nonmolecular compounds (such as salts) are found by adding the atomic weights of all the constituent atoms.

Central to all chemical calculations is the concept of the mole. As defined in Chapter 1, a mole of any substance is the quantity that contains as many particles of the substance as there are atoms in exactly 12 g of carbon-12. Thus a mole of a substance is a quantity in grams that is numerically equal to its molecular weight expressed in atomic mass units. The number of particles in a mole is called Avogadro's number, and the experiments of Millikan and Faraday described at the end of Chapter 1 are one means of establishing its value:

N = 6.022 X 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; particles mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

Moles are a way of manipulating atoms or molecules in bundles of 6.022 X 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;. The molecular weights of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0 were worked out in Chapter 1. If we know that two molecules of hydrogen gas, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, react with one molecule of oxygen gas, 0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, to produce two molecules of water, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0, then we can predict that 2 moles of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, or 4.032 g, will react with 1 mole of
0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, or 31.999 g, to yield 2 moles of water, or 36.031 g (Figure 2-1). The check addition, 4.032 + 31.999 = 36.031, verifies the conservation of mass during the reaction. The chemist measures substances in grams, by weighing them.

Yet it is more meaningful to convert these quantities from grams to moles, because then one is working with relative molecular proportions, scaled up by a uniform factor of N.

== Chemical Analyses. Percent Composition and Empirical Formulas ==
Chemical analysis involves breaking a substance down into its elements
and then measuring the relative amount of each element present, either in
grams per 100 g of original compound, or as a percent by weight. One way of
doing this, if the compound is a hydrocarbon (made up only of carbon and
hydrogen), is to burn a known amount of the substance in oxygen, and
measure the quantities of C0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (carbon dioxide) and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0 that result.
{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;
|+'''Example 1'''
|-
|When 25.00 g of an unknown hydrocarbon is burned, 68.58 g of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and 56.15 g of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0 are produced. 
How many grams of carbon and hydrogen did the original sample contain?
|-
|'''Solution'''&lt;p&gt;The atomic weight of carbon is 12.011 g mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, and the molecular weight of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is 44.010 g mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. 
First we find the percentage of carbon in carbon dioxide:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\textstyle{(\frac{12.011}{44.010})} \times 100% = 27.29%\mbox{ carbon}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
If 27.29% of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is carbon, then the quantity of carbon in 68.58 g of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
will be&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;27.29% \times 68.58\mbox{ g} = 18.72\mbox{ g carbon.}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
A similar calculation for hydrogen in water gives:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\textstyle{(\frac{2 \times 1.008}{18.015})} \times 100% = 11.19%\mbox{ hydrogen}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;11.19% \times 56.15\mbox{ g} = 6.283\mbox{ g hydrogen.}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;p&gt;
As a check: 18.72 g + 6.283 g = 25.00 g.

|+'''Example 4'''
|-
|Calculate the relative number of carbon and hydrogen atoms in the hydrocarbon of Example 3.
|-
|'''Solution'''
It is easiest to work with 100.0 g of the substance, so the percent elemental composition figures become grams of the respective elements. First we divide each amount of carbon and hydrogen by their atomic weights:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{74.88\mbox{ g carbon}}{12.011\mbox{ g/mole}} = 6.234\mbox{ moles carbon}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{25.12\mbox{ g hydrogen}}{1.008\mbox{ g/mole}} = 24.92\mbox{ moles hydrogen}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
These are the relative numbers of moles of carbon and hydrogen, and it is here that the concept of moles becomes useful. These numbers must also be the relative numbers oí atoms of carbon and hydrogen. For every 6.234 atoms of carbon in the unknown hydrocarbon, there are 24.92 atoms of hydrogen. If we look for a common factor for these two numbers, we see that they are
in a 1:4 ratio. Dividing both numbers by the lower number, 6.234, we find that for every one atom of carbon there are &lt;math&gt;\frac{24.92}{6.234} = 3.997\mbox{ atoms of hydrogen.}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\frac{25.12\mbox{ g oxygen}}{15.999\mbox{ g/mole}} = 5.551\mbox{ moles oxygen}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Dividing both numbers by the smaller, to search for a common factor, we find that there are two atoms of hydrogen for every atom of oxygen.

An elemental analysis, by itself, is not enough to decide the correct
molecular formula of a compound. The formula for methane is CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, which
would fit the results of the calculation in Example 4. But the analytical
results would also be compatible with the molecules C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;, or
C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;16&lt;/sub&gt;, if they could exist. The substance in Example 5 might be water,
H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0, but it could also be H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or some higher multiple. If you recognize,
correctly, that only CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0 are chemically sensible, then you are
bringing to bear new chemical information that is not present in the analytical 
data alone. Most chemists would assume that the molecule in Example
6 was benzene, C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;. But it could also be acetylene, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (except for the
fact that acetylene is a gas at room temperature, and the unknown hydrocarbon 
was said to be a common laboratory solvent, which would exclude
acetylene) or any of the five other less common hydrocarbon molecules
shown in Figure 2-2.

A chemical formula that gives the relative number of each type of
atom, as integers with no common factor, is called the empirical formula
of the substance. It is the empirical formula that results from an elemental
analysis of a substance, not the molecular formula, which could be the
same as the empirical formula or could be some integral multiple of it. The
empirical formula is the same as the molecular formula for methane, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;,
and for water, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O; the empirical formulas of acetylene and benzene are
both CH, but the molecular formulas are C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively.
It frequently happens that some simple physical measurement can give
a rough approximation of the molecular weight of a substance. Gas densities
(Chapter 3), freezing-point depression, and osmotic pressure measurements
(Chapter 18) are useful in this regard. If such an approximate molecular
weight is available, then it can be used along with the empirical formula to
decide the true molecular formula.

|+'''Example 7'''
|-
|Glucose is 40.00% carbon by weight, 6.71% hydrogen, and 53.29% oxygen. What is its empirical formula, and what is its molecular formula?
|-
|'''Solution'''
Working with 100.0 g of glucose, we first find the number of moles of each element:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{40.00\mbox{ g carbon}}{12.011\mbox{ g/mole}} = 3.330\mbox{ moles carbon}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{6.71\mbox{ g hydrogen}}{1.008\mbox{ g/mole}} = 6.66\mbox{ moles hydrogen}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{53.29\mbox{ g hydrogen}}{15.999\mbox{ g/mole}} = 3.331\mbox{ moles hydrogen}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This is obviously a molar ratio of one carbon to two hydrogens to one oxygen, so the empirical formula is CH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. With the information provided we have no way of knowing whether this, or some multiple of this, is the true molecular formula.

|From other experiments we know that glucose has a molecular weight of approximately 175 g mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Use this information and the results of Example 7 to find the molecular formula and the exact molecular weight of glucose.

|'''Solution'''
The weight corresponding to the empirical formula is&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;12.011 + (2 \times 1.008) + 15.999 = 30.026\mbox{ g/mole}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The approximate molecular weight is roughly six times this value, so the
precise molecular weight is&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;6 \times 30.026\mbox{ g/mole} = 180.16\mbox{ g/mole,}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

== Chemical Equations. Balancing Equations and Conservation of Mass ==
When propane gas, C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, is burned in oxygen, the products are carbon
dioxide and water. This can be written as a chemical equation:

       C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O                   (2-1)

If chemistry were not a quantitative science, then this description of the
reaction, identifying both the reactants and the products, would be adequate.
But we expect more from a chemical equation. How many molecules of
oxygen are required per molecule of propane, and how many molecules of
carbon dioxide and water result? Equation 2-1 is an unbalanced equation.
When we add numerical coefficients (placed to the left of the formula) that
tell how many of each kind of molecule are involved, then there will be the
same number of each kind of atom on the left and right sides of the equation,
since atoms are neither created nor destroyed in a chemical reaction. The
result will be a balanced equation.

To balance equation 2-1, we note first that the 3 carbon atoms on the
left will lead to 3 molecules of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as products, each requiring 2 oxygen
atoms, or 6 oxygens in all. Similarly, the 8 hydrogen atoms in propane will
produce 4 molecules of water, requiring 4 more oxygen atoms. This total of
10 oxygens on the right must come from 5 molecules of 0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The correct
coefficients for the four substances in equation 2-1 are therefore 1,5,3, and 4:

       C&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 3 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O             (2-2)

Each side of this balanced equation contains 3 carbon atoms, 8 hydrogen
atoms, and 10 oxygen atoms.

{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;
|+'''Example 9'''
|-
|Trinitrotoluene (TNT), C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, combines violently with oxygen to produce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, water, and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Write a balanced chemical equation for the explosion.
|-
|'''Solution'''
The unbalanced equation is
:C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;0&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → C0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
Since there are odd numbers of hydrogen and nitrogen atoms on the left,
and even numbers on the right, it will be easier to balance the equation on
the basis of two molecules of TNT:
:2 C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
The 14 carbons, 10 hydrogens, and 6 nitrogens then will result in 14 carbon
dioxide, 5 water, and 3 nitrogen molecules:
:2 C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;0&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 14 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 3 N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
Now all atoms are balanced on left and right sides of the equation except
for oxygen. Of the 33 oxygens on the right, 12 are provided on the left by
the 2 starting molecules of TNT, and 21 must be supplied by &lt;math&gt;\textstyle{10\tfrac{1}{2}}&lt;/math&gt; 0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The
final, balanced equation is
:2 C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;0&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 10&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 14 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 5 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 3 N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|}

Example 9 led to an equation with a fractional coefficient for oxygen. This
can be removed by multiplying all coefficients on both sides by 2:

       4 C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 21 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; -&gt; 28 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 10 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 6 N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;           (2-3)

but this is not necessary, since there is no reason why all coefficients must be
integers. It would even be correct to base the equation on a single molecule
of TNT:

       C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 21/4 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 7 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 5/2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 3/2 N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;         (2-4)

A balanced chemical equation such as equation 2-3 has several levels
of meaning. Most simply, it describes the starting materials and the products.
It also tells us that the number of each kind of atom entering the reaction
is the same as the number leaving. Each type of atom individually is
conserved during the reaction. Equation 2-3 is also a statement that for
every 4 molecules of TNT, 21 molecules of oxygen are required, and the
products are 28 molecules of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 10 molecules of water, and 6 molecules
of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Scaling the reaction up by a factor of 6.022 X 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; to go from molecules to moles, 4 moles of TNT react with 21 moles of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to produce
28 moles of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 10 moles of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, and 6 moles of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The individual
molecular weights are

{| border=0 cellspacing=10
| align=center |C&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;N&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
|227.13 g mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

|-
| align=center |N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
|28.013 g mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
|}

Hence equation 2-3 also tells us that 4 X 227.13 g = 908.52 g of TNT
requires 21 X 31.999 g = 671.98 g of oxygen for complete reaction. It also
tells us that the products will be 

28 X 44.010 g = 1232.3 g of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
10 X 18.015 g = 180.15 g of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
6 x 28.013 g = 168.08 g of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

We can verify that mass is indeed conserved:

Reactants: 908.52 g + 671.98 g = 1580.5 g
Products: 1232.3 g + 180.15 g + 16.08 g = 1580.5 g

What a balanced chemical equation does not tell us is the molecular
mechanism or course of events by which the reaction takes place. Equation
2-3 should not be construed as suggesting that 4 TNT molecules must collide
simultaneously with 21 oxygen molecules. Even three-body collisions are
so much rarer than two-body collisions that they can be dismissed from
consideration in most chemical reactions. An elaborate series of individual
steps could take place, as long as the overall net reaction was described 
correctly by equation 2-3 or equation 2-4.

The reactants and products need not be molecules:
       CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 HCl → CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O                      (2-5)
Equation 2-5 describes the reaction of CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, calcium carbonate (limestone), 
and HCl, hydrochloric acid, to produce an aqueous solution of
calcium chloride, CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and carbon dioxide. The equation is balanced,
because the number of each type of atom is the same on both sides. The
molar meaning is clear: 1 mole or 100.09 g of calcium carbonate requires
2 moles or 72.92 g of hydrochloric acid for complete reaction, and the
products will be 1 mole each of calcium chloride (110.99 g mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), carbon
dioxide (44.01 g mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;), and water (18.02 g mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). You can verify from
these figures that mass is conserved during the reaction. The molecular
interpretation is less straightforward, since calcium carbonate is a salt and
not a molecular compound, Equation 2-5 should not be taken as meaning
that one molecule of calcium carbonate reacts with two molecules of HCl.
Although HCl exists as discrete molecules in the gas phase, in solution the
molecules dissociate into H+ and Cl- ions. A better approximation of what
actually happens at the molecular level is
       CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''(s)'' + 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''(aq)'' → Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;''(aq)'' + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''(g)'' + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O''(l)''        (2-6)
The letters in parentheses describe the physical state of each species (''s'',
solid; ''aq'', a hydrated ion in aqueous solution; ''g'', gas; ''l'', liquid). This equation
says that solid calcium carbonate reacts with two hydrated protons (hydrogen
ions) in aqueous solution to produce hydrated calcium ions, gaseous carbon
dioxide, and liquid water. The chloride ions remain as hydrated chloride
ions in solution before and after the reaction; hence they are omitted from
the equation. Equation 2-5, like other balanced chemical equations, is most
useful in describing the amounts of materials involved, rather than the
molecular mechanism of reaction. Equation 2-6, although a better description 
of what is going on at the level of atoms and ions, is less useful in keeping
track of the quantities of matter involved.

|-
|How many grams of hydrogen are needed to combine with 100.0 g of carbon
to make benzene, C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;? How many moles and how many grams of benzene
will be produced?
|-
|'''Solution'''
The balanced equation for the reaction is
:6 C + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;
The number of moles of carbon present is&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{100.0\mbox{ g carbon}}{12.011\mbox{ g/mole}}=8.326\mbox{ moles carbon}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The balanced equation tells us that half as many moles of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are needed as
moles of C, so we need 4.163 moles of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;4.163\mbox{ moles hydrogen}\times2.016\mbox{ g/mole}=8.393\mbox{ g hydrogen}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The molecular weight of benzene is&lt;br&gt;
(6 X 12.011 g) + (6 X 1.008 g) = 78.11 g mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br&gt;
One-sixth as many moles of benzene are produced as moles of carbon used
up, or 8.326/6 = 1.388 moles of benzene. Hence the amount of benzene
produced is&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;1.388\mbox{ moles} \times 78.11\mbox{ g/mole} = 108.4\mbox{ g benzene}&lt;/math&gt;
|}


As a check on arithmetic, note that 100.0 g of carbon and 8.4 g of hydrogen
combine to produce 108.4 g of benzene. Again, mass is conserved during a
chemical reaction.

|-

The quantity of sulfur required to react with 10.00 g of silver is&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{32.06\mbox{ g S}}{215.7\mbox{ g Ag}}\times10.00\mbox{ g Ag}=1.486\mbox{ g S}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
But we only have 1.00 g sulfur, so not all of the silver can react.  Turning the problem around, the amount of silver needed to react with 1.00 g sulfur is&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{215.7\mbox{ g Ag}}{32.06\mbox{ g S}}\times1.00\mbox{ g S}=6.73\mbox{ g Ag}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Hence, there will be &lt;math&gt;10.00 - 6.73 = 3.72\mbox{ g Ag}&lt;/math&gt; left over.  The quantity of silver sulfide produced will be&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{247.8\mbox{ g silver sulfide}}{32.06\mbox{ g S}}\times1.00\mbox{ g S}=7.73\mbox{ g silver sulfide}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Notice that Example 12 was worked a different way: First the total masses
of all reactants and products were written under the balanced chemical
equation, and then the ratios of these masses were worked out to find the
desired answers. The problem can also be solved using moles, and the choice
is one of convenience.

{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;
|'''Alternative Solution'''
First we find the number of moles of silver and sulfur:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{10.00\mbox{ g Ag}}{107.9\mbox{ g/mole}}=0.0927\mbox{ mole Ag}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{1.00\mbox{ g S}}{32.06\mbox{ g/mole}}=0.0312\mbox{ mole S}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Since 2 moles of silver are required for every mole of sulfur, and there are more than twice as many moles of silver as moles of sulfur, some of the silver must be left behind when all of the sulfur has been used.  The 0.0312 mole of sulfur will combine with 0.0624 mole of silver, adn form 0.0312 mole of Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S. Left behind are 0.0927 - 0.0624 = 0.0303 mole of silver.  Translating these quantities back to grams, we have&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;0.0303\mbox{ mole Ag}\times107.9\mbox{ g/mole}=3.27\mbox{ g Ag left over}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;0.0312\mbox{ mole Ag}_2\mbox{S}\times247.8\mbox{ g/mole}=7.73\mbox{ g Ag}_2\mbox{S produced}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We arrived at the same answers in the first solution to the example. The mole method is surer, but slower. The ratio method is faster, but you can go astray more easily if you are not absolutely sure of what you are doing. Use the mole method until you are proficient in chemical calculations.

== Solutions as Chemical Reagents ==
Liquid solutions are convenient media for chemical reactions. Rapid
mixing of the liquid means that potential reactants are brought close to one
another frequently, so collisions and chemical reactions can take place much
faster than they would in a crystalline solid. Moreover, a given number of
molecules in a liquid is confined to a smaller space than the same number of
molecules in a gas, so reactant molecules in a liquid have more of a chance
to come in contact. Water is an especially good solvent for chemical reactions
because its molecules are polar. The H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O molecules, and the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;
ions into which water dissociates to a small extent, can help to polarize
bonds in other molecules, weaken bonds, and encourage chemical attack.
It is no accident that life evolved in the oceans rather than in the upper
atmosphere or on dry land. If life had been forced to evolve using solid-state
crystal reactions, the 4.5 billion years of earth's history to date might barely
have been time enough for the process to begin.

=== Concentration Units: Molarity and Molality ===
In solutions involving a liquid and a gas or solid, the liquid component is
called the solvent, and the other component is called the solute. If the solution 
is made up of two liquids, the distinction is less clear, but the substance
present in the greater amount is usually considered as the solvent. The most
common way of expressing concentration in solution is molarity, or the
number of moles of solute ''per liter of solution''.
&lt;ref&gt;The SI unit of length is the meter (m), divided into 10 decimeters (dm) or 100 centimeters (cm). The unit of volume is the cubic meter (m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). For laboratory work the cubic meter is too large to be convenient, so it is customary to use the liter, which in the SI is defined as 1 dm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, and the milliliter (mL), which equals 1 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (or sometimes cc). By strict logic the liter is an extraneous unit in SI, but it is too convenient, and its use too deeply ingrained, to be eliminated. Scientists in the past tended to use milliliters for liquid volumes, and cubic centimeters for volumes of solids. Hence the volume of a sodium chloride solution would be measured in milliliters, but the density of rock salt (sodium chloride crystals) would be reported in grams per cubic centimeter, or g cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;. We shall use only milliters in this chapter, but thereafter shall feel free to use cubic centimeters wherever that unit seems more natural. Remember that 1 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 1000 liters, 1 liter = 1000 mL, and 1 mL = 1 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. For more information on SI, see Appendix 1.&lt;/ref&gt;
The symbol M is read as &quot;moles per liter of solution,&quot; as in 1.5''M'' NaCl. The symbol ''c'' is used to denote concentration  in moles per liter, as is the chemical symbol in brackets [H], although such brackets are sometimes used to represent concentration in any units. Hence the expression ''c''&lt;sub&gt;NaC1&lt;/sub&gt; would be read as &quot;the concentration of sodium chloride in moles per liter of solution.&quot; This is ''not'' the solution that would result from adding 1 mole of NaCl to a liter of water, since the total volume after mixing would be a little more than 1 liter. Sodium and chloride ions take up room, even when dissolved in water. The proper procedure in making a 1.0''M'' solution would be to dissolve the salt in less than a liter of water, and then slowly add more water, with mixing, until the total volume reached 1.00 liter.

For many salts, we can use the approximation that volumes are additive,
or that the volume of a solution will be equal to the original volume of the
solvent plus that of the crystals that were dissolved.

{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;
|+'''Example 13'''
|-
|If 264 g of ammonium sulfate, (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, are dissolved in 1.000 liter of water, what will the approximate final volume and the approximate molarity of the solution be, assuming additivity of volumes? The density of crystalline (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is 1.76 g ml&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.
|-
|'''Solution'''
The volume of solid ammonium sulfate added is&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{264\mbox{ g}}{1.76\mbox{ g/mL}}=150\mbox{ mL or 0.150 L}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The final solution volume then will be 1.000 + 0.150 = 1.150 liters. The
number of moles of solute is
&lt;math&gt;\frac{264\mbox{ g}}{132\mbox{ g/mole}}=2.00\mbox{ moles ammonium sulfate}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The molarity of ammonium sulfate then is
&lt;math&gt;\frac{2.00\mbox{ moles}}{1.15\mbox{ liters}}=1.74\mbox{ moles/liter or 1.74}M&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
|}

The approximation of additivity of volumes must be used with care. In this
example, the true molarity of such a solution is 1.80''M'', so the approximation
is only 3.3% in error. But for liquids whose molecules interact strongly,
such as ethyl alcohol and water, the total volume may shrink after mixing
because of molecular attractions. Additivity of volumes should be used only
as a rough guide to molarity.

An alternative expression of concentration, molality, is based on the
amount of solvent used rather than the solution that results. The molality
of a solute is the number of moles of solute in 1 kg of solvent (not of solution).
The density of water is 1.00 g mL&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, so 1 kg of water occupies a volume of
1 liter. Hence the ammonium sulfate solution of Example 13 is a 2.00 molal
solution, since it was made up from 2.00 moles of solute in a kilogram
(1 liter) of water. For solvents other than water, we must use the density of
the liquid to convert from kilograms to liters.

{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;
|+'''Example 14'''
|-
|Suppose 5.00 g of acetic acid, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, are dissolved in 1 liter of ethanol.
Calculate the molality of the resulting solution. The density of ethanol is
0.789 g mL&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Can you calculate the molarity from the information given?
|-
|'''Solution'''
The molecular weight of acetic acid is 60.05 g mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, so the number of moles is&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{5.00\mbox{ g}}{60.05\mbox{ g/mole}}=0.0833\mbox{ mole acetic acid}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The number of kilograms of solvent used is&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;1.00 \mbox{ liter}\times0.789\mbox{ kg/liter}=0.789\mbox{ kg ethanol}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Notice that 1 g mL&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; is the same as 1 kg liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, since there are 1000 g in a kilogram and 1000 mL in a liter.  The molality then is&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\frac{0.0833\mbox{ mole solute}}{0.789\mbox{ kg solvent}}=0.106\mbox{ mole/kg}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
The solution is therefore 0.106 molal.  The molarity of the solution cannot be calculated because we know neither the volume of the acetic acid nor whether volumes are additive when acetic acid is dissolved in ethanol.
|}

The symbol ''m'' is used for concentration expressed as molality. We would
write the results of Example 14 as
:''m''&lt;sub&gt;acetic acid&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.106 mole kg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

=== Dilution Problems ===
If we '''dilute''' a solution (add more solvent), the number of moles of solute
does not change. If ''c'' is the molarity (not molality) of the solution and ''V'' is the
volume in liters, then the number of moles of solute is

:''c'' (moles liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;) X ''V''(liters) = ''cV''(moles)

If we use the subscript 1 to represent a solution before it is diluted with more
solvent, and the subscript 2 for the diluted solution, then

:Moles of solute = ''c&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt; V&lt;sub&gt;l&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''c&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''

{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;

|-
|To what volume must 5.00 mL of 6.00''M'' HCl be diluted to make the concentration 0.100''M''?

&lt;math&gt;V_2=\frac{c_1}{c_2}\times V_1=\frac{6.00M}{0.100M}\times 5.00\mbox{ mL}=300\mbox{ mL}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
This does not mean that 300 mL of water must be added, but that the total volume of solution must be brought up to 300 mL

===Acid-Base Neutralization===
Probably the most familiar definition of acids and bases is that by the
Swedish physicist and chemist Svante Arrhenius (1859-1927): An acid is a
substance that increases the hydrogen ion concentration, [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;], when added
to water, and a base is a substance that increases the hydroxide ion concentration, [OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;], when added to water. Some of the more common acids
and bases are listed in Tables 2-1 and 2-2. The first 11 acids in Table 2-1,
from HF to HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, dissociate in aqueous solution to release one proton or
hydrogen ion:
:{|border=0

The abbreviation (aq) is a reminder that the ions are hydrated, but it is
really not necessary since every ion in aqueous solution is hydrated, and we
shall omit it in the rest of this discussion. Remember that the water molecules
are always present, surrounding each ion and helping to stabilize it in
solution.
Carbonic, sulfurous, and sulfuric acids release two protons in two
stages, and the three phosphorus-containing acids produce three protons:
:{| border=0

|phosphoric acid
|}

Carbonic acid is classed as a weak acid because its loss of protons is only
partial; the species present in aqueous solution are a mixture of carbonate
and bicarbonate ions and a small amount of undissociated carbonic acid.
In contrast, sulfuric acid is a strong acid because the loss of the first of the
two H+ is complete in aqueous solution. (Acid-dissociation equilibria are
considered in detail in Chapter 5.) Nitric and hydrochloric acids are common
strong acids, and phosphoric acid is weak. Organic acids such as formic and
acetic release a proton from their —COOH carboxyl groups:
:{|border=0
|CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH||→|| CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|acetic acid|| ||acetate ion
|}
It is common to use the abbreviation HOAc for acetic acid and OAC&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; for the acetate ion.

Hydroxide bases such as sodium hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide dissolve in water to release hydroxide ions:
:{|border=0
|align=right|NaOH → ||Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|align=right|Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → ||Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;
|}
The hydroxide ions are already present in solid NaOH, just as chloride
ions are present in NaCl. Ammonia, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is also a base, but it has no
hydroxide ions of its own. Instead, it produces them by reacting with water
molecules:
:{|border=0
|- align=center
|NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;||+ H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → ||NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;|| + ||OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;
|- align=center
|valign=top|ammonia|| ||ammonium&lt;br&gt;ion|| ||hydroxide&lt;br&gt;ion
|}

Ammonia is sometimes written as ammonium hydroxide, NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;OH, to make
it resemble the metal hydroxide bases (such as sodium hydroxide, NaOH).
But this is incorrect; there is no such substance as ammonium hydroxide;
there is only ammonia.

Acids and bases are useful because the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ions that they
produce can attack molecules in solution and bring about chemical changes
that would be difficult or slow in their absence. When acids and bases react
with one another, the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ions combine to form water molecules.
This is called '''neutralization''':
:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
The easiest way to determine how much of an acid or base is present is to
find out how much of a base or acid of known concentration is required to
neutralize it completely. This is the process of acid-base titration. One
'''equivalent''' (equiv) of an acid is the quantity of acid that will release 1 mole
of protons or H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in neutralizing a base, and 1 equiv of a base is the quantity
that will produce 1 mole of OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ions. Complete neutralization occurs when
the same number of equivalents of acid and base react with one another. For
acids that release one proton per molecule, such as HCl and HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, the
equivalent is the same as the mole, and 1 equivalent weight is the same as
the molecular weight. But since H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is capable of releasing two H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, 1 mole of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; corresponds to 2 equiv, and the equivalent weight of sulfuric acid in acid-base neutralizations is half the molecular weight. The equivalent weight of phosphoric acid, H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, or the quantity that will produce 1 mole of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, is one-third the molecular weight. Similarly, the
mole and the equivalent are identical for NaOH, KOH, and NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, but the
equivalent weight of Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is half its molecular weight.
We can appreciate the usefulness of the concept of equivalents by
looking at the neutralization of phosphoric acid by magnesium hydroxide:
:{|border=0
|- align=center valign=top
| ||2 H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;||+||3 Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;|| → ||Mg&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;(PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;||+||6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
|- align=center
|align=right|Molecular weight:||98.0 g|| ||58.3 g|| ||262.9 g|| ||18.0 g
|- align=center
|align=right|Equivalent weight:||32.7 g|| ||29.2 g
|}
One mole or 98.0 g of phosphoric acid will not neutralize 1 mole or 58.3 g
of magnesium hydroxide, but 1 equiv or 32.7 g of phosphoric acid will
neutralize 1 equiv or 29.2 g of magnesium hydroxide. This is the same
answer that would be obtained by using the balanced equation shown.
Since 2 moles of acid react with 3 moles of base as shown, 2 X 98.0 = 196 g
of phosphoric acid will neutralize 3 X 58.3 = 175 g of magnesium hydroxide. 
These numbers are just the numbers obtained by using equivalents,
but scaled up by a factor of 6.

|Use equivalents to find the number of grams of nitric acid, HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, needed to neutralize 100.0 g of barium hydroxide, Ba(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.
|-
|'''Solution'''
The molecular weight of HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is 63.01 g mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;; of Ba(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 171.34 g mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. The corresponding equivalent weights are 63.01/1 = 63.01 g equiv&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and 171.34/2 = 85.67 g equiv&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for Ba(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The number of equivalents of barium hydroxide is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{100.0\mbox{ g}}{85.67\mbox{g/equiv}} = 1.167\mbox{ equiv of Ba(OH)}_2&lt;/math&gt;
The same number of equivalents of nitric acid is needed:
:&lt;math&gt;1.167\mbox{ equiv}\times63.01\mbox{g/equiv}=73.53\mbox{ g nitric acid}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|'''Alternative Solution'''
This example could also be solved by using the balanced chemical equation:
:2 HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + Ba(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → Ba(NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
The number of moles of barium hydroxide at the start is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{100.0\mbox{ g}}{171.3\mbox{g/mole}}=0.5838\mbox{ mole Ba(OH)}_2&lt;/math&gt;
The balanced equation tells us that twice as many moles of nitric acid are required: 1.167 moles HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. In grams, this is
:&lt;math&gt;1.167\mbox{ moles}\times63.01\mbox{ g/mole}=73.53\mbox{ g nitric acid}&lt;/math&gt;
The use of equivalents eliminates the need to work out a balanced equation for the reaction.

The normality of a solution, represented by ''N'' is the number of
equivalents of solute per liter of solution. A 1.00 ''M'' solution of phosphoric
acid is 3.00''N'', and a 0.010''M'' solution of Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is 0.020''N''.

Since the molecular weight of NaOH is 40.0 g mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{4.00\mbox{ g}}{40.0\mbox{ g/mole}}=0.010\mbox{ mole NaOH}&lt;/math&gt;

Because 1 mole of NaOH releases 1 mole of OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ions, the molarity and normality are the same. The solution is 0.200''N''.

=== Acid-Base Titration ===

[[Image:ChemicalPrinciplesFig2-3.jpg|frame|right|'''Figure 2-3.''' An acid—base titration. The solution in the flask contains an unknown number of equivalents of base (or acid). The burette is calibrated to show volume to the nearest 0.001 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. It is filled with a solution of strong acid (or base) of known concentration. Small increments are added from the burette until, at the end point, one drop or less changes the indicator color permanently. (An indication that the equivalence point is being approached is the appearance — and disappearance on stirring — of the color that the indicator assumes beyond neutralization.) At the equivalence point, the total amount of acid (or base) is recorded from the burette readings. The number of equivalents of acid and base must be equal at the equivalence point.]]

Chemists frequently use '''titrations''' to compare relative concentrations of
chemical equivalents in acid—base solutions (Figure 2-3). When enough
acid solution from a burette (shown in the figure) has been added to neutralize the base in the sample being analyzed, the number of equivalents of acid
and base involved must be the same. The point of neutralization is called
the equivalence point. An acid—base indicator such as litmus or Phenolphthalein can be used to determine the equivalence point. From the volume of acid solution used and its normality, we can calculate the number of equivalents of base in the unknown sample. If ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and ''N''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; are the normalities of acid and base solutions, and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; are the volumes of each at
neutrality, then
       Number of equivalents = ''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;''V''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; = ''N''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;''V''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;             (2-7)

the two solutions? What is the ratio of molarities?
|-
|'''Solution'''
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{N_A}{N_B}=\frac{V_B}{V_A}=0.102\mbox{ mole sulfuric acid}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{0.102\mbox{ mole}}{0.750\mbox{ liter}}=0.136M\mbox{ sulfuric acid}&lt;/math&gt;
Since each mole of sulfuric acid contributes 2 equiv, the solution is
:&lt;math&gt;2\times0.136M=0.272N\mbox{ H}_2\mbox{SO}_4&lt;/math&gt;
Since the normality of the acid is three times its molarity, and the normality of the base is the same as its molarity, the molarity ratio is
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{c_A}{c_B}=\frac{N_A/3}{N_B}=0.403&lt;/math&gt;

== Heats of Reaction==
So far this chapter has been devoted to the consequences of the conservation
of mass, and little has been said about energy. But the principle that heats
of reaction are additive, that energy is conserved in a process whether the
process is carried out in one step or in several, is an important one. Heat and
work are both forms of energy, and are measured in the same units. If you
do work on an object or collection of objects, you can increase the energy
or make the system heat up, depending on how the work is done. Lifting a
heavy object is a conversion of work to potential energy, and friction is a
conversion of work to heat. Conversely, energy can be reconverted to work
when a heavy object falls, and heat is converted to work in an automobile
engine. Of these three — heat, work, and energy — the chemist usually is more
concerned with heat: the heat that may be absorbed or given off when a
chemical reaction takes place.

By Newton's laws of motion, the force on an object is the product of its
mass and acceleration:
:{|border=0
|Force||=||mass||×||acceleration
|- align=center
|''F''||=||''m''||×||''a''
|}

The force that must be applied to a 1.00 kg mass to give it an acceleration of
1 meter per second per second (1 m s&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;) is defined as a force of 1 newton
(N). Hence 1 N = 1 kg m s&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;. (SI units are based on length in meters and
mass in kilograms.)

{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;
|+'''Example 23'''
|-
|When a pitcher whips a 5.00 ounce (oz) baseball around an arc 5.00 m in circumference in order to accelerate it from zero to 90 miles hr&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, what average acceleration does he give to the ball during the pitch, and what average force does he exert on it during his windup?
|-
|'''Solution'''
Assume uniform acceleration on the ball from the time the windup begins until the ball leaves the pitcher's hand. For uniform acceleration from rest, ''v = at'' and ''s = at&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'', where ''v'' is velocity, ''a'' is acceleration, ''t'' is time, and ''s'' is distance.  Eliminating time from the two expressions yields ''a'' = ''v''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/2''s''. If ''v'' = 40.2 m s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (90 mph) and ''s'' = 5.00 m, then
:&lt;math&gt;a=\frac{40.2^2}{2\times5.00}=162\mbox{ m s}^{-2}&lt;/math&gt;
Since the mass (''m'') is 0.142 kg (5.00 oz), the average force applied to the ball during the swing is
:&lt;math&gt;F=m\times a=0.142\times162\mbox{ kg m s}^{-2}=23.0N&lt;/math&gt;
|}

The work done when 1 N of force is exerted on an object for a distance of
1 m is defined as 1 '''joule''' (J). Hence 1 J = 1 N m = 1 kg m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; s&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;. For a thrown object, all the work is converted into kinetic energy (energy of
motion); in other circumstances, part or all the work can end as heat.

{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;
|+'''Example 24'''
|-
|How much work is done on the baseball in the pitch described in Example 23? How much kinetic energy does the ball have as it leaves the pitcher's hand? 
|-
|'''Solution'''
The work done on the baseball is
:&lt;math&gt;W=F\times s=23.0\mbox{ N} \times 5.00\mbox{ m}=115\mbox{ N m} = 115\mbox{ J}&lt;/math&gt;
The ball ends with a kinetic energy of 115 J.
|}

As a check on these results, we can calculate the kinetic energy directly:
:&lt;math&gt;E = \tfrac{1}{2} mv^2 = \tfrac{1}{2}\times0.142\times(40.2)^2\mbox{ kg m}^2\mbox{s}^{-2}=115\mbox{ J}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''E'' is energy.
The advantage of the joule as a unit of heat is that it makes immediately
apparent the connection between heat, work, and energy. An older unit of
energy that arose from heat measurements is the '''calorie'''. One calorie (cal)
is defined as the quantity of heat required to raise the temperature of 1 g of
pure water by 1°C (from 14.5°C to 15.5°C, to be exact). This definition had
no obvious connection with work, and in fact the calorie was defined in the
nineteenth century, before anyone realized that heat and work were alternative forms of the same thing: energy. We will use only joules in this book, but
you should be aware of calories since most of the preexisting literature uses
that unit. The calorie is approximately four times as big as a joule: '''1 cal = 4.184 J'''. Heats of reaction of mole quantities of substances are typically in the range of kilojoules (kJ) or kilocalories (kcal), where 1 kJ = 1000 J and 1 kcal = 1000 cal.

As an illustration of heats of reaction and the principle of additivity of
heat, let us look at the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. When an aqueous solution of hydrogen peroxide reacts to form oxygen gas and liquid
water, heat is given off. The amount of heat will vary somewhat with the
temperature at which the reaction occurs, but at 25°C, the commonly accepted standard &quot;room temperature&quot; for measuring and tabulating heats of reaction, each mole of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that decomposes produces 94.7 kJ of heat. (If this energy could be used with perfect efficiency, it would be enough
to accelerate 823 baseballs as described in Example 24.)

[[Image:ChemicalPrinciplesFig2-4.jpg|frame|right|A schematic representation of a bomb calorimeter used for the measurement of heats of combustion. The weighed sample is placed in a crucible, which in turn is placed in the bomb. The sample is burned completely in oxygen under pressure. The sample is ignited by an iron wire ignition coll that glows when heated. The calorimeter is filled with fluid, usually water, and insulated by means of a jacket. The temperature of the water is measured with the thermometer. From the change in temperature, the heat of reaction can be calculated.]]
The heat involved in a chemical reaction carried out at constant pressure (or at least with the final pressure brought back to the starting value) is known as the change in the '''enthalpy''' of the reacting system, &amp;Delta;''H'' (read as &quot;delta H&quot;). As we shall see in Chapter 15, the '''energy''' change, &amp;Delta;''E'', corresponds to the heat of the reaction if the reaction is carried out at constant volume, as in the bomb calorimeter shown in Figure 2-4. Enthalpy can be regarded as a &quot;corrected&quot; energy, the correction being for any work that
the chemicals might do in pushing against the atmosphere if they expand.
The difference between &amp;Delta;''E'' and &amp;Delta;''H'' is small but significant, but it is not
important to us now. If heat is given off during the reaction, then the
enthalpy of the reacting system of chemical falls; &amp;Delta;''H'', the change in enthalpy,
is negative. Such a reaction is called '''exothermic'''. In an '''endothermic''' reaction heat is absorbed and the enthalpy of the reaction mixture rises. For the hydrogen peroxide reaction, we can write
       H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''(aq)'' → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O''(l)'' + 1/2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;    &amp;Delta;''H'' = -94.7 kJ    (2-8)
This heat is released when 1 mole of hydrogen peroxide decomposes to
1 mole of water and 1/2 mole of oxygen gas, or for 1 mole of the reaction as
just written. If all the coefficients of the reaction are doubled, then the heat
of reaction must be doubled also, since it then refers to twice as much
reaction:
       2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''(aq)'' → 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O''(l)'' + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;    &amp;Delta;''H'' = -189.4 kJ   (2-9)
&quot;One mole of the reaction as written&quot; now means 2 moles of hydrogen
peroxide decomposing to 2 moles of water and 1 mole of oxygen, because
the coefficients in the equation have all been doubled.
The heat of a reaction also depends on the physical state of the reactants and products. If hydrogen peroxide were to decompose to give oxygen gas and water vapor instead of liquid, part of the 94.7 kJ would be
diverted to evaporating H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O:
       H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O''(l)'' → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O''(g)'' &amp;Delta;''H''= +44.0 kJ           (2-10)
and less heat would be given off by decomposition of peroxide:
       H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''(aq)'' → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O''(g)'' + 1/2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''(g)''     &amp;Delta;''H''= -50.7 kJ       (2-11)
An important assumption is hidden here: that heats of reaction are additive
(Figure 2-5). Equation 2-9 plus equation 2-10 gives equation 2-11, and so we
have assumed that the heat of the third reaction will be the sum of the first
two:
:&amp;Delta;''H''= -94.7 + 44.0 kJ = -50.7 kJ
[[Image:ChemicalPrinciplesFig2-5.jpg|frame|right|The change in enthalpy for the reaction&lt;br&gt;
H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''(aq)'' → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O''(g)'' + 1/2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''(g)'' can be obtained
without actually measuring the enthalpy change for the reaction by adding &amp;Delta;''H'' for the two
reactions&lt;br&gt;
H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''(aq)'' → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O''(l)'' + 1/2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''(g)''  &amp;Delta;''H'' = -94.7 kJ/mol&lt;br&gt;
H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O''(l)'' → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O''(g)''  &amp;Delta;''H'' = +44.0 kJ/mol
]]The additivity of reaction heats follows directly from the first law of thermodynamics (Chapter 15): The change in energy or enthalpy between two
states depends only on the nature of those states, and not on how the change
is carried out. A collection of chemicals in a given state has a certain energy
and a certain enthalpy, neither of which depends in any way on how the
chemicals were brought to that state. (That is, the past history of the chemicals can affect their present energy and enthalpy, but we do not need to know
that history to measure the values of ''E'' and ''H''.) Hence the difference between
enthalpies of reactants and products, or the heat of reaction, can depend
only on the nature of the starting and ending states, and not on the particular way that the reaction is carried out. This is sometimes called Hess' '''law of heat summation''', which 
is a rather dignified name for a natural consequence of the first law of thermodynamics.

The additivity of heats of reaction makes a great amount of experimentation in thermochemistry (the chemistry of heat and energy) unnecessary. We need not measure and tabulate the enthalpy change of every conceivable chemical reaction. For example, if we know the heat of vaporization of liquid water (equation 2-10) and the heat of decomposition of
hydrogen peroxide to liquid water (equation 2-9), then we never need to measure the heat of decomposition of hydrogen peroxide to water vapor; the answer can be calculated ahead of time. If a certain reaction is inconvenient to carry out, there may be a set of easier reactions whose sum is the reaction in question. After we have carried out the individual experiments, we can add the enthalpy changes in the same way as the chemical equations,
to find the heat of the difficult-to-measure reaction.

Suppose that someone proposed a scheme for making diamonds by
oxidizing methane:
:CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;''(g)'' + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''(g)'' → C&lt;sub&gt;(di)&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O''(l)''
[The notation ''(s)'' is not sufficient for carbon, since diamond ''(di)'' must be
differentiated from graphite ''(gr)''.] You would like to find whether the
reaction will liberate heat that must be allowed for in the design of the
reaction vessel. This particular synthesis has never been carried out (and
probably never will be), yet you can give your misguided friend his answer
from a knowledge of the heats of easier reactions. The '''heat of combustion'''
of a substance containing C, N, O, and H is the heat, per mole of substance,
of the reaction with enough oxygen to produce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and liquid H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Heats of combustion are easy to measure, and were among the first reaction
heats to be measured and tabulated systematically. Extensive tables of heats of combustion can be found in books such as the CRC Handbook of Chemistry
and Physics or Lange's Handbook of Chemistry. The heats of combustion of
methane and diamond are
       CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;''(g)'' + 2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) → CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''(g)'' + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O''(l)''   &amp;Delta;''H'' = -890 kJ/mol    (2-12)
         C''(di)'' + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''(g)'' → CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''(g)''               &amp;Delta;''H'' = -395 kJ/mol    (2-13)

The desired diamond-synthesizing reaction is produced by subtracting
the second reaction from the first, or by adding the first reaction to the
reverse of the second, and the heat of reaction is found in the same way:
       CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;''(g)'' + 2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) → CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''(g)'' + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O''(l)''   &amp;Delta;''H'' = -890 kJ/mol    (2-12)
                 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''(g)'' → C''(di)'' + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''(g)''       &amp;Delta;''H'' = +395 kJ/mol    (2-14)
       &lt;s&gt;                                    &lt;/s&gt;   &lt;s&gt;                &lt;/s&gt;
         CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;''(g)'' + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(g) → C''(di)'' + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O''(l)''    &amp;Delta;''H'' = -495 kJ/mol    (2-15)
Notice that when a reaction is turned around and run in reverse, the heat of reaction changes sign, since a process that gave off 395 kJ in one direction must absorb 395 kJ in reverse.

===Heats of Formation===
Because of the additivity of heats of reaction, not all heats have to be tabulated — only those for the minimum set of reactions from which all others can be obtained. The set that has been agreed upon by scientists and engineers is made up of the heats of formation of compounds from their pure elements in standard states. For solids and liquids this standard state is the most common form of the element at 25 °C or 298 K and 1 atmosphere (atm)&lt;ref&gt;The conversion to the absolute or Kelvin temperature scale is considered in Chapter 3,
as is the atmosphere as a unit of pressure. (By SI convention, no degree sign is used for
the Kelvin scale.)&lt;/ref&gt; external pressure; gases are defined similarly but at 1 atm partial pressure.&lt;ref&gt;The partial pressure of a gas in a mixture is the pressure that the gas would show if all the
other gases were removed and it were the only gas present.&lt;/ref&gt; The standard state for thermodynamic measurements involving carbon is graphite ''(gr)'', not diamond ''(di)''. The heats of formation for all the compounds involved in the diamond synthesis are
       C''(gr)'' + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''(g)'' → CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;''(g)''     &amp;Delta;''H'' =  -74.8 kJ/mol          (2-16)
                 C''(gr)'' → C''(di)''&lt;sub&gt; &lt;/sub&gt;     &amp;Delta;''H'' =   +1.9 kJ/mol          (2-17)
     H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''(g)'' + 1/2 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''(g)'' → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O''(l)''     &amp;Delta;''H'' = -285.8 kJ/mol          (2-18)
A table of standard heats of formation of compounds from their pure elements is given in Appendix 3. In that table, the subscript 298 refers to the temperature (298 K), and the zero superscript signifies that reactants and
products are all in their standard states. To illustrate how heats of general reactions are found from heats of
formation, let us look again at the diamond synthesis, equation 2-15. That reaction can be obtained by adding equation 2-17 to twice equation 2-18 and the reverse of equation 2-16:
                C''(gr)'' → C''(di)'' &lt;sub&gt; &lt;/sub&gt;               &amp;Delta;''H'' =   +1.9 kJ        (2-17)
       2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''(g)'' + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''(g)'' → 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O''(l)''             &amp;Delta;''H'' = -571.6 kJ      2x(2-18)
                CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;''(g)'' → C''(gr)'' + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''(g)''      &amp;Delta;''H'' =  +74.8 kJ       -(2-16)
       &lt;s&gt;                                 &lt;/s&gt;      &lt;s&gt;               &lt;/s&gt;
       CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;''(g)'' + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''(g)'' → C''(di)'' + 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O''(l)''      &amp;Delta;''H'' = -494.9 kJ        (2-15)
The heat of reaction is found in exactly the same manner:
:&amp;Delta;''H'' = (+1.9) + 2(-285.8) - (-74.8) = -494.9 kJ
As you can see, the consequences of not keeping track of signs and coefficients can be disastrous. The surest method is to write out each equation, with its heat of reaction, in such a way that the sum of the individual equations will
be the desired reaction. If all the coefficients of an equation are multiplied by an arbitrary number n, then the heat of formation must also be multiplied by n, and if a formation equation is turned around and run in reverse, then
the sign &amp;Delta;''H'' must be changed. If the individual equations add to give the desired reaction, then the individual heats add to give the corresponding overall heat of reaction.

A convenient shortcut is to think of the heat of formation of a compound as if it were, in a sense, the enthalpy of the compound itself. (Warning: This is possible only because the heats of formation of the elements are zero by definition.) Then the heat of a reaction becomes the sum of heats of formation of all the products, minus the heats of formation of all the
reactants, each being multiplied by the coefficient of that substance in the balanced equation.

|+'''Example 25'''
|-
|What is the standard heat of the reaction by which ferric oxide is reduced by carbon to iron and carbon monoxide in a blast furnace?
|-
|'''Solution'''
The reaction is as follows, with the standard heat of formation per mole written below each compound:
{|border=0
|- valign=top
| ||Fe&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''(s)''||+|| 3 C(gr)|| → ||2 Fe(s)||+||3 CO(g)
|- align=center
|&amp;Delta;''H'' (kJ/mole) ||-822.1|| ||0.0|| ||0.0|| ||-110.5
|}
The standard heat of formation of the elements from themselves, of course is zero, by definition. For the reaction as written,
:&amp;Delta;''H'' = 2(0.0) + 3(-110.5) - (-822.1) - 3(0.0) = +490.6 kJ
|}

These results are consistent with the fact that much heat must be supplied to reduce iron ore to iron. Note, however, that 490.6 kJ is the net heat that would be absorbed if the reaction were run at 298 K, not the 1800 K of a blast furnace. Yet this calculated figure is also the heat absorbed if ferric oxide and carbon are heated from 298 K to 1800 K, allowed to react, and the products are cooled again to room temperature. The enthalpy change or heat of a reaction depends only on the initial and final states of the participants, and not on whether the temperature remained constant or went to blast-furnace levels in between. All that matters is that the temperature is brought back down to 298 K at the end. 

As another example of the principle, the net heat evolved when water is made from hydrogen and oxygen will be the same whether a mixture of H2 and 02 at 298 K explodes violently and the resulting water is cooled back to 298 K, or whether the same mixture reacts slowly in the presence of finely divided platinum as a catalyst, never increasing its temperature.
So, in referring to heats of reaction, when we say that the values are correct for the process carried out &quot;at 1 atm pressure and 298 K,&quot; we require only that the reactants begin at these conditions, and that the products end there. This is why tables of heats of formation under standard conditions (Appendix 3) are useful.

''Scientific research consists in seeing what''&lt;br&gt;
''everyone else has seen, but thinking what''&lt;br&gt;
''no one else has thought.''&lt;br&gt;

'''A. Szent-Gyorgyi (b. 1893)'''


==Introduction==

The word ''gas'' comes from ''gaos'', a Dutch form of the word ''chaos''. Gases
were the last substances to be understood chemically. Solids and
liquids were easy to identify and differentiate, but the idea of different
kinds of &quot;ayres&quot; came only slowly. Carbon dioxide was not prepared
from limestone until 1756. Hydrogen was discovered in 1766; nitrogen, in
1772; and oxygen, in 1781. Although gases were late in being identified,
they were the first substances whose physical properties could be explained
in terms of simple laws. It is fortunate that when matter in this most elusive
state is subjected to changes in temperature and pressure, it behaves according
to rules much simpler than those that solids and liquids follow.
Moreover, one of the best tests of the atomic theory is its ability to account
for the behavior of gases. This is the story of the present chapter.

Given any trapped sample of gas, we can measure its mass, its volume,
its pressure against the walls of a container, its viscosity, its temperature,
and its rate of conducting heat and sound. We can also measure the rate at
which it effuses through an orifice into another container, and the rate at
which it diffuses through another gas. In this chapter we shall show that
these properties are not independent of one another, that they can all be
related by a simple theory which assumes that gases consist of moving and
colliding particles.

==Avogadro's Law==

One of the most important hypotheses in the development of atomic theory
was made by Amedeo Avogadro (1776-1856) in 1811. He proposed that
equal volumes of all gases, at a specified temperature and pressure, contain
equal numbers of molecules. This means that the density of a gas-its
weight per unit volume-in grams per milliliter must be proportional to
the molecular weight of the gas. If Avogadro's ideas had not been ignored
for another 50 years, the process of arriving at a dependable set of atomic
weights for the elements would have taken much less time. (The entire
story is told in Chapter 6.) It was a belated tribute to an unjustly ignored
scientist to call the number of molecules per mole '''Avogadro's number'''.

If we accept Avogadro's principle, then the number of molecules, ''n'',
and also the number of moles, is proportional to V, the volume of the gas:
::''n'' = number of moles = ''kV''       (at constant ''P'' and ''T'').

In this equation, ''k'' is a proportionality constant; it changes with temperature
and pressure. We shall be looking for other such relationships for gases -relationships
connecting the pressure, ''P'', the volume, ''V'', the temperature, ''T'',
and the number of moles in a sample, ''n''.

==The Pressure of Gas==

[[Image:Chemical Principles Fig 3.1.png|frame| '''Figure 3-1''' Measuring gas pressure . (a) Torricellian barometer . When a mercury-filled tube is
inverted in a dish of mercury. the level in the tube falls, thereby leaving a vacuum at the
top of the tube . Only a trace of mercury vapor is present in the space at the top. The
height of the column is determined by the pressure of the atmosphere on the mercury
in the reservoir. (b) In a gas-handling system, pressure P (in millimeters of Hg) is determined
by measuring the difference in heights of the two mercury columns of a
manometer. If the system is evacuated completely. the levels are equal.]]

If a glass tube, closed at one end, is filled with mercury (Hg), and the open
end is inverted in a pool of mercury as in Figure 3-1a, the level of mercury in
the tube will fall until the mercury column stands about 760 millimeters
(mm) above the surface of the pool. The pressure produced at the pool
surface by the weight of the mercury column is balanced exactly by the
pressure of the surrounding atmosphere. Because there is a balance of
opposing pressures, more mercury will not flow into or out of the tube. A
device such as this (called a ''barometer'') can measure atmospheric pressure, as
Italian mathematician and physicist Evangelista Torricelli (1608-1647)
first realized. He showed that it was the ''pressure'' at the bottom of the mercury
column that mattered, and not the total weight of mercury; thus, the height
of mercury in a barometer tube is independent of the size or shape of the
tube. Atmospheric pressure at sea level supports a column of mercury
760 mm high. Because mercury columns were used so often in early pressure
experiments, the &quot;millimeter of mercury&quot; became a common unit of pressure.
Pressure is force per unit area (P = F / A), and the SI unit of pressure is
the pascal (Pa), defined as 1 newton per square meter (N m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;). (The newton,
as you may recall from Chapter 2, is the force that will impart an acceleration
of 1 m sec&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; to a 1-kg mass; 1 N = 1 kg m sec&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; .)

{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;
|+'''Example 1'''
|-
|The density of liquid mercury is 13.596 g cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;. How would you express a pressure of 1 mm Hg in pascals?
|-
|'''Solution'''
Imagine a sheet of mercury 1 m square and 1 mm thick. Converting first to
centimeters for convenience) we would find its volume to be
::0.100 cm X 100 cm X 100 cm = 1000 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
and its mass to be
::1000 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; X 13.596 g cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; = 13,596 g or 13.596 kg
Since force is equal to mass times acceleration, and the acceleration of
gravity at sea level, g, is 9.806 m sec&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;, the force exerted by the mercury on
its supporting table would be
::F = mg
::F = 13.596 kg X 9.806 m sec&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; = 133.32 kg m sec&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;, or 133.32 N
Since the area of the sheet is I m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the pressure on the table would be
::P = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{F}{A}&lt;/math&gt;

::P = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{133.32 N}{1 m^2}&lt;/math&gt; = 133.32 N m&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; = 133.32 pascals (Pa)
|}
 
{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;
|+'''Example 2'''
|-
|Standard sea level pressure is exactly 760 mm Hg. Express this in pascals.
|-
|'''Solution'''
From Example I , we know that a pressure of I mm Hg is equal to 133.3 Pa.
Therefore,
::760 mm Hg X 133.32 Pa mm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; = 101,323 Pa
The pascal is too small a unit to be convenient for measuring gas pressures,
just as the cubic meter is too large to be convenient for measuring
liquid volumes. Hence we shall follow a long-established tradition of
measuring gas pressures in standard atmospheres, where
::I atmosphere (atm) = 101,325 Pa = 760 mm Hg
The atmosphere then becomes an auxiliary or secondary unit to the strict
S1, like the liter for volume, and the charge on the electron for ionic charges.

==Boyle's Law Relating Pressure and Volume==

[[Image:Chemical Principles Fig 3.2.png|frame|'''Figure 3-2''' Dependence of volume of gas sample on pressure. (a) The simple J·tube apparatus used
by Boyle to measure pressure and volume. When the height of the column is equal in
the open and closed parts of the tube, the pressure exerted on the gas sample is equal
to atmospheric pressure . (b) The pressure on the gas is increased by adding mercury to
the tube. (e) The gas burette. a device employing the same principle as the J-tube
apparatus. The gas is at atmospheric pressure . (d) The pressure on the gas is increased
by raising the mercury reservoir. In (a) and (b) the cross section of the J-tube is
assumed constant so the height of the gas sample is a measure of volume . In (c) and
(d) the volume of the gas is measured by the calibrated burette.]]

Robert Boyle (1627-1691), who gave us the first operational definition of
an element (see Chapter 6), was also interested in phenomena occurring in
evacuated spaces. When devising vacuum pumps for removing air from vessels,
he noticed a property familiar to anyone who has used a hand pump for
inflating a tire or football, or who has squeezed a balloon without breaking
it: As a ir is compressed, it pushes back with increased vigor. Boyle called
this the &quot;spring of the air,&quot; and measured it with the simple device shown in
Figure 3-2a and b.

Boyle trapped a quantity of air in the closed end of the J-tube as in
Figure 3-2a, and then compressed it by pouring increasing amounts of
mercury into the open end (b) . At any point in the experiment, the total
pressure on the enclosed gas is the atmospheric pressure ''plus'' that produced
by the excess mercury, which has height ''h'' in the open tube. Boyle's original
pressure-volume data on air are given in Table 3-1. Although he did not
take special pains to keep the temperature of the gas constant, it probably
varied only slightly. Boyle did note that the heat from a candle flame produced
a drastic alteration in the behavior of air.

plotted as ''P'' versus 1/ ''V'' (or ''V'' versus 1/ ''P''), the curve obeys
the linear equation y = ax + b , in which ''P'' is the
y-coordinate and 1/ ''V'' is the x coordinate. The proportionality
constant a can be determined from the slope of the straight
line in (b) , or from the height of the horizontal line in (e)

===Analysis of Data===


After a scientist obtains data such as those in Table 3-1, he then attempts
to infer a mathematical equation relating the two mutually dependent
quantities that he has measured. One technique is to plot various powers of
each quantity against one another until a straight line is obtained. The
general equation for a straight line is
       
       ''y= ax + b''                   (3-2)

in which ''x'' and ''y'' are variables and ''a'' and ''b'' are constants. If ''b'' is zero, the line
passes through the origin.

Figure 3-3 shows several possible plots of the data for pressure, ''P'', and
volume, ''V'', given in Table 3-1. The plots of ''P'' versus 1/''V'' and ''V'' versus 1/''P''
are straight lines through the origin. A plot of the logarithm of ''P'' versus the
logarithm of ''V'' is also a straight line with negative slope of -1. From these
plots the equivalent equations are deduced:

       ''P = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{a}{V}&lt;/math&gt;''                   (3-3a)

       ''V = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{a}{P}&lt;/math&gt;''                   (3-3b)
and
       
       log ''V'' = log ''a'' - log ''P''                   (3-3c)

These equations represent variants of the usual formulation of Boyle's law:
''For a given number of moles of gas molecules, the pressure is inversely proportional to
the volume if the temperature is held constant.''

When the relationship between two measured quantities is as simple as
this one, it can be deduced numerically as well. If each value of ''P'' is multiplied
by the corresponding value of ''V'', the products all are nearly the same
for a single sample of gas at constant temperature (Table 3-1 ). Thus,

       ''PV'' = ''a''&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{~}{}&lt;/math&gt; 1410                   (3-3d)

Equation 3-3d represents the hyperbola obtained by plotting ''P'' versus ''V''
(Figure 3-3a). This experimental function relating ''P''; and ''V'' now can be
checked by plotting ''PV'' against ''P'' to see if a horizontal straight line is obtained
(Figure 3-3e).

Boyle found that for a given quantity of any gas at constant temperature,
the relationship between ''P'' and ''V'' is given reasonably precisely by

       ''PV'' = constant &lt;font color=&quot;white&quot;&gt;word&lt;/font&gt;(at constant ''T'' and ''n'')                   (3-4)

For comparing the same gas sample at constant temperature under different
pressure and volume conditions, Boyle's law can be written conveniently
as

       ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''V''&lt;sub&gt;=1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;                   (3-5)

with the subscripts 1 and 2 representing the different conditions.

==Charles' Law Relating Volume and Temperature==

of a small capillary tube and a thermometer mounted on a

cools. the oil rises in the tube, and the length of air space
and the temperature are measured at intervals. For a

measure of the gas volume. So long as the bottom of
the air space In the capillary is maintained at the same
depth below the surface of the oil bath. the pressure in

error in the value of absolute zero . It should

extrapolations should be avoided.]]

We know that air expands on heating, thereby decreasing its density. For
this reason, balloons rise when inflated with warm air. About 100 years after
Boyle derived his law, Jacques Charles (1746-1823), in France, measured
the effect of changing temperature on the volume of an air sample. This
measurement can be made quite easily with the device shown in Figure 3-4.

Some sample data are plotted in Figure 3-5; these show that a graph of V
versus T is a straight line with an extrapolated intercept of - 273 ° on the
Celsius scale of temperature, or - 460° on the Fahrenheit scale. Charles expressed
his law as
       
       ''V'' = ''c''(''t'' + 273)

where ''V'' is the volume of gas sample, ''t'' is the temperature on the Celsius
scale, and ''c'' is a proportionality constant.

Later, Lord Kelvin (1824- 1907) suggested that the intercept of -273°C
represented an absolute minimum of temperature below which it is not possible
to go. Scientists now use Kelvin's absolute scale of temperature with
0 K = -273.15°C and O°C = 273.15 K. Charles' law is expressed as

       ''V'' = ''cT'' &lt;font color=&quot;white&quot;&gt;word&lt;/font&gt;(at constant ''P'' and ''n'')                   (3-6)

where ''T'' is the absolute Kelvin temperature (i.e., ''T'' = ''t'' + 273.15). Equation
3-6 indicates that ''at constant pressure the volume of a given number of moles of gas is
directly proportional to the absolute temperature''. For light gases such as hydrogen
and helium, Charles' law is so accurate that gas thermometers often replace
mercury thermometers for precise temperature measurement (Figure 3-6).
A mercury thermometer calibrated to read O°C in a water-ice mixture and
100°C in boiling water is inaccurate by as much as 0.1 degree (deg) at intermediate
points, whereas a hydrogen thermometer is much more accurate
throughout this region.

If the same gas sample is being compared at constant pressure but different
temperatures and volumes, then Charles' law can be written as
       
       &lt;math&gt;\frac{V_{1}}{T_{1}}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\frac{V_{2}}{T_{2}}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;white&quot;&gt;word&lt;/font&gt; or &lt;font color=&quot;white&quot;&gt;word&lt;/font&gt; &lt;math&gt;\frac{V_{1}}{V_{2}}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\frac{T_{1}}{T_{2}}&lt;/math&gt;                    (3-7)

This way of writing the expression emphasizes the fact that the ratio of
volumes matches the ratio of absolute temperatures, if pressure and the
number of moles are constant.

|-
|'''Solution'''
V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 100.0 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;; T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 20°C, or 293.15 K; and T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 30°C, or 303.15 K. To calculate V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; we use equation 3-7:
::&lt;math&gt;\frac{V_{1}}{T_{1}}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\frac{V_{2}}{T_{2}}&lt;/math&gt;
Substituting our data and solving for V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; we get
::&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{100.0 cm^3}{293.15}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{V_{2}}{303.15}&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the absolute Kelvin temperature (K) must be used, ''not'' the
Celsius temperature.

==The Combined Gas Law==

The three gas equations that we have encountered so far all may be written
in terms of the proportionality of volume to another quantity:

::{| border=0 cellspacing=10
   | align=right |Avogadro's law: || V&lt;math&gt;\propto \!\,&lt;/math&gt;n || (at constant ''P'' and ''T'')
   |-
   | align=right |Boyle's law:|| V&lt;math&gt;\propto \!\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{1}{P}&lt;/math&gt; || (at constant ''T'' and ''n'')
   |-
   | align=right |Charles' law: || V&lt;math&gt;\propto \!\,&lt;/math&gt;T ||  (at constant ''P'' and ''n'')
   |}

(The symbol &lt;math&gt;\propto \!\,&lt;/math&gt; means &quot;is proportional to.&quot;) Therefore, the volume must
be proportional to the product of these three terms, or

       ''V''&lt;math&gt;\propto \!\,&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{nT}{P}&lt;/math&gt; = ''R''&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{nT}{P}&lt;/math&gt;

or

       ''PV'' = ''nRT''                    (3-8)

where ''R'' is the proportionality constant. Equation 3-8 is known as the '''ideal
gas law'''. It contains all of our earlier laws as special cases and, in addition,
predicts more relationships that can be tested. For example, the French
chemist and physicist Joseph Gay-Lussac verified the prediction that, at
constant volume, the pressure of a fixed amount of gas is proportional to
its absolute temperature. (In effect, equation 3-8 is a definition of the ideal
gas; the differences between real gases and the hypothetical ideal gas are
discussed in Section 3-8.)

The gas law is often useful when expressed in the form of ratios of
starting and final variables. Suppose a fixed amount of gas at constant
temperature is compressed from ''P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' to ''P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' with volumes ''V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''. Then
''P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''nRT/V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''nRT/V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', and the pressure ratio and volume ratio are
related by

       &lt;math&gt;\frac{P_2}{P_1}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\frac{V_1}{V_2}&lt;/math&gt;          (''T, n'' constant)                           (3-9)

This is Boyle's law in ratio form. In a similar way, as we have seen, Charles'
law states that the ratio of starting volume to final volume matches the
temperature ratio at constant pressure:

       &lt;math&gt;\frac{V_2}{V_1}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\frac{T_2}{T_1}&lt;/math&gt;          (''P, n'' constant)                           (3-7)

Increasing the number of moles of gas at constant temperature and pressure
by a certain factor increases the volume by the same factor:

       &lt;math&gt;\frac{V_2}{V_1}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\frac{n_2}{n_1}&lt;/math&gt;          (''P, T'' constant)                           (3-10)

And increasing the number of moles of gas at constant temperature in a tank
of fixed volume by a certain factor increases the pressure inside the tank by
the same factor:

       &lt;math&gt;\frac{P_2}{P_1}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\frac{n_2}{n_1}&lt;/math&gt;          (''T, V'' constant)                           (3-11)

You should be able to derive these equations and also the analogous equation
that expresses Gay-Lussac's observations about pressure and temperature
at constant volume easily from the ideal gas law.

{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;
|+'''Example 6'''
|-
|An old-fashioned diving bell is simply a cylinder closed at the top and open
at the bottom, like an inverted drinking glass, with benches around the
inside for the divers to sit on. Air pressure alone keeps the water out. A diver
sitting in a bell that has an air volume of 8000 liters wants to drive the water
level down by increasing the volume to 10,000 liters, because his feet are
getting wet. If he filled the bell with 650 moles of an 0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; mixture to
begin with, how many more moles of gas will he have to release into the
bell to obtain his desired volume increase?
|-
|'''Solution'''
This is a problem in changes of volume with number of moles; pressure and
temperature remain constant. Therefore we use equation 3-10, with ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; =
8000 liters, ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 10,000 liters, and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 650 moles. We need to calculate
''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Substituting our data in equation 3-10 and solving for ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; , we get
:{| border=0 cellspacing=10
   | align=right |&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{10,000 liters}{8,000 liters}&lt;/math&gt;|| = || &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{n_2}{650 moles}&lt;/math&gt;

   |-
   | align=right |Hence 813-650 ||= || 163 moles of gas must be added
   |}
|}

Notice that it makes no difference to the problem whether the gas is
pure or a mixture of N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Within the limits of validity of the ideal
gas expression, all gases behave the same way with respect to pressure,
volume, and temperature, if measured in moles rather than in grams. The
ideal gas expression itself can be written as a ratio, in a form useful for considering
simultaneous pressure, temperature, and volume changes in a
fixed quantity of gas:

       &lt;math&gt;\frac{P_1V_1}{T_1}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\frac{P_2V_2}{T_2}&lt;/math&gt;                    (3-12)

|When a weather balloon is filled with hydrogen gas at 1.000 atm pressure and 25°C, it has a diameter of 3.00 m and a volume of 14,100 liters. At high altitude the atmospheric pressure drops to half its sea-level value; the temperature is -40°C. What then is the volume of the balloon? What is its diameter?
|-
|'''Solution'''
We have P&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.000 atm; V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 14,100 liters; T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 25°C, or 298.15 K; P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; =
0.500 atm; T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = -40°C, or 233.15 K. Rearranging equation 3-12 to solve
for V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; , we get
:{| border=0 cellspacing=10

   |-
   | align=right | || = 22,100 liters

Assuming that the balloon is spherical, we can find its diameter, ''d'', by using
the formula ''V'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{4}{3}&lt;/math&gt; πr&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or V = 4πr&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/3. The diameter then is 3.48 m.
|}

Notice that in Example 7 the temperature drop alone would have
brought about a volume decrease to 233.15/298.15 = 0.782 of the initial
volume, and the pressure drop alone would have brought about a twofold
volume increase. The actual increase, by a factor of 1.56, is the product of
these two effects.

The numerical value of the gas constant, R) in the ideal gas law (equation
3-8) depends on the units in which pressure and volume are measured -assuming
that only the absolute, or Kelvin, temperature scale is used. If
pressure is in atmospheres and volume is in liters, then ''R'' = 0.082054 liter
atm K&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. But, as you can see from Appendix 1, R also can be expressed
as 8.3143 J K&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. We shall show in Chapter 15 that the
product ''PV'' has the units of work or energy.

===Standard Temperature and Pressure===

It is frequently useful to compare volumes of gases involved in physical
and chemical processes. Such comparisons are interpreted most easily if the
gases are at the same temperature and pressure, although generally it is
inconvenient to make all measurements under such carefully controlled
conditions; O°C (273 K) and 1.000 atm have been designated arbitrarily as
'''standard temperature and pressure (STP)'''. If we know the volume of a
sample of gas at any condition, we can easily calculate the volume it would
have as an ideal gas at STP by employing the combined gas law. This
calculated volume is useful even if the substance itself becomes a liquid or
solid at STP.

{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;
|+'''Example 11'''
|-
|In an experiment, 300 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of steam are at 1.000 atm pressure and 150°C. What is the ideal volume at STP?
|-
|'''Solution'''
We can use equation 3-7, substituting the subscript STP for the subscript 2. Rearranging the equation to solve for ''V''&lt;sub&gt;STP&lt;/sub&gt;, we get
:{| border=0 cellspacing=10
   | align=right |''V''&lt;sub&gt;STP&lt;/sub&gt; ||= ''V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{T_{STP}}{T_1}&lt;/math&gt;
   |-
   | align=right | || = 300 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{273 K}{423 K}&lt;/math&gt; = 194 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
   |}
This is the volume that the steam would occupy at STP ''if'' it behaved like an ideal gas instead of condensing.
|}

At STP, 1 mole of an ideal gas occupies 22.414 liters, as can be seen from
the ideal gas law:
:{| border=0 cellspacing=10
   | align=right |Volumes per mole||= &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{V}{n}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{RT}{P}&lt;/math&gt;

   | align=right | || = 22.414 liters mole&lt;sup&gt;-l&lt;/sup&gt;
|}

This volume is often called a '''standard molar volume.'''

===Ideality and Nonideality===

The equations describing the various gas laws are exact mathematical
expressions. Measurements of volume, pressure, and temperature more
accurate than those of Boyle and Charles show that gases only ''approach'' the
behavior that the equations express. Gases depart radically from so-called
ideal behavior when under high pressure or at temperatures near the boiling
point of the corresponding liquids. Thus, the gas laws, or more precisely the
ideal gas laws, accurately describe the actual behavior of a real gas only at
low pressures and at temperatures far above the boiling point of the substance
in question. In Section 3-8 we shall return to the problem of how to
correct the simple ideal gas law for the behavior of real gases.

bottom flask. However, only molecules moving vertically can
pass through the collimating holes in the connecting tube
and into the top flask. These molecules pass straight through
and form a single spot directly opposite the source material.
A high vacuum (low pressure) is required to prevent molecular
collisions from randomizing molecular motion in the connection tube and upper flask.]]

At STP, 1 mole of carbon dioxide gas occupies 22.2 liters (ideally 22.4 liters),
whereas the same amount of dry ice (solid CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) has a volume of only about
28 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; (assuming a density of dry ice of 1.56 g cm&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;). This greater volume of
the gas, plus the fact that a gas is compressed or expanded so easily, suggests
strongly that much of a gas is empty space. But how does a system that is
mostly empty space exert pressure on its surroundings? Experiments such as
the one in Figure 3-7 indicate that gas molecules move, and move in straight
lines. They also collide with the walls of the container, with one another,
and with any other objects that may be in the container with the gas (Figure
3-8). As we shall see, the collision with the container walls produces pressure.
It is unnecessary to assume any forces between molecules and container
to account for pressure.

components of the velocity vector '''v''' by dropping perpendiculars from the head and tail of
the vector to the coordinate axes. (b) Collision of molecule with wall showing change in

We can explain many observed properties of gases by a simple theory
of molecular behavior that was developed in the latter half of the nineteenth
century by Ludwig Boltzmann (1844-1906), James Clerk Maxwell (1831 -
1879), and others. This kinetic molecular theory has three assumptions:
::'''1.''' A gas is composed of molecules that are extremely far from one
another in comparison with their own dimensions. They can be considered
as essentially shapeless, volumeless points, or small, hard spheres.
::'''2.''' These gas molecules are in a state of constant random motion, which
is interrupted only by collisions of the molecules with each other and with
the walls of the container.
::'''3.''' The molecules exert no forces on one another or on the container
other than through the impact of collision. Furthermore, these collisions are
elastic; that is) no energy is lost as friction during collision.

Our experience with colliding bodies such as a tennis ball bouncing on
pavement is that some kinetic energy is lost on collision: The energy is
transformed into heat as a result of what we call '''friction'''. A bouncing tennis
ball gradually &quot;dies down&quot; and comes to rest because its collisions with the
pavement are subject to friction and are therefore '''inelastic'''. If molecular
collisions involved friction, the molecules gradually would slow down and
lose kinetic energy, thereby hitting the walls with decreasing ,change of
momentum, so the pressure would drop slowly to zero. This process does not
take place; therefore, we must postulate that '''molecular collisions are frictionless, that is, perfectly elastic'''. 
In other words, the total kinetic energy of colliding molecules remains constant.


===The Phenomenon of Pressure and Boyle's Law===

This simple model is adequate to explain pressure and to provide a molecular
explanation of Boyle's law. Consider a container, which we will make
cubical for simplicity, with a side of length ''l'' (Figure 3-9b). Suppose that the
container is evacuated completely except for one molecule of mass ''m'' that
moves with a velocity ''v'' having components ''v&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''v&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', and v&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt; parallel to the
''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' edges of the box (see Figure 3-9a).*

Let us look first at what happens when the molecule rebounds from a
collision with one of the ''YZ'' walls, which are perpendicular to the ''x'' axis.

Pressure is force per unit area, and force is the rate of change of momentum
(mass times velocity) with time. When a molecule bounces off the
shaded wall in Figure 3-9b, it exchanges momentum of 2''mv''. with the wall;
for the particle begins with momentum in the ''x'' direction of -''mv''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; and ends
with momentum +''mv''&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;. The velocity components in the ''y'' and ''z'' directions
are not changed during a collision with the ''YZ'' wall and do not enter into
the calculation. No matter how many collisions the molecule has with an
''XY'' or an ''XZ'' wall along the way, if the ''x'' component of velocity is ''v&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' the
molecule will return to collide with the original ''YZ'' wall in a time 2''l''/''v&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''. If
the molecule transfers momentum of 2''mv&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''. every 2''l''/''v&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' sec, then the rate of
change of momentum with time, or the force, ''F&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', is
::''F&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{2mv_x}{2l/v_x}&lt;/math&gt;  =  &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{mv^2_x}{l}&lt;/math&gt;

The force per unit area, or the pressure, is

       ''P&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{mv^2_x}{l \cdot \!\ l^2}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{mv^2_x}{l^3}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{mv^2_x}{V}&lt;/math&gt;                         (3-13)

::''*''If the idea of the breakdown of a vector such as velocity into it's three components, ''v&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;,v&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; '' and ''v&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'', is unfamiliar, there is another explanation that, although less exact, leads to the same answer. This is to assume that since the motions of a molecule in the ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' directions are unrelated, we can think of the molecules as being divided into three groups: one third moving in the ''x'' direction, one third in the ''y'' direction, and one third in the ''z'' direction. The pressure from one molecule on the ''YZ'' wall is then ''P&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = ''mv&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''/''V'' (analogous to equation 3-13). The pressure from all the molecules moving in a direction perpendicular to that wall is ''N''/3 times this value (where ''N'' is the total number of molecules), or

:::''P&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{N}{3}&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{m\overline{v^2}}{V}&lt;/math&gt;

::as in equation 3-21. The rest of the proof is the same. (The bar over v2 indicates an average over all molecules.)

since the area of the wall is ''l&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and the total volume of the box is ''V'' = ''1&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;'' .Similarly,
for the other walls,

       ''P&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{mv^2_y}{V}&lt;/math&gt;                                      (3-14)

       ''P&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{mv^2_z}{V}&lt;/math&gt;                                      (3-15)

If the box now contains ''N'' molecules rather than just one,

       ''P&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''N'' &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{m\overline{v^2_x}}{V}&lt;/math&gt;                                    (3-16)
      
       ''P&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''N'' &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{m\overline{v^2_y}}{V}&lt;/math&gt;                                    (3-17)
      
       ''P&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''N'' &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{m\overline{v^2_z}}{V}&lt;/math&gt;                                    (3-18)
       

in which the quantities &lt;math&gt;\overline{v^2}&lt;/math&gt; are the ''averages'' over all molecules of the squares
of the velocity components, since we cannot assume that all molecules have
the same velocity.

The total velocity of a molecule is related to its velocity components by

       ''v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ''v''&lt;math&gt;{_x^2}&lt;/math&gt; + ''v''&lt;math&gt;{_y^2}&lt;/math&gt; + ''v''&lt;math&gt;{_z^2}&lt;/math&gt;                             (3-19)

If the motions of the individual molecules are truly random and unrelated,
the average of the square of the velocity component in each direction will
be the same. There will be no preferred direction of motion in the gas:

      &lt;math&gt;\overline{v{_x^2}}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\overline{v{_y^2}}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\overline{v{_z^2}}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;{_3^1}\overline{v^2}&lt;/math&gt;                            (3-20)

(As before, the bars over ''v''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; indicate averages over all molecules.) An immediate
consequence of this randomness of motion is that the pressure will
be the same on all walls, a fact that certainly agrees with our observations of
real gases. Rewriting equations 3-16, 3-17, and 3-18 in terms of ''v''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; gives

       ''P''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{N}{3}\frac{m\overline{v^2}}{V}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;''P''&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{N}{3}\frac{m\overline{v^2}}{V}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;''P''&lt;sub&gt;''z''&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{N}{3}\frac{m\overline{v^2}}{V}&lt;/math&gt;

and

       ''P&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''P&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' =  ''P&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''P'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{N}{3}\frac{m\overline{v^2}}{V}&lt;/math&gt;                     (3-21)

or 

       ''PV'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{N}{3}&lt;/math&gt; ''m&lt;math&gt;\overline{v^2}&lt;/math&gt;''                                     (3-22)

This last expression looks very much like Boyle's law. Boyle's law
maintains that the product of pressure and volume for a gas is constant
''at constant temperature''; our derivation from the simple kinetic molecular
theory states that the ''PV'' product is constant for a given mean velocity of gas
molecules. If the theory is correct, the mean velocity of the molecules of a
gas cannot depend on either pressure or volume, but only on temperature.
The mean molecular kinetic energy is represented by the symbol &lt;math&gt;\overline{\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt;
(where ε is the Greek letter epsilon) and is expressed as ''&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;mv&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''; furthermore, if ''N'' is
Avogadro's number, the kinetic energy, ''E&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' , of 1 mole of molecules is ''N&lt;math&gt;\overline{\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt;''. For
a mole of gas, the ''PV'' product of Boyle's law is proportional to the kinetic
energy per mole:

       ''E&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''N&lt;math&gt;\overline{\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt;'' = ''&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;N m&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\overline{v^2}&lt;/math&gt;''                       (3-23)

Multiplying and dividing the right-hand term by 3 and rearranging gives

       ''E&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''  = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle({3 \over 2}) ({1 \over 3})N m\overline{v^2}&lt;/math&gt;                           (3-24)

Comparison with equation 3-22 shows that

       ''PV'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt; E&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;                          (3-25)

The combination of this derivation from the kinetic theory and the
observed ideal gas law (equation 3-8) tells us that the kinetic energy per mole
is directly proportional to the temperature. Or, reversing the statement:

Absolute temperature,''T''; is an indication of the kinetic energy of gas molecules
and ultimately of their mean square velocity. For 1 mole of an ideal
gas, PV = RT. Substituting the value for PV given in equation 3-25 gives

       ''E&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{3}{2}&lt;/math&gt; ''RT''                          (3-26)

But ''E&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''N&lt;math&gt;\overline{\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt;'', in which ''&lt;math&gt;\overline{\epsilon}&lt;/math&gt;'' =''&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; m&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\overline{v^2}&lt;/math&gt;''; therefore,

       ''T'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{2}{3}\frac{N}{R}\frac{1}{2}m\overline{v^2}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{M\overline{v^2}}{3R}&lt;/math&gt;                      (3-27)

in which the molecular weight is ''M'' = ''Nm''. In short, ''temperature is a measure
rifthe motion of molecules''. If we heat a gas and raise its temperature, we do so by
increasing the velocity of its molecules. When a gas (or any other substance)
cools, its molecular motion diminishes. This molecular motion need not be
confined to movement of whole molecules from one place to another, which
is the picture that we have drawn for an ideal gas. It also can include ''rotations''
of entire molecules or of groups on a molecule, and ''vibrations'' of molecules.

We now can see more clearly what happens when the kinetic energy of
macroscopic objects is dissipated as heat. When a speeding car skids to a
halt, its braking is achieved by converting its energy of motion into frictional
heat. But this conversion means changing the motion of the large object-the
automobile-into increased relative motion of the molecules of the brake
shoes and drum, the tires, and the pavement. Instead of having rubber
molecules in the tires vibrating relatively slowly but moving rapidly as a
unit, we have a heated tire with molecules moving more rapidly relative to
one another but without a net direction of motion. The motions of the
molecules have become less directional and more randomized.

This behavior is typical of all real processes. It is easy to go from coherent
motion (the rolling tire) to incoherent motion (the hot but stationary
tire); it is not possible to go the other way without paying a price. As we shall
see in Chapter 16, in any real process the disorder of the object under examination,
plus all of the surroundings with which it interacts, always will
increase. In other words, in this world things always get messier. This notion
is simply the second law of thermodynamics. The quantity that measures
this disorder, and which we shall learn to use later in chemical situations, is
called '''entropy''', '''''S'''''.

==Predictions of the Kinetic Molecular Theory==

The test of any theory is not its beauty or its internal consistency, but its
usefulness in predicting the behavior of real systems correctly. By this criterion,
the kinetic molecular theory is a good one, as we shall see.

===Molecular Size===

Some simple calculations with solid and gaseous carbon dioxide illustrate
an important difference between molecular environments in gases and in
condensed phases of matter.

{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;
|+'''Example 12'''
|-
|The density of dry ice, or solid carbon dioxide, is 1.56 g cm-&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. Find the volume per mole and the volume per molecule.
|-
|'''Solution'''
The molecular weight of carbon dioxide is 44.01 amu, so 1 mole of dry ice
weighs 44.01 g. To find the volume of 1 mole, divide weight by density:
::''V'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{44.01 g}{1.56 g cm^{-3}}&lt;/math&gt; = 28.2 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
Dividing the volume per mole by Avogadro's number yields the volume per
molecule:
::''V'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{28.2 cm^3}{6.022 \times \!\, 10^{23} molecules}&lt;/math&gt; = 4.68 &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\times \!\,&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-23&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; molecule &lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

Since 1 cm = 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; Å, the volume per molecule is 46.8 Å&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.
|}

The cube root of 46.8 is 3.6, so we should expect the carbon dioxide molecule
to fit inside a cube approximately 3.6 Å on edge; therefore the carbon
dioxide molecule is about 3.6 Å in diameter. This is roughly what would be
expected from other experiments for the size of the carbon dioxide molecule,
giving us confidence in the correctness of the picture of dry ice as built up
from closely packed molecules of carbon dioxide. Now let's try a comparable
calculation for gaseous carbon dioxide.

{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;
|+'''Example 13'''
|-
|The density of carbon dioxide gas at STP is 1.977 g liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Find the volume

|-
|'''Solution'''
One mole or 44.01 g of carbon dioxide gas has a volume of
::''V'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{44.01 g}{1.977 g liter^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt; = 22.26 liters or 22,260 cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;
(Notice the small deviation from ideal gas behavior.) The volume per
molecule is
::''V'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{22,260 cm^3}{6.022 \times \!\, 10^{23} molecules} \times \!\,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{10^{24}Å^3}{1 cm^3}&lt;/math&gt; = 36,900 Å&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; molecule&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
|}

[[Image: Chemical Principles Fig 3.10.png|frame|'''Figure 3-10''' The relative size of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule and the volume per molecule available to it in carbon dioxide gas at STP. Of course, one molecule is not confined to this volume, nor are other molecules excluded from it.]]

Carbon dioxide gas has a molar volume that is 790 times the volume of the
solid. The ''volume per molecule'' in the gas phase corresponds to a cube that is
33.4 Å on a side (Figure 3- 10). Only one part in 790 of the gas volume is
actually filled by molecules.

===Molecular Speeds===

With nothing more than the elementary kinetic theory presented here, we
can calculate the '''root-mean-square (rms) speed''', ''v&lt;sub&gt;rms&lt;/sub&gt;'' which is the square
root of the average of the squares of the speeds of individual molecules. From
equation 3-27, ''v&lt;sub&gt;rms&lt;/sub&gt;'' is

       &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\overline{v^2}}&lt;/math&gt; = ''v&lt;sub&gt;rms&lt;/sub&gt;'' =  &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\sqrt\frac{3RT}{M}&lt;/math&gt;                        (3-28)


where ''R'' is the gas constant, ''T'' is the absolute temperature, and ''M'' is the
molecular weight. This equation is a good example of the absolute necessity
of keeping track of units. The gas constant, ''R'', must be expressed as 8.314 J
K&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, ''not'' as 0.08205 liter atm K&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, if the speed is to be
expressed in m sec&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Since 1 J = 1 kg m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; sec&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;, the units of 3''RT/M'' are

       &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{(kg  m^2 sec^{-2}K^{-1}mole^{-1})(K)}{kg mole^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt; = m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; sec&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;

and ''v&lt;sub&gt;rms&lt;/sub&gt;'' is in the desired units. At STP the expression is

       ''v&lt;sub&gt;rms&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{2610}{M^{1/2}}&lt;/math&gt;  m sec&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;                               (3-29)

[[Image:Chemical Principles Fig 3.11.png|frame|'''Figure 3-11''' The distribution of speeds among molecules in nitrogen gas at three different temperatures. At higher temperatures the average speed is greater, there are fewer molecules that have precisely this average speed. and there is a broader distribution of speed among molecules.]]

|-
|Use equation 3·29 to calculate the root-mean-square speeds at STP of molecules of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and HBr.
|-
|'''Solution'''
The molecular weights of these four gases are 2.02, 28.01, 32.00, and 80.91 g mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Hence the rms speeds are 1840 m sec&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 493 m sec&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 461 m sec&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for 0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and 290 m sec&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; for HBr. In more familiar
units, these are speeds of 4140, 1109, 1037, and 653 miles hr&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively.
|}

Notice that heavier molecules are slower moving at a given temperature.
Molecules that have greater mass do not have to move as rapidly as lighter
molecules do to have the same kinetic energy, and it is kinetic energy that is
directly related to temperature.

Although the root-mean-square speed of nitrogen molecules at STP
may be 493 m sec&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; , this does not mean that all nitrogen molecules travel at
this speed. There is a ''distribution'' of speeds, from zero to values considerably
above 493 m sec&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. As individual gas molecules collide and exchange
energy, their speeds will vary. The actual distribution of speeds in nitrogen
gas at 1 atm pressure and three different temperatures is shown in Figure
3-11. These curves portray a ''Maxwell- Boltzmann distribution'' of speeds. The
equations for these curves can be derived from the kinetic theory of gases by
using statistical or probability arguments. At higher temperatures, the root-mean-
square speed increases, as expected from equation 3-28. But Figure
3-11 shows that the distribution of speeds also becomes more diffuse. There
is a greater range of speeds, and fewer molecules have a speed close to the
average value.

From the size of a molecule, the speed with which it travels, and the
number of other molecules per unit of volume around it, we can calculate
the '''mean free path''' (the distance a molecule travels between two successive
collisions) and the '''collision frequency'''. Molecules such as 0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; travel
an average of 1000 Å between collisions, and they experience approximately
5 billion collisions per second at STP (Figure 3-12).

===Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures===

[[Image:Chemical Principles Fig 3.12.png|frame|'''Figure 3-12''' The mean free path, or distance traveled between collisions. for gas molecules that show ideal behavior at STP, is about 1000 Å or 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt; cm. We can imagine the size of a molecule in this drawing by comparing the relative sizes of the cube 33.4 Å on a side in this figure and in Figure 3-10.]]

If each molecule in a gas travels independently of every other except at
moments of collisions, and if collisions are elastic, then in a mixture of different
gases the total kinetic energy of all the different gases will be the sum
of the kinetic energies of the individual gases:

       ''E'' = ''E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''E&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''E&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'' + • • •

Since each gas molecule moves independently, the pressure that each gas
exerts on the walls of the container can be derived separately (equation
3-25). For example,

       ''p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{2E_1}{3V}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;''p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{2E_2}{3V}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;''p&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{2E_3}{3V}&lt;/math&gt;                         (3-30)

This pressure exerted by one component of a gas mixture is called its '''partial pressure''', '''''p''''' . Each of these equations can be rewritten to give kinetic energy
in terms of pressure:

       ''E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{3}{2}p_1V&lt;/math&gt;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;''E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{3}{2}p_2V&lt;/math&gt;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;''E&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{3}{2}p_3V&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting in the energy expression and canceling the &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{3}{2}&lt;/math&gt;V terms from both
sides of the equation produces

       ''P'' = ''p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''p&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''p&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'' + ''p&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;'' + • • • = &lt;math&gt;\sum_{j}^{}{p_j}&lt;/math&gt;                             (3-31)

The special sign at the right is a '''summation sign''', which is a shorthand way
of writing the instructions: Sum all the terms of the type P&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; for all the different
values of ''j''. It will be used frequently.


The ''total pressure'', P, then, is the ''sum of the partial pressures'' of the individual
components of the gas mixture, each considered as if it were the
only gas present in the given volume. John Dalton (1766-1844) proposed his
''law of partial pressures'' during the gas investigations that eventually led him to
the theory of atoms.

An important measure of concentrations in a mixture of gases (and in
solutions and solids as well) is the '''mole fraction''', '''''X'''''. The mole fraction of the
''j'' th component in a mixture of substances is defined as the number of moles
(''n'') of the given substance divided by the total number of moles of all
substances:

       ''X&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{n_j}{n_1 + n_2 + n_3 + n_4 + . . .}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\frac{n_j}{\sum_{i}^{}{n_i}}&lt;/math&gt;                            (3-32)

Another version of Dalton's law is the statement that the partial pressure of
one component in a mixture of gases is its concentration in mole fraction
times the total pressure. If there are ''n&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' moles of gas ''j'' present in a mixture, the
partial pressure of that gas is calculable from the ideal gas law:

       ''p&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; = ''n&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{RT}{V} = \frac{n_j}{n} \times n \times \frac{RT}{V}&lt;/math&gt;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp; &lt;math&gt; n = (\ n_1 + n_2 + n_3 + n_4 + . . . = \sum_{i}^{}{n_i}\ ) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

Since n&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;/n = X&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; is the mole fraction, and ''nRT/V'' = ''P'' is the ''total'' pressure,
Dalton's law becomes

       ''p&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; = ''X&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;P''                        (3-33)

{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;
|+'''Example 15'''
|-
|A gas mixture at 100°C and 0.800 atm pressure contains 50% helium, HE, and 50% xenon, Xe, by weight. What are the partial pressures of the individual gases?
|-
|'''Solution'''
First find the number of moles of helium and xenon in any given sample.
A- convenient sample choice is 100 g. Then the number of moles of each
gas is
::''n&lt;sub&gt;He&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{50.0 g}{4.00 g mole^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt; = 12.85 moles He
::''n&lt;sub&gt;Xe&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{50.0 g}{131.3 g mole^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt; = 0.381 mole Xe

The next step is to calculate the mole fraction, X&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; of each component:
::''X&lt;sub&gt;He&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{12.5}{12.5 + 0.381}&lt;/math&gt; = 0.970
::''X&lt;sub&gt;Xe&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{0.381}{12.5 + 0.381}&lt;/math&gt; = 0.030
According to Dalton's law, the partial pressure of each component is expressed as ''p&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''X&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;P''. Thus, we have
::''p&lt;sub&gt;He&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0.970 ''P'' = 0.970(0.800) = 0.776 atm
::''p&lt;sub&gt;Xe&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0.030 ''P'' = 0.030(0.800) = 0.024 atm
|}

Notice that no total volume was specified, and a convenient but arbitrary
sample size was used for calculation purposes. Why is the answer independent
of volume? Will the answer change if the temperature is changed?

Often gases are collected over liquids such as water or mercury, as in
Figure 3-13. Dalton's law must be applied in such cases to account for partial
evaporation of the liquid into the space occupied by the gas.

[[Image:Chemical Principles Fig 3.13.png|frame|'''Figure 3-13''' When oxygen gas is collected by displacing water from an inverted bottle, the presence of water vapor in the collecting bottle must be recognized when calculating the amount of oxygen collected. The correction is made easily by using Dalton's law of partial pressures.]]=

|Oxygen gas generated in an experiment is collected at 25°C in a bottle inverted in a trough of water (Figure 3-13). The external laboratory pressure is 1.000 atm.

|-
|'''Solution'''
If the water levels inside and outside the bottle are the same, then the total pressure inside the bottle equals 1.000 atm. But at 25°C the vapor pressure of water (or the pressure of water vapor in equilibrium with the liquid) is 23.8 mm Hg or 0.0313 atm, so the partial pressure of oxygen gas is only 1.000 - 0.031, or 0.969 atm. The mole fraction of oxygen gas in the bottle is 0.969 and not 1.000, and the partial pressure of oxygen also is 0.969 atm. The number of moles is
::''n'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{PV}{RT} = \textstyle\frac{0.969 atm \times 1750 cm^3}{82.054 cm^3 atm K^{-1}mole^{-1}\times 298 K}&lt;/math&gt;
::&amp;emsp;= 0.0694 mole

===Other Predictions of the Kinetic Molecular Theory===

[[Image:Chemical Principles Fig 3.14.png|frame| '''Figure 3-14''' Effusion is the flow of gas from a small hole in a container into an outside region of equal pressure. According to Graham's law, the rates of effusion of two gases at equal temperature are inversely proportional to the square roots at their molecular weights or, by kinetic molecular theory, proportional to their velocities.]]


Derivations from the kinetic molecular theory that are not much more
complicated in principle than the ones we have seen for the gas pressure
furnish us with a host of other predictions about the behavior of gases. These
predictions have been tested by many scientists and have encouraged confidence
in the theory. A derivation of the probability of a molecule hitting a
hole in the wall of a container leads to Graham's law of effusion, which
predicts that the rate of leakage of a gas from a small hole in a tank will be
inversely proportional to the square root of the molecular weight (Figure
3-14).

Thomas Graham (1805-1869) observed, in 1846, that the rates of
effusion of gases are inversely proportional to the square roots of their densities.
Since, by Avogadro's hypothesis, the density of a gas is proportional to
its molecular weight, Graham's observation agrees with the kinetic theory,
which predicts that the rate of escape is proportional to molecular velocity
or inversely proportional to the square root of the molecular weight (equation
3-29):

       &lt;math&gt;\frac{Rate_2}{Rate_1} = \frac{v_2}{v_1} = (\tfrac{M_1}{M_2})^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;                           (3-34)

However, the law begins to fail at high densities, in which molecules collide
several times with one another as they escape through the hole. The law also
fails when there are holes large enough so the gas has a hydrodynamic flow
toward the hole, thereby leading to the formation of a jet of escaping gas.
But so long as isolated molecules escape by going through the hole during
their random motions through a stationary gas, the kinetic molecular theory
prediction is exact.

|+'''Example 18'''
|-
|A given volume of oxygen gas effuses through a small orifice into a vacuum in 1 min. The same volume of an unknown gas takes 1 min and 34 sec to effuse at the same temperature. What is the approximate molecular weight of the unknown gas? If its empirical formula is CH, what is its molecular formula, and what is its molecular weight?
|-
|'''Solution'''
From equation 3-34 we can derive
:: &lt;math&gt;\frac{t_2}{t_1} = \frac{Rate_1}{Rate_2} = (\tfrac{M_1}{M_2})^{1/2}&lt;/math&gt;
the subscript 1 representing oxygen and the subscript 2 representing the
unknown gas. Substituting the observed data, and rearranging the equation
to solve for ''M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', we get
::''M&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 32.00 g mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;math&gt;\times (\tfrac{1.57}{1.00})^2&lt;/math&gt; = 78.9 g mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
This is an approximate value, subject to errors in measuring gas flow. Since
the formula weight of the unknown gas is 13.02 g (we know this from the
empirical formula, CH), there must be six formula weights in the true
molecular weight. Since 6 X 13.02 = 78.12, the gas is C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; .

:: &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{Rate(235)}{Rate(238)} = (\tfrac{352.0}{349.0})^{1/2} = 1.0043&lt;/math&gt;

Although there is only 0.43% difference in effusion rates of the hexafluorides
of the two isotopes of uranium, scientists used this difference to
separate fissionable &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U from &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U during the construction of the first
atomic bombs at the end of World War II. No other separation method
proved workable at the time. The scientists used UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; because it is a gaseous
compound of uranium, but the small separation ratio meant that the gas
had to be passed through many thousands of porous barriers in the special
gas diffusion plant at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, to achieve a useful degree of
separation.

The kinetic molecular theory also allows us to predict gaseous diffusion,
viscosity, and thermal conductivity, the three so-called transport properties.
Each phenomenon can be treated mathematically as the diffusion of some
molecular property down a gradient. In gaseous diffusion, mass diffuses
from regions of high to low concentration, or down a concentration gradient.
Viscosity of a fluid arises because slowly moving molecules diffuse into (and
retard) rapidly moving fluid layers, and faster molecules diffuse into (and
accelerate) the slow regions. This is a transport of momentum down a
velocity gradient. Thermal conductivity is the scattering of rapidly moving
molecules into regions of slower ones. It can be described as a transport of
kinetic energy down a temperature gradient. In all three cases, the kinetic
molecular theory predicts the diffusion coefficient, with best accuracy at
low gas pressures and high temperatures. These are just the conditions for
which the simple ideal gas law is most applicable.

In summary, the elementary kinetic molecular theory, as outlined here,
provides a correct explanation for the behavior of ideal gases. It gives us
confidence in the reality of molecules, and encourages us to look for molecular
modifications of the simple theory that will account for deviations from
ideal gas behavior.

==Real Gases and Deviations from the Ideal Gas Law==

If gases were ideal, the quotient ''PV/RT'' would always equal 1 for 1 mole
of gas. Actually all real gases deviate, to some extent, from ideal behavior;
the quantity ''Z = PV/ RT'', called the ''compressibility coefficient'', is one measure
of this deviation. ''Z'' is plotted against pressure for several gases at 273 K in
Figure 3-15, and for one gas at several temperatures in Figure 3-16. We can
interpret the behavior of real gases as a combination of intermolecular
attractions (which are effective over comparatively long distances) and
repulsions caused by the finite sizes of molecules (which become significant
only when molecules are crowded together at high pressures). At low pressures-
but still too high for ideal behavior-intermolecular attractions make
the molar volume unexpectedly low, and the compressibility coefficient is
less than 1. However, at sufficiently high pressures the crowding of molecules
begins to predominate, and the molar volume of the gas is greater
than it would be if the molecules were point masses. The higher the temperature
(Figure 3-16), the less significant the intermolecular attraction will
be in comparison with the kinetic energy of the moving molecules, and the
lower will be the pressure at which the bulk factor dominates and ''Z'' rises
above 1.

An equation such as the ideal gas law, ''PV = nRT'', is known as an '''equation
of state''' because it describes the state of a system in terms of the measurable
variables ''P, V, T,'' and ''n'' (Figure 3-17). Other equations of state that have
been proposed describe the behavior of real gases better than the ideal gas law. The best known of these equations is the one introduced, in 1873, by
Johannes van der Waals. Van der Waals assumed that, even for a real gas,
there is an ideal pressure, ''p''* , and an ideal volume, ''V''* , that would apply
to the ideal expression ''P*V*'' = ''nRT''; but because of the imperfections of the
gas, these were not the same as the measured pressure, ''P'', and measured
volume, ''V''. The ideal volume, he reasoned, should be less than the
measured volume because the individual molecules have a finite volume
instead of being point masses, and the portion of the container's volume
that is occupied by other molecules is unavailable to any given molecule.
Therefore, the &quot;ideal&quot; volume should be less than the measured volume by a
constant, ''b'', that is related to molecular size by ''V* = V - b''.

Moreover, a gas molecule subject to attractions from other gas molecules
strikes the walls with less force than it would if these attractions were
absent. For as the molecule approaches the wall, there are more gas molecules
behind it in the bulk of the gas than there are between it and the wall
(Figure 3-18). The number of collisions with the wall in a given time is
proportional to the density of the gas, and each collision is softened by a
back-attraction factor, which itself is proportional to the density of molecules
doing the attracting. Therefore, the correction factor to ''P'' is proportional
to the square of the gas density, or inversely proportional to the
square of the volume: ''P* = P + a/ V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', where ''a is related to the attractions
between molecules. The complete van der Waals equation is

       &lt;math&gt;\textstyle(P + \tfrac{a}{\overline{V}^2}) (\overline{V} - b)&lt;/math&gt; = ''RT''

Here &lt;math&gt;\overline{V}&lt;/math&gt; is the ''volume per mole'', or: &lt;math&gt;\overline{V}&lt;/math&gt; = ''V/n''. The equation is simpler when written this way. Similarly, the ideal gas law can be written ''P&lt;math&gt;\overline{V}&lt;/math&gt;'' = RT as easily as ''PV = nRT''. The constants ''a'' and ''b'' are chosen empirically to provide the best relationship of the equation to the actual ''PVT'' behavior of a gas. Even so, the molecular size calculated from this purely experimental ''b'' agrees well with the ones obtained by other means (Table 3-2), and gives us confidence that we have the right explanation for deviations from ideality.


[[Image:Chemical Principles Table 3.2.png]]


Experimentally obtained values of ''a'' and ''b'' for several gases are given in
Table 3-2, along with several calculations of molecular diameters. We might
suppose that the constant ''b'' is simply the excluded volume per mole, ''V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' (as
in Figure 3-19): ''b'' = 8''NV&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{4}{3}\pi Nd^3&lt;/math&gt;. However, collision is a two-molecule
process and this calculation overcounts the excluded volume by a factor of
2. The molecular diameters in Table 3-2 were obtained from the ''b'' values by
having ''b'' equal to 4''NV&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'', in which ''V&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\pi d^3&lt;/math&gt; /6 is the volume of one molecule.

The van der Waals equation is applicable over a much wider range of
temperatures and pressures than is the ideal gas law; it is even compatible
with the condensation of a gas to a liquid.

==Summary==

We have seen four experimentally derived principles or laws of gas behavior,
which all gases obey approximately, especially under conditions of
low pressure and high temperature.

'''1. Avogadro's law:''' At fixed pressure and temperature, the volume of
any gas is proportional to the number of moles present.

'''2. Boyle's law:''' At constant temperature, the volume of a sample of gas
is inversely proportional to the pressure on the gas.

'''3. Charles' law:''' At constant pressure, the volume of a sample of gas
is proportional to the temperature of the gas on the absolute, or Kelvin,
scale.

'''4. Gay-Lussac's law:''' At constant volume, the pressure exhibited by a
sample of gas is proportional to the temperature of the gas on the absolute
scale.

Although real gases only approximate this behavior, we can define an '''ideal
gas''' as one that follows the preceding laws exactly under all conditions.
All the foregoing observations can be combined in one expression, the
'''ideal gas law:'''

::''PV = nRT''

If ''P'' is pressure in atmospheres, ''V'' is volume in liters, ''T'' is the absolute Kelvin
temperature, and ''n'' is the number of moles, then the proportionality constant
''R'', known as the gas constant, has the value

::''R'' = 0.08205 liter atm K&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

In practical calculations, the ideal gas law is often most useful in one of
the various ratio forms given in equations 3-9 through 3-12.

'''Standard temperature and pressure''', or '''STP''', is defined as 273.15 K
(O°C) and exactly 1 atm. Gas properties are frequently converted to STP
conditions for comparison purposes, even for gases such as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O that liquefy
at STP. One mole of any ideal gas at STP has a volume of 22.414 liters, and
this is called a '''standard molar volume'''. 

The '''kinetic molecular theory of gases''' successfully explains the behavior
of ideal gases with a minimum of starting assumptions, and also
provides a framework for understanding the deviations of real gases from
ideal gas behavior. In its simplest form, the kinetic theory assumes that a
gas is made up of noninteracting point molecules in a state of constant motion,
colliding elastically with one another and with the walls of a container.
In extending the theory to cover real gases, we recognize that molecules
have finite volume and exert attractive forces on one another.

In the kinetic theory, pressure is simply the result of collision of molecules
with the container walls, and transfer of momentum. The product
of pressure and volume is equal to two-thirds the kinetic energy of motion
of the molecules (equation 3-25). Combining this fact with the observed
ideal gas law, we come to the important conclusion that the kinetic energy
of motion of the molecules is directly proportional to abso1ute temperature
(equation 3-26), or that ''temperature is simply a consequence of molecular motion''.

Comparing the densities of substances in the gaseous and condensed
phases, we find that the average space available to a gas molecule at STP
is roughly three orders of magnitude (or 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) greater than the volume of
the molecule itself. The '''root-mean-square (rms) speed''' of a molecule is
inversely proportional to the square root of its molecular weight (equation
3-27), and this speed is on the order of several thousand miles per h,our
at STP. The heavier the molecule, the more slowly it moves.

The actual molecular velocities in a gas vary in a distribution around
this rms value, with some velocities nearly zero and others very much 
faster than average. Velocities of individual molecules vary as the molecules
collide with one another and rebound. Nevertheless, the ''distribution'' of
molecular speeds remains constant at constant temperature. An ideal gas
at STP has a '''mean free path''', or average distance between collisions, on
the order of 1000 Å, and a collision rate of around 5 X 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; collisions sec&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

'''Dalton's law of partial pressures''' says that each component of a gas
mixture behaves as if it were the only gas present. The '''mole fraction''', ''X&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;, is
the number of moles of gas ''j'' present divided by the total number of moles
of all gases. The partial pressure of gas ''j'' is the mole fraction of ''j'' times
the total pressure: ''p&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''X&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;P''. The sum of partial pressures of all components
is the total pressure.

The kinetic theory of gases predicts that the rate of effusion of a gas
through a small orifice will be inversely proportional to the square root
of molecular velocity (equation 3-34), and this prediction is borne out by
experiment. The theory is also successful in accounting quantitatively for
diffusion of gases, viscosity, and conductivity of heat.

Real gases deviate from ideal behavior because molecules are not
volumeless, shapeless points, and because real molecules attract one another.
Molecular attractions become impossible to neglect when the molecules
are moving more slowly, at low temperatures; molecular volumes
become significant when the gas is compressed. Hence the gases approximate
ideal behavior most closely at high temperature and low pressure.

Van der Waals modified the ideal gas law to take both of the preceding
factors into account. The van der Waals equation, (''P + a/&lt;math&gt;\overline{V}^2&lt;/math&gt;'')(&lt;math&gt;\overline{V}&lt;/math&gt;'' - ''b'') =
''RT'' for 1 mole of gas, has an experimental constant, ''b'', that is related to
molecular volume, and another constant, ''a'', that is related to molecular
attractions or &quot;stickiness.&quot; From the van der Waals constant ''b'' we can
obtain approximate molecular diameters, and these values agree roughly
with estimates of diameters obtained from densities of solids or from gas
viscosities.

''The words &quot;acid&quot; and &quot;base&quot; are''&lt;br&gt;
''functional terms, and not labels.''&lt;br&gt;
''They describe what a substance'' does,&lt;br&gt;
''rather than what it is.''&lt;br&gt;

'''R. von Handler (b. 1931)'''


==Introduction==

Almost all the reactions that a chemist is concerned with take place
in solution rather than in gaseous or solid phases. Most of these
reactions occur in ''aqueous'' solution, where water is the solvent. There
are good reasons for this preference for liquid media. Molecules must come
into contact to react, and the rates of migration of atoms or molecules within
crystals usually are too slow to be useful. In contrast, molecules of gases are
mobile, but gas volumes are inconveniently large, and many substances
cannot be brought into the gas phase without decomposing. Solutions of
reacting molecules in liquids offer an optimum combination of compactness, ease of handling, and rapidity of mixing of different substances.

As we saw in Chapter 1, water has special virtues as a solvent. It is polar,
in the sense illustrated in Figure 5-1. The oxygen atom draws the electrons
of the 0 - H bonds toward itself, acquiring a slight negative charge and
leaving small positive charges on the two hydrogen atoms. Water therefore
can interact with other polar molecules. Moreover, water molecules dissociate to a small extent into H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ions, a property that is important
in acid-base reactions. This chapter is concerned with reactions and
equilibria in aqueous solution, especially those involving acids and bases.

==Equilibria in Aqueous Solutions==

[[Image:Chemical Principles Fig 5.1.png|frame|'''Figure 5-1''' Water is a polar molecule, with excess electrons and a partial negative
charge on the oxygen atom, and an electron deficiency and a partial
positive charge on each hydrogen atom. (b) The methane molecule, CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;,
is nonpolar: Its electrons are distributed evenly over the molecule. It has
no local regions of positive and negative charge to attract water
molecules, so water is a poor solvent for methane, (c) Methanol,
CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;OH, is polar, although less so than water. It has an excess of electrons
and a small negative charge on the oxygen atom. and a small positive
charge on the attached hydrogen atom. Methanol interacts well with
water molecules by electrostatic forces. making it soluble in water.
(d) Sodium hydroxide. NaOH. dissociates into positive and negative ions.
These ions interact strongly with the polar water molecules, so NaOH is
extremely soluble in water. Each Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ion has a cluster of water
molecules surrounding it, with their negative charges closest to the sodium ions and their positive charges closest to the hydroxide ions. The
ions are said to be hydrated.]]

If reactants and products in a chemical reaction are in solution, the form
of the equilibrium-constant expression is the same as for gas reactions, but
the logical units of concentration are moles per liter of solution (units of
molarity).

       ''a''A + ''b''B [[Image:U+21C4.svg]] ''c''C + ''d''D                                                      (4-7)
       ''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{[C]^c[D]^d}{[A]^a[B]^b}&lt;/math&gt;                                                             (4-8)

Some reactions in aqueous solution involve water as a participant. A well-studied example is the '''hydrolysis''' (&quot;splitting by water&quot;) of the ethyl acetate molecule to yield acetic acid and ethyl alcohol (ethanol):

[[Image:Chemical Principles Equ 5.1.png]]

Because all the other participant molecules themselves are polar, they dissolve
well in water, which is therefore a good dispersing agent. In addition,
water plays a direct role as a reactant molecule.

The equilibrium-constant expression for this reaction, in principle, is
       ''K'&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{[CH_3COOH][C_2H_5OH]}{[CH_3COOC_2H_5][H_2O]}&lt;/math&gt;                                               (5-2)

However, since water is present in such excess in its role as solvent, the
water concentration is virtually unchanged during the reaction. In dilute
solutions this is approximately the concentration of water in its pure
state.
       H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{1000 g liter^{-1}}{18.0 g mole^{-1}} =&lt;/math&gt; 55.6 moles liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;                                   (5-3)

This constant water concentration can be brought over to the left side of equation 5-2 and incorporated into the equilibrium constant, as we saw for condensed phases in Chapter 4, so the equilibrium-constant expression becomes
       ''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; = ''K'&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;[H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O] = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{[CH_3COOH][C_2H_5OH]}{[CH_3COOC_2H_5]}&lt;/math&gt;                                    (5-4)

Other reactions in aqueous solution involve ions; an example is the precipitation of silver ions with chloride ions, in the form of insoluble silver chloride:
::Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; [[Image:U+21C4.svg]] AgCl(''s'')

In this process water is not a direct reactant or product, but it does interact
with the ions to keep them in solution. Any ion in aqueous solution is
'''hydrated''', or surrounded by polar water molecules as in Figure 5-1d. If the
central ion is positive (a cation), then the negatively charged oxygen atoms
of the water molecules are pointed toward it; if the central ion is negative
(an anion), the positively charged hydrogen atoms of the water molecules
are closest.

Each hydrated ion thus is stabilized by an immediate environment of
charges opposite in sign to its own charge. When a salt crystal dissolves in
water, the attractions between ions of opposite charge in the crystal are
broken. In compensation, similar attractions are set up between ions and the
hydrating water molecules. Solubility of salt crystals is the result of a
balance or competition between crystal forces and hydration forces. This
is why salts do not dissolve in nonpolar solvents such as benzene, which
cannot offer hydrating attractions.



==Ionization of Water and the pH Scale==

Water itself ionizes to a small extent:
       H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(''l'') [[Image:U+21C4.svg]] H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;                                                      (5-5)

Each ion is surrounded with polar water molecules (as Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; are
in Figure 5-1d). The hydrated state of the proton, H+, is sometimes represented
as H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, meaning H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; • H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0. But this is an unnecessary and even
misleading notation. A more accurate representation of a hydrated proton
would be H&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;math&gt;_4^+&lt;/math&gt;, or H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; • (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0)4, to represent the cluster:
::[[Image:Chemical Principles Pic 5.1.png]]

We will assume that H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, like all other ions, are hydrated in
aqueous solution, and we will therefore represent them simply as H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;.

|}


The equilibrium-constant expression for the dissociation of water is
       ''K'&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt;math&gt;= \textstyle\frac{[H^+][OH^-]}{[H_2O]}&lt;/math&gt;                                                          (5-6)

The constant [H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O] form can be combined with ''K'&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; as before, producing
       ''K&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 55.6''K'&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; = [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;][OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;]                                                  (5-7)

This new equilibrium constant, ''K&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;, is called the '''ion-product constant''' for water. Like most equilibrium constants, ''K&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' varies with temperature. Some experimental values of the ion-product constant are given in Table 5-1. 

{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;
|+'''Example 1'''
|-
|From the data in Table 5-1 and Le Chatelier's principle, predict whether the dissociation of water liberates or absorbs heat. 
|-
|'''Solution'''
Since a higher temperature favors dissociation, dissociation is an endothermic or heat-absorbing process. From Appendix 3, ΔH&lt;sub&gt;(diss of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0)&lt;/sub&gt; =
+55.90 k&lt;sup&gt;J&lt;/sup&gt; mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. This is the energy required to break one O—H bond,
thereby leaving both electrons with the oxygen atom.
|}


It is customary to take ''K&lt;sub&gt;w,/sub&gt;'' = 1.00 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10,sup&gt;-14&lt;/sup&gt; as being accurate enough
for room-temperature equilibrium calculations. (It is also customary in acid
base equilibrium calculations to write ''K&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' as if it were an exact number,
10,sup&gt;-14&lt;/sup&gt; rather than 1.00 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-14&lt;/sup&gt;.) This means that in pure water, where
the concentrations of hydrogen and hydroxide ions are equal,

       [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = [OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;] = 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;                                 (5-8)

[[Image:Chemical Principles Fig 5.2.png|frame| The pH scale. From Dickerson and Geis, ''Chemistry, Matter, and the Universe.'']]

Since large powers of 10 are clumsy to deal with, a logarithmic notation has
been devised, called the '''pH scale''' (Figure 5-2). (The symbol pH stands for
&quot;negative power of hydrogen ion concentration.&quot;) The pH is the negative
logarithm of [H+]:
       pH = -log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;[H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]                                                      (5-9)
 
If the hydrogen ion concentration is 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, then
::pH = -log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt;) = +7

By an analogous definition,
       pOH = -log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;[OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;]                                                          (5-10)

and the pOH of pure water is also +7. The equilibrium constant ''K&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' also
can be expressed in logarithmic terms:
       p''K&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' = -log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;''K&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' = +14                                                       (5-11)
              
Finally, the equilibrium expression for dissociation of water, 
       [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;][OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;] = ''K&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 10&lt;sup&gt;-14&lt;/sup&gt;                                                     (5-12)

can be written
       pH + pOH = 14                                                              (5-13)

In an acid solution, [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] is greater than 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt;, so the pH is less than 7.
The ion-product equilibrium still holds, and [OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;] can be found from the
expression
       [OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;] = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{K_w}{[H^+]} = \frac{10^{-14}}{[H^+]}&lt;/math&gt;                                                       (5-14)

or
       pOH = p''K&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' - pH = 14 - pH                                                   (5-15)

|+'''Example 2'''
|-
|From Table 5-2, what is the hydrogen ion concentration of orange juice? What is the hydroxide ion concentration? 
|-
|'''Solution'''
Since the pH of orange juice is 2.8, the hydrogen ion concentration is
::[H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = 10&lt;sup&gt;-2.8&lt;/sup&gt; = 10&lt;sup&gt;+0.2&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; = 1.6 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;
:::= 0.0016 mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

The hydroxide ion concentration can be obtained by either of two equivalent methods:
::[OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;] = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{10^{-14}}{1.6 \times 10^{-3}} =&lt;/math&gt; 6.3 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-12&lt;/sup&gt; mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
or
::pOH = 14 - pH = 11.2
::[OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;] = 10&lt;sup&gt;-11.2&lt;/sup&gt; = 10&lt;sup&gt;+0.8&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-12&lt;/sup&gt; = 6.3 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-12&lt;/sup&gt; mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; 
|}

{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;
|+'''Example 3'''
|-
|What is the ratio of hydrogen ions to hydroxide ions in pure water? In orange juice? 
|-
|'''Solution'''
In pure water the ratio is 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; or 1 to 1. In orange juice, from Table 5-2, the ratio is 1.6 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; to 6.3 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-12&lt;/sup&gt; or 250,000,000 to 1.
|}


To maintain equilibrium, the added H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions from the juice have
pushed the water dissociation reaction in the direction of undissociated
H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0, thereby removing OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ions from the solution. Orange juice is not a
particularly strong acid, and the enormous fluctuation of ionic ratios even
in this example illustrates the usefulness of power-of-ten and logarithmic
(pH, pOH, p''K'') notation.

==Strong and Weak Acids==

[[Image:Chemical Principles Fig 5.3.png|frame|'''Figure 5-3''' Bronsted-Lowry acids and bases. In the theory of Bronsted and Lowry, an acid is any substance that releases protons in solution, and a base is any substance that removes protons by combining with the. HCl is a strong acid because it readily releases H&lt;sup&gt;+,/sup&gt; ions. Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; is a weak base because it has a small tendency to combine with H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, HCl, and Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; are termed a conjugate pair of acid and base. From Dickerson and Geis, ''Chemistry, Matter and the Universe''.]]

[[Image:Chemical Principles Fig 5.4.png|frame|'''Figure 5-4''' Comparison of relative strengths of solvation of a hydrogen ion in (a) liquid ammonia, (b) water, and (c) diethyl ether. The binding between proton and solvent ammonia molecules is extremely strong, and liquid ammonia will take protons from and make strong acids of substances that in aqueous solution are only weak acids. In contrast, diethyl ether is such an ineffectual proton-solvating molecule that many substances that are strong aC ids in water can retain their proton and be only partially dissociated weak acids in ethyl ether. The + and - represent partial charges arising from local deficiencies and excesses of electrons.]]

Arrhenius defined an acid (Chapter 2) as a substance that increases the
hydrogen ion concentration of an aqueous solution, and a base as a substance
that increases the hydroxide ion concentration. A more general
definition was proposed in 1923 by Johannes Bronsted and T. M. Lowry.
The Bronsted-Lowry definition can be applied to nonaqueous solutions
as well: An acid is any substance that is capable of giving up a hydrogen
ion, or proton, and a base is any substance that can combine with and
therefore remove a hydrogen ion. Now that we understand that water
molecules exist in equilibrium with their dissociated H+ and OH- ions, we
can see that the two definitions are equivalent when water is the solvent.
Arrhenius and Br~nsted acids are both hydrogen-ion-releasing substances.
If a Br~nsted base combines with hydrogen ions, it shifts the equilibrium of
equation 5-5 in favor of dissociation until balance is restored. More hy~
droxide ions are formed in the process, so in water a Br~nsted base is an
Arrhenius base as well.

In aqueous solution, acids are classified as either strong or weak. Strong
acids are completely dissociated or ionized, and they include hydrogen
acids such as hydrochloric acid (HCl) and hydroiodic acid (HI), and
oxyacids (oxygen-containing acids) such as nitric acid (HN0&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), sulfuric
acid (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S0&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and perchloric acid (HCI0&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). Each of these acids loses one
proton in solution, and the acid-dissociation constant, ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'', is so large
(&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) that too little undissociated acid remains to be measured. (HS0&lt;math&gt;_4^-&lt;/math&gt;
loses a second proton and is a weak acid.)

Weak acids have measurable ionization constants in aqueous solution,
because they do not dissociate completely. Examples (at 25°C) are

The distinction between strong and weak acids is somewhat artificial. The
ionization of HCl is not simply a dissociation; it is, rather, the result of
successful competition of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0 molecules with Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ions for the proton, H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;:

       HCl + ''x''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O [[Image:U+21C4.svg]] H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; • (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; + Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;                    (5-20)

In the Bronsted-Lowry theory, ''any proton donor is an acid'', and ''any proton
acceptor is a base'' (Figure 5-3). Therefore, HCl is an acid, and Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; is its
'''conjugate base'''. Since HCl loses a proton readily it is a strong acid, and
since Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; has so little affinity for the proton it is a weak base. In contrast,
HCN is a very weak acid, because relatively few HCN molecules release
their proton. Its conjugate base, CN&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, is a strong base by virtue of its high
affinity for a proton.

Water is a somewhat stronger base than Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, and when it is present in
excess, as in an aqueous solution of HCl, it takes virtually all the protons
from HCl, leaving it completely ionized. CN,sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; is a much stronger base than
H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, so only a small fraction of the protons from HCN become bound to
the water molecules. In other words, HCN is only slightly ionized in aqueous
solution, as its ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' of 4.9 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-10&lt;/sup&gt; indicates.

Because water is present in great excess, any acid whose conjugate base
is weaker than H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (i.e., has a lesser affinity for protons than has H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O) will
be ionized almost completely in aqueous solution. We cannot distinguish
between the behavior of HCl and of HCl0&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (perchloric acid) in water
solution. Both are completely dissociated and are therefore strong acids.
However, for a solvent with a lesser attraction for protons than water, we do
find differences between HCl and HCl0&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.  With diethyl ether as a solvent,
perchloric acid is still a strong acid, but HCl is only partially ionized and
hence is a weak acid. Diethyl ether does not solvate a proton as strongly as
water does (Figure 5-4). ('''Solvation''' is a generalization of the concept of
hydration, which applies to solvents other than water.) The equilibrium
point in the reaction

       HCl + ''x''C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; [[Image:U+21C4.svg]] H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; • (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;OC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; + Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;               (5-21)

lies far to the left, so HCl is only partially dissociated in ether. Only in an
extremely strong acid, such as perchloric acid, does the anion have so little
attraction for the proton that it will release it to ether as an acceptor solvent.
Clearly, by using solvents other than water, we can see differences in
acidity (or proton affinity) that are masked in aqueous solution. This
masking of relative acid strengths by solvents such as water is known as the
'''leveling effect'''.

[[Image:Chemical Principles Table 5.3.png]]

The dissociation constants for a number of acids in aqueous solution are
listed in Table 5-3, with estimates of the ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' for strong acids that are &quot;leveled&quot;
by the solvent in aqueous solution. The dissociation of protonated
solvent, H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, into hydrated protons and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0, represents merely a shuffling
of protons from one set of water molecules to another, and must have a
''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;'' of 1.00. In liquid ammonia as a solvent, all acids whose conjugate bases
are weaker than NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; would be leveled by the solvent and would be totally
ionized strong acids. Thus hydrofluoric acid and acetic acid are both strong
acids in liquid ammonia.

The leveling effect of solvent and the origin of strong and weak acids
are summarized in Figure 5-4. T he distinction between strong and weak
acids depends on the solvent as much as it does on the inherent properties of
the acids themselves. Nevertheless, in aqueous solution the distinction is
real. As long as the discussion is confined to aqueous solutions (as ours will
be from now on), we shall find it useful to think about and to treat the two
classes of acids separately.

==Strong and Weak Bases==

In Arrhenius' terminology a base is a substance that decreases the hydrogen
ion concentration of a solution. Sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide,
and similar compounds are bases because they dissolve and dissociate completely
in aqueous solution to yield hydroxide ions:

       NaOH [[Image:U+21C4.svg]] Na &lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;                                            (5-22)
        KOH [[Image:U+21C4.svg]] K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; 

These excess hydroxide ions then disturb the water dissociation equilibrium, and combine with some of the protons normally found in pure water:

       H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; [[Image:U+21C4.svg]] H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &amp;emsp; &amp;emsp; [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{K_w}{OH^-}&lt;&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt;                       (5-23)

In the more generalized Bronsted-Lowry defnition, the hydroxide ion itself is the base, because it is the substance that combines with the proton. The Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions merely provide the positive ions that are necessary for overall electrical neutrality for the chemical compound. 

The commonly encountered hydroxides of alkali metals (Li, Na, K) all dissolve and dissociate completely to produce the same Bronsted-Lowry base, OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;. These hydroxides all are ''strong bases'', analogous to strong acids such as HCl and HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Other substances such as ammonia and many organic nitrogen compounds also can combine with protons in solution and act as Bronsted-Lowry bases. These compounds are generally ''weaker'' bases than the hydroxide ion, because they have smaller attraction for protons. For example, when ammonia competes with OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; for protons in an aqueous solution, it is only partially successful. It can combine with only a portion of the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions, thus will have a measurable equilibrium constant.

       NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; [[Image:U+21C4.svg]] NH&lt;math&gt;_4^+&lt;/math&gt;                                               (5-24)

There is no logical reason why this reaction cannot be described by an acd-dissociation constant, as in Table 5-3. The ammonium ion, NH&lt;math&gt;_4^+&lt;/math&gt;, is the Bronsted-Lowry '''conjugate acid''' of the base NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. There is no reason why, in an acid-base pair, it is the acid that must be neutral and the base charged, as in HCl/Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; and HCN/CN&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;. The NH&lt;math&gt;_4^+&lt;/math&gt; ion is just as respectable an acid as HCl or HCN, and although weaker than HCl, it is actually stronger than HCN. Thus, we can describe the ammonia reaction as an acid dissociation:
       
       NH&lt;math&gt;_4^+&lt;/math&gt; [[Image:U+21C4.svg]] NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;     ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''= 5.6 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-10&lt;/sup&gt;     (from Table 5-3)     (5-25)

or, if we want to focus on the basic behavior of NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,

       NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; [[Image:U+21C4.svg]]  NH&lt;math&gt;_4^+&lt;/math&gt;     ''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{1}{K_a}&lt;/math&gt; = 1.8 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;+9&lt;/sup&gt;                   (5-26)

However, chemical language has become trapped by the older acid-base
terminology introduced by Arrhenius, and you should be aware of this.
Arrhenius thought of a base as a substance that releases OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ions into
aqueous solution. For alkali metal hydroxides such as NaOH the process was
straightforward:

       NaOH [[Image:U+21C4.svg]] Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;                                             (5-27)

But what about NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;? Where do the hydroxide ions come from? Arrhenius assumed that when ammonia dissolved in water the reaction was

       NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; [[Image:U+21C4.svg]] NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;OH [[Image:U+21C4.svg]] NH&lt;math&gt;_4^+&lt;/math&gt; + OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;                              (5-28)

This brought NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; into line by postulating an intermediate-ammonium hydroxide base that dissociates completely; ammonium hydroxide would be a weak base that dissociates only partially. Arrhenius defined a base-dissociation constant, ''K&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'', as

       BOH [[Image:U+21C4.svg]] B&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + OH&lt;sup-&lt;/sup&gt;     ''K&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{[B^+][OH^-]}{[BOH]}&lt;/math&gt;                        (5-29)

where B usually represents a metal. For ammonia, ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''K&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' would be related by
       
       ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{[NH_4^+][OH^-]}{[NH_3]} = \frac{[NH_4^+][OH^-][H^+]}{[NH_3][H^+]} = \frac{K_w}{K_a}&lt;/math&gt;                       (5-30)

       ''K&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{10^{-14}}{5.6\times 10^{-10}} =&lt;/math&gt; 1.8 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt;                                    (5-31)

Unfortunately for Arrhenius' theory, there is no evidence that ammonium
hydroxide, NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;0H, exists as a real compound. It is more accurate to say
that the polar ammonia molecule is hydrated like any other polar molecule:
NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; • (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0)&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;. Ammonia, NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, combines directly with a proton and with water molecules:

       NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;O + ''x''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;sub&gt; [[Image:U+21C4.svg]] NH&lt;math&gt;_4^+&lt;/math&gt;                   (in acid solutions)         (5-32)
               NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + ''x''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O [[Image:U+21C4.svg]] NH&lt;math&gt;_4^+&lt;/math&gt; + OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;             (in acid solutions)

Nevertheless, Arrhenius' notation is too deeply embedded in the fabric of
chemistry to dislodge, and we often will use ''K&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' for weak bases rather than ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''
for their conjugate acids. In general, the completely dissociated strong bases
that we shall encounter will be hydroxide compounds, and the weak bases
will be ammonia and organic nitrogen compounds such as those listed in
Table 5-4. ''K&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' always can be found from ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''K&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' and the expression

       ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; ''K&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''K&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;''                                                    (5-33)

==Solutions of Strong Acids and Bases: Neutralization and Titration==

When an amount of strong acid is added to water, the effect is that of adding
the same amount of hydrogen ions, since the acid is totally dissociated,

{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;

|-
|What is the hydrogen ion concentration of a 0.0l00''M'' nitric acid solution? What is the pH?

::pH = -log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(10&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sub&gt;) = 2.00
The solution is quite acidic.

{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;
|+'''Example 5'''
|-
|What are the hydrogen ion concentration and the pH of a 0.0050''M'' sodium hydroxide solution?
|-
|'''Solution'''
The hydroxide ion contribution from completely dissociated NaOH is
::[OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;] = 0.0050 mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
This large quantity of hydroxide ions will repress the normal dissociation of water and enhance the reaction to the left:
::H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O [[Image:U+21C6.svg]] H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;
The hydrogen ion concentration is found from the water equilibrium expression:
::[H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{K_w}{[OH^-]} = \frac{10^{-14}}{0.0050} =&lt;/math&gt; 2.0 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-12&lt;/sup&gt; mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
::pH = -log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(2.0) - log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(10&lt;sup&gt;-12&lt;/sup&gt;) = -0.30 + 12.0 = 11.7
The solution is quite basic.

{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;
|+'''Example 6'''
|-
|If we mix equal volumes of the solutions of the previous two examples, what will be the pH of the resulting solution?
|-
|'''Solution'''
If equal volumes are mixed, then the concentration of each solute will be halved, since the final volume is twice the volume of each starting solution. The final solution would be 0.0050''M'' in nitric acid and 0.0025''M'' in sodium hydroxide. But acid and base will react and neutralize one another until one or the other is used up:
::H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + NO&lt;math&gt;_3^-&lt;/math&gt; + Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; [[Image:U+21C4.svg]] H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + NO&lt;math&gt;_3^-&lt;/math&gt; + Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
or simply
::H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; [[Image:U+21C4.svg]] H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
since sodium and nitrate ions take no part in the neutralization reaction. In this case, sodium hydroxide is in shorter supply. When all the base has been neutralized, we still have
::{|

|+'''Example 7'''
|-
|How many milliliters of 0.10''M'' HCl must we add to 200 ml of 0.0050''M'' KOH to bring the pH down to 10.0?
|-
|'''Solution'''
Without HCl, the pH of the potassium hydroxide solution would be 11.7, as in Example 5. Let ''y'' equal the number of milliliters of HCl solution needed to yield a pH of 10.0. Since 0.0050 mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; is the same as 0.0050 millimoles ml&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, the total number of millimoles (m moles) of KOH is
::''n''&lt;sub&gt;KOH&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.0050 m mole ml&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 200 ml = 1.00 m mole
The total number of millimoles of HCl that must be added is 
::''n''&lt;sub&gt;HCl&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.10 m mole ml&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; ''y'' ml = 0.10''y'' m mole
Since the final solution is basic, ''n''&lt;sub&gt;KOH&lt;/sub&gt; - ''n''&lt;sub&gt;HCl&lt;/sub&gt;. The net amount of hydroxide ions left over after partial neutralization by HCl is
::''n''&lt;sub&gt;base&lt;/sub&gt; = ''n''&lt;sub&gt;KOH&lt;/sub&gt; - ''n''&lt;sub&gt;HCl&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.0 -0.10''y''
The final volume is
::''V'' = 200 + ''y'' ml
and therefore the final hydroxide in concentration is
::[OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;] = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{n_{base}}{V} = \frac{1.0 - 0.10y}{200 + y}&lt;/math&gt;
A pH of 10.0 means a pOH of 4.0 and [OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;] = 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt; mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, thus
::&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{1.0 - 0.10y}{200 + y}&lt;/math&gt; = 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt;
and
::''y'' = 9.8 ml of 0.10 ''M'' HCl to be added. 
|}

===Titration and Titration Curves===

If we add equal numbers of equivalents of a strong acid and a strong base, they will neutralize one another completely, and the pH will be 7.0. As we saw in Chapter 2, this makes possible the titration method of measuring quantities of acid or base.

{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;
|+'''Example 8'''
|-
|One hundred fifty milliliters of HCl solution of unknown concentration are
titrated with 0.10''M'' NaOH. Eighty milliliters of base solution are required
to neutralize the acid. How many moles of HCl were present originally,
and what was the acid-solution concentration?
|-
|'''Solution'''
The number of millimoles of base used is
::''n''&lt;sub&gt;NaOH&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.10 m mole ml&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 80 ml = 8.0 m mole
This must be the same as the number of millimoles of acid originally present, if neutralization was complete.
::Thus the original concentration of HCl was
::[HCl]&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{8.0 m moles}{150 ml} = &lt;/math&gt; 0.053 m moles ml&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; or mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; 
|}

A common way of determining the equivalence point of titration (the
point at which neutralization occurs) is with an acid-base indicator. Indicators
are weak organic acids or bases that have different colors in their
ionized and neutral states (or in two ionized states). If their color change
occurs in the neighborhood of pH 7, and if we add a few drops of indicator
solution to the solution being titrated, we see this color change at the end
point of the titration. We will discuss some common indicators in the section
on weak acids. The matching of indicator color-change point and the end
point of a titration does not have to be very exact, because the pH swings
drastically through several units as neutralization becomes complete. This
can make life easy for the analytical chemist, and it is worth looking more
closely at the behavior of pH during titration. To illustrate what we have
just said, let us calculate the titration curve for a typical strong acid and
strong base.

It is easiest to treat this calculation in three parts: before neutralization, at
neutralization (equivalence point), and after neutralization. Before the
equivalence point, calculate how much base has been added, assume that all
of this base was used to neutralize some of the acid, and calculate how much
acid would remain unneutralized, as a function of the volume of base solution
added.

This calculation for several values of ''v'' and the corresponding pH values are
listed in Table 5-5 and are plotted with solid circles on the right of Figure
5-5. It now is obvious why the choice of an indicator is not too critical in such
a titration. Any indicator that changes color between pH 4 and pH 10
will do.

Titrating a weak acid with a strong base, or a weak base with a strong
acid, is more complicated because the weak component is only partially
dissociated. Dissociation equilibria of the type discussed in the next section
must be used. We will not be concerned in this chapter with such titrations,
but they are treated in Appendix 5, with an example of a titration curve
corresponding to Figure 5-5.

==Equilibria with Weak Acids and Bases==

Because weak acids are only partially dissociated in water, the contribution
of a weak acid such as acetic acid to the hydrogen ion concentration is less
than the total concentration of added acid. The equilibrium-constant expression
for dissociation of the acid must be used explicitly. These general
principles can be illustrated with a concrete example, that of calculating
the pH of a solution of 0.0l00''M'' acetic acid. As we saw in Example 5-4 for
nitric acid, a strong acid, a 0.0100''M'' solution has a pH of 2.00. Because
acetic acid is a weak acid and only partially dissociated, a 0.0 100''M'' solution
will have a hydrogen ion concentration of less than 0.0100''M'', and a pH
greater than 2.0.

It is common to represent the acetate ion, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, simply by Ac&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, and the undissociated acetic acid molecule, CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH, by HAc as if it were a simple inorganic acid. (The forms OAc&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; and HOAc also are used, to
indicate that acetic acid is an oxyacid with the dissociating proton attached
to an oxygen atom.) The dissociation of HAc is incomplete:

::HAc [[Image:U+21C4.svg]] H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + Ac&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

and the equilibrium expression describing dissociation is

::''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{[H^+][Ac^-]}{[HAc]}&lt;/math&gt; = 1.76 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt;     (from Table 5-3)

We know the initial overall concentration, ''c&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', of acetic acid:
::''c&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0.0100 mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

and we know that at equilibrium some of this acetic acid remains undissociated and some of it has ionized to acetate ions, Ac&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;:

::''c&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = [HAc] + [Ac&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;]     (mass-balance equation)
This is called a '''mass-balance equation''', because it states that ''total'' acetate is neither created nor destroyed during dissociation. We also know that the concentrations of hydrogen ions and acetate ions are equal, since dissociation of HAc is the only source of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. (It is legitimate to neglect H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; from the dissociation of water, since acetic acid represses water dissociation even below its normal small extent.) Thus

::[H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = [Ac&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;]          (charge-balance equation)

This is known as a '''charge-balance equation''', because it states that the total positive charge in the solution must equal the total negative charge. We now can use these data about conservation of acetate and neutrality of the solution
to simplify the equilibrium-constant expression. Let the hydrogen ion
concentration that we are seeking be [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = ''y'', and eliminate [Ac&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;] at once using the charge-balance equation:

::''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{y^2}{[HAc]}&lt;/math&gt;     (eequilibrium equation)

:: ''c&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = [HAc] + ''y''         (mass-balance equation)

The second equation tells us that the concentration od undissociated HAc equals the original overall concentration, ''c&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', minus the amount that has dissociated ''y'':

::[HAc] = ''c&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' - ''y''

The equilibrium expression then is

::''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{y^2}{c_0 -y}&lt;/math&gt;                        (5-34)

Substituting the value of ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' from Table 5-3, we get

::1.76 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{y^2}{0.0100 - y}&lt;/math&gt;

or

::''y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' + 1.76 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt;''y'' - &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; = 0
This is a quadratic equation, which can be solved with the quadratic formula. If ''ay&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' + ''by'' + ''c'' = 0, then 
       ''y'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{-b\pm \!\, \sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a} &lt;/math&gt;                         (5-35)


For this problem, ''a'' = 1, ''b'' = 1.76 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''c'' = -1.76 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt;.

::''y'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{-1.76\times10^{-5}\pm \!\,\sqrt{3.10\times10^{-10} + 7.04 \times 10^{-7}}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

or

::''y'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{-1.76 \times 10^{-5}\pm \!\, 8.39 \times 10^{-4}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

Only the positive answer is reasonable, because one cannot have a negative concentration. Thus the answer is
::''y'' = 4.11 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt; mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

Under certain physical conditions you can take a shortcut to avoid the quadratic formula. In this example, since you know that the acid is only slightly dissociated, you can try neglecting ''y'' in the denominator of the
equilibrium expression for ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'', thereby assuming that it is small in comparison
with 0.0100 mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, and that the concentration of undissociated
acetic acid is virtually the same as the total acetic acid present.
This assumption gives

::1.76 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{y^2}{0.0100}&lt;/math&gt;

and an approximate answer of 

::''y'' = 4.2 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.00042 mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

This is close to the correct answer of 0.000411 mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. You can make a
quick improvement by using this approximate value in the undissociated
acetate concentration in the denominator:

::1.76 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{y^2}{0.0100 - 0.00042}&lt;/math&gt;
::::: = 4.11 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt; mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

Repetition of the foregoing process until the answer remains constant from one cucle to the next is called the '''method of successive approximation'''. If your intuition for how much dissociation the acid undergoes is good enough, you can often solve equilibrium problem by an approximate solution and a quick correction in less time than it takes to solve the quadratic formula. If your original guess is not so good, two or three cycles of approximation may be required before you arrive at an unchanging value for ''y''. 

As our results show, acetic acid is indeed only slightly dissociated at
0.0100M concentration. Of the initial 0.0100 mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, 0.000411 mole
has dissociated, and 0.0096 mole remains as dissolved but undissociated
HAc molecules. The percent dissociation is

::&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{4.11 \times 10^{-4} mole}{0.0100 mole} \times&lt;/math&gt; 100 = 4.11%

Since the hydrogen ion concentration is [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = 4.11 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt; ''M'', the pH of this solution is 3.39.

What happens if we dilute the acetic acid solution? Does a greater or
lesser percent of the acetic acid then dissociate? Does the pH increase or
decrease?


{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;
|+'''Example 8'''
|-
|What are the pH and percent dissociation in a solution of 0.00100''M'' acetic acid?
|-
|'''Solution'''
The equilibrium expression is as before:
::''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;NaOH&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{y^2}{c_0 - y}&lt;/math&gt;
:1.76 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{y^2}{0.00100 - y}&lt;/math&gt;
Neglecting ''y'' in comparison with c&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;, the approximate solution is 
:1.76 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{y^2}{0.00100}&lt;/math&gt;
::''y'' = 1.33 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt; mole liter &lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
and the solution obtained by using this value to correct the undissociated HAc concentration is
::''y'' = 1.24 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt; mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
Using this second value to correct''c&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' in another cycle of approximation makes no change in ''y'', so the process can be halted. Now the pH is 3.91 instead of 3.39, and the percent dissociation is
:&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{1.24 \times 10^{-4} mole}{0.00100 mole} \times 100 =&lt;/math&gt; 12.4%
|}

Although the actual hydrogen ion concentration is lower (witness the larger pH), a greater fraction of the HAc present is dissociated into ions. This is Le Chatelier's principle again. If a solution containing HAc, H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and Ac&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; is diluted, thereby lowering its total concentration of all ions and molecules, the equilibrium will attempt to reestablish itself, as reactions change, in the direction that will increase the total concentration of solute particles of one kind or another. Compare this behavior with the effect of increasing the pressure on the ammonia gas equilibrium in Chapter 4.

===Indicators===

[[Image:Chemical Principles Fig 5.6.png|frame|'''Figure 5-6''' The basic form (a) and acid form (b) of the indicator methyl orange. The different colors of the two structures, yellow and red, give methyl orange its usefulness in displaying the pH of a solution into which it has been introduced. The complex structure can be symbolized by an ion, In&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, which can combine with a proton as shown at the bottom of the figure.]]

An indicator is a weak acid (or a weak base) that has sharply different colors in its dissociated and undissociated states. Methyl orange (Figure 5-6) is a complex organic compound that is red n its neutral, un-ionizes form and yellow when ionized. It can be represented as the weak acid HIn:
::HIn[[Image:U+21C4.svg]] H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + In&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;
::&lt;small&gt;red&lt;/small&gt; &amp;emsp; &amp;emsp; &amp;emsp;&lt;small&gt;yellow
&lt;/small&gt;

Adding acid shifts the indicator equilibrium to the left, and adding base
shifts it to the right. Hence methyl orange is red in acids and yellow in bases.

The intensity of color from indicators such as methyl orange is so great that
the colors can be seen easily even when the amount added to a solution is
too small to have an appreciable influence on the pH of the solution. Nevertheless,
the ratio of dissociated to undissociated indicator depends on the
hydrogen ion concentration
       ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{[H^+][In^-]}{[HIn]}&lt;/math&gt;                             (5-36)

and
       &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{[In^-]}{[HIn]} = \frac{K_a}{[H^+]}&lt;/math&gt;                              (5-37)

       log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{[In^-]}{[HIn]}&lt;/math&gt;) = pH - p''k&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''                    (5-38)

For methyl orange, Ka = 1.6 X 10-4 and pKa = 3.8. The neutral (red) and dissociated (yellow) forms of the indicator are present at equal concentrations when the pH = 3.8. The eye is sensitive to color changes over a range of concentration ratios of approximately 100, or over two pH units. Below pH 2.8, a solution containing methyl orange is red, and above approximately 4.8 it is clearly yellow. As you can see from Figure 5-5, an indicator change over two pH units is quite satisfactory for strong acid-base titrations.

Methyl orange could be used for the titration in Figure 5-5, even
though its pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is far from the titration equivalence point of 7.0, only because
the change in pH at the equivalence point is so large. For titrations of
weak acids, this would not be true, and it would be better to pick an indicator
with a pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; closer to the expected equivalence point. Other indicators
are shown in Figure 5-7, along with the pH range in which their color
changes occur. Phenolphthalein is a particularly convenient and common
indicator, which changes from colorless to pink in the range of pH 8 to 10.

===Contribution to [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] from Dissociation of Water===

[[Image:Chemical Principles Fig 5.7.png|frame|'''Figure 5-7''' Some common acid-base indicators, with the pH ranges in which their color changes occur. The choice of an indicator for an acid-base titration depends on the expected pH at the equivalence point of the titration and the width of swing of pH values as the equivalence point is passed. ]]


Nothing has been said in the discussions of either strong acids or weak
acids about a contribution to the hydrogen ion concentration from the dissociation
of water itself. It has been tacitly assumed that all H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; comes from
the acid. This is a valid assumption for all but the most dilute solutions of
very weak acids such as HCN. The correction for water dissociation seldom
is necessary, so it will not be covered in this chapter. A complete treatment
is given in Appendix 5.

==Weak Acids and Their Salts==

What will happen to a weak acid such as acetic acid if we add some sodium
acetate (NaAc), which is the salt of a strong base (NaOH) and acetic acid?
The salt will dissolve and dissociate completely into sodium and acetate
ions. From Le Chatelier's principle, we would expect these added acetate
ions to force the weak acetic acid equilibrium system in the direction of less
dissociation. This is exactly what happens. The acid-equilibrium expression
is the same:
       ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{[H^+][Ac^-]}{[HAc]}&lt;/math&gt;                                                               (5-39)

However, two sources of acetate ions now exist: NaAc and HAc. The acetate
ion supplied by sodium acetate is measured by ''c&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' , the total molarity of the
salt, since dissociation is complete. Acetate concentration from acetic acid is
measured by the hydrogen ion concentration, since every dissociation of
HAc to produce Ac&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; also produces a proton. Therefore, the total acetate ion
concentration is
       [Ac&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;total&lt;/sub&gt; = [Ac&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;NaAc&lt;/sub&gt; + [Ac&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;HAc&lt;/sub&gt; = ''c&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' + [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]                               (5-40)

(Again, we have neglected any protons contributed by the dissociation of
water.) The concentration of un-ionized acetic acid is the overall acid concentration,
''c&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'', less the acetate from dissociation:
       [HAc] = ''c&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' - [Ac&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;HAc&lt;/sub&gt; = ''c&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' - [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]                                           (5-41)

If we represent the hydrogen ion concentration by ''y'', we have
       ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{y(c_s + y)}{(c_a - y)}&lt;/math&gt;                                                                 (5-42)

When the added salt concentration, ''c&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'', is zero, this is the simple weak acid-dissociation equilibrium expression that we have seen previously in equation 5-34.

[[Image:Chemical Principles Fig 5.8.png|frame|'''Figure 5-8''' The effect of added sodium acetate on the dissociation of acetic acid. Data plotted here are listed in Table 5-6, and were calculated as explained in the text. The first salt added represses acetic acid dissociation to a great extent and causes a rapid increase in pH. Later additions are not as effective.]]


{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;
|+'''Example 11'''
|-
|What are the pH and percent dissociation of a solution of 0.0l0M acetic
acid in the presence of (a) no NaAc, (b) 0.0050''M NaAc, and (c) 0.010M
NaAc?
|-
|'''Solution'''
From Le Chatelier's principle, we would expect the dissociation of HAc to
be repressed as more NaAc is added. The pH should increase and the
percent dissociation should decrease. (a) This problem was already solved
in Section 5-6, yielding pH 3.39 and 4.11% dissociation.
(b) For ''c&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0.0050 mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, 
::1.76 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{y(0.0050 + y)}{0.010 - y}&lt;/math&gt;     (from equation 5-42)

This is most easily solved by successive approximations. As a first approximation we can assume that ''y'' will be smaller than 0.0050 or 0.010, and we can therefore neglect it when it is added to or subtracted from these quantities:
::''y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 1.76 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;math&gt;\times \textstyle\frac{0.010}{0.0050} =&lt;/math&gt; 3.52 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.000035 mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

As a second approximation, we can use this trial value of ''y'' tpo &quot;correct&quot; 0.0050 to 0.005035, and 0.010 to 0.009965, and solve the equation again:
::''y&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 1.76 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;math&gt;\times\textstyle\frac{0.009965}{0.005035} =&lt;/math&gt; 3.48 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt; mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

A third approximation is unnecessary, and the answer should be rounded to 3.5 ,math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt; mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;:
::pH = 5 - log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; 3.5 = 5 - 0.54 = 4.46
::Percent dissociation = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{3.5 \times 10^{-5}}{0.010} \times&lt;/math&gt; 100 = 0.35%

Results for these and a few other sodium acetate concentrations are listed in Table 5-6 and are plotted in Figure 5-8. The first salt added has a large effect on the degree of dissociation and pH; later additions of salt cause less change. When acid and salt are present in equal concentrations, the pH is equal to the p''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' of the acid.

===Buffers===

If the concentrations of a solution of a weak acid and a salt of the acid anion are reasonably high, then the solution is resistant to changes in hydrogen ion concentration.

|+'''Example 12'''
|-
|A solution is 0.050''M'' in HAc and 0.050''M'' in NaAc. Calculate the change in
pH when 0.0010 mole of hydrochloric acid (HCl) is added to a liter of solution,
assuming that the volume increase upon adding the HCl is negligible.
Compare this to the pH if the same amount of HCI is added to a liter of
pure water.
|-
|'''Solution'''
Before adding HCl the acetic acid equilibrium is
::''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{[H^+][Ac^-]}{[HAc]} = \frac{y(0.050)}{(0.050)}&lt;/math&gt;
Thus
::''y'' = ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 1.76 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt; mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
::pH = p''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 4.75
(Again, we were justified in ignoring ''y'' in the [Ac&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;] and [HAc] terms because
the value is small compared to 0.050.)

The added protons from HCl combine with the acetate ions to form more acetic acid:
::Ac&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (from HCl) &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; HAc

Thus to a good approximation, all the added protons are used up, and the new acetic acid and acetate concentrations are
::[HAc] = 0.050 + [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;HCl&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.051 mole liter&lt;sup.-1&lt;/sup&gt;
::[Ac&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;] = 0.050 - [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;HCl&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.049 mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
::''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{y(0.049)}{(0.051)}&lt;/math&gt;
::''y'' = 1.76 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;math&gt;\times \textstyle\frac{0.051}{0.049} =&lt;/math&gt; 1.83 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt; mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
::pH = 5 - 0.26 = 4.74
The pH changes from 4.75 to 4.74, a difference of only 0.01 unit. In the absence of HAc and NaAc, the same concentration of HCl would produce a pH of 3.0.
|}

This resistance to pH change is called '''buffering action''', and the solution
of HAc and NaAc is an acetate buffer. Buffers are used widely for pH
control in laboratory chemistry, in the; chemical industry, and in living
organisms. A carbonate buffer system in your bloodstream, involving the
reaction
       H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HCO&lt;math&gt;_3^-&lt;/math&gt; [[Image:U+21C4.svg]] H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; [[Image:U+21C4.svg]] CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O                               (5-43)

maintains the blood pH around 7.4. When a biochemist studies enzyme
activity in the laboratory, he must use a buffer system to maintain a constant
pH during the experiments, otherwise his results may have little
meaning. One of the sillier disputes in commercial advertising is that between
two pharmaceutical companies as to whether buffers added to aspirin
to combat an acid reaction in the stomach are a benefit or an adulterant.

In general, if the concentration of strong acid added to a buffer solution
is ''y'' moles liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, the equilibrium equation becomes
       ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{[H^+][A^-]}{[HA]} = \frac{[H^+](c_s - y)}{c_a + y}&lt;/math&gt;                                        (5-44)

in which ''c&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''c&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' are the salt and buffering acid concentrations, respectively. After addition of the foreign acid, the hydrogen ion concentration is
       [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{(c_a + y)}{(c_s - y)}&lt;/math&gt;                                                   (5-45)

and the pH is
       pH = p''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' + log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{(c_s - y)}{(c_a + y)}&lt;/math&gt;                                            (5-46)

If base is added, hydrogen ions are removed, and the same expressions can be used with a negative value of ''y''.

In the preceding example, you can see the dramatic effect of the
formate buffer in keeping the solution acidic in spite of the added base, and
the importance of reasonably high buffer concentrations if the buffering
capacity of the solution is not to be exceeded.

==Salts of Weak Acids and Strong Bases : Hydrolysis==

A sodium chloride solution is neutral, with a pH of 7.0. This is reasonable,
because sodium hydroxide is a strong base and hydrochloric acid is a strong
acid, and if equal amounts of each were added, neutralization would be
complete. In contrast, sodium acetate is the salt of a strong base and a weak
acid. Intuitively we would expect a sodium acetate solution to be somewhat
basic, and it is. Some of the acetate ions from the salt combine with water to
form undissociated acetic acid and hydroxide ions:

       Ac&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O [[Image:U+21C4.svg]] HAc + OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;                                      (5-47)

This sometimes is called a '''hydrolysis reaction''', the implication being that H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O breaks up crystals of sodium acetate. It does, when the salt crystal dissolves in water, but this is not the point. In solution the acetate ion acts as a base. It is as good a Bronsted base as ammonia, and the ammonium ion is a perfectly good acid, like HAc. 
::NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O [[Image:U+21C4.svg]] NH&lt;math&gt;_4^+&lt;/math&gt; + OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

We should not let the different charges on the acetate ion (-1) and ammonia (0) obscure the similarity of their acid-base behavior.

The equilibrium constant for acetate hydrolysis has the same form as
any other base dissociation:
       ''K&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{[HAc][OH^-]}{[Ac^-]}&lt;/math&gt;                                              (5-48)
       ''K&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{[NH_4^+][OH^-]}{[NH_3]}&lt;/math&gt;                                             (5-30)

where, as usual, the virtually unchanging water concentration is incorporated into the equilibrium constant. This constant sometimes is written ''K&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'' for &quot;hydrolysis constant,&quot; but the added nomenclature is unnecessary. It is a simple base-equilibrium constant of the kind we have seen before, except that acetate ion is the base. 

As always, ''K&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' is related to the cooresponding acid-dissociation constant, ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'', by    
       ''K&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{[HAc][OH^-]}{[Ac^-]} = \frac{[HAc][OH^-][H^+]}{[Ac^-][h^+]} = \frac{K_w}{K_a}&lt;/math&gt;                      (5-49)         

(Recall the ammonia-water equilibrium expressions at the end of Section
5-4.) This value is all we need to calculate the pH of a sodium acetate
solution.


{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;
|+'''Example 14'''
|-
|What is the pH of a solution of 0.010''M'' NaAc?
|-
|'''Solution'''
Acetate ions from NaAc combine with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0 to produce undissociated HAc
molecules and OH- ions (equation 5-47). The equilibrium expression is
::5.68 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-10&lt;/sup&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{[HAc][OH^-]}{[Ac^-]}&lt;/math&gt;
Let the hydroxide ion concentration be ''y''. Since every reaction of an acetate ion with water produces one hydroxide ion and one undissociated HAc molecule, the concentration of each of the latter two species must bey
moles liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. The remaining acetate ions are those originally present from NaAc minus those that have combined with water:
::[Ac&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;] = 0.010 - ''y''
and we arrive at the familiar expression
       ''K&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{y^2}{c_s - y} = \frac{y^2}{0.010 - y} =&lt;/math&gt; 5.68 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-10&lt;/sup&gt;                               (5-50)

This is even easier to solve than the weak-acid problems. Since the equilibrium
constant is so small, ''y'' will be correspondingly small and can be
neglected in the denominator in comparison to 0.010. The result is
::''y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' = 0.010 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 5.68 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-10&lt;/sup&gt; = 5.7 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-12&lt;/sup&gt;
:: ''y'' = 2.4 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt; mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; = [OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;]
::[H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{K_w}{[OH^-]} = \frac{10^{-14}}{2.4 \times 10^{-6}}&lt;/math&gt; = 4.2 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-9&lt;/sup&gt;
::pH = 9 - 0.6 = 8.4
|}

(As before, we have neglected any contribution to the hydrogen ion concentration
from water molecules. Our procedure is accurate enough for most
situations, including the purposes of this chapter. The full derivation is
found in Appendix 5.)

==Polyprotic Acids: Acids That Liberate More Than One Hydrogen Ion==


If water is the solvent, sulfuric acid, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, loses one proton as a strong acid with an immeasurably large dissociation constant. 
::H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HSO&lt;math&gt;_4^-&lt;/math&gt;

It also can lose a second proton as a weak acid with a measurable dissociation constant. Acids that can liberate more than one proton are called '''polyprotic acids'''.
::HSO&lt;math&gt;_4^-&lt;/math&gt; [[File:U+21C4.svg]] H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + SO&lt;math&gt;_4^{2-}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;emsp; ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 1.20 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;emsp; p''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 1.92

For carbonic acid, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C0&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, both dissociations are weak:
::H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; [[File:U+21C4.svg]] H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HCO&lt;math&gt;_3^-&lt;/math&gt; &amp;emsp; ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 4.3 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;emsp; p''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 6.37
::HCO&lt;math&gt;_3^-&lt;/math&gt; [[File:U+21C4.svg]] H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + CO&lt;math&gt;_3^{2-}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;emsp; ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 5.61 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-11&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;emsp; p''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 10.25

The relative values of ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'' for a given acid are intuitively reasonable. One would expect HCO&lt;math&gt;_3^-&lt;/math&gt;, which already has a negative charge, to be less ready than neutral H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C0&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to lose another proton.
::Phosphoric acid, H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, has three dissociations:
::H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; [[File:U+21C4.svg]] H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;math&gt;_4^-&lt;/math&gt; &amp;emsp; p''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.12
::H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;math&gt;_4^-&lt;/math&gt; [[File:U+21C4.svg]] H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HPO&lt;math&gt;_4^{2-}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;emsp; p''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = 7.21
::HPO&lt;math&gt;_4^{2-}&lt;/math&gt; [[File:U+21C4.svg]] H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + PO&lt;math&gt;_4^{2-}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;emsp; p''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = 12.67

Thus, in an aqueous solution of phosphoric acid there will be seven ionic
and molecular species present: H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; , H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;math&gt;_4^-&lt;/math&gt;, HPO&lt;math&gt;_4^{2-}&lt;/math&gt;, PO&lt;math&gt;_4^{3-}&lt;/math&gt;, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;,
and OH&lt;sub&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;. Life might appear impossibly complicated, were we not able to
make some approximations.

At a pH equal to the p''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'' for a particular dissociation, the two forms
of the dissociating species are present in equal concentrations. For the
second dissociation of phosphoric acid, for which p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = 7.21,
::::''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{[H^+][HPO_4^{2-}]}{[H_2PO_4^-]}&lt;/math&gt;
::log&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{[HPO_4^{2-}]}{[H_2PO_4^-]}&lt;/math&gt; = pH - pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;
When pH = p''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;, we have the ratio
:::&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{[HPO_4^{2-}]}{[H_2PO_4^-]} &lt;/math&gt; = 1.00

Hence, in a neutral solution, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;math&gt;_4^{2-}&lt;/math&gt; and HPO&lt;math&gt;_4^-&lt;/math&gt; are present in about the same concentrations. Very little undissociated H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; will be found, since from the first dissociation constant,
::::''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{[H^+][H_2PO_4^-]}{[H_3PO_4]}&lt;/math&gt;
::log&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{[H_2PO_4^-]}{[H_3PO_4]}&lt;/math&gt; = pH - p''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 7.00 - 2.12 = 4.88
::&amp;emsp; &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{[H_2PO_4^-]}{[H_3PO_4]}&lt;/math&gt; = 10&lt;sup&gt;4.88&lt;/sup&gt; = 7.6 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = 76,000

Similarly, little PO&lt;math&gt;_4^{3-}&lt;/math&gt; will exist:
::log&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{[PO_4^{3-}]}{[HPO_4^{2-}]} =&lt;/math&gt; pH - p''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 7.00 - 12.67 = -5.67
::&amp;emsp; &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{[PO_4^{3-}]}{[HPO_4^{2-}]} = &lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-5.67&lt;/sup&gt; = 2.1 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{1}{480,000}&lt;/math&gt;

The only phosphate species that we have to consider near pH = 7 are
H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;math&gt;_4^{2-}&lt;/math&gt; and HPO&lt;math&gt;_4^{2-}&lt;/math&gt;. Similarly, in strong acid solutions near pH = 3, only H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;P0&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;P0&lt;math&gt;_4^-&lt;/math&gt; are important. As long as the pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'s of successive dissociations are separated by three or four units (as they almost always are), matters are simplified.

There is still another simplification. When a polyprotic acid such as carbonic acid, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, dissociates, most of the protons present come from
the first dissociation:
::H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO,sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; [[File:U+21C4.svg]] H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HCO&lt;math&gt;_3^-&lt;/math&gt; &amp;emsp; p''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = 6.37

Since the second dissociation constant is smaller by four orders of magnitude (and the p''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'' larger by four units), the contribution of hydrogen ions from the second dissociation will be only one ten-thousandth as large. Correspondingly, the second dissociation has a negligible effect on the concentration of the product of the first dissociation, HCO&lt;math&gt;_3^-&lt;/math&gt;.

::''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 4.3 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{y^2}{0.0040 -y}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;emsp;in which ''y'' = [H^+]

From our experience with acetic acid, which has an even larger ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'', we
should expect to be able to neglect ''y'' in the denominator. The extent of dissociation
of an acid with such a small ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; will be very small:
::''y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 4.3 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 0.040 = 1.7 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-8&lt;/sup&gt;
::''y'' = 1.3 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt; mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

This is the concentration of both hydrogen ion and bicarbonate ion, HCO&lt;math&gt;_3^-&lt;/math&gt;:
::{|
   |-
   | &amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;[H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] || = || 1.3 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt; mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
   |-

   |-
   |&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp;&amp;emsp; pH || = || 4 - 0.12 = 3.88 
   |}

Consequently, carbonated beverages have an acidity somewhere between those of wine and tomato juice (see Table 5-2). For the second dissociation:
::HCO&lt;math&gt;_3^-&lt;/math&gt; [[File:U+21C4.svg]] H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + CO&lt;math&gt;_3^{2-}&lt;/math&gt;
::''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = 5.6 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-11&lt;/sup&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{[H^+][CO_3^{2-}]}{[HCO_3^-]}&lt;/math&gt;

Since this second dissociation has only a minor effect on the first one, we can
assume that the hydrogen ion and bicarbonate ion concentrations are effectively
the same:
::[CO&lt;math&gt;_3^{2-}&lt;/math&gt;] = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{[HCO_3^-]}{[H^+]} \times&lt;/math&gt; ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 5.6 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-11&lt;/sup&gt; mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

Note the rather surprising result that the concentration of the second dissociation product is equal to the second dissociation constant!

In distilled water, the first dissociation is

The dissociation constant is so small that ''y'' in the denominator can be
neglected immediately. Dissociation will be extremely slight:
::''y = [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = [HS&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;] = 9.5 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt; mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
::pH = 5 - 0.98 = 4.02

As with the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; example, the anion produced by the second dissociation has a concentration equal to the second dissociation constant.

The acid has repressed the dissociation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, making the sulfide ion concentration only one-hundredth of what it is in pure water. As we shall see in
the next section, we can use acids to exert a fine control on sulfide concentration
in analytical methods by controlling the pH.

==Equilibria With Slight Soluble Salts==

When most solid salts dissolve in water, they dissociate almost completely
into hydrated positive and negative ions. The solubility of a salt in water
represents a balance between the attraction of the ions in the crystal lattice
and the attraction between these ions and the polar water molecules. This
balance may be a delicate one, easily changed in going from one compound
to an apparently similar one, or from one temperature to another. It is not
possible to give hard-and-fast rules as to whether a compound is soluble, or
even to account for all observed behavior.

One important factor certainly is the electrostatic attraction between
ions. Crystals made up of small ions that can be packed closely together are
generally harder to pull apart than crystals made up of large ions. Therefore,
for a given cation, fluorides (F&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) and hydroxides (OH-) are less soluble than
nitrates (NO&lt;math&gt;_3^-&lt;/math&gt;) and perchlorates (ClO&lt;math&gt;_4^-&lt;/math&gt;). Chlorides are intermediate in size, and their behavior is difficult to predict from general principles.

The charge on the ions also is important. More highly charged ions
such as phosphates (PO&lt;math&gt;_4^{3-}&lt;/math&gt;) and carbonates (CO&lt;math&gt;_3^{2-}&lt;/math&gt;) interact strongly with cations and are less soluble than the singly charged nitrates and perchlorates.

The terms ''soluble'' and ''insoluble'' are relative, and the degree of solubility can be related to an equilibrium constant. For a &quot;slightly soluble&quot; salt such as silver chloride, an equilibrium exists between the dissociated ions and the solid compound:
       AgCL(s) [[File:U+21C4.svg]] Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;                                         (5-51)

The equilibrium expression for this reaction is
       ''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{[Ag^+][Cl^-]}{[AgCl(s)]}&lt;/math&gt;                                                (5-52)

As long as solid AgCl remains, its effect on the equilibrium does not change.
As with the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O concentration in the water dissociation equilibrium, the
concentration of the solid salt can be incorporated into the equilibrium
constant:
       ''K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;''[AgCl(''s'')] = [Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;][Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;]                                (5-53)

This new equilibrium constant, ''K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;'', is called the ''solubility-product constant''. For substances in which the ions are not in a 1: 1 ratio, the form of the
solubility-product expression is analogous to our previous equilibrium
expression:
::{|
   |-
   | PbCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || [[File:U+21C4.svg]] || Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; || &amp;emsp; || ''K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;'' || = || [Pb&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;][Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;

Solubility equilibria are useful in predicting whether a precipitate will form under specified conditions, and in choosing conditions under which two chemical substances in solution can be separated by selective precipitation.

The solubility-product constant of a slightly soluble compound can be calculated from its solubility in moles liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

The equilibrium expression is
::AgCl [[File:U+21C4.svg]] Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

The concentrations of Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; are equal because for each mole of solid AgCl that dissolves, 1 mole each of Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; ions is produced. Hence the concentration of each ion is equal to the overall solubility, ''s'', of the solid in moles liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;:

The solubility-product constants of a number of substances are listed in
Table 5-7. Substances are grouped by anion and listed in the order of
decreasing ''K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;''; anions are listed roughly in the order of decreasing solubility.
Once the solubility-product constant is known, it can be used to
calculate the solubility of a compound at a specified temperature.

For cadmium carbonate,

For Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; the expression is slightly different. If the solubility again is
''s'' moles liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, since each mole of salt produces 2 moles of Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ions,
::&amp;emsp; [Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = 2''s''
::[CO&lt;math&gt;_3^{2-}&lt;/math&gt;] = ''s''

Although cadmium carbonate and silver carbonate have nearly the same solubility-product constants, their solubilities in moles liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; differ by
a factor of 100 because the form of the solubility-product expression is different.
The solubility of Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is sensitive to the square of the metal-ion
concentration, because two silver ions per carbonate ion are necessary to
build the solid crystal.

===Common-Ion Effect===

In the preceding example, the solubility of silver carbonate in pure water was calculated to be 1.3 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt; mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Will silver carbonate be more soluble or less soluble in silver nitrate solution? Le Chatelier's principle leads us to predict that a new, outside source of silver ions would shift the silver carbonate equilibrium reaction in the direction of less dissociation:
       Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; [[File:U+21C4.svg]] 2Ag&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + CO&lt;math&gt;_3^{2-}&lt;/math&gt;                           (5-54)

or that silver carbonate would be less soluble in a silver nitrate solution than in pure water. This decrease in the solubility of one salt in a solution of another salt that has a common cation or anion is called the '''common-ion effect'''.

|-
|'''Solution'''
(a) If the solubility in pure water is ''s'', then    
::{Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] = ''s''
::&amp;emsp; [F&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;] = 2''s''

:::''s'' = 2.1 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt; mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
(b) In 0.01''M'' CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the calcium ion concentration is the sum of the concentration
of calcium ions from calcium chloride and from calcium fluoride, whose solubility we are seeking:
::[Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] = 0.10 + ''s''
::&amp;emsp;[F&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;] = 2''s''
::&amp;emsp;''K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;'' = (0.10 + ''s'')(2''s'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 3.9 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-11&lt;/sup&gt;
This is a cubic equation, but a moment's thought about the chemistry involved will eliminate the need to solve it as such. With such a small solubility-product constant, you can predict that the solubility of calcium fluoride will be very small in comparison with 0.10 mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. (You already should realize from (a) and Le Chatelier's principle that in this
problem ''s'' will be less than 2.1 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt; mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.) If our prediction is valid, we can simplify the solubility-product equation and calculate the
approximate solubility:

   | &amp;emsp; &amp;emsp; &amp;emsp; &amp;emsp; ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; || = || &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{3.9 \times 10^{-11}}{4 \times 0.10}&lt;/math&gt; = 9.75 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-11&lt;/sup&gt;
   |-
   | &amp;emsp; &amp;emsp; &amp;emsp; &amp;emsp; ''s'' || = || 0.99 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt; = 9.9 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-6&lt;/sup&gt; mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
|}

Therefore the approximation is justified. Only 4.7% as much CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will dissolve in 0.10''M'' CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; as in pure water:
::&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{9.9 \times 10^{-6}}{2.1 \times 10^{-4}} \times&lt;/math&gt; 100 = 4.7%
(c) In 0.10''M'' NaF,
::[Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] = ''s''     and     [F&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;] = 0.10 + 2''s''
since fluoride ions come from NaF as well as from CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The solubility-product equation is
::''K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''s''(2''s'' + 0.10)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 3.9 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-11&lt;/sup&gt;
Again, thinking about the chemical meaning will avoid the necessity of
solving a cubic equation. The 2''s'' term will be very small compared to 0.10
mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, therefore,
::''s''(0.10)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 3.9 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-11&lt;/sup&gt;
::::''s'' = 3.9 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-9&lt;/sup&gt; mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
This approximation is even more valid than the previous one, since from the calculation
::&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{3.9 \times 10^{-9}}{2.1 \times 10^{-4}} \times&lt;/math&gt; 100 = 0.0019%
only 0.0019% as much CaF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will dissolve in 0.10''M'' NaF as in pure water. Fluoride is more effective than calcium as a common ion because it has a second-power effect on the solubility equilibrium.

The common-ion method of controlling solubility often is used with
solutions of sulfide ion, S&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;, because many metals form insoluble sulfides,
and the sulfide ion concentration can be controlled by adjusting the pH.

{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;
|+'''Example 22'''
|-
|What is the maximum possible concentration of Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion in water at 25°C that is saturated with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S and maintained at pH 3.0 with HCl?
|-
|'''Solution'''
From the solubility-product equilibrium equation we predict that too much
nickel ion will cause the precipitation of nickel sulfide, NiS:   
::''K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;'' = [Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;][S&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;] = 3 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-21&lt;/sup&gt;
The only new twist to this problem is finding the sulfide ion concentration
from the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S equilibrium. Hydrogen sulfide dissociates in two steps, each
with an equilibrium constant:
::H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S [[File:U+21C4.svg]] H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HS&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;emsp; &amp;emsp; ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 9.1 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-8&lt;/sup&gt;
::&lt;u&gt;HS&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; [[File:U+21C4.svg]] H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + S&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/u&gt; &amp;emsp; &amp;emsp; ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 1.1 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-12&lt;/sup&gt;
::H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S [[File:U+21C4.svg]] 2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + S&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;emsp; &amp;emsp; ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;1.2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;''
Because the overall dissociation is the sum of two dissociation steps, the overall equilibrium constant, ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;1.2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'', is the product of ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'':
::''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;1.2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{[H^+][HS^-]}{[H_2S]} \times \frac{[H^+][S^{2-}]}{[HS^-]} = \frac{[H^+]^2[S^{2-}]}{[H_2S]}&lt;/math&gt;
::''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;1.2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 9.1 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-8&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 1.1 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-12&lt;/sup&gt; = 1.0 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt;
Saturated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is approximately 0.10''M'' at 25°C, and the very small value
of K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;1.2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; means that dissociation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is very slight. Hence we can write
::[H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S] = 0.10 mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;emsp; &amp;emsp; and &amp;emsp; &amp;emsp; [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;[S&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;] = 1.0 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-20&lt;/sup&gt;
in a saturated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S solution. This &quot;ion product&quot; for saturated H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S is a useful relationship to remember. 

In this problem, the pH has been adjusted to 3.0 with hydrochloric acid, so
::[H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = 1.0 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
Therefore, the sulfide ion concentration can be calculated from
::[S&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;] = ''K''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;1.2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\times \textstyle\frac{[H_2S]}{[H^+]^2} = &lt;/math&gt; 1.0 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;math&gt;\times \textstyle\frac{0.10}{(1.0 \times 10^{-3})^2}&lt;/math&gt;
which gives
::[S&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;] = 1.0 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-14&lt;/sup&gt; mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
Since NiS will precipitate if the solubility product is exceeded, the highest value that the nickel ion concentration can have is
::[Ni&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{K_{sp}}{S^{2-}} = \frac{3 \times 10^{-21}}{1 \times 10^{-14}}&lt;/math&gt; = 3 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

===Separation of Compounds by Precipitation===

Solubility-product constants can be used to devise methods for separating ions solution by selective precipitation. The entire traditional qualitative-analysis scheme is based on the use of these equilibrium constants to determine the correct precipitating ions and the correct strategy.  

{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;
|+'''Example 23'''
|-
|A solution is 0.010''M'' in barium chloride, BaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and 0.020''M'' in strontium chloride, SrCl2. Can either Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; or Sr&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; be precipitated selectively with concentrated sodium sulfate, Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, solution? Which ion will precipitate first? When the second ion just begins to precipitate, what is the residual concentration of the first ion, and what fraction of the original amount of the first ion is left in solution? (For simplicity, assume that the Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; solution is so concentrated that the volume change in the Ba-Sr solution can be neglected.)
|-
|'''Solution'''
The upper limit on barium sulfate solubility is given by    
::''K&lt;sub&gt;sp&lt;/sub&gt;'' = [Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;][SO&lt;math&gt;_4^{2-}&lt;/math&gt;] = 1.5 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-9&lt;/sup&gt;
With 0.010 mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; of Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, precipitation of barium sulfate will not
occur until the sulfate ion concentration increases to
::[SO&lt;math&gt;_4^{2-}&lt;/math&gt;] = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{1.5 \times 10^{-9}}{0.010}&lt;/math&gt; = 1.5 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
Strontium sulfate will precipitate when the sulfate concentration is 
::[SO&lt;math&gt;_4^{2-}&lt;/math&gt;] = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{K_{sp(SrSO_4)}}{[Sr^{2+}]} = \frac{7.6 \times 10^{-7}}{0.020} =&lt;/math&gt; 3.8 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt; mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
Therefore, barium will precipitate first. When the sulfate concentration has
risen to 3.8 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt; mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and strontium sulfate just begins to precipitate, the residual barium concentration left in solution will be
::[Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;] = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{1.5 \times 10^{-9}}{3.8 \times 10^{-5}}&lt;/math&gt; = 3.9 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt; mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
The quantity is 
::&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{3.9 \times 10^{-5}}{0.010} \times&lt;/math&gt; 100 = 0.39%
or 0.39% of the original Ba&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; present. Thus 99.6% of the barium has been
precipitated before any strontium begins to precipitate.

==Summary==

In this chapter we have applied the concepts of chemical equilibrium to ions
in aqueous solution, especially to acid-base and precipitation reactions. We
have used the equilibrium-constant expression from Chapter 4, with concentrations
expressed in units of moles per liter (moles liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;). Since the
concentration of water is effectively constant, especially in dilute solutions,
we have incorporated all water concentration terms, [H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0], into the equilibrium
constants.

Water itself ionizes with an equilibrium or ion-product constant at room temperature of ''K&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;'' = [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;][OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;] = 10&lt;sup&gt;-14&lt;/sup&gt;. To avoid the inconvenience of large exponential numbers, a negative exponent notation is used, whereby pH = -log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;[H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;], pOH = -log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;[OH-], and p''K''&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; = -log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; ''K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt;''. In this notation, the dissociation of water can be represented by pH + pOH = p''K''&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; = 14. For pure water, [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] and [OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;] must be the same, and equal to 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; mole liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, so the pH and pOH each are equal to 7. The pH is a convenient measure of acidity, since in acid solutions the pH is less than 7, and in basic solutions it is greater than 7.

According to the Bronsted-Lowry theory of acids and bases, any substance
that gives up a proton is an ''acid'', and any substance that can combine
with a proton and remove it from solution is a ''base''. When an acid loses its proton, it becomes the conjugate base. A strong acid such as HCl has a weak
conjugate base, Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, and a weak acid such as HAc or NH&lt;math&gt;_4^+&lt;/math&gt; has a relatively strong conjugate base, Ac&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; or NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Any acid whose conjugate base is sufficiently weaker than H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (has a lesser affinity for H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) will be dissociated completely in aqueous solution, hence it is classified as a '''strong acid'''. Acids that dissociate only partially in aqueous solution are '''weak acids'''.

Strong acids and bases are simple to deal with, since their dissociation
is complete in aqueous solution. When a strong acid is added to water, the
increase in hydrogen ion concentration equals the concentration of added
acid. '''Neutralization''' occurs when H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; from an acid combines with OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; from a base to form water molecules. The amount of acid present in a
sample can be determined by finding out how much base of known strength
is required to make the solution neutral as measured by an acid-base
'''indicator'''. This is called '''titration''', and it is a useful analytical procedure.

The equilibrium expression for a weak acid, equation 5-34, is obtained
with the help of two conservation expressions: a mass-balance equation that
says the total amount of acid '''anion''' is constant, and a charge-balance equation
that says the solution must remain neutral as a whole. This simple
expression can be solved as a quadratic equation or by the method of successive
approximations, and it is valid as long as the solution is so acid
that the contribution to [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] from the dissociation of water can be neglected.
If this is not the case, then a more complete expression (Appendix 5)
must be used. Acid-base indicators themselves are weak acids or weak
bases whose dissociated and undissociated forms have different colors.

A '''buffer''' is a mixture of a weak acid and its salt with a strong base, or
alternatively, of a weak base and its salt with a strong acid. The equilibrium
between the acid and salt form of the substances shifts to counteract the
effect of added acid or base, making the buffered solution resistant to pH
change. The pH in such solutions can be calculated from equations 5-42
and 5-46.

'''Hydrolysis''' is the interaction of the salt of a weak acid (or weak base)
with water to form undissociated acid (or base) and OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; (or H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) ions. What
is sometimes described as a '''hydrolysis constant''' is actually nothing more
than the dissociation constant for the conjugate of the weak acid or base.
The base constant, K&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;, and the acid constant, K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, are related by K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = K&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt;.

Some acids can release more than one proton in successive dissociations.
These are called '''polyprotic acids'''. As long as the successive dissociation
constants, ''K&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''K&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' , and so on, differ by factors of 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt; or 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt;, the successive dissociations can be treated as separate events.

Most of the general comments just made about solving acid-base
equilibrium problems are applicable to solubility equilibria, for situations
in which ions combine to form an insoluble salt. Solubility-product calculations
are more useful to indicate whether precipitation will occur under
certain conditions, what the upper limit on concentration of an ion in
solution may be, and whether two ions can be separated in solution by
selective precipitation.

==Introduction==

In the first five chapters you encountered some of the most fundamental
ideas in chemistry: atoms, molecules, moles, conservation of
mass and energy, behavior of gases, kinetic theory, equilibrium, and
acid-base chemistry in solution. All these ideas have been presented in a
very dogmatic way, without proof of any kind. It is time now to stop being
a believer and to become a skeptic. How do we know that the material
in the first five chapters is true? How do we know, for example, that the
molecular formula for water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0? After all, the best chemists in the
world thought it was HO for a full 58 years after the atomic theory was
proposed in 1802 by John Dalton. Why did they change their minds? What
gives us the right to assert that one atom of carbon is approximately 12
times as heavy as one atom of hydrogen? It is not easy to think of ways to
weigh out equal numbers of atoms without the mole concept, and this
concept depends on the existence of a reliable set of atomic weights, which
brings us back in a circle to the relative weights of carbon and hydrogen.
How can the circle be broken?

How are the atomic numbers for elements obtained? Why should
atoms with the same atomic number but different atomic weights (isotopes)
have so nearly identical chemical properties that they are given the same
symbol and classed as one element? What evidence is there that the negative
charges in an atom are on the outside, and the positive charges are
grouped in a tiny central nucleus that contains virtually all the mass of the
atom? And what do we mean by the radius of an atom? Is not the size of
an atom as difficult to measure as its weight? What laboratory measurements
can be related to such microscopic dimensions, and how can we be
sure that the relationship is correct?

How, in fact, do we know that atoms exist at all? How do we really
know that everything said so far is not the product of the chemist's hyperactive
imagination? Perhaps Professor Smith, the author of our chapter opening
quote, was right. Alchemists explained chemical reactions in terms
of mythological figures or planets (the distinction was not clear in their
own minds) that they associated with the reagents: gold with the sun,
copper with Venus, iron with Mars, tin with Jupiter, and lead with Saturn.
In what way are atoms more successful models than Greek gods? And how
are hydrogen, helium, lithium, beryllium, and so on really more satisfactory
as &quot;fundamental materials&quot; than the earth, air, fire and water of
Empedocles in ancient Greece?

We have already mentioned Faraday's experiments with ions and
electrolysis, and Thomson's and Millikan's measurements of electron charge
and mass, in Chapter 1. The tremendous achievement of Mendeleev and
Meyer in building the periodic table of the elements is the subject of
Chapter 7. The work of Rutherford, Bohr, Schrödinger, and others in developing
the modern theory of atomic structure and bonding is described
in Chapter 8. In this chapter we shall go back even farther, and focus on
two men who revolutionized chemistry: Antoine Lavoisier (1743-1794),
who demonstrated that the fundamental quantity in any chemical reaction
is mass) and John Dalton (1766-1844), who proposed that the fundamental
units in chemical reactions are ''atoms''. Dalton was not the first to propose
the idea of atoms in principle, but he was the first to show in a convincing
way that atoms do exist, and that they are a useful basis for understanding
chemical reactions.

This chapter is an exercise in both chemical history and chemical
understanding-the two frequently go hand in hand. One of the guiding
principles of this book is that knowing how chemical concepts evolved
helps to make them more comprehensible and more interesting. Such historical
material is usually presented in postscripts at the ends of chapters.
In effect, this chapter is one long postscript to the first five chapters. As you
travel through the rest of this book, study and learn the material in the
chapters, and relax and enjoy the postscripts.

==The Concept of An Element==

[[Image:Chemical Principles Fig 6.1.png|frame| '''Figure 6-1''' The Greeks of the fifth century B.C. pictured all material substances as composed of different proportions of the four basic elements: earth, air, fire, and water. These elements shared, in pairs, the properties of heat or cold and wetness or dryness: Earth was cold and dry, water was cold and wet, air was hot and wet, and fire was hot and dry.]]

One of the oldest ideas in science is that of fundamental materials out of
which everything else is made. Empedocles (500 B.C.), in Greece, performed
what may be the first recorded chemical analysis. He noted that when wood
burns, smoke or air rises first and is followed by flame or fire. Water vapor
will condense on a cool surface held near the flame. After combustion,
the remains are ash or earth. Empedoc1es interpreted combustion as a
breaking down of the burning substance into its four elements: earth, air,
fire, and water. He and later writers generalized these into the four elements
of which all substances were composed in varying proportions (Figure 6-1).
Originally, at least, these ideas were not meant to be flights of metaphysical
invention, but were attempts to explain observations. Later, among the
Greek, Arabic, and medieval alchemists, the ideas become imbued with
mysticism. Then earth, air, fire, and water were abandoned as fundamental
elements, but varying sets of what we now would call elements or simple
compounds were chosen by different alchemists as the fundamental materials
of nature.

Aristotle (384 -322 &lt;sub&gt;B.C.&lt;/sub&gt;) gave a definition of an element that, even now, can hardly be improved:
::&quot;Everything is either an element or composed of elements.... An element is that into which other bodies can be resolved, and which exists in them either potentially or actually, but which cannot itself be resolved into anything simpler, or different in kind.&quot;

However, this definition doesn't answer the question of how to recognize an element when you encounter one. Robert Boyle (1627- 1691) gave a
more practical definition: ''An element is a substance that will always gain weight
when undergoing chemical change.'' This statement must be understood in the
sense in which it was intended. For example, when iron rusts, the iron
oxide produced weighs more than the original iron. Yet the weigh t of the
iron ''and'' the oxygen that combines with it is exactly the same as the weight
of the iron oxide. Conversely, when the red powder of mercuric oxide is
heated, oxygen gas is emitted, and the silvery liquid mercury that remains
weighs less than the original red powder. But if this decomposition takes
place in an enclosed flask, one sees that there is no ''overall'' loss of weight
during the reaction. (It was a century after Boyle that Lavosier made careful
weighing experiments demonstrating the conservation of mass in such
reactions. )

By Boyle's definition, mercuric oxide could not be an element, because
it can be decomposed into parts, each of which is lighter than the original
substance. Mercury could provisionally be called an element, at least until
the day when someone else succeeded in separating it into components.
Until the present century of spectroscopy and other laboratory techniques,
it was easy to prove that a substance was ''not'' an element, but impossible to
prove that one was. As the famous German chemist Justus von Liebig
wrote, in 1857, &quot;The elements count as simple substances not because we
know that they are so, but because we do not know that they are not.&quot;

The elements called the ''rare earths'' provide an example of the difficulties
of proving by purely chemical means that a substance is an element. In
1839, the Swedish chemist Carl Mosander extracted a new element from
cerium nitrate and named it ''lanthanum'' (from the Greek ''lanthanein'', &quot;to lie
hidden&quot;). Two years later he showed that his lanthanum-containing preparation
contained a second element which he christened ''didymium'' (from
the Greek ''didymos'', or &quot;twin&quot;). In 1879, Fran~ois Lecoq de Boisbaudran isolated
another substance, ''samarium'', from the didymium preparation, and all
these were accepted as chemical elements. But didymium vanished from the
rolls of chemistry in 1885, when the Austrian Carl von Welsbach separated
it into two new elements, ''neodymium'' (&quot;new twin&quot;) and ''praseodymium'' (&quot;green
twin&quot;). It is only because we now have the periodic table, and understand
the principles behind its construction, that we can say that there can be
no other new elements between hydrogen, &lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;H , and element 105.

What kinds of substances are elements? The first to be recognized correctly
as such were the metals. Gold, silver, copper, tin, iron, platinum,
lead, zinc, mercury, nickel, tungsten, and cobalt all are metals. In fact, all
but 22 of the 105 known elements have metallic properties. Five of the
nonmetals (helium, neon, argon, krypton, and xenon) were discovered in the
mixture of gases that remained when all the nitrogen and oxygen in air
were removed. Chemists thought that these &quot;noble&quot; gases were inert until
1962, when it was shown that xenon combines with fluorine, the most chemically
active nonmetal. The other chemically active nonmetals are either
gases (such as hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and chlorine) or brittle, crystalline
solids (such as carbon, sulfur, phosphorus, arsenic, and iodine). Only
one nonmetallic element, bromine, is liquid under ordinary conditions.


==Compounds, Combustion, and the Conservation of Mass==

[[Image:Chemical Principles Fig 6.2.png|frame|'''Figure 6-2''' Priestley's apparatus for preparing oxygen gas.

The arrangement of the mercury bath and bell jar prevents loss of the gas evolved.]]

Most eighteenth-century chemists were devoted to preparing and describing pure compounds, and to decomposing them to the elements from which they are formed. The great advances of the time were in the chemistry of gases. In 1756, Joseph Black completely changed chemists' ideas about gases when he showed, in his M.D. thesis at Edinburgh, that marble (which we know to be primarily calcium carbonate, CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) could be decomposed to quicklime (calcium oxide, CaO) and a gas (carbon dioxide, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), and that ''the process could be reversed''. This demonstration proved that there were different kinds of gases, and that they could take part in chemical reactions just as well as liquids and solids could. One of Black's contemporaries, John Robinson, wrote the following:
::&quot;He had discovered that a cubic inch of marble consisted of about half its weight of pure lime and as much air as would fill a vessel holding six wine gallons.... What could be more singular than to find so subtile a substance as air existing in the form of a hard stone, and its presence accompanied by such a change in the properties of the stone?&quot;

In the following years, Henry Cavendish discovered hydrogen (1766),
Daniel Rutherford found nitrogen (1772), and Joseph Priestley invented
carbonated water and identified nitrous oxide (&quot;laughing gas&quot;), nitric oxide,
carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrogen chloride, ammonia, and oxygen.
In 1781 , Cavendish proved that water is a combination of only hydrogen
and oxygen, after he had witnessed Priestley explode the two gases in
what Priestley later recalled as &quot;a random experiment to entertain a few
philosophical friends.&quot; The discovery of oxygen (Figure 6-2) led Antoine
Lavoisier to overthrow the predominant idea of eighteenth-century chemistry,
the phlogiston theory. The process by which this theory was shattered
illustrates the great importance of quantitative measurements in chemistry.

===Phlogiston===

When Empedocles watched wood burn, he was impressed with the idea that
something ''left'' the wood; only a light fluffy ash remained. It became generally
accepted that combustion was the decomposition of a substance accompanied
by a loss of weight. Metal oxides are usually less dense and less
compact than the metals from which they come. Even when it became
known that the oxide was heavier than the original metal, a confusion
between density (weight per unit volume) and weight itself compounded
the error. The Germans Johann Becher and Georg Stahl proposed, in 1702,
that all combustible material contains an element called '''phlogiston''', which
escapes when the material burns. According to their theory,
::1. Metals, when heated, lose phlogiston and become '''calces'''. (A calx is a crumbly residue.)
::2. Calces, when heated with charcoal, reabsorb phlogiston and become metals again. The charcoal is necessary because the original phlogiston has become scattered through the surrounding atmosphere and lost.
::3. Charcoal must therefore be very rich in phlogiston.

By this theory, a lit match goes out when it is placed in a closed bottle
because the air in the bottle becomes saturated with phlogiston; respiration
in living organisms is a purification process in which phlogiston is removed;
a mouse under a bell jar eventually dies when the air around him has
absorbed all the phlogiston it can.

Think about these ideas for a while. So long as you make no weighing
experiments, this theory explains combustion as well as our present ideas do,
and seems to agree with common-sense observations about the appearance
of metals and calces. Jean Rey, in France, had demonstrated that tin gains
weight when it burns, but chemists, unaccustomed to attaching much importance
to weight, overlooked the significance of Rey's work. In 1723,
Stahl gave a clever explanation for Rey's finding:
::&quot;The fact that metals when transformed into their calces increase in
weight, does not disprove the phlogiston theory, but, on the contrary,
confirms it, because phlogiston is lighter than air, and, in combining with
substances, strives to lift them, and so decrease their weight; consequently,
a substance which has lost phlogiston must be heavier than before.&quot;

It is no wonder that hydrogen, when it was discovered, was hailed as the first preparation of pure phlogiston! Again there was a confusion between the two ideas of weight and of density (in terms of buoyancy).

===Conservation of Mass===

Lavoisier discovered that mercuric calx lost weight when it was heated and
free mercury and a gas were produced. He measured the volume of gas
released. Then he showed that when mercury was reconverted to calx,
the same volume of this gas was reabsorbed and there was a weight increase
equal to the earlier loss. On the basis of careful weighing experiments such
as these, Lavoisier proposed that combustible materials burn by ''adding''
oxygen, thus increasing in weight. (''Oxygen'' was his name for the gas. Priestley
called it ''dephlogisticated air'' since it could apparently absorb even more
phlogiston than atmospheric air could.) Lavoisier demonstrated that the
products obtained from burning wood, sulfur, phosphorus, charcoal, and
other substances were gases whose weight always exceeded that of the solids
that burned. His rebuttal to the metallurgical explanations of Becher and
Stahl was as follows:
::1. Metals combine with oxygen from the air to form calces, which are oxides.
::2. Hot charcoal removes oxygen from calces to form a metal and a gas, 0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (at that time called ''fixed air'').
::3. Charcoal, therefore, does not combine with the ''metal'')· rather, it removes the oxygen that had previously been combined with the metal in the calx.

The key to this theory was the chemical balance. Lavoisier was the first
chemist to realize the importance of the principle of the conservation of
mass. In his ''Traite Etementaire de Chimie'') he wrote:
::&quot;We must lay it down as an incontestable axiom, that in all the operations of art and nature, nothing is created; an equal quantity of matter exists both before and after the experiment .... Upon this principle, the whole art of performing chemical experiments depends.&quot;

Lavoisier was a businessman first and a chemist second. His full-time
occupation was as a member of the ''Ferme Generale'') an agency that collected
taxes on a commission basis for the French government before the revolution.
One of his biographers has called his conservation of mass dictum the
&quot;principle of the balance sheet,&quot; and has claimed to see its origin in his
role as tax collector. Be that as it may, in 1794, his connection with the
''Ferme Generale'' cost him his life. *
::&lt;small&gt;*Hailed before a revolutionary tribunal because of his past aristocratic associations, Lavoisier heard Coffinhal, president of the tribunal, reject a plea for clemency: &quot;The Republic has no need of chemists and savants. The course of justice shall not be interrupted.&quot; This was surely one of the most serious governmental cutbacks in the history of science.&lt;/small&gt;

Lavoisier published his textbook, ''Traite Etementaire de Chimie'') in 1789,
and it would be difficult to overemphasize the impact that it had on chemistry.
In addition to setting forth the principle of conservation of mass in
chemical reactions and overthrowing the phlogiston theory, the book contained
in an appendix what is essentially our present system of nomenclature.
For a generation, therefore, chemistry became &quot;the French science&quot;
(the phrase lingered longer in France than elsewhere).

==Does a Compound Have a Fixed Composition?==

After Lavoisier, chemists began an intensive study of quantities in chemical
reaction, that is, masses. The distinction between compounds and mixtures
or solutions gradually became clear. A feud developed between those who
claimed that the ratios of elements in compounds were fixed and those who
believed that a continuous range of proportions was possible. The French
chemist Berthollet cited alloys of metals in support of the idea of variable
composition. But]. L. Proust, in Madrid, insisted that compounds had fixed
composition, and correctly recognized alloys as solid solutions, not compounds:
::&quot;The properties of true compounds are invariable as is the ratio of their constituents. Between pole and pole, they are found identical in these two respects; their appearance may vary owing to the manner of aggregation, but their [chemical] properties never. No differences have yet been observed between the oxides of iron from the South and those from the North. The cinnabar of Japan is constituted according to the same ratio as that of Spain. Silver is not differently oxidized or muriated in the muriate of Peru than in that of Siberia.&quot;

This principle has been called the '''law of constant composition'''. The dispute between Berthollet and Proust had the good effect of sending chemists to the laboratory to prove the ideas of one or the other camps, and incidentally to compile rapidly a body of knowledge about chemical composition. *Of course, Proust was right; yet there are solid crystalline materials in which, because of defects in the crystal structure, the same ratio of atoms is not quite that predicted by the ideal chemical formula. For example, iron sulfide can vary from Fe&lt;sub&gt;1.1&lt;/sub&gt;S to FeS&lt;sub&gt;1.1&lt;/sub&gt;, depending on how the sample is prepared. Such substances are called ''nonstoichiometric solids'', although it has been suggested that they be called &quot;berthollides&quot; after the loser in the debate just discussed.
::&lt;small&gt;*The orthodox viewpoint is that they went to the laboratory to decide between two conflicting theories. Let us be honest: Scientists are people, and science is seldom conducted in such a nonpartisan vacuum.&lt;/small&gt;

===Equivalent Proportions===

Between 1792 and 1802, an obscure German chemist named Jeremias Richter made an important discovery that was almost completely ignored by his contemporaries. His idea was the one of the '''equivalent proportions''': The same relative amounts of two elements that combine with on another will also combine with a third element (assuming that the reactions are possible at all). This concept is easy to understand from a few examples:
::1 g oh hydrogen combines with 8 g of oxygen to form water.
::1 g of hydrogen combines with 3 g of carbon to form methane. 
::1 g of hydrogen combines with 35.5 g of chlorine to form hydrogen chloride.
::1 g of hydrogen combines with 25 g of arsenic to form arsine. 

The chemical reactions and formulas (which were not known at the time) are, in fact, 
::2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
::2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
::H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
::3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Using modern atomic weights, verify that the preceding statements about
weights involved in the reactions are true.

Richter's law of equivalent proportion states that if carbon and oxygen
combine they should do so in the ratio of 3 to 8 by weight. This is true for
what we now know to be CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. If they react, carbon and chlorine should do
so in the ratio of 3 to 35.5, and this is true for the liquid that we now know
as carbon tetrachloride, CCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. In a similar way, arsenic forms AsCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and
As&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and chlorine and oxygen form Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.

===Combining Weights===

[[Image: Chemical Principles Fig 6.3.png|frame|'''Figure 6-3''' Weights of elements that combine with one another in form ing the compounds indicated. We can pred ict from the diagram that 25.0 g of arsenic, for example, will combine with 35.5 9 of chlorine or 16.0 9 of sulfur. This, in fact, does occur. Arsenic and chlorine react In the predicted weight ratio to give arsenic trichloride (AsCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). whereas arsenic and sulfur react in the predicted ratio to give the compound arsenous sulfide (As&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).]]

A '''combining weight''' can be defined for each element as the weight of the element that combines with 1 g of hydrogen. If no hydrogen compound exists, it is the weight that combines with 8 g  of oxygen or with one combining weight of some other element that does form a hydrogen compound. In this way a branching network of reactions can lead to a table of combining weights for all the elements. Richter's principle, if true, assures us that there will be no contradictions within the table. Such a set of combining weights for all the elements. Richter's principle, if true, assures us that there will be no contradictions within the table. Such a set of combining weights is shown in Figure 6-3 and Table 6-1.

There is one serious flaw to this scheme, which is why no one took Richter very seriously. The flaw is that many elements appear to have ''more than one'' combining weight. Carbon forms a second oxide (we know it now as carbon monoxide, CO), in which the ratio of carbon to oxygen is only 3 to 4. Either the combining weight of carbon has risen to 6, or that of oxygen has fallen to 4. In ethane (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) the combining weight of carbon is 4, in ethylene (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) it is 6, and in acetylene (C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) it is 12. The expected oxide of sulfur, SO, does not appear, and in the two most common oxides (SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) sulfur has combining weights of 8 and 5&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{1}{3}&lt;/math&gt;(Figure 6-4).

[[Image: Chemical Principles Fig 6.4.png|frame|'''Figure 6-4''' Variable combining weights for sulfur and carbon. Note that in this figure and in Figure 6-3 there are three combining weights for sulfur: 5.33 g, 8.00 g, and 16.0 g. These weights are in the ratios of 2:3:6. The two combining weights for carbon are in the ratio of 1:2.]]

[[Image:Chemical Principles Table 6.1.png]]

Nitrogen is particularly troublesome. In ammonia it has a combining
weight of 4&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt;, and in the three oxides known since Priestley's time its combining
weights are 3&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, 7, and 14. If you know chemical formulas, the
combining weights are easy to calculate, and you should be able to check
them. But if you know ''only'' the combining weights, could you deduce the
formulas? The significance of the ratios of elements in compounds was
obscured even more by the habit of reporting composition in percent by
weight; it was John Dalton who developed the trick of writing them as
ratios to one common element and setting up combining weight tables, .
which we still do. When Humphry Davy reported that the three oxides
of nitrogen contained 29.50%, 44.05%, and 63.30% nitrogen by weight, no
one noticed that the nitrogen was combining in the relative ratios of 1 to
2 to 4. (These percentages are Davy's experimental values. What are the
correct percentages?) By 1802, it was established that compounds had fixed
compositions, and that there could be several such definite compositions
between the same two elements. Yet no one knew why, or where to go
from there.

==John Dalton and the Theory of Atoms==

[[Image:Chemical Principles Fig 6.5.png|frame|'''Figure 6-5''' Dalton's oriinal symbolism for reactions that form simple compounds. Modern symbols appear beneath them. The namees to the right are Dalton's. When either the formula or the name of the product is different today, the modern formula or name is given in parentheses.]]

John Dalton, a science (or &quot;natural philosophy&quot;) teacher in the Manchester, England, schools was compelled by such data as those in Section 6-3 to propose a theory of atoms, which he presented to the Literary and Philosophical Society of Manchester in 1802 and published three years later. His theory was as follows:
::1. All matter is made up of atoms. These are the ultimate particles, and are indivisible and indestructible. 
::2. All atoms of a given element are identical, both in weight and in chemical properties. 
::3. Atoms of different elements have a different weights and different chemical properties. 
::4. Atoms of different elements can combine in simple whole numbers to form compounds.
::5. When a compound is decomposed, the recovered atoms are unchanged and can form the same or new compounds. 

Dalton also emphasized weights, as had Lavoisier; furthermore, Dalton invented a convenient symbolism for atoms, shown in Figure 6-5. Dalton's symbol for hydrogen represents more than merely an unspecified amount of hydrogen. It represents either one ''atom'' of hydrogen or some standard weight
of hydrogen containing a standard number of atoms (such as the atomic weight containing Avogadro's number of atoms). Chemical formulas and equations are therefore not merely symbolic, but quantitative.

===The Greek Atomic Theory===

The idea of atoms was far from new. Democritus and the Epicureans in Greece had proposed an atomic theory, about 400 B.C., that contained virtually all of Dalton's ideas on the subject. The original writings are lost, but we know of this theory from attacks by its opponents and from a long poem written, in 55 &lt;sub&gt;B.C.&lt;/sub&gt;, by a Roman Epicurean, Lucretius. (The poem is entitled ''De Rerum Natura'', &quot;On the Nature of Things.&quot;) After Lucretius, the ideas of atomism drifted in and out of alchemy for nearly 1900 years without making a significant impact on it. Isaac Newton and Lavoisier
both believed in atoms, but more as philosophical concepts or figures of speech that helped in thinking about reactions than as a theory requiring experiment.

There is an important point here that cannot be overstressed. A theory
in science is important ''if, and only if,'' it makes the understanding of the
behavior of the real world clearer. Describing bronze as a substitutional
alloy of tin and copper is superior to describing it as the confluence of
Jupiter and Venus, in alchemical terminology, because the tin-copper
theory suggests experiments by which the properties of bronze might be
explained, predicted, and even improved, whereas the &quot;celestial marriage&quot;
theory leads nowhere. But perhaps it is less apparent that Democritus'
atomic theory, and even Newton's, was not much of an improvement on
this celestial marriage idea; it was Dalton's measurements, explanations,
and predictions that made atomic theory valuable.

===Fixed Ratios===

Dalton took the table of combining weights as his point of departure and
asked why the ratios of elements in compounds should be fixed. His answer
was that ''a compound consists of a large number of identical molecules, each of which is built up from the same small number of atoms, arranged in the same way.'' Yet Dalton
still needed to know how many atoms of carbon and oxygen combined in
each molecule of an oxide of carbon, and how many hydrogen and oxygen
atoms combined in a water molecule. Lacking any other guide, he proposed
a &quot;rule of simplicity&quot; that started him off well but eventually landed him in
serious trouble. The most stable two-element molecule, he reasoned, would
be the simple diatomic one, AB. If only one compound of two elements were
known, it would be an AB compound. Next most stable would be the
triatomic molecules, AB&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;B. If only two or three compounds of two
elements were known, they would be of these three types. This rule was one
of those principles of economy, like the minimization of energy in mechanics or the principle of least action in physics, which are sometimes right, and
sometimes wrong. Dalton was wrong.

Dalton began by mistakenly assuming from his rule of simplicity that
water had a diatomic formula, HO. This made the atomic weight of
oxygen equal to its combining weight of 8 (all relative to 1 for hydrogen).
He then turned to the oxides of carbon and nitrogen; the possible choices are
shown in Table 6-2. (All atomic weights in this discussion are based on the
true numerical values, not on Dalton's values. He was a notoriously poor
experimentalist. The atomic weight of oxygen, even on his own terms, began
at 6.5 and slowly worked up to 8.) One oxide of carbon had a carbon-to-oxygen
ratio of 0.75, and the other had a ratio of 0.375. If the first oxide
were CO- he assumed that one of them had to be-then, as Table 6-2 shows,
the other would be CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; , Thus, the atomic weight of carbon would be 6. If
the second oxide were CO, the first would have to be C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0. (Can you prove
this?) Then carbon would have an atomic weight of 3. Since oxide A was
more stable to decomposition, he argued that this one must be CO, and
correctly chose possibility 1. For the oxides of nitrogen, he similarly ruled
out possibilities 1 and 3 because the five-atom molecules clashed with his
rule of simplicity; and he again made the correct assignment of an atomic
weight of 7 for nitrogen. (Correct, that is, relative to 8 for oxygen.)

[[Image:Chemical Principles Table 6.2.png]]

Dalton should have sensed trouble as soon as he came to ammonia. He
assumed by the rule of simplicity that the molecular formula for ammonia
was NH. However, since 4&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt; g of nitrogen combines with 1 g of hydrogen,
this assumption would have meant an atomic weight of 4&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{2}{3}&lt;/math&gt; for nitrogen, a
value in conflict with the number 7 calculated from the oxides. As an
alternative, he could have kept the atomic weight of 7 and worked out the
formula for ammonia:
::Hydrogen: &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{1 g of hydrogen}{1 g mole^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt; = 1 mole of hydrogen atoms
::Nitrogen: &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{4\frac{2}{3}g of nitrogen}{7 g mole^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt; = 0.667 mole of nitrogen atoms

With the molar ratio of hydrogen to nitrogen (and therefore the ratio of atoms as well) being 1:0.667, or 3:2, the chemical formula would have to be N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, N&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, or some higher multiple. Such a result would have shaken Dalton's faith in the rule of simplicity, and might have forced him to go back and find the right track. Yet he was undone by the poor quality of his experimental data. His initial value for the combining weight of oxygen was 6.5, which he raised to 7 in 1808. Davy increased it 7.5, and Proust finally arrived at the correct figure (given Dalton's assumptions) of 8. Dalton refused to believe their values (a stubborn attitude for such a poor experimentalist), and all the nitrogen calculations described here were carried out by Dalton with a nitrogen atomic weight of 5 rather than 7.

===Law of Multiple Proportions===

It is easy to be critical of a man who has gone astray because of bad data. But the real achievement of the atomic theory, which made people accept it almost at once, was not the calculation of atomic weights. It was the atomic theory explained perfectly a principle that had lain unnoticed in he published literature for over 15 years, relating elements that combine to form more than one compound. This was Dalton's '''law of multiple proportions'''. 

The law of multiple proportions states that if two elements combine to form more than one compound, then the amounts of one element that combine with a fixed amount of the other will differ by factors that are the ratios of small whole numbers. (Or, that you can multiply the amounts by a suitable constant and produce a set of integers.) Since we have been using combining weights, perhaps a more meaningful statement is that if an element shows several combining weights, these weights will differ among themselves by ratios of small whole numbers. For example, the combining weights of carbon in Table 6-1 differ in the ratios of 3 to 4 to 6 to 12, or, more revealingly, in the ratio of 1/4 to 1/3 to 1/2 to 1. The combining weights for sulfur are in the ratios of 1 to 1/2 to 1/3, and the ones for nitrogen are 1/3 to 1/4 to 1/2 to 1 in NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, NO, and N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Dalton's explanation of these simple fractions was that one, or two, or small number of atoms could combine with one of another kind, but that a molecule with 1.369... atoms combined with 1 atom of another was physically impossible according to atomic theory. The combining weights differ by small whole number fractions because the atoms combine in small whole numbers. 

A search through the chemical literature showed that this law was the universal rule. It is one thing to prove your theory with new data that you have collected, but it is much more impressive to prove it with everyone else's; this is what Dalton did. The acceptance of the atomic theory was rapid and almost unanimous.


==Equal Numbers In Equal Volumes: Gay-Lussac and Avogadro==

As chemists tried to deduce formulas for more and more compounds, the flaws in Dalton's atomic weights and in his rule of simplicity became more and more obvious. No one could come up with dependable method of deciding on chemical formulas. Of the three pieces of molecular information -combining weights of the elements, atomic weights of the elements, and molecular formulas- any one could be calculated if the other two were known. Yet only one, the combining weight, was directly measurable. Dalton's wrong assumptions about formulas led to wrong atomic weights, which led back again to wrong formulas were assigned to acetic acid, the common acid of vinegar. The confusion was so great that some chemists despaired for the atomic theory. Jean Dumas wrote:
::&quot;If I were in charge, I would efface the word atom from science, for I am persuaded that it goes far beyond experience, and chemistry must never go beyond experience.&quot;

The great German chemist Friedrich Wöhler  complained, even as early as 1835, that
::&quot;...organic chemistry just now is enough to drive one mad. It gives me the impression of a primeval tropical forest, full of the most remarkable things, a monstrous and boundless thicket, with no way to escape, into which one may well dread to enter.&quot;

However, the key to dilemma was already in the chemical literature, and had been since 1811. The first step was provided by Gay-Lussac, and the second by Avogadro.


===Gay-Lussac===

[[Image:Chemical Principles Fig 6.6.png|frame|'''Figure 6-6''' Gay-Lussac's results on the combining volumes of gases and the explanations by (a) Dalton and (b) Avogadro. Gay-Lussac found that one volume of hydrogen and one of chlorine produce two volumes of HCl gas, and that two volumes of hydrogen react with one of oxygen to produce two volumes of steam. (a) Dalton agreed that if the volume of HCl is twice the volume of either hydrogen or chlorine there must be half as many molecules per volume unit in HCL. Similarly, if there are ''n'' molecules of hydrogen per unit
of volume, and if each of these molecules produces a water molecule in the same total
volume, there will also be ''n'' molecules per volume unit in water. But only half the
volume of oxygen is required, so the density of oxygen must be 2''n'' molecules per volume
unit. Thus. in hydrogen chloride, hydrogen, chlorine, water, and oxygen, the numbers of
molecules per volume unit are ''n''/2, ''n'', ''n'', and 2''n''. (b) Avogadro proposed that each
molecule of hydrogen, chlorine. or oxygen contains two atoms. All the participants in the
HCl reaction would therefore have the same number of molecules per volume unit of gas.
Applying this same assumption to the water reaction led to a new formula for water,
H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, and ultimately to a complete revision of Dalton's atomic weight scale.]]

In 1808, Joseph Gay-Lussac (1778-1850) began a series of experiments with the ''volumes'' of reacting gases. He found that equal volumes of HCL gas and ammonia form neutral, solid ammonium chloride. An initial excess of either gas is left over at the end of the reaction. Two volumes of hydrogen react with one of oxygen to form two volumes of steam; three volumes of hydrogen
react with one of nitrogen to yield two volumes of ammonia; and one
volume of hydrogen reacts with one of chlorine to produce two volumes of
HCl gas. In these and other experiments, in which the gas reactions were
usually explosions triggered by a spark in an enclosed container, Gay-Lussac
always found that gases react [in simple whole number units of volume
units 1 provided that after the explosion the products are brought back to the
temperature and pressure of the initial gases. 

Gay-Lussac was a cautious man and a protégé of Berthollet, who as we
have seen did not believe in compounds with fixed compositions. Gay-Lussac
drew no conclusions in his ''Memoire'', but the possibility of a connection
with Dalton's atomic theory was apparent.

===Avogadro===

Dalton used Gay-Lussac's data to &quot;prove&quot; that equal volumes of gas do not
have equal numbers of molecules, another wrong turn, like his rule of
simplicity. Dalton's argument is illustrated in Figure 6-6a. The Italian
physicist Amedeo Avogadro (1776- 1856) saw another path. He began by
assuming that equal volumes of gas (at the same temperature and pressure)
contain ''equal numbers of molecules''. As Figure 6-6b shows, this assumption
requires that gases of the reactive elements such as hydrogen, oxygen,
chlorine, and nitrogen be composed of two-atom molecules instead of single,
isolated atoms. If Avogadro had been believed when he published his ideas
in 1811, a half-century of confusion in chemistry would have been avoided.
To many people, though, his ideas seemed like one shaky assumption (equal
numbers in equal volumes) buttressed by an even shakier one (diatomic
molecules). At that time, ideas of chemical bonding were based almost entirely
on electrical attraction and repulsion, and it was difficult for scientists
to understand how two ''identical'' atoms could do anything but repel each
other. And if they did attract, why did they not form larger molecules, such
as H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;? Jöns Jakob Berzelius (1779- 1848) used data on the vapors of
sulfur and phosphorus to undercut Avogadro. Yet Berzelius did not realize
that these were examples of just such higher aggregates (S&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; and P&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).
Avogadro himself did not help matters; he mixed terminology so much that
it sometimes appeared as if he were splitting hydrogen atoms (&quot;elementary
molecules&quot;) rather than separating atoms in a diatomic molecule (&quot;integral
molecules&quot;).


==Cannizzaro and A Rational Method Of Calculating Atomic Weights==

By 1860, the confusion about atomic weights was so widespread that nearly
every chemist of any repute had his own private method of writing chemical
formulas. August Kekulé (the inventor of the Kekulé structure for benzene)
called a conference in Karlsruhe, Germany, to try to reach some kind of an
agreement. The man who settled the entire issue was the Italian Stanislao
Cannizzaro (1826-1910), who based a rigorous method for finding atomic
weights on the long-ignored work of his countryman Avogadro.

Cannizzaro's reasoning, based on Avogadro's principle that equal
volumes of gas contain equal numbers of molecules, was as follows:
::1. Assume that the atomic weight of hydrogen is 1.0, and that hydrogen gas is made up of diatomic molecules, as Gay-Lussac's gas volume experiments suggest.
::2. Assume that Avogadro was correct in deducting that oxygen gas is also diatomic, O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and hence that the molecular formula for water is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, not HO. (See Figure 6-6b.) Since the combining weight of oxygen in water is 8.0, the atomic weight of oxygen must be 16.0, and the molecular weight of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; must be 32.0.
::3. If equal volumes of all gases contain equal numbers of molecules, then the molecular weight (''m'') of a gas is proportional to the density (''D'') of the gas: ''M'' = ''k D''. Use H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to evaluate the proportionality constant, ''k'':

::{|
  |
  |-border=0

  |- border=0

  |- border=0
  | H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || &amp;emsp; || 0.0894 || &amp;emsp; || 2.0 || &amp;emsp; || 22.37
  |-border=0
  | O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; || &amp;emsp; || 1.427 || &amp;emsp; || 32.0 || &amp;emsp; || &lt;u&gt;22.42&lt;/u&gt;
  |-border=0
  |  || &amp;emsp; ||  || &amp;emsp; || Average Value: || &amp;emsp; || 22.4
  |
  |}

(The fact that ''k'' is the same or both H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; indicated that Cannizzaro was on the right track.)
::4. Evaluate the molecular weights of a series of compounds containing the elements whose atomic weights are to be determined. Starting with percent composition by weight from chemical analyses, and molecular weights calculated from gas densities, calculate the weight of each element ''per molecular unit''. Look over these weights for a given element to see if the numbers can be interpreted as integral multiples of some common factor, which may then be the atomic weight. 

In the data given in Table 6-3, carbon occurs only in multiples of 12, hydrogen
in multiples of 1, and chlorine in multiples of 35.3. Hence the atomic
weight of carbon cannot be greater than 12, although it could be an integral
submultiple of 12, such as 6, 4, or 3.

[[Image:Chemical Principles Table 6.3.png]]

The atomic weights obtained by Cannizzaro's method are either the
true atomic weights or integral multiples of them. If just ethane, benzene,
and ethyl chloride had been included in the table, then the conclusion
might have been drawn that the atomic weight of carbon was 24. If information
from other carbon compounds had been added to the table, and
just ''one'' analysis gave a weight of 6 for carbon, then the lower value would
have to have been accepted, making the probable formulas C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;,
C&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;HCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and so on. However, no matter how many carbon compounds were analyzed by Cannizzaro's method, the weight per molecular
unit always came out to be an integral multiple of 12. Hence this value
was accepted as the atomic weight of carbon.

Cannizzaro's achievement was the last link in the chain of logic that
began with Proust and the law of constant composition. The battle was
over, save for the computing. Scientists could find accurate atomic weights
for any element that appeared in compounds having measurable vapor
densities. With these atomic weights, the percent composition of a new
compound would lead unambiguously to the chemical formula. The ''mole''
was defined as we have stated in Chapter 1, that is, as the number of
grams of a compound equal to its molecular weight on Cannizzaro's scale
(which is the one we use today, with improvements in accuracy). It was
realized that a mole of any compound would have the same number of
molecules. Although the value of that number was not then known, it was
named ''Avogadro's number'', ''N'', in belated recognition of his contribution.

With the hindsight that comes from knowledge of the ideal gas law,
we can see that Cannizzaro's constant ''k'' is simply ''RT/P'':

::''PV'' = ''nRT'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{wRT}{M}&lt;/math&gt;
::''PM'' = ''DRT''
::''k'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{M}{D} = \frac{RT}{P}&lt;/math&gt;

The gas density values that were used in the previous demonstration of
Cannizzaro's argument are those at standard temperature and pressure or
STP: 1.00 atm and 273 K. Thus,
::''k'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{0.08205 \times 273}{1.00}&lt;/math&gt; liters mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; = 22.4 liters mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

The probable atomic weight of sulfur is therefore 32.0 g mole&lt;sub&gt;-1&lt;/sub&gt;.

{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;

|-
|Suppose that another compound, ''w'', has a vapor density of 1.38 g liter&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, and an analysis of 38.7% C, 9.4% H, and 51.6% S by weight. How would this force you to revise your conclusions for Example 1?
|-
|'''Solution'''
The molecular weight of compound ''w'' would be 31.0 g mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, and the percent composition would indicate 12.0 g or 1 mole of C per mole, 2.9 g or 3 moles of H, and only 16.0 g of sulfur. Hence the revised atomic weight of S would be 16.0 g mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and the formula for molecule ''w'' would be CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S. The formula for ''x'' then would be CS&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;; for ''y'', CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ; and for ''z'', C&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Needless to say, a compound such as ''w'' has never been observed, and the atomic weight of 32.0 for sulfur is valid.

By calculations such as these, a consistent set of atomic weights was
obtained for the lighter elements that can be found in gaseous molecules.

==Atomic Weights for the Heavy Elements: Dulong and Petit==

One problem remained: What does one do about the heavy elements,
especially metals, that cannot be prepared readily in gaseous compounds?
The problem can be illustrated by considering lead and silver.

{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;
|+'''Example 3'''
|-
|The combining weight of lead (amount per 8.00 g of oxygen) in lead oxide is 51.8 g. What is the atomic weight of lead?
|-
|'''Solution'''
We know that 103.6 of lead combine with 16 g, or 1 mole, of oxygen atoms,
but we can go no further without knowing the chemical formula for
lead oxide. Hence, we are caught in the same vicious circle from which
Cannizzaro escaped for the lighter atoms. ''If'' the formula is PbO, then the
atomic weight oflead is 103.6. But if the formula is Pb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, the atomic weight
is 51.8, and if PbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 207.2. Can you show that, in general, if the formula
for lead oxide is Pb&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;, the atomic weight of lead will be 103.6 (y/x)? The
problem has several solutions.

{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;
|+'''Example 4'''
|-
|Silver oxide is 93.05% silver by weight. What is the atomic weight of silver?
|-
|'''Solution'''
If we take, for simplicity, a specimen sample of 100 g, there will be 93.05 g of
silver for every 6.95 g of oxygen. The combining weight of silver (amount
per 8.00 g of oxygen) is then 93.05 g &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; (8.00 g/6.95 g) = 107.1 g. One mole
of oxygen atoms combines with twice this amount, or 214.2 g, of silver. The
choice of atomic weight now is limited to a set of multiples or fractions of
107.1 g, depending on what we assume the formula to be.

  |- border=0
  | Atomic Weight: || 107.1 || 142.8 || 214.2 || 321.3 || 428.4

We need some means of deciding among these values. Without further information a choice cannot be made.

Pierre Dulong (1785-1838) and Alexis Petit (1791-1820) had discovered
a method of estimating atomic weights of the heavier elements in
1819, but it had been overlooked in the general confusion that attended
chemistry at that time. They made a systematic study of all physical
properties that could possibly have a correlation with atomic weight, and
found a good one in the heat capacities of solids. The '''gram heat capacity'''
of a substance is the number of joules of heat needed to raise the temperature
of 1 g of the substance by 1°C. It is an easily measured property. The
product of the gram heat capacity and the atomic weight of an element is
the heat required to raise the temperature of 1 mole by 1°C, or the '''molar heat capacity'''. Dulong and Petit noticed that for many solid elements whose
atomic weight was known the molar heat capacity was very close to 25 J
deg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; (Table 6-4). This indicates that the process of heat absorption
must be related more strongly to the number of atoms of matter present
than to the mass of matter. Later work on the theory of heat capacities of
solids has shown that there should be such a constant molar heat capacity
for simple solids. Dulong and Petit gave no explanation, however.

Since they advanced no reason for this phenomenon, at the time it was
regarded by most chemists as being as dubious as Dalton's rule of simplicity
(which was wrong) or Avogadro's principle of equal volumes/equal number
of molecules (which was right). It was not until Cannizzaro prepared the
way with light atoms that the method of Dulong and Petit was appreciated
for heavy atoms.

We now can choose among the possible precise values of atomic weight
derived from analytical data by using an approximate value obtained by
assuming, with Dulong and Petit, that the molar heat capacity is approximately
constant for all solids, 25 J deg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

[[Image:Chemical Principles Table 6.4.png]]

{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;
|+'''Example 5'''
|-
|The heat capacities of lead and silver, as tabulated by Dulong and Petit, are 0.123 and 0.233 J deg&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; g&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. Use this information to choose the proper atomic weights for Examples 3 and 4.
|-
|'''Solution'''
::Approximate atomic weight of lead = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{25}{0.123}&lt;/math&gt; = 203
::Approximate atomic weight of silver = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{25}{0.233}&lt;/math&gt; = 107
The correct choices from the previous examples must be 207.2 for lead and 107.1 for silver; the chemical formulas then are PbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.

Assuming that you know the atomic weight of sulfur to be 32.06, compute the atomic weight of cobalt and write the correct empirical formula for linnaeite.
|-
|'''Solution'''
The correct answers are 59 and Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.

==Combining Capacities, &quot;Valence,&quot; and Oxidation Number==

With Dalton's atomic theory, and with the contributions of Avogadro,
Dulong and Petit, and Cannizzaro, it became possible to deduce atomic
weights for elements from chemical analyses and physical data such as vapor
densities and heat capacities. These deductions have given us the table of
atomic weights shown on the inside back cover. The next great task of
chemistry was to explain the formulas that could be derived.

The most primitive concept in chemical bonding is probably the idea
of combining capacity, sometimes called &quot;valence.&quot; The combining
capacity of an element in a given compound is defined as the ratio of its
true atomic weight to its combining weight in that compound:

::Combining capacity = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{atomic weight }{combining weight}&lt;/math&gt;

Hydrogen has a combining capacity of 1, by definition. Oxygen has a
combining capacity of 2 in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and most other compounds, but a combining
capacity of 1 in hydrogen peroxide, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Using the data in Table
6-1, we can see that Cl and Br have combining capacities of 1; Ca, 2; and
As, 3; carbon shows several combining capacities: 4, 3, 2, and 1. Sulfur has a
combining capacity of 2 in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S, 4 in S0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and 6 in SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Nitrogen has a
combining capacity of 3 in ammonia, 4 in NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 2 in NO, and 1 in N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.
Notice that in these two-element compounds the total combining capacity
of one element exactly balances the total combining capacity of the other.
In SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; one sulfur atom with a combining capacity of 6 balances three
oxygen atoms having a capacity of 2 each. The formulation of the concept
of combining capacity or &quot;valence&quot; was the first step toward a theory of
chemical bonding. The second step was to assign plus and minus signs to
these combining capacities so that the sum of the signed capacities for a
molecule is zero. Hydrogen was assigned the value +1; therefore the value
for oxygen had to be -2 so the sum for water, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, would be zero. The
formula for sulfuric acid, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, requires that sulfur be associated with the
value +6:
::H: &amp;emsp; 2 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; +1 = +2 
::O: &amp;emsp; 4 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; -2 = -8
::S: &amp;emsp; 1 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; +6 = &lt;u&gt;+6&lt;/u&gt;
::Sum: &amp;emsp; &amp;emsp; &amp;emsp; &amp;emsp;0

These signed combining capacities are just the oxidation numbers that we
encountered in Chapter 1. They are important in theories of chemical
bonding because they describe how electrons are shifted toward or away
from atoms in a molecule.

==Summary==

This chapter has chronicled the process by which scientists deduced that chemical compounds are made up of specific numbers of atoms of different kinds having specific atomic weights, and slowly worked out a set of reliable atomic weights. The theory of atoms originated as a philosophical concept rather than as a means of manipulating substances and reactions. Antoine Lavoisier laid the foundation by establishing that mass was the fundamental quantity in chemical reactions. John Dalton turned the philosophy into reality by showing that the atomic theory would account for the experimental observations that were summarized in the '''laws of equivalent proportions and multiple proportions.'''

The task of deciding upon a set of consistent atomic weights was not
an easy one, and Dalton himself went astray. The circular argument
involving assumed atomic weights and assumed molecular formulas was not
broken until 1860, when Cannizzaro applied a principle that had been
discovered in 1811 by Avogadro but had been ignored: Under the same
conditions of temperature and pressure, equal volumes of all gases contain
equal numbers of molecules. Since this meant that gas density was proportional
to molecular weight, the way was open for establishing the standard
atomic weight scale that we still use today. The quantitative foundations
of modern chemistry had been laid.

==Introduction==

In this chapter we shall examine the correlations that exist between the
physical and chemical properties of the elements and their compounds.
These correlations lead directly to a fundamental classification scheme
for matter, the periodic table. To Ernest Rutherford, who once remarked
that there are two kinds of science-physics and stamp collecting-the
periodic table would be the ultimate stamp album. If this were the final
chapter of our book, his impression would be confirmed. But we organize
the elements of the universe into the periodic table so chemistry can begin,
not end. Once we have established the classification scheme, we must set
out to explain it, in terms of electrons and the other subatomic particles
from which atoms are constructed. This explanation is the task of later
chapters. But before we begin to theorize about the world, let's see what it's
really like.

==Early Classification Schemes==

Very early in the development of chemistry, chemists recognized that certain
elements have similar properties. In the earliest classification scheme,
there were only two divisions, metals and nonmetals. Metallic elements
have a certain lustrous appearance, they are malleable (can be hammered
into thin sheets) and ductile (can be drawn into wires), they conduct heat
and electricity, and they form compounds with oxygen that are basic (alkaline).
Nonmetallic elements have no one characteristic appearance, they generally
do not conduct heat and electricity, and they form acidic oxides.

===Döbereiner's Triads===

In 1829, the German chemist Johann Dobereiner observed several groups
of three elements (''triads'') with similar chemical properties. In every case
the atomic weight of one element in the triad was nearly the average of the
other two. For example, each element in the triad ''chlorine'', ''bromine'', and
''iodine'' forms colored vapors containing diatomic molecules. Each element
combines with metals and has a combining weight equal to its atomic
weight. Each element forms ions with oxygen that have a single negative
charge: ClO&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, ClO&lt;math&gt;_3^-&lt;/math&gt;, BrO&lt;math&gt;_3^-&lt;/math&gt;, and IO&lt;math&gt;_3^-&lt;/math&gt;. The atomic weight of bromine (80)
is approximately the average of those of chlorine (35.5) and iodine (127).
Table 7-1 lists the similarities of elements in this and other triads.

In addition to recognizing the triads given in Table 7-1, Döbereiner 
observed a peculiar triad of the metals ''iron'', ''cobalt'', and ''nickel'', all of which have similar properties and almost the same atomic weights. The metals
are used in structural materials (steel) and may be ferromagnetic like iron;
in their +2 and +3 states they form complex ions that are colored.

This discovery of families of elements (the number 3 per family proved
to be insignificant) provided an incentive to those who were attempting to
find a rational means of classifying the elements.

===Newlands' Law of Octaves===

Between 1850 and 1865 many new elements were discovered, and chemists
made considerable progress in the determination of atomic weights. Thus,
more accurate atomic weights were made available for old elements, and
reasonably accurate values were presented for new elements. In 1865, the
English chemist John Newlands (1839–1898) explored the problem of the
periodic recurrence of similar behavior of elements. He arranged the
lightest of the known elements in order of increasing atomic weight as
follows:

::{|
  |
  |-border=0
  | H || &amp;emsp; Li || &amp;emsp;Be || &amp;emsp;B || &amp;emsp;C ||&amp;emsp; N || &amp;emsp;O
  |- border=0
  | F || &amp;emsp;Na || &amp;emsp;Mg || &amp;emsp;Al || &amp;emsp;Si || &amp;emsp;P || &amp;emsp;S
  |- border=0
  | Cl ||&amp;emsp; K || &amp;emsp;Ca || &amp;emsp;Cr || &amp;emsp;Ti || &amp;emsp;Mn || &amp;emsp;Fe
  |
  |}

Newlands noticed that the eighth element (fluorine, F) resembled the first (hydrogen, H), the ninth resembled the second, and so forth. His observation that every eighth element had similar properties led him to compare his chemical octaves with musical octaves, and he himself called it his ''law of octaves''. Periodicity by octaves in chemistry suggested to him a fundamental harmony like the one in music. The comparison, although appealing, is invalid. Had Newlands known of the noble gases, his periodicity of properties would have been by nines rather than by eights. He never would have used his musical analogy, and he might have been spared some of the ridicule and indifference that he suffered. (See the Postscript for more on Newlands.)

[[Image:Chemical Principles Table 7.1.png]]

Newlands' effort was admittedly a step in the right direction. However, three serious criticisms can be directed at his classification scheme:
::'''1.''' There were no places in his table for the new elements, which were being discovered rapidly. Moreover, in the later parts of the table, there were several places where two elements were forced into the same position. (See the Postscript.)
::'''2.''' There was no scholarly evaluation of the work on atomic weights and no selection of probable best values.
::'''3.''' Certain elements did not seem to belong where they were placed in the scheme. For example, chromium (Cr) is not sufficiently similar to aluminum (AI), nor is manganese (Mn), a metal, to phosphorus (P), a nonmetal. Iron (Fe), a metal, and sulfur (S), a nonmetal, do not resemble each other either.

==The Basis for Periodic Classification==

The development of the periodic table as we now know it is credited mainly
to the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev (1834–1907), although the
German chemist Lothar Meyer worked out essentially the same system
independently and almost simultaneously. So far as we know, neither man
was aware of Newlands' work. Mendeleev's periodic table (Figure 7-1),
presented in 1869, followed Newlands' plan of arranging the elements in
order of increasing atomic weight, but with the following substantial
improvements:
::'''1.''' Long periods were instituted for the elements now known as transition
metals. These long periods are shown folded in half in his original
table, with each full period taking two lines. This innovation removed the
necessity of placing metals such as vanadium (V), chromium, and manganese
under nonmetals such as phosphorus, sulfur, and chlorine.
::'''2.''' If the properties of an element suggested that it did not fit in the
arrangement according to atomic weight, a space was left in the table. For
example, no element existed that would fit in the space below silicon (Si).
Thus, a space was left for a new element, which was named ''ekasilicon''.
::'''3.''' A scholarly evaluation of atomic weight data was made. For example,
as a result of this work the combining capacity of chromium in its
highest oxide was changed from 5 to the correct value of 6. The combining
weight of chromium was known to be 8.66 g. Hence, instead of
43.3 (5 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 8.66), the revised atomic weight of chromium became 52.0
(6 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 8.66).

[[Image:Chemical Principles Fig 7.1.png]]

Indium (In), with a combining weight of 38.5, had been assigned a
combining capacity of 2 and therefore an atomic weight of 77, and had
been placed between arsenic (As) and selenium (Se). Since their properties
were consistent with placement below phosphorus and sulfur, which were
next to one another, arsenic and selenium also had to be side by side in
Mendeleev's scheme. A reevaluation showed that indium had an atomic
weight of 114.8 and a combining capacity of 3, which is consistent with its
position below aluminum and gallium (Ga) in the present table.

The atomic weight of platinum (Pt) had been thought to be greater
than that of gold (Au). Mendeleev thought otherwise, because of the
chemistry of the two metals and the places that they should occupy in his
table. New determinations inspired by Mendeleev showed 198 for platinum
and 199 for gold, thereby placing platinum ahead of gold and under
palladium (Pd), which of all the other elements most resembles platinum.
::'''4.''' On the basis of the known periodic behavior summarized in the
table, predictions of the properties of the undiscovered elements were made.
These predictions later proved to be amazingly accurate, as one can see by
comparing the predicted properties of ekasilicon and the properties reported
for the element called germanium (Ge), which now occupies the ekasilicon
space. This comparison is given in Table 7 -2.

[[Image:Chemical Principles Table 7.2.png]]

From the table it is evident how Mendeleev was able to predict accurately the physical and chemical properties of the missing element. Its position
in the periodic table was below silicon and above tin (Sn). The physical
properties of germanium are just about the average between those observed
for silicon and for tin. To predict the chemical properties for ekasilicon
Mendeleev also used information from the known relative properties of
phosphorus, arsenic, and antimony (Sb) in the column to the right in the
periodic table.

Correlations such as this guided the search for new elements and compounds
and stimulated investigation when known data did not conform
with other correlations. One consequence of this research was that we gained
improved values for atomic weights and densities.

===The Periodic Law===

Mendeleev summarized his discoveries in the '''periodic law''': The properties
of chemical elements are not arbitrary, but vary with the atomic weight
in a systematic way. 

After most of the elements had been discovered and their atomic
weights carefully determined, several discrepancies persisted. For example,
the order of increasing atomic weight within Mendeleev's Group VIII
(Figure 7-1) was found to be Fe, Co, Ni, Cu in the fourth period (row 4),
Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag in the fifth (row 6), and Os, Ir, Pt, Au in the sixth (row 10).
Vet Ni resembles Pd and Pt more than Co does. Again, Te has a higher
atomic weight than I, but I clearly belongs with Br and CI, and Te resembles
Se and S in chemical properties. When the noble gases were
discovered, it was revealed that Ar had a higher atomic weight than K,
whereas all the other noble gases had lower atomic weights than the
adjacent alkali metals. In these three instances, increasing atomic weight
clearly is ''not'' acceptable as a means of placing elements in the periodic
table. Therefore, the elements were assigned atomic numbers from 1 to 92
(now 105). (The atomic numbers of the elements ''approximately'' increase with
their atomic weights.) When the elements are arranged according to increasing
atomic number, chemically similar elements lie in vertical columns
(families or groups) of the periodic table.

In 1912, Henry G. J. Moseley (1887–1915) observed that the frequencies
of x rays emitted from elements could be correlated better with atomic
numbers than with atomic weights. The relationship between an element's
atomic number and the frequency (or energy) of x rays emitted from the
element is a consequence of atomic structure. As we shall see in Chapter 8,
the electrons in an atom are arranged in ''energy levels''. When an element
is bombarded by a powerful beam of electrons, electrons from the innermost
levels or shells (closest to the nucleus) can be ejected from the atoms. When
outer electrons drop into these shells to fill the vacancies, energy is emitted
as x radiation. The x-ray spectrum of an element (the collection of frequencies
of x rays emitted) contains information about the electronic energy
levels of the atom. The important point for our present purpose is that the
energy of a level varies with the charge on the nucleus of the atom. The
greater the nuclear charge, the more tightly the innermost electrons are
bound. More energy is required to knock off one of these electrons; consequently,
there is more energy emitted when an electron falls back into a
vacancy in the shells. Moseley discovered that the frequency of x rays
emitted (designated by the Greek letter P, nul varies with atomic number,
Z, according to
::&lt;math&gt;\textstyle v = c(Z - b)^2&lt;/math&gt;
in which ''c'' and ''b'' are characteristic of a given x-ray line and are the same for
all elements.

[[Image:Chemical Principles Fig 7.2.png]]

In April 1914, Moseley published the results of his work on 39 elements
from &lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt;Al to &lt;sub&gt;79&lt;/sub&gt;Au. (Recall that the atomic number is indicated by a subscript to the left of the symbol of an element.) A portion of his data [s
plotted in Figure 7 -2. Moseley wrote the following:

&quot;The spectra of the elements are arranged on horizontal lines spaced at
equal distances. The order chosen for the elements is the order of the
atomic weights, except in the cases of Ar, Co, and Te, where this clashes
with the order of the chemical properties. Vacant lines have been left for an
element between Mo and Ru, an element between Nd and Sm, and an
element between W and Os, none of which are yet known. . . . This is
equivalent to assigning to successive elements a series of successive characteristic
integers . ... Now if either the elements were not characterized
by these integers, or any mistake had been made in the order chosen or in
the number of places left for unknown elements, these regularities (the
straight lines) would at once disappear. We can therefore conclude from the
evidence of the x-ray spectra alone, without using any theory of atomic
structure, that these integers are really characteristic of the elements....
Now Rutherford has proved that the most important constituent of an atom
is its central positively charged nucleus, and van den Broek has put forward
the view that the charge carried by this nucleus is in all cases an integral
multiple of the charge on the hydrogen nucleus. There is every reason to
suppose that the integer which controls the x-ray spectrum is the same as
the number of electrical units in the nucleus, and these experiments therefore
give the strongest possible support to the hypothesis of van den
Broek.&quot;*

The three undiscovered elements mentioned by Moseley were later
found to be elements 43 (technetium, Tc), 61 (promethium, Pm), and 75
(rhenium, Re). A confusing &quot;double element&quot; was cleared up in 1923, when
D. Coster and G. Hevesy showed that one of the unoccupied horizontal
lines of Moseley's chart belonged to the new element hafnium (Hf, 72).
Moseley's work was perhaps the most fundamental single step in the development
of the periodic table. It proved that atomic number (or the
charge on the nucleus), and not atomic weight, was the essential property
in explaining chemical behavior.

==The Modern Periodic Table==

The easiest way to understand the periodic table is to build it. Although
this may seem to be a difficult task, surprisingly little knowledge of chemistry is required to understand that the form on the inside front cover of this book is inevitable. If we arrange elements by atomic number, as Moseley did, then certain chemical properties repeat at definite intervals (Figure 7-3, top). The chemically inert gases (at least thought to be inert until 1962, when chemists produced compounds containing xenon bound to fluorine and oxygen), He, Ne, Ar, Kr, Xe, and Rn, have atomic numbers 2, 10, 18, 36, 54, and 86, or numerical intervals of 2, 8, 8, 18, 18, and 32. Each of these gases precedes an extremely reactive, soft metal that tends to form a + 1 ion: the '''alkali metals''' Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs, and Fr. And each gas is preceded by a reactive element that can gain an electron to form a - 1 ion: hydrogen and the '''halogens''' F, CI, Br, I, and At. These key elements are shown in color in the row at the top of Figure 7-3.

These chemical similarities are best represented by dividing the list of
105 elements into seven rows or '''periods''' (Figure 7-3). However, the first
period has only 2 elements, the next two have 8, the next two, 18, and the
sixth and probably the seventh periods have 32. How can we align 8 entries
over 18, and 18 over 32?

[[Image:Chemical Principles Fig 7.3.png]]

&lt;small&gt;*By the time these lines were published, Moseley was in the British army, and less than a year later he was dead, at the age of 27, on a hillside on Gallipoli.&lt;/small&gt; 

The alkaline earth metals, Be, Mg, Ca, Sr, and Ba, are so similar in
chemical properties that we need little imagination to place them as shown.
Nonmetals are at the right end of each period, and O, S, Se, and Te constitute
a series of elements with a combining capacity of 2 and an increase in
metallic behavior from O to Te: O is a nonmetal, and Te exists in the
unspecific intermediate zone known as the '''semimetals''' or '''metalloids'''.
Elements N, P, As, Sb, and Bi comprise a group whose characteristics are the
ability to gain three electrons in certain compounds and a gradation from
the nonmetallic N and P, to the semimetallic As, to the metallic Sb and Bi.
T he elements C, Si, Ge, Sn, and Pb all have a combining capacity of 4.
For these elements, the border zone between metals and nonmetals is
located at an earlier period ; C is a nonmetal, Si and Ge are semimetals,
and Sn and Pb are meta ls. Finally, the series B, Al, Ga, In, and Tl form
+3 ions; B is semimetallic and the others are metallic. The properties of
Al and Ga are more similar than those of Al and Sc. To bring Al above Ga,
it is necessary to shift the S-element periods to the extreme right above the
18-element period below.

The &quot;superfluous&quot; elements in Periods 4 and 5 c,. Sc to 30Zn, and 39 Y
to &quot;Cd) constitute a series of metals, all of which exhibit a great variety of
ionic states, the + 2 and + 3 states seeming to be the most common. Their
properties do not change from one element to another nearly as much as
the properties in the series B, C, N, 0, and F change. We call these &quot;superfluous&quot;
elements '''transition metals'''. (We defer the question of ''what'' is in
transition to Chapters 9 and 10.) When we look for chemical parallels
between the fifth and sixth periods, we find that &lt;sub&gt;40&lt;/sub&gt;Zr and &lt;sub&gt;72&lt;/sub&gt;Hf are virtually
identical in behavior. Again, our preferred arrangement is to place the
elements in Period 5 beyond &lt;sub&gt;38&lt;/sub&gt;Sr as far as possible to the right atop Periods 6 and 7. The extra elements in Period 6, &lt;sub&gt;57&lt;/sub&gt;La to &lt;sub&gt;70&lt;/sub&gt;Yb, are practically identical in chemical behavior. These elements are called the '''rare earths''', or '''lanthanides'''. Their partners in the seventh period (&lt;sub&gt;89&lt;/sub&gt;Ac to &lt;sub&gt;102&lt;/sub&gt;No) are known as the '''actinides'''. Because the lanthanides are so similar in chemical properties,
they are found together in nature and are extremely difficult to separate.

In summary, the elements can be classified into three groups (Figure
7-3): the '''representative elements''', with diverse properties; the '''transition metals''', more similar but yet clearly distinguishable; and the '''inner transition metals''' (lanthanides and actinides), with very similar properties. The
representative elements are called representative because they show a
broader range of properties than are found in the other elements, and because
they are the elements with which we are most familiar.

(The radioactivity and nuclear instability of the actinides, especially
uranium, have given them a historical significance that their chemical
properties perhaps would not have justified. An old-time chemist is a person
who still thinks of uranium as an obscure heavy element used in yellow
pottery glazes and stained glass. It is ironic that a nuclear war would be
fought with the raw material of stained-glass windows.)

There is a more compact form of the periodic table that indicates more
clearly the relative variability of properties of neighboring elements (Figure
7-4). Trends in chemical behavior are often easier to understand if only the
representative elements are examined, with the transition metals set to one
side as a special case and the inner transition metals virtually ignored. In
this table, the vertical columns are called '''groups''', and those of the representative
elements are numbered IA through VIIA and O. The groups of the
transition elements are numbered in a way to remind you that they should
be inserted in the representative element table. The numbering includes
Groups IIIB to VIIB, then three columns all labeled collectively Group
VIIIB, then Groups IB and lIB. Group HIB follows Group IIIA in the representative
elements, and Group lIB precedes Group IlIA. This kind of
numbering is clearer in the standard, &quot;long form&quot; of the periodic table on
the inside front cover. We can see that the standard form is a compromise
between the compactness of Figure 7-4 and the completeness of Figure 7-3.
The lanthanides and actinides have been of so little relative importance
that they have not been given group numbers.

==Periodicity of Chemical Properties as Illustrated by Binary Hydrides and Oxides==

In this section we shall see how the periodic table enables us to predict the molecular formulas and the chemical properties of compounds of metals and nonmetals with hydrogen and oxygen. 

===Binary Hydrides===

The number of hydrogen atoms that combine with one atom of a given representative element in the first three periods of the periodic table varies (as shown in Figure 7-5) from 1 to 4 and back to 1 again across each period. This number is equal to either the group number or 8 minus the group number, whichever is smaller. This face alone offers a clue to the way in which H is bonded in each hydrogen compound. 

[[Image:Chemical Principles Fig 7.5.png]]
[[Image:Chemical Principles Fig 7.6.png]]

Compounds of metals with hydrogen-called ''hydrides''-are mostly ionic.
In alkali hydrides such as KH or NaH, there is a transfer of negative
charge to each hydrogen atom. Alkali hydrides have the NaCl crystal
structure (Chapter 1), but BeH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; MgH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and AlH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, manifest a new phenomenon, &quot;bridging&quot; hydrogen. In this arrangement each H atom in the
crystal is equidistant between two metal atoms and appears to form a
hydrogen bridge between them. Whenever H has a net negative charge,
this extra charge can apparently be used to make a second bond to another
atom, if there is enough potential bonding capacity in the other atom. The
negatively charged H is present in NaH, but not the capacity for multiple
bonds. However, Be, Mg, and Al satisfy both demands, and bridge structures
are formed. The boron- hydrogen compound B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; (Figure 7-6) is an
example of hydrogen bridging ''within'' a molecule, and the other known boron
hydrides (such as B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;, and B&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;14&lt;/sub&gt;) all make extensive use of such hydrogen bridges.

Compounds of hydrogen with elements in the right half of the periods
are small molecular compounds in which the number of hydrogen atoms in
a molecule is dictated by the number of covalent bonds that the other atom
can form. Molecules of such compounds are held together in crystals only
by weak forces between molecules; thus their melting and boiling points are
very low (Figure 7 -6).

Ionic hydrides react with water to produce basic solutions:
::Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
Conversely, the halogen compounds are acidic:
::HCl + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;
|+'''Example 1'''
|-
|What are the formulas of the hydrides of cesium (Cs) and selenium (Se)? Which hydride has the higher melting point? Write a balanced equation for the reaction of cesium hydride with water.
|-
|'''Solution'''
Cesium is in Group IA. Therefore the formula of its hydride is CsH.
Selenium is in Group VIA, and its hydride is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se. Cesium hydride is an
ionic hydride with a much higher melting point than that of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Se, which is
a molecular substance with a low melting point (and boiling point). The
reaction of CsH with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O yields H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, and OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;:
::CsH(''s'') + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(''l'') &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''g'') + Cs&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;
|}

===Binary Oxides===

The representative elements form oxides with the formulas expected from the elements' positions in the periodic table; in the third period these oxides are Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. MgO, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, P&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;. Oxides of elements at the lower left of the table are strong bases. They have a large negative charge on the O atom, and are ionic. The melting points of these ionic oxides are typically around 2000°C, and many decompose before melting. They react with water to make basic solutions:
::Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; 2Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;
At the other extreme, oxides of elements at the upper right of the table are strong acids:
::Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; + 3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; 2H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2ClO&lt;math&gt;_4^-&lt;/math&gt; &amp;emsp; &amp;emsp; (perchloric acid)
::SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; 2H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + SO&lt;math&gt;_4^{2-}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;emsp; &amp;emsp; &amp;emsp; (sulfric acid)

Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; is explosively unstable, and SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; reacts vigorously with water to produce acidic solutions. The acids have been represented here as completely
ionized or dissociated, but this can be as misleading as writing them
in their undissociated forms: HClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;. As we saw in Chapter 5, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; is only partially dissociated in water.

Between acidic and basic oxides lies a diagonal band of oxides that are
amphoteric: BeO, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and Ga&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;; GeO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through PbO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;; and Sb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; and Bi&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;. (Amphoteric oxides show both acidic and basic behavior.) They are virtually insoluble in water but can be dissolved by either acids or bases: 
::BeO + 2H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; Be&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 3H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
::BeO + 2OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Be(OH)&lt;math&gt;_4^{2-}&lt;/math&gt;

The notation in the first equation is conventional but inconsistent. The
hydration of the proton is denoted by the symbol H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;. However, the
Be&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; cation is also very strongly hydrated, especially so because of its small
size. It should be written as Be(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;math&gt;_n^{2+}&lt;/math&gt;, or at least Be&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;(''aq''). But so long as
the hydration of cations is understood, it need not be spelled out every time.

The amphoteric and basic oxides are solids with high melting points.
For instance, Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;0&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is the abrasive known as corundum, or emery; SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is
quartz. Only the oxides of C, N, S, and the halogens are normally liquids or
gases. The contrast between C and Si in carbon dioxide and quartz is
analogous to the contrast between C and N in diamond and nitrogen gas.
The difference between C and Si arises because C can make double bonds
to O and therefore form a molecular compound of limited size. However,
Si must make single bonds with four different O atoms; hence, it must assume a three-dimensional network structure in which tetrahedrally arranged Si atoms are connected by bridging O atoms. 

In all the oxides discussed so far, the chemical formula can be predicted
from the group number. But there are other oxides whose formulas cannot
be predicted from group numbers. For example, C can form CO as well as
CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The compound N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; is not the only nitrogen oxide: NO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, and
NO are others. Sulfur can form SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, and S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;, as well as SO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.
But in these compounds the element does not make full use of its potential
combining capacity. Thus, the general trends in properties are best illustrated
by the oxides that we have been examining.

Calcium (Ca) is in Group IIA. Its oxide is therefore CaO. The reaction is
::CaO(''s'') + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(''l'') &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

==Summary==

Physical and chemical properties of elements are periodic functions, not of atomic weight, but of atomic number. Moseley suggested, and it later was verified, that the atomic number is the total positive charge on the nucleus,
equal to the total number of electrons around the nucleus in a neutral atom.

Particularly stable, inert elements occur at intervals of 2, 8, 8, 18, 18,
and 32 in atomic number. These intervals, and only the most basic knowledge
of similarities among elements, led to the formulation of a periodic
table, in which similar elements are in vertical columns or groups, and in
which chemical properties change in an orderly manner along horizontal
rows or '''periods'''. The full, extended periodic table can be folded into a
compact form that illustrates the division of the elements into three
categories: the diversified '''representative elements''', the more similar '''transition metals''', and the virtually identical '''inner transition metals'''.

The correlation between combining capacity and group number in the
periodic table may be illustrated by the hydrides and oxides of the representative
elements. Elements at the lower left of the periodic table are
metals. Their hydrides and oxides are ionic, and aqueous solutions of these
compounds are basic. Elements at the upper right corner of the table are
nonmetals. Their hydrogen compounds and oxides are small molecules with
covalent bonds; they are gases or liquids, and are acidic. Between the two
extremes at upper right and lower left in the table there is a gradation of
properties. As the elements pass from nonmetals through semimetals to
metals, their hydrogen compounds go from acidic, to neutral or inert, to
basic (although there are many complications to this overall trend), and
the oxides proceed in a more regular manner from acidic, to amphoteric,
to basic.

==Introduction==

Physics seemed to be settling down quite satisfactorily in the late nineteenth
century. A clerk in the U.S. Patent Office wrote a now-famous
letter of resignation in which he expressed a desire to leave a dying
agency, an agency that would have less and less to do in the future since
most inventions had already been made. In 1894, at the dedication of a
physics laboratory in Chicago, the famous physicist A. A. Michelson suggested
that the more important physical laws all had been discovered, and
&quot;Our future discoveries must be looked for in the sixth decimal place.&quot;
Thermodynamics, statistical mechanics, and electromagnetic theory had
been brilliantly successful in explaining the behavior of matter. Atoms
themselves had been found to be electrical, and undoubtedly would follow
Maxwell's electromagnetic laws.

Then came x rays and radioactivity. In 1895, Wilhelm Rontgen (1845-
1923) evacuated a Crookes tube (Figure 1-11) so the cathode rays struck the
anode without being blocked by gas molecules. Rontgen discovered that a
new and penetrating form of radiation was emitted by the anode. This
radiation, which he called ''x rays'', traveled with ease through paper, wood,
and flesh but was absorbed by heavier substances such as bone and metal.
Rontgen demonstrated that x rays were not deflected by electric or magnetic
fields and therefore were not beams of charged particles. Other
scientists suggested that the rays might be electromagnetic radiation like
light, but of a shorter wavelength. The German physicist Max von Laue
proved this hypothesis 18 years later when he diffracted x rays with crystals.

In 1896, Henri Becquerel (1852–1908) observed that uranium salts
emitted radiation that penetrated the black paper coverings of photographic
plates and exposed the photographic emulsion. He named this
behavior '''radioactivity'''. In the next few years, Pierre and Marie Curie
isolated two entirely new, and radioactive, elements from uranium ore and
named them ''polonium'' and ''radium''. Radioactivity, even more than x rays, was
a shock to physicists of the time. They gradually realized that radiation
occurred during the breakdown of atoms, and that atoms were not indestructible
but could decompose and decay into other kinds of atoms. The
old certainties, and the hopes for impending certainties, began to fall away.

The radiation most commonly observed was of three kinds, designated
alpha (α), beta (β), and gamma (γ). Gamma radiation proved to be electromagnetic
radiation of even higher frequency (and shorter wavelength) than
x rays. Beta rays, like cathode rays, were found to be beams of electrons.
Electric and magnetic deflection experiments showed the mass of α radiation
to be 4 amu and its charge to be +2; α particles were simply nuclei
of helium, &lt;small&gt;&lt;math&gt;_2^4&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/small&gt;He.

The next certainty to slip away was the quite satisfying model of the
atom that had been proposed by J. J. Thomson.

==Rutherford and The Nuclear Atom==

[[Image:Chemical Principles Fig 8.1.png|frame| '''Figure 8-1''']]
[[Image:Chemical Principles Fig 8.2.png|frame| '''Figure 8-2''']]
[[Image:Chemical Principles Fig 8.3.png|frame| '''Figure 8-3''']]

In Thomson's model of the atom all the mass and all the positive charge
were distributed uniformly throughout the atom, with electrons embedded
in the atom like raisins in a pudding. Mutual repulsion of electrons
separated them uniformly. The resulting close association of positive and
negative charges was reasonable. Ionization could be explained as a stripping
away of some of the electrons from the pudding, thereby leaving a
massive, solid atom with a positive charge.

In 1910, Ernest Rutherford (1871–1937) disproved the Thomson
model, more or less by accident, while measuring the scattering of a beam
of α particles by extremely thin sheets of gold and other heavy metals.
(His experimental arrangement is shown in Figure 8-1.) He expected to
find a relatively small deflection of particles, as would occur if the positive
charge and mass of the atoms were distributed throughout a large volume
in a uniform way (Figure 8-2a). What he observed was quite different, and
wholly unexpected. In his own words:

&quot;In the early days I had observed the scattering of α particles, and
Dr. Geiger in my laboratory had examined it in detail. He found in thin
pieces of heavy metal that the scattering was usually small, of the order of
one degree. One day Geiger came to me and said, 'Don't you think that
young Marsden, whom I am training in radioactive methods, ought to begin
a small research?' Now I had thought that too, so I said, 'Why not let him
see if any α particles can be scattered through a large angle?' I may tell
you in confidence that I did not believe they would be, since we knew that
the α particle was a very fast massive particle, with a great deal of energy,
and you could show that if the scattering was due to the accumulated effect
of a number of small scatterings, the chance of an α particle's being
scattered backwards was very small. Then I remember two or three days
later Geiger coming to me in great excitement and saying, 'We have been
able to get some of the α particles coming backwards.' ... It was quite
the most incredible event that has ever happened to me in my life. It was
almost as incredible as if you fired a 15-inch shell at a piece of tissue paper
and it came back and hit you.&quot;

Rutherford, Geiger, and Marsden calculated that this observed backscattering
was precisely what would be expected if virtually all the mass
and positive charge of the atom were concentrated in a dense nucleus at the
center of the atom (Figure 8-2b). They also calculated the charge on the
gold nucleus as 100 ± 20 (actually 79), and the radius of the gold nucleus as
something less than 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; cm (actually nearer to 10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt; cm).

The picture of the atom that emerged from these scattering experiments
was of an extremely dense, positively charged nucleus surrounded by
negative charges-electrons. These electrons inhabited a region with a
radius 100,000 times that of the nucleus. The majority of the α particles
passing through the metal foil were not deflected because they never encountered
the nucleus. However, particles passing close to such a great
concentration of charge would be deflected; and those few particles that
happened to collide with the small target would be bounced back in the
direction from which they had come.

The validity of Rutherford's model has been borne out by later investigations.
An atom's nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons (Figure
8-3). Just enough electrons are around this nucleus to balance the nuclear
charge. But this model of an atom cannot be explained by classical physics.
What keeps the positive and negative charges apart? If the electrons were
stationary, electrostatic attraction would pull them toward the nucleus to
form a miniature version of Thomson's atom. Conversely, if the electrons
were moving in orbits around the nucleus, things would be no better. An
electron moving in a circle around a positive nucleus is an oscillating
dipole when the atom is viewed in the plane of the orbit; the negative
charge appears to oscillate up and down relative to the positive charge,
By all the laws of classical electromagnetic theory, such an oscillator should
broadcast energy as electromagnetic waves. But if this happened, the atom
would lose energy, and the electron would spiral into the nucleus. By the
laws of classical physics, the Rutherford model of the atom could not be
valid. Where was the flaw?

==The Quantization of Energy==

Other flaws that were just as disturbing as Rutherford's impossibly stable
atoms were appearing in physics at this time. By the turn of the century
scientists realized that radio waves, infrared, visible light, and ultraviolet
radiation (and x rays and y rays a few years later) were '''electromagnetic waves''' with different wavelengths. These waves all travel at the same speed,
c, which is 2.9979 × l0&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; cm sec&lt;sup&gt;-l&lt;/sup&gt; or 186,000 miles sec&lt;sup&gt;-l&lt;/sup&gt; (This speed
seems almost instantaneous until you recall that the slowness of light is
responsible for the 1.3-sec delay each way in radio messages between the
earth and the moon.) Waves such as these are described by their wavelength
(designated by the Greek letter lambda, λ), amplitude, and frequency (designated by the
Greek letter nu, ν), which is the number of cycles of a moving wave that
passes a given point per unit of time (Figure 8-4). The speed of the wave,
''c'', which is constant for all electromagnetic radiation, is the product of the
frequency (the number of cycles per second or hertz, Hz) and the length of
each cycle (the wavelength):
      ''c'' = ''νλ''                                        (8-1)
The reciprocal of the wavelength is called the wave number, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\overline{\nu}&lt;/math&gt;:
::&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\overline{\nu}&lt;/math&gt; = 1/λ

Its units are commonly waves per centimeter, or cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

The electromagnetic spectrum as we know it is shown in Figure 8-5a. The scale is logarithmic rather than linear in wavelength; that is, it is in increasing powers of 10. On this logarithmic scale, the portion of the
electromagnetic radiation that our eyes can see is only a small sector
halfway between radio waves and gamma rays. The visible part of the
spectrum is shown in Figure 8-5b.

::= 2 × 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

===The Ultraviolet Catastrophe===

Classical physics gave physicists serious trouble even when they used it to try
to explain why a red-hot iron bar is red. Solids emit radiation when they are
heated. The ideal radiation from a perfect absorber and emitter of radiation
is called '''blackbody radiation'''. The spectrum, or plot of relative intensity
against frequency, of radiation from a red-hot solid is shown in Figure
8-6a. Since most of the radiation is in the red and infrared frequency
regions, we see the color of the object as red. As the temperature is increased,
the peak of the spectrum moves to higher frequencies, and we see
the hot object as orange, then yellow, and finally white when enough
energy is radiated through the entire visible spectrum.

The difficulty in this observation is that classical physics predicts that
the curve will keep rising to the right rather than falling after a maximum.
Thus there should be much more blue and ultraviolet radiation emitted
than is actually observed, and all heated objects should appear blue to our
eyes. This complete contradiction of theory by facts was called the '''ultraviolet
catastrophe''' by physicists of the time.

In 1900, Max Planck provided an explanation for this paradox. To do
this he had to discard a hallowed tenet of science-that variables in nature
change in a continuous way (nature does not make jumps). According to
classical physics, light of a certain frequency is emitted because charged
objects- atoms or groups of atoms- in a solid vibrate or oscillate with that
frequency. We could thus theoretically calculate the intensity curve of the
spectrum if we knew the relative number of oscillators that vibrate with each
frequency.All frequencies are thought to be possible, and the energy associated
with a particular frequency depends only on how many oscillators
are vibrating with that frequency . There should be no lack of high-frequency
oscillators in the blue and ultraviolet regions.

Planck made the revolutionary suggestion that the energy of electromagnetic
radiation comes in packages, or '''quanta'''. The energy of one package
of radiation is proportional to the frequency of the radiation:
       ''E'' = ''hν''                                             (8-2)

The proportionality constant, ''h'', is known as '''Planck's constant''' and has the
value 6.6262 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−34&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;big&gt;J&lt;/big&gt; sec. By Planck's theory, a group of atoms cannot emit a ''small'' amount of energy at a ''high'' frequency; high frequencies can be emitted only by oscillators with a ''large'' amount of energy, as given by ''E'' = ''hν''. The probability of finding oscillators with high frequencies is therefore slight because the probability of finding groups of atoms with such
unusually large vibrational energies is low. Instead of rising, the spectral
curve falls at high frequencies, as in Figure 8-6.

Was Planck's theory correct, or was it only an ''ad hoc'' explanation to
account for one isolated phenomenon? Science is plagued with theories that
explain the phenomenon for which they were invented, and thereafter never
explain another phenomenon correctly. Was the idea that electromagnetic
energy comes in bundles of fixed energy that is proportional to frequency
only another one-shot explanation?

===The Photoelectric Effect===

Albert Einstein (1879–1955) provided another example of the quantization
of energy, in 1905, when he successfully explained the '''photoelectric effect''',
in which light striking a metal surface can cause electrons to be given off.
(Photocells in automatic doors use the photoelectric effect to generate the
electrons that operate the door-opening circuits.) For a given metal there is
a minimum frequency of light below which no electrons are emitted, no
matter how intense the beam of light. To classical physicists it seemed nonsensical
that for some metals the most intense beam of red light could not
drive off electrons that could be ejected by a faint beam of blue light.

Einstein showed that Planck's hypothesis explained such phenomena
beautifully. The energy of the quanta of light striking the metal, he said,
is greater for blue light than for red. As an analogy, imagine that the low-frequency
red light is a beam of Ping-Pong balls and that the high-frequency
blue light is a beam of steel balls with the same velocity. Each impact of a
quantum of energy of red light is too small to dislodge an electron; in our
analogy, a steady stream of Ping-Pong balls cannot do what one rapidly
moving steel ball can. These quanta of light were named photons. Because
of the successful explanation of both the blackbody and photoelectric effects,
physicists began recognizing that light behaves like particles as well as like
waves.

{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;
|+'''Example 2'''
|-
|Consider once again the green light in Example 1. The relationship E = ''hν'' allows us to calculate the energy of one green photon. What is this energy in kilojoules? In kilojoules per mole of green photons?
|-
|'''Solution'''
Let us assume that we know the wavelength to two significant digits, 5.0 X 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt; cm. The frequency, ν, of this green light is
::''c'' = λν = 3.0 × 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; cm sec&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; = (5.0 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt; cm) ν
::ν = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{3.0 \times 10^{10} cm sec^{-1}}{5.0 \times 10^{.5} cm}&lt;/math&gt;
:&amp;emsp; = 0.60 × 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; sec&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;emsp; &amp;emsp; (or 0.60 × 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; Hz)
The energy of one green photon, then, is
::''E'' = ''hν''
:&amp;emsp; (6.63 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-34&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;big&gt;J&lt;/big&gt; sec)(0.60 × sec&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)
:&amp;emsp; 4.0 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;big&gt;J&lt;/big&gt;, or 4.0 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-22&lt;/sup&gt; k&lt;big&gt;J&lt;/big&gt;
This is the energy of ''one'' green photon. To obtain the energy of a mole of green photons, we must multiply by Avogadro's number:
::''E'' = (4.0 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-22&lt;/sup&gt; k&lt;big&gt;J&lt;/big&gt; photon&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)(6.02 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-23&lt;/sup&gt; photons mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;)
:&amp;emsp; = 2.4 × 10&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; k&lt;big&gt;J&lt;/big&gt; mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
|}

===The Spectrum of the Hydrogen Atom===

The most striking example of the quantization of light, to a chemist, appears in the search for an explanation of atomic spectra. Isaac Newton (1642–1727) was one of the first scientists to demonstrate with a prism that white light is a spectrum of many colors, from red at one end to violet at the other. We know now that the electromagnetic spectrum continues on both sides of the small region to which our eyes are sensitive; it includes the infrared at low frequencies and the ultraviolet at high frequencies.

All atoms and molecules absorb light of certain characteristic frequencies.
The pattern of absorption frequencies is called an '''absorption
spectrum''' and is an identifying property of any particular atom or molecule.
The absorption spectrum of hydrogen atoms is shown in Figure 8-7.
The lowest-energy absorption corresponds to the line at 82,259&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. Notice
that the absorption lines are crowded closer together as the limit of
109,678&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is approached. Above this limit absorption is continuous.

If atoms and molecules are heated to high temperatures, they emit light
of certain frequencies. For example, hydrogen atoms emit red light when
they are heated. An atom that possesses excess energy (e.g., an atom that
has been heated) emits light in a pattern known as its '''emission spectrum'''.
A portion of the emission spectrum of atomic hydrogen is shown in Figure
8-8. Note that the lines occur at the same wave numbers in the two types of
spectra.

If we look more closely at the emission spectrum in Figure 8-8, we see
that there are three distinct groups of lines. These three groups or series are
named after the scientists who discovered them. The series that starts at
82,259&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and continues to 109,678&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is called the '''Lyman series''' and is in the ultraviolet portion of the spectrum. The series that starts at
15,233&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and continues to 27,420&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; is called the '''Balmer series''' and covers a large portion of the visible and a small part of the ultraviolet
spectrum. The lines between 5332&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and 12,186&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; are called the '''Paschen series''' and fall in the near-infrared region. The Balmer spectra of
hydrogen from several stars are shown in Figure 8-9.

J. J. Balmer proved, in 1885, that the wave numbers of the lines in the
Balmer spectrum of the hydrogen atom are given by the empirical relationship
       &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\overline{\nu} = &lt;/math&gt; ''R&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\times (\frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{n^2})&lt;/math&gt; &amp;emsp; &amp;emsp; ''n'' = 3, 4, 5, . . .                               (8-3)   

Later, Johannes Rydberg formulated a general expression that gives all of the line positions. This expression, called the '''Rydberg equation''', is 
       &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\overline{\nu}&lt;/math&gt; = ''R''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\times (\frac{1}{n{_1^2}} - \frac{1}{n^{_2^2}})&lt;/math&gt;                                 (8-4)

In the Rydberg equation ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are integers, with ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; greater than ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;; ''R''&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt; is called the '''Rydberg constant''' and is known accurately from experiment to be 109,677.581&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

::&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\overline{\nu} = 109,678 (\frac{1}{1^2} - \frac{1}{4^2}) = 109,678 (1 - \frac{1}{16}) = 102,823 cm^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

We see that the wave numbers obtained in Example 3 correspond to the first three lines in the Lyman series. Thus we expect that the Lyman series corresponds to lines calculated with ''n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 1 and ''n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 2, 3, 4, 5, . . . . We can check this by calculating the wave number for the line with ''n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 and ''n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;∞&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;.
''n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 1, ''n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;∞&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; line:
::&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\overline{\nu} = 109,678 (1 - 0) = 109,678 cm^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;
The wave number 109,678 cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; corresponds to the highest emission line in the Lyman series. 
::The wave number for ''n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 2 and ''n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 3 is
::&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\overline{\nu} = 109,678 (\frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{9}) = 15,233 cm^{-1}.&lt;/math&gt;

This corresponds to the first line in the Balmer series. Thus, the Balmer series corresponds to the ''n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 2, ''n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 3, 4, 5, 6, . . . lines. You probably would expect the lines in the Paschen series to correspond to ''n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 3, ''n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' =  4, 5, 6, 7, . . . They do. Now you should wonder where the lines are with ''n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 4, ''n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 5, 6, 7, 8, . . . , and ''n&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 5, ''n&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 6, 7, 8, 9, . . . . They are exactly where the Rydberg equation predicts they should be. The ''n'' = 4 series was discovered by Brackett and the ''n'' = 5 series was discovered by
Pfund. The series with ''n'' = 6 and higher are located at very low frequencies
and are not given special names.

The Rydberg formula, equation 8-4, is a summary of observed facts
about hydrogen atomic spectra. It states that the wave number of a spectral
line is the difference between two numbers, each inversely proportional to
the square of an integer. If we draw a set of horizontal lines at a distance
RH/n' down from a baseline, with ''n'' = 1, 2, 3, 4, . . ., then each spectral
line in any of the hydrogen series is observed to correspond to the distance
between two such horizontal lines in the diagram (Figure 8-10). The Lyman
series occurs between line ''n'' = 1 and those above it; the Balmer series occurs
between line ''n'' = 2 and those above it; the Paschen series occurs between
line ''n'' = 3 and those above it; and the higher series are based on lines ''n'' = 4, 5, and so on. Is the agreement between this simple diagram and the observed
wave numbers of spectral lines only a coincidence? Does the idea of a wave
number of an emitted line being the difference between two &quot;wave-number
levels&quot; have any physical significance, or is this just a convenient graphical
representation of the Rydberg equation?

==Bohr's Theory of the Hydrogen Atom==

In 1913, Niels Bohr (1885–1962) proposed a theory of the hydrogen atom that, in one blow, did away with the problem of Rutherford's unstable atom and gave a perfect explanation of the spectra we have just discussed.

There are two ways of proposing a new theory in science, and Bohr's
work illustrates the less obvious one. One way is to amass such an amount
of data that the new theory becomes obvious and self-evident to any observer.
The theory then is almost a summary of the data. This is essentially
the way Dalton reasoned from combining weights to atoms. The other way
is to make a bold new assertion that initially does not seem to follow from
the data, and then to demonstrate that the consequences of this assertion,
when worked out, explain many observations. With this method, a theorist
says, &quot;You may not see why, yet, but please suspend judgment on my
hypothesis until I show you what I can do with it.&quot; Bohr's theory is of
this type.

Bohr answered the question of why the electron does not spiral into the
nucleus by simply postulating that ''it does not''. In effect, he said to classical
physicists: &quot;You have been misled by your physics to expect that the electron
would radiate energy and spiral into the nucleus. Let us assume that it
does not, and see if we can account for more observations than by assuming
that it does.&quot; The observations that he explained so well are the wavelengths
of lines in the atomic spectrum of hydrogen.

Bohr's model of the hydrogen atom is illustrated in Figure 8-11: an
electron of mass ''m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' moving in a circular orbit at a distance r from a nucleus.
If the electron has a velocity of ''v'', it will have an '''angular momentum''' of
''m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;vr''. (To appreciate what angular momentum is, think of an ice skater
spinning on one blade like a top. The skater begins spinning with his arms
extended. As he brings his arms to his sides, he spins faster and faster. This
is because, in the absence of any external forces, angular momentum is
conserved. As the mass of the skater's arms comes closer to the axis of
rotation, or as r decreases, the velocity of his arms must increase in order
that the product ''mvr'' remain constant.) Bohr postulated, as the first basic
assumption of his theory, that in a hydrogen atom there could only be orbits
for which ''the angular momentum is an integral multiple of Planck's constant divided by 2&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;:

::''m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;vr'' &lt;math&gt;= \textstyle n \frac{h}{2\pi}&lt;/math&gt;

There is no obvious justification for such an assumption; it will be accepted
only if it leads to the successful explanation of other phenomena. Bohr then
showed that, with no more new assumptions, and with the laws of classical
mechanics and electrostatics, his principle leads to the restriction of the
energy of an electron in a hydrogen atom to the values
       ''E'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle - \frac{k}{n^2}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;emsp; ''n'' = 1, 2, 3, 4, . . .                      (8-5)

The integer n is the same integer as in the angular momentum assumption,
''m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;vr'' = ''n(h/ 2&lt;/math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;); ''k'' is a constant that depends only on Planck's constant, ''h'', the mass of an electron, ''m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'', and the charge on an electron, ''e'':
::''k'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{2\pi^2m_ee^4}{h^2} = &lt;/math&gt;13.595 electron volts (eV)* atom&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
::::= 1312 k&lt;big&gt;J&lt;/big&gt; mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
The radius of the electron's orbit also is determined by the integer ''n'':
       ''r'' = ''n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''                               (8-6)
The constant, ''a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', is called the '''first Bohr radius''' and is given in Bohr's theory by
::''a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{h^2}{4\pi^2m_ee^2} =&lt;/math&gt; 0.529Å

The first Bohr radius is often used as a measure of length called the '''atomic unit''', a.u.

The energy that an electron in a hydrogen atom can have is '''quantized''', or limited to certain values, by equation 8-5. The integer, ''n'', that determines these energy values is called the '''quantum number'''. When an electron is removed (ionized) from an atom, that electron is described as excited to the quantum state ''n'' = &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;∞&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;. From equation 8-5, we see that as ''n'' approaches &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;∞&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;, ''E'' approaches zero. Thus, the energy of a completely ionized electron has been chosen as the zero energy level. Because energy is required to remove an electron from an atom, an electron that is bound to an atom must have less energy that this, and hence a negative energy. The relative sizes of the first five hydrogen-atom orbits are compared in Figure 8-12.

In the second part of his theory, Bohr postulated that absorption and
emission of energy occur when an electron moves from one quantum state
to another. The energy emitted when an electron drops from state ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to a lower quantum state ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the difference between the energies of the two states:
       Δ''E'' = ''E''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - ''E''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = -''k''&lt;math&gt;\textstyle ( \frac{1}{n_1^2} - \frac{1}{n_2^2})&lt;/math&gt;                               (8-7)

The light emitted is assumed to be quantized in exactly the way predicted from the blackbody and photoelectric experiments of Planck and Einstein:
       |Δ''E''| = ''hv'' = ''hc&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\overline{v}&lt;/math&gt;                       (8-8)

If we divide equation 8-7 by ''hc'' to convert from energy to wave number units, we obtain the Rydberg equation,
::&lt;math&gt;R_H = \textstyle\frac{k}{hc} = \frac{2\pi^2m_ee^4}{h^3c} = 109,737.3 cm^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

Recall that the experimental value of ''R&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;'' is 109,677.581 cm&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

The graphic representation of the Rydberg equation, Figure 8-10, now
is seen to be an energy-level diagram of the possible quantum states of the
hydrogen atom. We can see why light is absorbed or emitted only at specific
wave numbers. The absorption of light, or the heating of a gas, provides the
energy for an electron to move to a higher orbit. Then the ''excited'' hydrogen
atom can emit energy in the form of light quanta when the electron falls
back to a lower-energy orbit. From this emission come the different series of
spectral lines:
::'''1.''' The Lyman series of lines arises from transitions from the ''n'' = 2, 3, 4, . . . levels to the ground state (''n'' = 1)
::'''2.''' The Balmer series arises from transitions from the ''n'' = 3, 4, 5, . . . levels to the ''n'' = 2 level.
::'''3.''' The Paschen series arises from transitions from the ''n'' = 4, 5, 6, . . .  levels to the ''n'' = 3 level.

An excited hydrogen atom in quantum state ''n'' = 8 may drop directly to the ground state and emit photon in the Lyman series, or it may drop first to ''n'' = 3, emit a photon in the Paschen series, and then drop to ''n'' = 1 and emit a photon in the Lyman series. The frequency of each photon depends on the energy difference between levels:
::Δ''E'' = ''E''&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; - ''E''&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; = ''hv''

By cascading down the energy levels, the electron in one excited hydrogen atom can successively emit photons in several series. Therefore, all series are
present in the emission spectrum from hot hydrogen. However, when
measuring the absorption spectrum of hydrogen gas at lower temperatures
we find virtually all the hydrogen atoms in the ground state. Therefore,
almost all the absorption will involve transitions from ''n'' = 1 to higher states,
and only the Lyman series will be observed.

===Energy Levels of a General One-Electron Atom===

Bohr's theory can also be used to calculate the ionization energy and spectral lines
of any atomic species possessing only one electron (e.g., He&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Li&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;,
Be&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; ). The energy of a Bohr orbit depends on the square of the charge on
the atomic nucleus (''Z'' is the atomic number):
::''E'' = &lt;math&gt;-\frac{Z^2k}{n^2}&lt;/math&gt;
where
::''k'' = 13.595 eV or 1312 k&lt;big&gt;J&lt;/big&gt; mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
::''n'' = 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;∞&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;
The equation reduces to equation 8-5 in the case of atomic hydrogen (''Z'' = 1).

{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;

|-
|Calculate the third ionization energy of a lithium atom.
|-
|'''Solution'''
A lithium atom is composed of a nucleus of charge +3 (''Z'' = 3) and three electrons. The first ionization energy, ''IE&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'', of an atom with more than one electron is the energy required to remove one electron. For lithium, 
::Li(''g'') &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;(''g'') + ''e''&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;emsp;&amp;emsp; Δ''E'' = ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
The energy needed to remove an electron from the unipositive ion, Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, is defined as the second ionization energy, ''IE&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'', of lithium, 
::Li(''g'') &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; Li&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;(''g'') + ''e''&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &amp;emsp;&amp;emsp; Δ''E'' = ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
and the third ionization energy, ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, of lithium is the energy required to remove the one remaining electron from Li&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. For lithium, ''Z'' = 3 and ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = (3)&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(13.595 eV) = 122.36 eV. (The experimental value is 122.45 eV.)

===The Need for a Better Theory===

The Bohr theory of the hydrogen atom suffered from a fatal weakness: It explained nothing ''except'' the hydrogen atom and any other combination of a nucleus and one electron. For example, it could account for the spectra of He&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Li&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, but it did not provide a general explanation for atomic spectra. Even the alkali metals (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs), which have a single valence electron outside a closed shell of inner electrons, produce spectra that are at variance with the Bohr theory. The lines observed in the spectrum of Li could be accounted for only by assuming that each of the Bohr levels beyond the first was really a collection of levels of different energies, as in Figure 8-13: two levels for ''n'' = 2, three levels for ''n'' = 3, four for ''n'' = 4, and so on. The levels for a specific ''n'' were given letter symbols based on the appearance of the spectra involving these levels: ''s'' for &quot;sharp,&quot; ''p'' for &quot;principal,&quot; ''d'' for &quot;diffuse,&quot; and ''f'' for &quot;fundamental.&quot;

Arnold Sommerfeld (1868–1951) proposed an ingenious way of saving the Bohr theory. He suggested that orbits might be elliptical as well as circular. Furthermore, he explained the differences in stability of levels with the same principal quantum number, ''n'', in terms of the ability of the highly elliptical orbits to bring the electron closer to the nucleus (Figure 8-14). For a point nucleus of charge +1 in Hydrogen, the energies of all levels with the same ''n'' would be identical. But for a nucleus of +3 screened by an inner shell of two electrons Li, an electron in an outer circular orbit would experience a net attraction of +1, whereas one in a highly elliptical orbit would penetrate the screening shell and feel a charge approaching +3 for part of its traverse. Thus, the highly elliptical orbits would have the most additional stability illustrated in Figure 8-13. The ''s'' orbits, being the most elliptical of all in Sommerfeld's model, would be much more stable than the others in the set of common ''n''.

The Sommerfeld scheme led no further than the alkali metals. Again an impasse was reached, and an entirely fresh approach was needed.

==Particles of Light and Waves of Matter==

At the beginning of the twentieth century, scientists generally believed that all physical phenomena could be divided into two distinct and exclusive classes. The first class included all phenomena that could be described by laws of classical, or Newtonian, mechanics of motion of discrete particles.

The second class included all phenomena showing the continuous properties of waves. 

One outstanding property of matter, apparent since the time of Dalton, is that it is built of discrete particles. Most material substances appear to be continuous: water, mercury, salt crystals, gases. But if our eyes could see the nuclei and electrons that constitute atoms, and the fundamental particles that make up nuclei, we would discover quickly that every material substance in the universe composed of a certain number of these basic units and therefore is quantized. ''Objects appear continuous only because of the minuteness of the individual units.''

In contrast, light was considered to be a collection of waves traveling through space at a constant speed; any combination of energies and frequencies was possible. However, Planck, Einstein, and Bohr showed that light when observed under the right conditions, also behaves as though it occurs in particles, or quanta. 

In 1924, the French physicist Louis de Broglie (b. 1892) advanced the complementary hypothesis that all matter possesses wave properties. De Broglie pondered the Bohr atom, and asked himself where, in nature, quantization of energy occurs most naturally. An obvious answer is in the vibration of a string with fixed ends. A violin string can vibrate with only a selected set of frequencies: a fundamental tone with the entire string vibrating as a unit, and overtones of shorter wavelengths. A wavelength in which the vibration fails to come to a '''node''' (a place of zero amplitude) at both ends of the string would be an impossible mode of vibration (Figure 8-15). The vibration of a string with fixed ends is quantized by the '''boundary conditions''' that the ends cannot move.

Can the idea of standing waves be carried over to the theory of the Bohr
atom? Standing waves in a circular orbit can exist only if the circumference
of the orbit is an integral number of wavelengths (Figure 8-15c, d). If it is not, waves from successive turns around the orbit will be out of phase and will cancel. The value of the wave amplitude at 10° around the orbit from a chosen point will not be the same as at 370° or 730°, yet all these represent the same point in the orbit. Such ill-behaved waves are not '''single-valued''' at any point on the orbit: Single-valuedness is a boundary condition on acceptable waves.

For single-valued standing waves around the orbit, the circumference is
an integer, ''n'', times the wavelength:
::2&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;''r'' = ''n''λ
But from Bohr's original assumption about angular momentum, 
::2&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;''r'' = ''n''&lt;math&gt;\textstyle ( \frac{h}{m_ev})&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the idea of standing waves leads to the following relationship
between the mass of the electron ''m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' its velocity, ''v'', and its wavelength, λ:
       λ = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{h}{m_ev}&lt;/math&gt;                             (8-10)

De Broglie proposed this relationship as a general one. With every particle, he said, there is associated a wave. The wavelength depends on the mass of the particle and how fast it is moving. If this is so, the same sort of diffraction from crystals that von Laue observed with x rays should be produced with electrons.

In 1927, C. Davisson and L. H. Germer demonstrated that metal foils
diffract a beam of electrons exactly as they diffract an x-ray beam, and that the wavelength of a beam of electrons is given correctly by de Broglie's relationship (Figure 8-16). Electron diffraction is now a standard technique for determining molecular structure.

{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;
|+'''Example 8'''
|-
|A typical electron diffraction experiment is conducted with electrons accelerated through a potential drop of 40,000 volts, or with 40,000 eV of
energy. What is the wavelength of the electrons?
|-
|'''Solution'''
First convert the energy, ''E'', from electron volts to joules:
::''E'' = 40,000 eV &lt;math&gt;\times \textstyle\frac{1.6022 \times 10^{-19} J}{1 eV}&lt;/math&gt; = 6.409 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-15&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;big&gt;J&lt;/big&gt;
|}

(This and several other useful conversion factors, plus a table of the values of frequently used physical constants, are in Appendix 2.) Since the energy is ''E'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;''m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the velocity of the electrons is
::''v'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle(\frac{2E}{m_e}^{1/2} = \frac{2 \times 6.409 \times 10^{-15}kg m^2 sec^-2}{9.110 \times 10^{-31} kg})^{1/2} &lt;/math&gt;
::&amp;emsp; (1.407 × 10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; sec&lt;sup&gt;-2&lt;/sup&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; = 1.186 × 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; m sec&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
(In the expression ''E'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;''m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;v&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, if the mass is in kilograms and the velocity is in m sec&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, then the energy is in joules: 1 &lt;big&gt;J&lt;/big&gt; equals 1&amp;nbsp;kg m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; sec&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; of energy. We used this conversion of units in the preceding step. The mass of the electron, ''m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 9.110 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−31&lt;/sup&gt; kg, is found in Appendix 2.) The momentum of the electron, ''m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;v'', is
::''m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;v'' = 9.110 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-31&lt;/sup&gt; kg × 1.186 × 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt; m sec&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
::&amp;emsp; = 10.80 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-23&lt;/sup&gt; kg m sec&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

Finally, the wavelength of the electron is obtained from the de Broglie relationship:
::λ = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{h}{m_ev} = \frac{6.6262 \times 10^{-34}J sec}{10.80 \times 10 ^{-23} kg m sec ^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt;
::&amp;emsp; = 0.06130 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-10&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{kg m^2 sec^{-2} sec}{kg m sec^{-1}} =&lt;/math&gt; 0.06130 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-10&lt;/sup&gt; m
::&amp;emsp; = 0.06130 Å

So 40-kilovolt (kV) electrons produce the diffraction effects expected from waves with a wavelength of six-hundredths of an angstrom.

Such calculations are all very well, but the question remains: Are electrons waves or are they particles? Are light rays waves or particles? Scientists worried about these questions for years, until they gradually realized that they were arguing about language and not about science. Most things in our everyday experience behave either as what we would call waves or as what we would call particles, and we have created idealized categories and used the words ''wave'' and ''particle'' to identify them. The behavior of matter as small as electrons cannot be described accurately by these large-scale categories. Electrons, protons, neutrons, and photons are not waves, and they are not particles. Sometimes they act as if they were what we commonly call waves, and in other circumstances they act as if they were what we call particles. But to demand, &quot;Is an electron a wave ''or'' a particle?&quot; is pointless.

This wave-particle duality is present in all objects; it is only because of the scale of certain objects that one behavior predominates and the other is negligible. For example, a thrown baseball has wave properties, but a wavelength so short we cannot detect it.

The wavelength of a 40-kV electron is 0.0613 Å.
::''v'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{h}{\lambda m}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle \frac{6.6262 \times 10^{-34} kg m^2 sec^{-2} sec}{0.06130 \times 10^{-10}m \times 0.200 kg}&lt;/math&gt;

Such a baseball would take over 10,000 years to travel the length of a carbon-carbon bond, 1.54 Å. This sort of motion is completely outside our experience with baseballs; thus we never regard baseballs as having wave properties.

==The Uncertainty Principle==

One of the most important consequences of the dual nature of matter is the uncertainty principle, proposed in 1927 by Werner Heisenberg (1901–1976). This principle states that you cannot know ''simultaneously'' both the position and the momentum of any particle with absolute accuracy. The product of the uncertainty in position, &lt;math&gt;\delta x&lt;/math&gt;, and in momentum, &lt;math&gt;\delta(mv)&lt;/math&gt;, will be equal to or greater than Planck's constant divided by 4&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;:
       [Δx][Δ(mv&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;)] ≥ &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{h}{4\pi}&lt;/math&gt;                                (8-11)

We can understand this principle by considering how we determine the position of a particle. If the particle is large, we can touch it without disturbing it seriously. If the particle is small, a more delicate means of locating it is to shine a beam of light on it and observe the scattered rays. Yet light acts as if it were made of particles - photons - with energy proportional to frequency: ''E'' = ''hν''. When we illuminate the object, we are pouring energy on it. If the object is large, it will become warmer; if the object is small enough, it will be pushed away and its momentum will become uncertain. The least interference that we can cause is to bounce a single photon off the object and watch where the photon goes. Now we are caught in a dilemma. The detail in an image of an object depends on the fineness of the wavelength of the light used to observe the object. (The shorter the wavelength, the more detailed the image.) But if we want to avoid altering the momentum of the atom, we have to use a low-energy photon. However, the wavelength of the low-energy photon would be so long that the position of the atom would be unclear. Conversely, if we try to locate the atom accurately by using a short-wavelength photon, the energy of the photon sends the atom ricocheting away with an uncertain momentum (Figure 8-17). We can design an experiment to obtain an accurate value of either an atom's momentum or its position, but the product of the errors in these quantities is limited by equation 8-11.

{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;
|+'''Example 11'''
|-
|Suppose that we want to locate an electron whose velocity is 1.00 × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; m sec&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; by using a beam of green light whose frequency is 0.600 × 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; sec&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. How does the energy of one photon of such light compare with the energy of the electron to be located?
|-
|'''Solution'''
The energy of the electron is
::''E'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{1}{2}m_ev^2 = \frac{9.110 \times 10^{-31} kg \times 1.00 \times 10^{12} m^2 sec^{-2}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;
::&amp;emsp; = 4.56 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;big&gt;J&lt;/big&gt;
But the energy of the photon is almost as large:
::''E&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''hν'' = 6.6262 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-34&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;big&gt;J&lt;/big&gt; sec × 0.600 × 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; sec&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
::&amp;emsp; = 3.97 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-19&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;big&gt;J&lt;/big&gt;
|}

Finding the position and momentum of such an electron with green light is
as questionable a procedure as finding the position and momentum of one
billiard ball by striking it with another. In either case, you detect the particle
at the price of disturbing its momentum. As a final difficulty, green light is a
hopelessly coarse yardstick for finding objects of atomic dimensions. An
atom is about 1 Å in radius, whereas the wavelength of green light is around
5000 Å. Shorter wavelengths make the energy quandary worse.

We do not see the uncertainty limitations in large objects because of the
sizes of the masses and velocities involved. Compare the following two
problems.

{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;
|+'''Example 12'''
|-
|An electron is moving with ~ velocity of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; m sec&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; Assume that we can measure its position to 0.01 Å, or 1% of a typical atomic radius. Compare the uncertainty in its momentum, ''p'', with the momentum of the electron itself.
|-
|'''Solution'''
The uncertainty in position is Δ''x'' ≅ 0.01 Å = 0.01 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;m. The momentum of the electron is approximately 
::''p'' = ''m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;v'' ≅ 10&lt;sup&gt;-30&lt;/sup&gt; kg × 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; m sec&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; = 10&lt;sup&gt;-24&lt;/sup&gt; kg m sec&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
By the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, the uncertainty in the knowledge of the momentum is
::Δ''p'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{h/4\pi}{\vartriangle x}&lt;/math&gt; ≅ &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{0.5 \times 10^{-34} kg m^2 sec^{-1}}{0.01 \times 10^{-22} kg m sec^{-1}}&lt;/math&gt;
:::≅ 0.5 × 10&lt;sup&gt;-22&lt;/sup&gt; kg m sec&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;
The ''uncertainty'' in the momentum of the electron is 50 times as great as the momentum itself!

|-
|'''Solution'''
The momentum, ''p'', of the baseball is 6&amp;nbsp;kg m sec&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, and Δ''p'' = 1 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−28&lt;/sup&gt; kg m sec&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;. The intrinsic uncertainty in the momentum is only one part in 10&lt;sup&gt;28&lt;/sup&gt;, far below any possibility of detection in an experiment.

==Wave Equations==

In 1926, Erwin Schrödinger (1887–1961) proposed a general wave equation
for a particle. The mathematics of the Schrödinger equation is beyond us,
but the mode of attack, or the strategy of finding its solution, is not. If you
can see how physicists go about solving the Schrödinger equation, even
though you cannot solve it yourself, then quantization and quantum numbers
may be a little less mysterious. This section is an attempt to explain the
method of solving a differential equation of motion* of the type that we
encounter in quantum mechanics. We shall explain the strategy with the
simpler analogy of the equation of a vibrating string. 

The de Broglie wave relationship and the Heisenberg uncertainty
principle should prepare you for the two main features of quantum mechanics
that contrast it with classical mechanics:
::'''1.''' Information about a particle is obtained by solving an equation for a wave.
::'''2.''' The information obtained about the particle is not its position;
rather, it is the ''probability'' of finding the particle in a given region of space.

We can't say whether an electron is in a certain place around an atom, but we can measure the probability that it is there rather than somewhere else.

Wave equations are familiar in mechanics. For instance, the problem of the vibration of a violin string is solved in three steps:

::'''1.''' Set up the equation of motion of a vibrating string. This equation will involve the displacement or amplitude of vibration, A (x), as a function of position along the string, x.
::'''2.''' Solve the differential equation to obtain a general expression for amplitude. For a vibrating string with fixed ends, this general expression is a sine wave. As yet, there are no restrictions on wavelength or frequency of vibration.
::'''3.''' Eliminate all solutions to the equation except those that leave the ends of the string stationary. This restriction on acceptable solutions of the wave equation is a boundary condition. Figure 8-15a shows solutions that fit this boundary condition of fixed ends of the string; Figure 8-15b shows solutions that fail. The only acceptable vibrations are those with ''λ = 2a/n'', or &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\overline{\nu}&lt;/math&gt; = ''n/2a'', in which ''n'' = 1, 2, 3, 4, .... ''The boundary conditions and not the wave equation are responsible for the quantization of the wavelengths of string vibration.''

::&lt;small&gt;*Equations of motion are always ''differential equations'' because they relate the change in one quantity to the change in another, such as change in position to change in time.&lt;/small&gt;

Exactly the same procedure is followed in quantum mechanics:
::'''1.''' Set up a general wave equation for a particle. The Schrödinger equation is written in terms of the function ψ&lt;sub&gt;(x,v,z)&lt;/sub&gt; (where ψ is the Greek letter psi), which is analogous to the amplitude, ''A''&lt;sub&gt;(x)&lt;/sub&gt;, in our violin-string analogy. ''The square of this amplitude, |ψ|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, is the relative '''probability density''' of the particle at position (x, y, z)''. That is, if a small element of volume, ''dv'', is located at (x, y, z), the probability of finding an electron within that element of volume is If |ψ|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ''dv''.
::'''2.''' Solve the Schrödinger equation to obtain the most general expression for ψ&lt;sub&gt;(x, y, z)&lt;/sub&gt;.
::'''3.''' Apply the boundary conditions of the particular physical situation. If the particle is an electron in an atom, the boundary conditions are that |ψ|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; must be ''continuous, single-valued,'' and ''finite'' everywhere. All these conditions are only common sense. First, probability functions do not fluctuate radically from one place to another; the probability of finding an electron a few thousandths of an angstrom from a given position will not be radically different from the probability at the original position. Second, the probability of finding an electron in a given place cannot have two different values simultaneously. Third, since the probability of finding an electron somewhere must be 100%, or 1.000, if the electron really exists, the probability at anyone point cannot be infinite.

We now shall compare the wave equation for a vibrating string and the Schrödinger wave equation for a particle. In this text you will not be expected to do anything with either equation, but you should note the similarities between them.

♦ ''Vibrating string.''  The amplitude of vibration at a distance ''x'' along the string is ''A&lt;sub&gt;(x)&lt;/sub&gt;. The differential equation of motion is
       &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{d^2A_{(x)}}{dx^2} + 4\pi^2\overline{\nu}^2A_{x} = 0&lt;/math&gt;                           (8-12)
The general solution to this equation is a sine function
::&lt;math&gt;A_{(x)} = A_{max}sin(2\pi\overline{\nu}x + \alpha)&lt;/math&gt;

and the only acceptable solutions (Figure 8-15a) are those for which
,math&gt;\textstyle\overline{\nu}&lt;/math&gt; = ''n/2a'', where ''n'' = 1, 2, 3, 4, ... , and for which the phase shift, α, is zero:
::&lt;math&gt;A_{(x)} = A_{max}sin&lt;/math&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\textstyle n(\frac{\pi}{a})x&lt;/math&gt;

♦ ''Schrödinger equation.'' The square of the amplitude If(x.v.z&gt;i' is the probability density of the particle at (x,), z). The differential equation is |ψ&lt;sub&gt;(x, y, z)&lt;/sub&gt;|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the probability density of the particle at (x, y,z). The differential equation is 
       &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2\psi}{\partial z^2} + \frac{8\pi^2m_e}{h}(E - V_{(x,y,z)}\psi_{(x,y,z)} = 0&lt;/math&gt;                             (8-13)

''V'' is the potential energy function at ''(x, y, z)'', and ''m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the mass of the electron.

Although solving equation 8-13 is not a simple process, it is purely a mathematical operation; there is nothing in the least mysterious about it. The energy, ''E'', is the variable that is restricted or quantized by the boundary conditions on |ψ|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Our next task is to determine what the possible energy states are.

==The Hydrogen Atom==

The sine function that is the solution of te equation for the vibrating string is characterized by one integral quantum muber: ''n'' = 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . . The first few acceptable sine functions are

These are the first four curves in Figure 8-15a.

An atom is three-dimensional, whereas the string has only length. The solutions of the Schrödinger equation for the hydrogen atom are characterized by three integer quantum numbers: ''n'', ''l'', and ''m''. These arise when solving the equation for the wave function, Ψ, which is analogous to the function ''A&lt;sub&gt;n(x)&lt;/sub&gt;'' in the vibrating string analogy. In solving the Schrödinger equation, we divide it into three parts. The solution of the '''radial''' part describes how the wave function, Ψ, varies with distance from the ''center'' of the atom. If we borrow the customary coordinate system of the earth, an '''azimuthal''' part produces a function that reveals how Ψ varies with north or south latitude, or distance up or down from the equator of the atom. Finally, an '''angular''' part is a third function that suggests how the wave function varies with east-west longitude around the atom. The total wave function, Ψ, is the product of these three functions. The wave functions that are solutions to the Schrödinger equation for the hydrogen atom are called '''orbitals'''.

In the process of separating the parts of the wave function, a constant,
''n'', appears in the radial expression, another constant, ''l'', occurs in the
radial and azimuthal expressions, and ''m'' appears in the azimuthal and
angular expressions. The boundary conditions that give physically sensible
solutions to these three equations are that each function (radial, azimuthal,
and angular) be continuous, single-valued, and finite at all points. These
conditions will not be met unless ''n'', ''l'', and ''m'' are integers, ''l'' is zero or a positive integer less than ''n'', and ''m'' has a value from -''l'' to + ''l''. From a one-dimensional problem (the vibrating string) we obtained one quantum
number. With a three-dimensional problem, we obtain three quantum numbers.

The '''principal quantum number''', ''n'', can be any positive integer: ''n'' =
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . . . The '''azimuthal quantum number''', ''l'', can have any integral value from 0 to ''n'' - 1. The '''magnetic quantum number''', ''m'', can have any integral value from -''l'' to +''l''. The different quantum states that the
electron can have are listed in Table 8-1. For one electron around an
atomic nucleus, the energy depends only on ''n''. Moreover, the energy expression
is exactly the same as in the Bohr theory:

::''E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle - \frac{Z^2k}{n^2}&lt;/math&gt; &amp;emsp;&amp;emsp; ::''k''&lt;math&gt;= \textstyle\frac{2\pi^2m_ee^4}{h^2}&lt;/math&gt;

For ''Z'' = 1 (the hydrogen atom), we have simply:
::''E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;-\textstyle\frac{k}{n^2}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''k'' = 13.595 eV or 1312 k&lt;big&gt;J&lt;/big&gt; mole&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

Quantum states, with ''l'' = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, . . ., are called the ''s, p, d, f, g, h,'' . . . states, in an extension of the old spectroscopic notation (Figure 8-13). The wave functions corresponding to ''s, p, d,'' . . . states are called ''s, p, d,'' . . . orbitals. All of the ''l'' states for the same ''n'' have the ''same'' energy in the hydrogen atom; the energy-level diagram is as in Figure 8-10.

{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;
|+'''Example 14'''
|-
|An electron in atomic hydrogen has a principal quantum number of 5. What are the possible values of ''l'' for this' electron? When ''l'' = 3, what are the possible values of ''m''? What is the ionization energy (in electron volts) of this electron? What would it be in the same n state in He&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;?
|-
|'''Solution'''
With ''n'' = 5, ''l'' may have a value of 4, 3, 2, 1, or 0. For ''l'' = 3, there are seven possible values of ''m'': 3, 2, 1, 0, -1, -2, -3. The ionization energy of the electron depends only on ''n'', according to:
::''IE'' = -''E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''
::''E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = -&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{k}{n^2}&lt;/math&gt;

::''IE'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{k}{n^2}&lt;/math&gt;
Since ''k'' = 13.6eV. the ''IE'' of an electron with ''n'' = 5 is
::''IE'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{13.6 eV}{5^2} = &lt;/math&gt; 0.544 eV

In general, for one-electron atomic species:
::''IE'' = -''E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''
::''E&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{Z^2k}{n^2}&lt;/math&gt;
::''IE'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{Z^2k}{n^2}&lt;/math&gt;
For HE&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, ''Z'' = 2:
::''IE'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{2^2(13.6eV}{n^2}&lt;/math&gt;
For a He&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; electron with ''n'' = 5, we have
::''IE'' =&lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{4(13.6 eV)}{25} =&lt;/math&gt; 4 × 0.544 eV = 2.18 eV
|}

Each of the orbitals for the quantum states differentiated by ''n, l,'' and ''m''
in Table 8-1 corresponds to a different probability distribution function for
the electron in space. The simplest such probability functions, for s orbitals
(''l'' = 0), are spherically symmetrical. The probability of finding the electron
is the same in all directions but varies with distance from the nucleus. The
dependence of Ψ and of the probability density |Ψ|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; on the distance of the electron from the nucleus in the 1''s'' orbital is plotted in Figure 8-18. You can see the spherical symmetry of this orbital more clearly in Figure 8-19. The
quantity ''|Ψ|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;dv'' can be thought of either as the probability of finding an electron in the volume element ''dv'' in one atom, or as the ''average'' electron density within the corresponding volume element in a great many different
hydrogen atoms. The electron is no longer in orbit in the Bohr-Sommerfeld sense; rather, it is an electron probability cloud. Such probability density clouds are commonly used as pictorial representations of hydrogenlike '''atomic orbitals'''.

The 2''s'' orbital is also spherically symmetrical, but its radial distribution
function has a node, that is, zero probability, at ''r'' = 2 atomic units
(I atomic unit is a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.529 Å). The probability density has a crest at
4 atomic units, which is the radius of the Bohr orbit for ''n'' = 2. There is a
high probability of finding an electron in the 2''s'' orbital closer to or farther
from the nucleus than ''r'' = 2, but there is no probability of ever finding it in
the spherical shell at a distance ''r'' = 2 from the nucleus (Figure 8-20). The
3''s'' orbital has two such spherical nodes, and the 4''s'' has three. However,
these details are not as important in explaining bonding as are the general observations that ''s'' orbitals are spherically symmetrical and that they increase in size as ''n'' increases.

There are three 2''p'' orbitals: 2''p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', 2''p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', 2''p&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;''. Each orbital is cylindrically symmetrical with respect to rotation around one of the three principal axes ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', as identified by the subscript. Each 2''p'' orbital has two lobes of high electron density separated by a nodal plane of zero density (Figures 8-21 and 8-22). The sign of the wave function, Ψ, is positive in one lobe and negative in the other. The 3''p'', 4''p'', and higher ''p'' orbitals have one, two, or more additional nodal shells around the nucleus (Figure 8-23); again, these details are of secondary importance. The significant facts are that the three ''p'' orbitals are mutually perpendicular, strongly directional, and increasing size as ''n'' increases. 

The five ''d'' orbitals first appear for ''n'' = 3. For ''n'' = 3, ''l'' can be 0, 1, or 2, thus ''s'', ''p'', and ''d'' orbitals are possible. The 3''d'' orbitals are shown in Figure 8-24. Three of them, ''d&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''d&lt;sub&gt;yz&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''d&lt;sub&gt;xz&lt;/sub&gt;'', are identical in shape but different in orientation. Each has four lobes of electron density bisecting the angles between principal axes. The remaining two are somewhat unusual: The ''d&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'' orbital has lobes of density along the ''x'' and ''y'' axes, and the ''d&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'' orbital has lobes along the ''z'' axis, with a small doughnut or ring in the ''xy'' plane/ However, there is nothing sacrosanct about the ''z'' axis. The proper combination of wave functions of these five ''d'' orbitals will give us another set of five ''d'' orbitals in which the ''d&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; -like orbital points along the x axis, or the ''y'' axis. We could even combine the wave functions to produce a set of orbitals, all of which were alike but differently oriented. However, the set of orbitals, all of which were alike but differently oriented. However, the set that we have described, ''d&lt;sub&gt;xy&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''d&lt;sub&gt;yz&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''d&lt;sub&gt;xz&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''d&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-y&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''d&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'', is convenient and is used conventionally in chemistry. The sign of the wave function, Ψ, changes from lobe to lobe, as indicated in Figure 8-24.  

The azimuthal quantum number ''l'' is related to the shape of the orbital, and is referred to as the '''orbital-shape quantum number:''' ''s'' orbitals with ''l'' = 0 are spherically symmetrical, ''p'' orbitals with ''l'' = 1 have plus and minus extensions along one axis, and ''d'' orbitals with ''l'' = 2 have extensions along two mutually perpendicular directions (Figure 8-25). The third quantum number, ''m'', describes the orientation of the orbital in space. It is sometimes called the magnetic quantum number because the usual way of distinguishing between orbitals with different spatial orientations is to place the atoms in a magnetic field and to note the differences in energy produced in the orbitals. We will use the more descriptive term, '''orbital-orientation quantum number.'''

There is a fourth quantum number that has not been mentioned. Atomic spectra, and more direct experiments as well, indicate that an electron behaves as if it were spinning around an axis. Each electron has a choice of two '''spin''' states with '''spin quantum numbers''', ''s'' = + &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; or - &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;. A complete description of the state of an electron in a hydrogen atom requires the specification of all four quantum numbers: ''n'', ''l'', ''m'', and ''s''.

==Many-Electron Atoms==

It is possible to set up the Schrödinger wave equation for lithium, which has a nucleus and three electrons, or uranium, which has a nucleus and 92 electrons. Unfortunately, we cannot solve the differential equations. There is little comfort in knowing that the structure of the uranium atom is calculable ''in principle'', and that the fault lies with mathematics and not with physics. Physicists and physical chemists have developed many approximate methods that involve guesses and successive approximations o solutions of the Schrödinger equation. Electronic computers have been of immense value in such successive approximations. But the advantage of
Schrödinger's theory of the hydrogen atom is that it gives us a clear
qualitative picture of the electronic structure of many-electron atoms without
such additional calculations. Bohr's theory was too simple and could
not do this, even with Sommerfeld's help.

The extension of the hydrogen-atom picture to many-electron atoms is
one of the most important steps in understanding chemistry, and we shall
reserve it for the next chapter. We shall begin by assuming that electronic
orbitals for other atoms are ''similar'' to the orbitals for hydrogen and that they
can be described by the same four quantum numbers and have analogous
probability distributions. If the energy levels deviate from the ones for
hydrogen (which they do), then we shall have to provide a persuasive argument,
in terms of the hydrogenlike orbitals, for these changes.

==Summary==

Rutherford's scattering experiments showed the atom to be composed of an
extremely dense, positively charged nucleus surrounded by electrons. The
nucleus is composed of protons and neutrons. A proton has one positive
charge and a mass of 1.67 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−27&lt;/sup&gt; kg. A neutron is uncharged and has a mass of 1.67 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−27&lt;/sup&gt; kg.

Radio waves, infrared, visible, and ultraviolet light, x rays and γ rays are electromagnetic waves with different wavelengths. The speed of light, ''c'', equal to 2.9979 × 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; cm sec&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, is related to its wavelength (λ) and frequency (ν) by ''c'' = ''νλ''. The '''wave number''', &lt;math&gt;\overline{\nu}&lt;/math&gt;, is the reciprocal of the wavelength, &lt;math&gt;\overline{\nu}&lt;/math&gt; = 1/λ. Hot objects radiate energy ('''blackbody radiation'''). Planck proposed that the energy of electromagnetic radiation is '''quantized'''. The energy of a '''quantum''' of electromagnetic radiation is proportional to its '''frequency''', ''E'' = ''hν'', in which ''h'' is '''Planck's constant''', 6.6262 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−34&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;big&gt;J&lt;/big&gt; sec. Electron ejection caused by light striking a metal surface is called the '''photoelectric effect'''. '''Photon''' is the name given to a quantum of light. The energy of a photon is equal to ''hν'', in which ν is the frequency of the electromagnetic wave. The pattern of light absorption by an atom or molecule as a function of wavelength frequency or wave number is called '''absorption spectrum'''. The related pattern of light emission from an atom or molecule is called '''emission spectrum'''. The emission spectrum of atomic hydrogen is composed of several series of lines. The positions of these lines are given accurately by a single equation, the '''Rydberg equation,'''
::&lt;math&gt;\overline{\nu}&lt;/math&gt; = &lt;math&gt;R_H \times\textstyle(\frac{1}{n_1^2}- \frac{1}{n_2^2})&lt;/math&gt;

in which &lt;math&gt;\overline{\nu}&lt;/math&gt; is the wave number of a given line, ''R&lt;sub&gt;H&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the Rydberg constant, 109,677.581&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are integers (''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is greater than ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;). The '''Lyman series''' is that group of lines with ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1 and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 2, 3, 4, . . . . The '''Balmer series''' has ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 2 and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 3, 4, 5, . . ., and the '''Paschen series''' has ''n''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 3 and ''n''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 4, 5, 6, . . . .

Bohr pictured the hydrogen atom as containing an electron moving in a circular orbit around a central proton. He proposed that only certain orbits were allowed, corresponding to the following energies:
::&lt;math&gt;E = - \textstyle\frac{k}{n^2}&lt;/math&gt;

in which ''E'' is the energy of an electron in the atom (relative to an ionized state, H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + ''e''&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;), ''k'' is a constant, equal to 13.595 eV atom&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; or 1312 k&lt;big&gt;J&lt;/big&gt; mole&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''n'' is a quantum number that can take only integer values from 1 to ∞. The radius of a Bohr orbit is ''r'' = ''n&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'', where ''a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' is called the '''first Bohr radius'''; ''a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 0.529 Å. One atomic unit of length equals ''a&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;''. The '''ground state''' of atomic hydrogen is the lowest energy state, where ''n'' = 1. '''Excited states''' correspond to ''n'' = 2, 3, 4, . . . . The energy levels in a general one-electron atomic species, such as He&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and Li&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, with atomic number ''Z'', are given by 
::&lt;math&gt;E = -\textstyle\frac{Z^2k}{n^2}&lt;/math&gt;

The wave nature of electrons was established when Davisson and Germer showed that metal foils diffract electrons in the same way that they diffract a beam of x rays. The wave-particle duality exhibited by electrons is present in all objects. For large objects (such as baseballs), particle behavior predominates to such an extent that wave properties are unimportant. 

Heisenberg proposed that we cannot know both the position and the momentum of a particle with absolute accuracy. The product of the uncertainty in position, Δ''x'', and momentum, Δ(''mv''), must be at least as large as ''h''/4&lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;:
::[Δ''x''][Δ(''mv&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'')] ≥ &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{h}{4\pi}&lt;/math&gt;

The wave equation for a particle is called the '''Schrödinger equation.''' The solutions to the Schrödinger equation, |Ψ&lt;sub&gt;(x,y,z)&lt;/sub&gt;|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, is the relative '''probability density''' of the particle at position &lt;sub&gt;(x,y,z)&lt;/sub&gt;. A place where the amplitude of a wave is zero is called a '''node'''. 

Solution of the Schrödinger equation for the hydrogen atom yields
wave functions Ψ&lt;sub&gt;(x,y,z)&lt;/sub&gt; and discrete energy levels for the electron. The
wave functions Ψ&lt;sub&gt;(x,y,z)&lt;/sub&gt; are called ''orbitals''. An orbital is commonly represented as a probability density cloud, that is, a three-dimensional picture
of |Ψ&lt;sub&gt;(x,y,z)&lt;/sub&gt;|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Three quantum numbers are obtained from solving the Schrödinger equation: the '''principal quantum number''', '''''n''''', can be any positive integer (n = 1, 2, 3, 4, . . . ); the '''azimuthal''' (or orbital-shape) '''quantum number''', ''l'', can have any integral value from 0 to ''n'' - 1; the '''magnetic''' (or orbital-orientation) '''quantum number''', '''m''', takes integral values from -''l'' to + ''l''. The energy levels depend only on ''n'',
::&lt;math&gt;E = - \textstyle\frac{k}{n^2}&lt;/math&gt;

Wave functions with ''l'' = 0 are called ''s'' orbitals; those with ''l'' = 1 are called ''p'' orbitals; those with ''l'' = 2 are called ''d'' orbitals; those with ''l'' = 3, 4, 5, . . ., are called ''f, g, h, . . ., orbitals. A fourth quantum number is needed to interpret atomic spectra. It is the '''spin quantum number''','''''s''''', which can be &lt;math&gt;+ \textstyle\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; or  &lt;math&gt;- \textstyle\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

==Introduction==

We now know the wave functions and energy levels for a hydrogen
atom. With this information and the ''aufbau'' (or buildup) process,
we can go on to determine the electronic structures for atoms
of all the elements. These structures lead directly to the periodic table of
Figures 7-3 and 7-4. As we shall see, the structures explain the stability of
eight-electron shells in noble gases and the trends in ionization energies and
electron affinities of the elements.

==Buildup of Many-Electron Atoms==

Although we cannot solve the Schrödinger equation exactly for many electron atoms, we can show that no radical new features are expected as the atomic number increases. There are the same quantum states, the same four quantum numbers (''n, l, m,'' and ''s''), and virtually the same electronic probability functions or electron-density clouds. The energies of the quantum levels are not identical for all elements; rather, they vary in a regular fashion from one element to the next. 

In studying the electronic structure of a many-electron atom, we shall assume the existence of a nucleus and the required number of electrons. We shall assume that the possible electronic orbitals are hydrogenlike, if not identical to the hydrogen orbitals. Then we shall build the atom by adding electrons one at a time, placing each new electron in the lowest-energy orbital available. In this way we shall build a model of an atom in its ground state, or the state of the lowest electronic energy. Wolfgang Pauli (1900 - 1958) first suggested this treatment of many-electron atoms, and called it the '''''aufbau''''', or buildup, process.

The ''aufbau'' process involves three principles:
::'''1.''' No two electrons in the same atom can be in the same quantum state. This principle is known as the '''Pauli exclusion principle'''. It means that no two electrons can have the same ''n, l, m,'' and ''s'' values. Therefore, one atomic orbital, described by ''n, l,'' and ''m,'' can hold a maximum of two electrons: one of spin &lt;math&gt;+ \textstyle\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and one of spin &lt;math&gt;- \textstyle\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;. We can represent an atomic orbital by a circle and an electron by an arrow:
::::[[Image:Chemical Principles Equation 9.1.png]]
When two electrons occupy one orbital with spins &lt;math&gt;+ \textstyle\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt; and one of spin &lt;math&gt;- \textstyle\frac{1}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, we say that their spins are paired. A '''paired spin''' is represented as follows:
::::[[Image:Chemical Principles Equation 9.2.png]]

::'''2.''' Orbitals are filled with electrons in order of increasing energies. The ''s'' orbital can hold a maximum of 2 electrons. The three ''p'' orbitals can hold a total of 6 electrons, the five ''d'' orbitals can hold 10, and the seven ''f'' orbitals can hold 14. We must decide on the order of increasing energies of the levels before we can begin the buildup process. For atoms with more than one electron, in the absence of an external electric or magnetic field, energy depends on ''n'' and ''l'' (the size and shape quantum numbers) and not on ''m'', the orbital-orientation quantum number. 

::'''3.''' When electrons are added to orbitals of the same energy (such as the five 3''d'' orbitals), one electron will enter each of the available orbitals before a second electron enters any one orbital. This follows '''Hund's rule''', which states that in orbitals of identical energy electrons remain unpaired if possible. This behavior is understandable in terms of electron-electron repulsion. Two electrons, one in ''p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' orbital and one in a ''p&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' orbital, remain farther apart than two electrons paired in the same ''p&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' orbital (Figure 8-22). A consequence of Hund's rule is that a '''half-filled set''' of orbitals (each orbital containing a single electron) is a particularly stable arrangement. The sixth electron in a set of five ''d'' orbitals is forced to pair with another electron in a previously occupied orbital. The mutual repulsion of negatively charged electrons means that less energy is required to remove this sixth electron than to remove one of the five in a set of five half-filled ''d'' orbitals. Similarly, the fourth electron in a set of three ''p'' orbitals is held less tightly than the third.

===Relative Energies of Atomic Orbitals===
 
[[Image:Chemical Principles Fig 9.1.png|frame|'''Figure 9-1''' Radial distribution fnctions for electrons in the 3''s'', 3''p'', and 3''d'' atomic orbitals of hydrogen. These curves are obtained by spinning the orbital in all directions around the nucleus to smear out all details that depend on direction away from the nucleus, and then by measuring the smeared electron probabil ity as a function of distance from the nucleus. The 35 orbital, which is already spherically symmetrical without the smearing operation. has a most probable radius at 13 atomic units and two minor peaks close to the nucleus. The 3''p'' orbital has a maximum density near ''r'' = 12 atomic units, one spherical node at ''r'' = 6 atomic units and a density peak close to the nucleus. The 3''d'' orbital has only one density peak, which occurs very close to the Bohr orbit radius of 9 atomic units. The shapes of the three orbitals before the spherical smearing process are to the right of each curve. An electron in the hydrogen atom with ''n'' = 2 will be in the neighborhood of ''r'' = 4 atomic units. The scale of distances changes in many electron atoms, but relative distances in different orbitals in the atom are the same as in H. An electron in a 3''s'' orbital is more stable than one in a 3''p'' or 3''d'' orbital because it has a greater probability of being inside the orbital of ''n'' = 2 electrons, in which it experiences a greater attraction from the nucleus. The 3''p'' orbital is similarly more stable than the 3''d''.]]
[[Image:Chemical Principles Fig 9.2.png|frame|'''Figure 9-2''']]
[[Image:Chemical Principles Fig 9.3.png|frame|'''Figure 9-3''']]

The 3''s'', 3''p'', and 3''d'' orbitals in the hydrogen atom have the same energy but differ in the closeness of approach of the electron to the nucleus (Figure 9-1). 

The energy of an electron in an orbital depends on the attraction exerted on it by the positively charged nucleus. Electrons with low principal quatum numbers will lie close to the nucleus and will screen some of this electrostatic attraction from electrons with higher principal quantum numbers. In the Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ion, the '''effective nuclear charge''' beyond 1 or 2 atomic units from the nucleus is not the true nuclear charge of +3, but a ''net'' charge of +1 produced by the nucleus plus the two 1''s'' electrons. Similarly, the lone ''n'' = 3 electron in sodium experiences a net nuclear charge of approximately +1 rather than the full nuclear charge of +11.

If the net charge from the nucleus and the filled inner orbitals were concentrated at a point at the nucleus, then the energies of 3''s'', 3''p'', and 3''d'' orbitals would be the same. But the screening electrons extend over an appreciable volume of space. The net attraction that an electron with a principal quantum number of 3 experiences depends on how close it comes to the nucleus, and whether it penetrates the lower screening electron clouds. As in Sommerfeld's elliptical-orbit model, the ''s'' orbital comes closer to the nucleus and is somewhat more stable than the ''p'', and the ''p'' is more stable than the ''d''. This is the reason for the variation of the ''l'' energy levels in the lithium energy-level diagram in Figure 8-13. 

For a given value of the principal quantum number, ''n'', the order of increasing energy is ''s, p, d, f, g'', . . . . It is less easy to decide whether and when the high ''l''-value orbitals of one ''n'' overtake the low-''l'' orbitals of the next: for example, whether a 4''f'' orbital has a higher energy than a 5''s'', or a 3''d'' a higher energy than a 4''s''. The question was originally settled empirically by choosing the order of overlap that accounted for the observed structure of the periodic table. The energies have since been calculated theoretically, and (fortunately for quantum mechanics) they agree with the observed order of levels. The sequence of energy levels is shown in Figure 9-2. 

===Orbital Configurations and First Ionization Energies===

[[Image:Chemical Principles Fig 9.2.png|frame|'''Figure 9-2''' Idealized diagram of the energy levels of the hydrogenlike atomic orbitals during the buildup of many-electron atoms. On each level are written the symbols of those elements that are completed with the addition of electrons on that level. Note the nearly equal energies of 4''s'' and 3''d'', of 5''s'' and 4''d'', of 6''s'', 4''f'', and 5''d'', and finally of 7''s'', 5''f'', and 6''d''. The near equivalence of energies is reflected in some irregularity in the order of filling levels in the transition metals and inner transition metals. Elements with such irregularities are circled. For example, after the 6''s'' and 7''s'' orbitals fill in lanthanum and actinium, the next electron goes into a ''d'' rather than an ''f'' orbital. See Figure 9-3 for details.]]

[[Image:Chemical Principles Fig 9.3.png|frame|'''Figure 9-3''' &quot;Superlong&quot; form of the periodic table. Column head indicates last electron to be added in the Pauli buildup process. Those elements whose electronic structures in the ground state differ from this simple buildup model are in color. In Gd, Cm, Cr, Mo, Cu, Ag, and Au, this difference arises from the extra stability of half-filled (''f''&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt;, ''d''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;) or completely filled (''d''&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;) shells. Other deviations arise from the extremely small energy differences between ''d'' and ''s'', or ''d'' and ''f'' levels. These deviations are less important to us now than the overall patterns of buildup and the way they account for the structure of the periodic table. He is placed over Be in Group IIA since the second electron is added to complete the ''s'' orbital in each of these elements. In the usual periodic table (inside front cover), He is placed over Ne, Ar, and the other noble gases to indicate that the entire valence shell is filled in these elements.]]

We shall build up the electronic structures of the atoms in the periodic table by adding electrons to the hydrogenlike orbitals in order of increasing energy, and by increasing the nuclear charge by one at each step. During this process we shall pay particular attention to the relationship between the '''orbital electronic configurations''' of atoms and their first ionization energies. The '''first ionization energy''' (''IE&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'') of an atom is the energy required to remove one electron:
::atom(''g'') + energy(''IE&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'') &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; positive ion(''g'') + ''e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;''

Numerical ''IE&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' values are given in Table 9-1.* Use the periodic table in Figure 9-3 as an aid as you follow this building process. 

A hydrogen (H) atom has only one electron, which in the ground state must go in the 1''s'' orbital. So we write 1''s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'' (the superscript represents the number of electrons in the orbital), and illustrate the electronic configuration as follows:

&lt;small&gt;*It is common to refer to ''IE&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' simply as ''IE'': This is done in Table 9-1.&lt;/small&gt;

[[Image:Chemical Principles Table 9.1.png]]

[[Image:Chemical Principles Equation 9.3.png]]

In helium (He), the second electron also can be in the 1''s'' orbital if its spin is paired with that of the first electron. In spite of electron - electron repulsion , this electron is more stable in the 1''s'' orbital than in the higher-energy 2''s'' orbital:
[[Image:Chemical Principles Equation 9.4.png]]

Because of the electron - electron repulsion, the first ionization energy of He is less than we might might have expected for an atom with a nuclear charge of +2. A simple calculation illustrates this point. If electron - electron repulsion were not important, each electron would feel the full force of the +2 nuclear charge, and the first ionization energy could be calculated from the one-electron formula:
::''IE&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' = -''E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' = &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{Z^2k}{n^2} = \frac{(2)^2(1312 kJ mole^{-1})}{(1)^2}&lt;/math&gt;
::&amp;emsp; = 5248 k&lt;big&gt;J&lt;/big&gt; mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;

However, the experimental value of ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; for He is much less, 2372 k&lt;big&gt;J&lt;/big&gt; mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Although the strong attraction of a 1''s'' electron to the +2 He nucleus is partially counterbalanced by the electron - electron repulsion, the ''IE''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is still very large, showing how tightly each electron is bound in He. 

Lithium (Li) begins the next period in the periodic table. Two electrons fill the 1''s'' orbital; the third electron in Li must, by the Pauli exclusion principle, occupy the next lowest-energy orbital, namely, the 2''s'':
[[Image:Chemical Principles Equation 9.5.png]]

The fourth electron in beryllium (Be) fills the 2''s'' orbital, and the fifth electron in boron (B) must occupy one of the higher-energy 2''p'' orbitals:
[[Image:Chemical Principles Equation 9.6.png]]

For B, the first ionization energy is less than that of Be because its outermost electron is in a less-stable (higher-energy) orbital. In carbon (C), two of the three 2''p'' orbitals contain an electron. As Hund's rule predicts, in nitrogen (N) the three ''p'' electrons are found in all three 2''p'' orbitals, instead of two being paired in one:
[[Image:Chemical Principles Equation 9.7.png]]

The fourth 2''p'' electron in an oxygen (O) atom is held less tightly than the first three because of the electron - electron repulsion with the other electron in one of the 2''p'' orbitals. The first ionization energy of O is accordingly low. 

The general trend across this period is for each new electron to be held ''more'' tightly because of the increased charge on the nucleus. Because the others 2''s'' and 2''p'' electrons are approximately the same distance from the nucleus, they do not shield the new electron from the steadily increasing charge. This increased charge overcomes the electron repulsion as the fifth 2''p'' electron is added in fluorine (F). Therefore, the fifth electron is held very tightly in F, and the first ionization energy increases again. The most stable configuration results when the sixth 2''p'' electron is added to complete the ''n'' = 2 shell with the noble gas neon (Ne):
[[Image:Chemical Principles Equation 9.8.png]]

The complete ''n'' = 1 shell of two electrons is often given the symbol ''K'', and the complete ''n'' = 2 shell of eight electrons is given the symbol ''l''. A briefer representation of the Ne atom then is 
::Ne: ''KL''

For all but a few atoms, writing the complete orbital electronic structure is a tedious procedure. It is also unnecessary because only the outer electrons are important in chemical reactions. We call the chemically important or outer electrons the '''valence electrons'''. The valence electrons of an atom are the electrons in the ''s'' and ''p'' orbitals beyond the closed-shell configurations. For example, in Li the two 1''s'' electrons in He, they are chemically unreactive. Thus we say that the valence electronic structure of Li is 2''s''&lt;sup.1,/sup&gt;. Similarly, the valence electronic structure of Be is 2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; of B, 2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;; of C, 2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;; of N, 2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;; of O, 2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;; and of F, 2''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;2''p''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;.

The buildup of the third period of the periodic table proceeds exactly as that of the preceding period did. Each new electron is bound more firmly because of the increasing nuclear charge, except for the fluctuations at aluminum (Al) and sulfur (S) produced by the filling of 3''s'' in magnesium (Mg) and the half-filling of 3''p'' in phosphorus (P):
[[Image:Chemical Principles Equation 9.9.png]]

The outermost electron for each element in this period is bound ''less'' firmly than the outermost electron in the corresponding element of the previous period because the ''n'' = 3 electrons are farther from the nucleus. Therefore, the first ionization energies for the ''n'' = 3 elements are smaller than for the corresponding ''n'' = 2 elements. With the completion of the 3''s'' and 3''p'' orbitals, we have again reached a particularly stable electronic configuration with the noble gas argon (Ar). 

Something unusual happens in the fourth period. The 4''s'' orbital penetrates closer to the nucleus than does the 3''d'' orbital, and at this point in the buildup process the 4''s'' has slightly lower energy than the 3''d''. Hence, the one and two electrons that are added to form potassium (K) and calcium (Ca) go into the 4''s'' orbital before the 3''d'' orbital is filled in the elements scandium (Sc) through zinc (Zn). If we assume a constant inner electronic configuration of ''KL'' 3''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;, the valence electronic configurations for the 4''s'' and 3''d'' elements are

There are two anomalies in this order of filling. The half-filled (''d''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;) and filled (''d''&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;) levels are particularly stable, therefore the chromium (Cr) and copper (Cu) atoms have only one 4''s'' electron each.

|-
|'''Solution'''
The ''aufbau'' process predicts ''3d&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;4s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'' for the ground state, but the extra stability of a half-filled level makes the ''3d&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;4s&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;'' configuration slightly lower in energy than ''3d&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;4s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''. The latter configuration thus becomes the first excited state.

For those elements whose ground-state configurations differ from those predicted by the ''aufbau'' process, the predicted configuration is that of an excited state usually only slightly higher in energy than the ground state.

Although the 4''s'' orbital penetrates closer to the nucleus than the 3''d'' and therefore has a lower energy, the ''majority'' of the probability density of the 4''s'' orbital is farther from the nucleus than in the 3''d''. An electron in a 4''s'' orbital is simultaneously farther from the nucleus, on the average, than a 3''d'' electron and more stable because of the small but not negligible probability that it will be very close to the nucleus. In chemical bonding, the energies of electrons in such a closely spaced levels in atoms are not as significant as distances of the electrons from the nucleus. Therefore, the 4''s'' electrons have more of an effect on chemical properties than the relatively buried 3''d'' electrons. With the exception of Cr and Cu, all the elements from Ca through Zn have the same outer electronic structure: two 4''s'' electrons. The chemical properties of this series of elements will vary less rapidly than those in a series in which ''s'' or ''p'' electrons are being added. This is the reason for the relatively unchanging properties of the transition metals. 

After the 3''d'' orbitals are filled, the 4''p'' orbitals fill, in a straightforward manner, to form the representative elements from gallium (Ga), 3''d''&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;4''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;4''p''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, to the noble gas krypton (Kr), 3''d''&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;4''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;4''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;. The first ionization energy, which had risen with increasing nuclear charge in the transition metals, plummets at Ga when the next electron is placed in the less stable 4''p'' orbital. 

The fifth period repeats the same pattern: first the filling of the 5''s'' orbitals, then an interruption while the buried 4''d'' orbitals are filled in another series of transition metals, and finally the filling of the 5''p'' orbitals, ending with the noble gas xenon (Xe), 4''d''&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;5''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;5''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;. The common feature of all noble gases is the outermost electronic arrangement ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;. This is the origin of the stable eight-electron shells that we mentioned in Chapter 7. The late filling of the ''d'' orbitals (and ''f'' orbitals) produces the observed lengths of the periods of the periodic table: first 2, then 8, then only 8 instead of 18 for ''n'' = 3, then only 18 instead of 32 for ''n'' = 4.

According to the energy diagram in Figure 9-2, the 6''s'' orbital is more stable than the 5''d'', although the difference is small and there are exceptions. The ''idealized'' filling pattern is for the 6''s'' orbital to fill in cesium (Cs) and barium (Ba), followed by the deeply buried 4''f'' orbitals in the 14 inner transition elements lanthanum (La) through ytterbium (Yb). There are minor deviations from this pattern, as shown in Figure 9-3. The most important of these deviations is that the first electron after Ba goes into the 5''d'' orbital in La and not into the 4''f''. Lanthanum is more properly a transition metal than an inner transition metal. It is more relevant to understand the idealized filling pattern, however, than to worry about the individual exceptions to it. 

The chemical properties of the inner transition metals cesium (ce) to lutetium (Lu) vary even less than the properties of the transition metals, because successive electrons are in the deeply buried 4''f'' orbitals. After the 4''f'' orbitals are filled, the balance of the third transition-metal series, hafnium (Hf) to mercury (Hg), occurs with the filling of the 5''d'' orbitals. The representative elements thallium (Tl) through radon (Rn) are formed as the 6''p'' orbitals fill. 

The seventh and last period begins in the same way. First the 7''s'' orbital fills, then the inner transition metals from actinium (Ac) to nobelium (No) - with the irregularities shown in Figure 9-3 - and finally the beginning of a fourth transition-metal series with lawrencium (Lr). There are more deviations from this simple ''f''-first, ''d''-next filling pattern in the actinides than in the lanthanides (Figure 9-3), and consequently the first few actinide elements show a greater diversity of chemical properties than do the lanthanides. 

In summary, the idealized sequence of filling of orbitals across a period is as follows:
::'''1.''' For period ''n'', the ''ns'' orbital is filled first with two electrons. These elements are the alkali metals (Group IA) and the alkaline earths (Group IIA) and are classed with the '''representative elements'''.
::'''2.''' The very deeply buried (''n'' - 2) ''f'' orbitals are filled next. They exist only for (''n'' - 2) greater than 3, or for Periods 6 and 7. These elements, which have virtually identical outer electronic structure and therefore virtually identical chemical properties, are the '''inner transition metals.'''
::'''3.''' The less deeply buried (''n'' -1)''d'' orbitals are then filled if they exist. They exist only for (''n'' -1) greater than 2, or for Period 4 and greater. These elements are similar to one another, but not as similar as the inner transition metals. They are called the '''transition metals''' (B groups).
::'''4.''' Finally, the three ''np'' orbitals are filled to form the remaining '''representative elements''' (Groups IIIA-VIIA) and to conclude in each period with the outermost ''s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;p&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;'' configuration of the '''noble gases'''.

We can now explain many of the facts that we presented in Chapter 7. The structure of the periodic table, with its groups and periods, can be seen to be a consequence of the order of energy levels (Figure 9-2). Elements in the same group have similar chemical properties because they have the same outer electronic structure in the ''s'' and ''p'' orbitals. The outer valence electrons that are so important in chemistry are these ''s'' and ''p'' electrons. The closed, inert shell of the noble gases is the completely filled ''s''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''p''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; configuration. We can understand the mechanism of formation of the transition metals and the inner transition metals in terms of the filling of inner ''d'' and ''f'' orbitals. We can see the reasons for general trends across a period or down a group, and for local fluctuations within a period.

===Electron Affinities===

Another atomic property that depends strongly on the orbital electronic configuration is the '''electron affinity''' (''EA''), which is the energy change that accompanies the addition of an electron to a gaseous atom to form a negative ion:
::Atom (''g'') + ''e''&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; negative ion (''g'')

If energy is released when an atom adds an electron to form a negative ion, the ''EA'' has a positive value. If energy is required, the ''EA'' is negative. (Values for the known atomic electron affinities are given in Table 9-1.)

Within a period, the halogens have the highest electron affinities because, after the effect of screening electrons in lower quantum levels has been accounted for, the net nuclear charge is greater for a halogen than for any other element in the period. The noble gases have negative electron affinities because the new electron must be added to the next higher principal quantum level in each atom. Not only would the added electron be farther from the nucleus than the other electrons, it also would receive the full screening effect from all the others.

Lithium and sodium have moderate electron affinities; beryllium has a negative electron affinity, and magnesium has a near zero electron affinity. In Be and Mg the valence ''s'' orbital is full and the added electron must go into a higher-energy ''p'' orbital. Nitrogen and phosphorus have low electron affinities because an added electron must pair with an electron in one of the half-filled ''p'' orbitals.

|-
|'''Solution'''
The valence orbital electronic configuration of P is ''3s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3p&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;''; of S, ''3s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;3p&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;''. The
3''p'' shell is exactly half-filled in a P atom, whereas there is one extra electron
in S that is forced to pair with another 3''p'' electron:
::[[Chemical Principles Equation 9.10.png]]
As a result of the added electron-electron repulsion of the paired 3''p'' electrons in atomic s, the normal trend of increasing first ionization energies with increasing atomic number in a given period is reversed, with the ''IE&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' of P being grater than the ''IE&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' of S. This effect illustrates the special stability associated with a half-filled ''p'' shell. After the half-filled ''p'' shell is disrupted (''p''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; to ''p''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;), the electron-electron repulsions associated with the addition of the fifth and sixth ''p'' electrons in Cl and Ar are not large enough to override the attractive effect of the increasing positive nuclear charge. Thus the ionization energies of S, Cl, and Ar increase in the usual order (S &lt; Cl &lt; Ar).

==Types of Bonding==

[[Image:Chemical Principles Fig 9.4.png|frame|'''Figure 9-4'''|frame|'''Figure 9-4''' The two hydrogen 1''s'' orbitals overlap to form an electron-pair covalent bond in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]

A '''covalent bond''' forms between combining atoms that have electrons of similar, or equal, valence-orbital energies. For example, two atoms of hydrogen are joined by a covalent bond in the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; molecule. The energy required to separate two bonded atoms is known as the '''bond energy'''. For H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the bond energy (corresponding to the process H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;→&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt; H + H) is 432 kJ mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;.

The two electrons in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are shared equally by the two hydrogen 1''s'' orbitals. This, in effect, gives each hydrogen atom a stable, closed-shell (helium-type configuration. An orbital representation of the covalent electron-pair bond in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is shown in Figure 9-4.

An '''ionic bond''' is formed between atoms with very different ionization energies and electron affinities. This situation allows one atom in a two-atom pair to transfer one or more valence electrons to its partner. An atom of Na is so different from an atom of Cl, for example, that it is not possible for atoms in NaCl to share their electrons equally. The Na atom has a relatively low ''IE&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' of 498 kJ mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and a small ''EA'' of 117 kJ mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Therefore, it will readily form Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; in the presence of an atom with a high ''EA''. The chlorine atom has an ''EA'' of 356 kJ mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; and an ''IE&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' of 1255 kJ mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;. Rather than lose an electron, a Cl atom has a strong tendency to gain one. The result is that in diatomic NaCl an ionic bond is formed, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, in which the 3''s'' valence electron in Na is transferred to the one vacancy in the 3''p'' orbitals of Cl. 

===Atomic Radii===

The separation of the nuclei of two atoms that are bonded together (such as H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;) is called the '''bond distance'''. In the hydrogen molecule, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, the bond distance is 0.74 Å. Each hydrogen atom in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; may be assigned an '''atomic radius''' of 0.37 Å. The average radii of atoms o some representative elements shown in the periodic-table arrangement of Figure 9-5 were determined from experimentally observed bond distances in many molecules. The atomic radius in most cases is compared with the size of the appropriate closed-shell positive or negative ion. 

You will notice (Figure 9-5) that the atomic radii become smaller across a given row (or period) of the periodic table. This shrinkage occurs because in any given period ''s'' and ''p'' orbitals acquire additional electrons, which are not able to shield each other effectively from the increasing positive nuclear charge. Thus an increase in the effective nuclear charge, thereby decreasing the effective atomic radius. This is why a Be atom, for example, is smaller than a Li atom. 

From H to Li there is a large increase in effective atomic radius; the third electron in a Li atom is in an orbital that has a much larger effective radius than the H 1''s'' orbital has. According to the Pauli principle, the third electron in Li must be in an orbital with a larger principal quantum number, namely the 2''s'' orbital. Seven more electrons can be added to the 2''s'' and 2''p'' orbitals, which have approximately the same radii. However, these electrons do not effectively shield each other from the positive nuclear charge as it increases, and the result is an increase in the effective nuclear charge and a corresponding decrease in radii in the series Li (''Z'' = 3) through Ne (''Z'' = 10). After Ne, additional electrons cannot be accommodated by the ''n'' = 2 level. Thus an eleventh electron must go into the ''n'' = 3 level, specifically, into the 3''s'' orbital. Since the effective radii increase from the ''n'' = 1 to ''n'' = 2 to ''n'' = 3 valence orbitals, the effective size of an atom also increases with increasing atomic number within each group in the periodic table. 

[[Image:Chemical Principles Fig 9.5.png|frame|'''Figure 9-5''' Relative atomic radii of some elements compared with the radii of the appropriate closed-shell ions. Radii are in angstroms. Solid spheres represent atoms and dashed circles represent ions. Notice that positive ions are smaller than their neutral atoms and negative ions are larger. Why is this so?]]

|-
|'''Solution'''
The order S &gt; Cl &gt; Ar is correct for the radii of these atoms, because the nuclear charge increases by one unit from S to Cl and by one unit from Cl to Ar. The valence electrons are attracted more strongly to the nuclei with higher positive charges in any given period, so the atomic radii decrease correspondingly. For isoelectronic atomic and ionic species (those having the same number of electrons), radii decrease as the nuclear charge (atomic number) increases, again because of increasing electron-nucleus attraction. Thus the correct order for the isoelectronic species is S&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; Ar &gt; K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.

==Electronegativity==

Most bonds in molecules fall somewhere between the extremes of the covalent and ionic types. The bond in the HF molecule, for example, is neither purely covalent nor purely ionic. Just how unequal is the sharing of electrons in HF? And which atom in HF is able to attract the greater share of the bonding electrons, H or F? To anser the second question, and to provide a qualitative guide to the first, Linus Pauling (b. 1901) defined a quantity called '''electronegativity''', χ (the Greek letter chi), in 1932: two years later R. S. Mulliken (b. 1896) showed that electronegativity could be related to the average of the electron affinity and the ionization energy of an atom. 

Pauling obtained electronegativity values by comparing the energy of a bond between unlike atoms, AB, with the ''average'' energies of the A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; bonds. If HF formed a covalent bond as in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, then we would expect the bond energy in HF to be close to the average (say, the arithmetic mean or the geometric mean) of the bond energies in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. However, in molecules such as HF, the bonds are stronger than predicted from such averages. The bond energy of HF is 565 kJ mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, whereas the bond energies of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are 432 and 139 kJ mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, respectively. The geometric mean of the last two values is (139 &lt;math&gt;\times&lt;/math&gt; 432)&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt; = 245 kJ mole&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;, which is much less than the observed bond energy of HF. This &quot;extra&quot; bond energy (designated Δ) in an AB molecule is assumed to be a consequence of the '''partial ionic character''' of the bond due to the electronegativity difference between atoms A and B. The electronegativity difference between A and B may be defined as 
       χ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; - χ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.102Δ&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;                             (9-1)
in which χ&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; and χ&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; are the electronegativities of atoms A and B, and Δ is the extra bond energy in kilojoules per mole. The extra bond energy is calculated
from the equation
::Δ = DE&lt;sub&gt;AB&lt;/sub&gt; - [(DE&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;)(DE&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;)]&lt;sup&gt;1/2&lt;/sup&gt;
in which ''DE'' is the particular bond dissociation energy.

In equation 9-1 the square root of Δ is used because it gives a more consisten set of atomic electronegativity values. Since only differences are obtained from equation 9-1, one atom must be assigned a specific electronegativity value, and then the values for the other atoms can be calculated easily. In a widely adopted electronegativity scale, the most electrnegative atom, F, is assigned a value of 3.98. (Electronegativity values based on this assignment are given in Table 9-1.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The original source material for this chapter can be found at http://caltechbook.library.caltech.edu/178/11/Chapter_10.pdf

Unfortunately, the PDF version is a scanned image of the textbook pages, so the text cannot be cut and pasted into this wikibook directly.  However, Google automatically generates html versions of documents as it crawls the web. Therefore, if you perform a Google search for the PDF file, you will frequently (but not always) find a link to an poorly formatted HTML version that was created using optical character recognition (OCR) software.

An easy way to work on this chapter is to cut and paste the text from the HTML version, and then capture the images from the original PDF version. Otherwise, you may have to retype the text from scratch (ugh).

Mohr's circle is a graphical depiction of two dimensional stress states. Amongst others, it can be applied to stresses and strains. In soil mechanics, Mohr's circles are used to visualize relationships between normal and shear stresses, and to estimate the maximum stresses, based on three or more soil samples extracted from a site. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.roymech.co.uk/Useful_Tables/Mechanics/Mohrs_circle.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://web.mit.edu/16.unified/www/FALL/materials/documents/HO-M-6(Mohrs)(08).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;


In practice, Mohr's circles are constructed based on the results of triaxial compressions tests for undisturbed soils. This test provides for the measurement of the total stresses applied to a specimen, uncorrected for pore pressure, and it provides data for determining strength properties and stress-strain relations for soils. It &quot;determines the unconsolidated, undrained, compressive strength of cylindrical specimens of cohesive soils in an undisturbed condition, using a strain-controlled application of the axial compression-test load where the specimen is subjected to a confining fluid pressure in a triaxial chamber&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;ftp://ftp.dot.state.tx.us/pub/txdot-info/cst/TMS/100-E_series/pdfs/soi118.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;


The shear strength of an extracted soil sample when tested in a triaxial compression test may differ from that of the same sample in situ, owing to the mechanical processes involved in soil extraction such as drilling, transportation and storage. Interpretation of the graphical results need to take this into account for greater accuracy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Name and purpose of this chapter ==

&quot;Panic&quot; (a wikiBooks admin?) pointed out to me that this chapter confused him. Especially the pronounced NPOV message, and the page named &quot;Benefits.&quot; I believe some changes need to be made to this section, but I wanted to start a baseline discussion about 1) the purpose of this section, and 2) why it was named as it was (and will be).

&lt;!-- This is a template to keep the heading out of the TOC --&gt;
{{hiddenh3|Purpose}}

The purpose of this books' chapter is to fairly and accurately depict the common user experience with MJ. This creates problems because the experience of users isn't a shared one (like it would be for MS Word users). MJ tends to work, or it doesn't. It tends to evoke &quot;love it,&quot; or &quot;hate it,&quot; sentiment. And, for good reason. 

That's the dilemma I faced when creating this book. I wanted to describe why people use MJ. It's features and benefits (such as the potential for extremely low price). But, that's impossible to do without mentioning the downsides that come with MJ, and which affect users to different degrees. If I didn't mention those downsides which are just as real as the benefits, then this book wouldn't conform to wikiBooks [[w:Neutral_point_of_view | &quot;neutral-point-of-view&quot; policy]].

To make matters worse, MJ is (or has the potential to be) a &quot;disruptive (game-changing) technology.&quot; This contributes to the passion over often-wildly disparate user experiences:

* There are some who see any criticism of MJ as jeopardizing a revolution in telecommunications. (They'll even go so far as to suggest that complaints are the result of incumbent providers spreading &quot;FUD,&quot; which I personally believe incumbents have a reason to do, and that some criticism can be attributed to them.). 
* Similarly, there are others who bristle at what they consider to be &quot;fan boy&quot; devotion to MJ. They believe MJ is a huge scam, tricking people into pre-purchasing service and will then close down or, become widespread malware/spyware (with no uninstall capability).

To varying degrees either side makes legitimate, compelling points. And, most MJ users see various shades of both sides, picking and choosing based upon what is important (or credible) to them. In essence, there's no way to present MJ's &quot;benefits&quot; (why users choose to use it) without presenting the negatives. And, even the &quot;benefits&quot; are very subjective. Some extremely positive users don't care about quality problems because they need $2-per-month service. Others complain about the quality, and would be happy with $5 a month.

MJ is unique in this way. It is extreme compared to other tools which someone may write a book about. It presents extreme benefits and extreme downsides. It's very situational, depending on what is important to an individual user. Any user who mentions what's important to them is likely to receive 20 responses (on forums) from others who disagree.

Therefore, I tried to create this area to fairly assess both sides (and how they can be taken together in different ways, depending on what is important to an individual). 

I also wanted to set the tone for this topic, that it should contain a summary of user sentiment found frequently enough in public forums (reviews, etc.) to justify acknowledgment. It shouldn't be a place for individual reviews. Just an overview of what is commonly expressed by MJ users.

&lt;!-- This is a template to keep the heading out of the TOC --&gt;
{{hiddenh3|Page name}}

As part of what I tried to accomplish above, I struggled with how to name the sub-pages. I initially called it &quot;Praise&quot; and &quot;Criticism.&quot; But, I worried that users who feel more passionately about the benefits of MJ would feel this term diminishes their views, as if it's &quot;religious,&quot; faith-based praise.

Therefore, I chose &quot;Benefits&quot; and &quot;Criticism.&quot; But, I understood &quot;Panic's&quot; confusion. &quot;Benefits&quot; evokes a more neutral, balanced presentation of what makes MJ different among its peers. I was striving for a different neutrality -- among MJ users -- recognizing that even the most generalized &quot;benefits&quot; can't be fairly presented without acknowledging the problems that do exist. This then leads to those who place more emphasis on MJ's &quot;benefits&quot; wanting to point out more specific benefits (which may not be suitable for the kind of general, comparitave &quot;Benefits&quot; topic normally found in an introduction.

So, I plan to rename the sub-pages to &quot;Pros&quot; and &quot;Cons.&quot; 

But, I'm still trying to think of the best name for the chapter page to represent the context of these pros/cons. I'm considering: 

* The user experience (good and bad)
* Common user sentiment (or, just &quot;User sentiment&quot; because, as mentioned above, sentiment is often not shared).
* Common sentiment (the user experience)
* MJ in practice: the positives and negatives.

&lt;!-- This is a template to keep the heading out of the TOC --&gt;
{{hiddenh3|Summary}}

As these issues are further resolved, I think the &quot;features sub-topic (in the &quot;introduction&quot; chapter) should be considered the place for more generalized &quot;benefits&quot; topic, presenting MJ benefits generally, benefits of VOIP generally, acknowledging other services. Maybe a comparison of features.

&lt;!-- This is a template to keep the heading out of the TOC --&gt;
{{hiddenh3|Suggestions for participating}}

I created this discussion topic just as a baseline for any further discussion about this chapter. Trying to avert edit wars, etc. If any MJ users take exception to anything in this book's chapter, or feel something should be added (or removed), I '''strongly''' suggest we try to operate with the following set of shared values:

* Start a discussion this page, or on one of the sub-pages. We all know this can be a contentious topic among MJ users. It should be more respectful to talk about it first.
* Err on the side of caution and respect for opposing viewpoints. Wikibooks encourages contributors to [[w:Be_bold | be bold]], but in this one facet of using MJ, I suggest we be more careful than bold.
* Acknowledging the existence of viewpoints (held widely enough to merit acknowledgment) isn't a validation of their validity or importance. We know they exist. That's all we're trying to depict. Not their merits, or how certain things outweigh other things.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The eight queens puzzle is the problem of putting eight chess queens on an 8×8 chessboard such that none of them is able to capture any other using the standard chess queen's moves. The queens must be placed in such a way that no two queens would be able to attack each other. Thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal. The eight queens puzzle is an example of the more general n queens puzzle of placing n queens on an n×n chessboard, where solutions exist only for n = 1 or n ≥ 4.

[[File:Water strider Gerridae.jpg|thumb|250px|right|]]
Water striders are among the most recognizable aquatic insects. Most species have long, slender bodies covered with thick, velvety, water-repelling hairs. Some species have shorter and rounder bodies. They have large prominent eyes and are usually dark brown to black in color. Some have stripes on their bodies. Others have yellow on top of the head. Many water striders are very small (6/100 inch) and others are relatively long (1-1/2 inches). Females are generally larger than males. 

Water striders have two short forelegs, two long middle legs and two long hind legs. The middle and hind legs are used for locomotion. Each leg is covered with thousands of microscopic, water-repelling hairs to keep them dry. Wet legs would break through the surface of the water, causing the water strider to sink. The hairs have grooves that trap air, increasing buoyancy and water resistance. Scientists use the term “superhydrophobic” to describe how the hairs repel water. 

There is an air cushion between water striders feet and the water surface. The purpose of this cushion is to create stability and maintain balance even in rainstorms. There are claws above the foot instead of at the end, so the water surface does not break.

== Where does it live? ==


Scientists believe there are about 500 water strider species worldwide. They estimate 45 to 60 species live in North America. ''Aquarius remigis'' is the scientific name for one species commonly found in eastern North America. Water striders spend their entire lives on the water’s surface. They can be seen on lakes, ponds and calm parts of rivers and streams.

Five water strider species roam the ocean. These insects, known as sea skaters, are the only true marine insect. Their scientific name is ''Halobates''. They have adapted to life on the open seas in warm areas of the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian oceans. Often, they are seen on tide pools or in debris that has washed ashore. 


== What does it eat? ==


Water striders are generally predators. They survive by capturing and feeding on other creatures. They eat newly hatched tadpoles and mosquito larvae that float to the surface. They often eat dead insects. Sea skaters depend on finding floating fish eggs and other sources of protein. 

Water striders eat land-dwelling insects that drop into the water. When insects drop they are caught on the water’s surface. As they struggle, they send “communication ripples” over the surface. Water striders detect these ripples through sensory receptors on the tips of their legs. They dart quickly to grab the insect prey with their strong front legs. 

Because they are “true bugs,” water striders are able to swing their beak forward from its resting position on the underside of the body. The beak is used to pierce the prey and inject it with digestive juices. The juices dissolve and liquefy internal organs allowing the water strider to suck out nourishment. 


== How does it defend itself? ==


Water striders are eaten by birds, fish, frogs,and aquatic insects. They are especially vulnerable when mating. One defence against predators is camouflage. Resting on floating leaves and vegetation lets water striders blend into their surroundings. Their large prominent eyes help them avoid predators.

== What stages of metamorphosis does it go through? ==


Water striders mate on the water’s surface. In some species, the males are territorial and defend small circles while waiting for females to drift by. Females are sometimes lured by vibrations made by a male tapping its legs on the water surface. 

Females lay rows of eggs on submerged plants, rocks, logs or floating objects. Sometimes eggs are inserted into a plant stem. 

Water striders develop through simple metamorphosis. The immature stages are called nymphs. They resemble adults but are smaller in size. Their wings are not as fully developed as adult wings. Nymphs live below the water surface where they molt five times before becoming adults. After hatching they must swim upward and break the surface tension to get to the top of the water. They begin to skate as soon as they are afloat. One or two generations of water striders mature each year. 

For the sea skaters, finding places to lay eggs is more difficult. They use any floating object, including feathers, seaweed, and live seabirds.

== What special behavior does it exhibit? ==

[[File:Water strider.jpg|thumb|300px|right|]]
Because they have the unique ability to move about on the surface, water striders are known as “skaters,” “scooters,” or “wherrymen.” Sometimes they are called “Jesus Bugs” because they appear to “walk” on water. 

Long middle and hind legs spread the weight evenly over the water surface. The “surface tension” of calm, smooth water keeps them afloat. Surface tension is the tendency of water molecules to cling to each other. It creates a thin film that water striders can float on without breaking through. 

Water striders move in two different ways—skating in a slow, graceful glide or darting in a quick, spurting motion. Skating is done when moving upstream against a current or getting to food and other striders. Gliding is done by “rowing” with the middle legs. Feet press down on the water’s surface creating little dimples around them. Like the blades of an oar, the dimples generate hidden underwater currents that move the insect forward. Hind legs act as rudders and brakes. Front legs are free to snare prey.

Darting is done whenever quick movement is needed—to escape danger, pursue prey, or grab females. Darting uses both middle and back legs for propulsion. Water striders can dart a distance of 100 body lengths per second. That would be 400 miles per hour for a six foot tall person.

'''Windows'''

The MagicJack softphone does not have an &quot;exit&quot; option. Therefore, the proper way to exit the softphone is to use the &quot;Safely remove hardware&quot; tool in the task tray. (See FAQ answer: [[MagicJack/Support_Resources/FAQ#Should_I_just_unplug_my_MagicJack_USB_device.3F | Should I just unplug my USB device?]]).).

However, there may be times when you simply want to exit the softphone (perhaps to restart it later) without safely removing and re-inserting the USB device. Or, some users choose to run MagicJack without the USB device. In this case, they have no way to exit the softphone without going into the Windows Task Manager (alt-cntl-delete to find it) and ending the magicjack.exe process. (See the How-To: [[MagicJack/Support_Resources/How-To/MJ_Without_Dongle | MagicJack Without Dongle]].). 

In such cases, the following may be useful:

# Create a shortcut on your desktop named &quot;Exit MagicJack.&quot;
#* Right click on your Desktop, New, and Shortcut
# In the shortcut &quot;Target&quot; or &quot;Location&quot; field use the following: &lt;/br&gt; &lt;code&gt;# XP uses &quot;tskill&quot;&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;code&gt;tskill.exe magicjack&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;code&gt;# Vista uses &quot;taskkill&quot;&lt;/code&gt; &lt;br /&gt; &lt;code&gt;taskkill /f /IM magicjack.exe&lt;/code&gt;
# Select &quot;Minimized&quot; in the &quot;Run&quot; field 
#* You may have to finish creating the shortcut, then right click it, and choose Properties before having a chance to set this value.

Now, you should be able to double click that shortcut to cause your softphone to exit. Restart it using the icon on your desktop which MagicJack should have placed there when it first installed.

Warning: Be aware that killing the softphone may prevent it from communicating its new status to the MJ server. See the FAQ answer: [[MagicJack/Support_Resources/FAQ#Can_I_shut_down_my_computer_without_removing_the_USB_device.3F | Can I shut down my computer without removing the USB Device?]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Input and Variables ===
Now I feel it is time for a really complicated program.  Here it is:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print(&quot;Halt!&quot;)
user_input = input(&quot;Who goes there?&quot;)
print(&quot;You may pass,&quot;,  user_input)
&lt;/source&gt;

When '''I''' ran it, here is what '''my''' screen showed:

 Halt!
 Who goes there? '''Josh'''
 You may pass, Josh

''Note: After running the code by pressing F5, the python shell will only give output:''

 Halt!
 Who goes there?

''You need to enter your name in the python shell, and then press enter for the rest of the output.''

Of course when you run the program your screen will look different
because of the &lt;code&gt;input()&lt;/code&gt; statement. When you ran the program
you probably noticed (you did run the program, right?) how you had to
type in your name and then press Enter. Then the program printed out
some more text and also your name. This is an example of ''input''.  The
program reaches a certain point and then waits for the user to input
some data that the program can use later.

Of course, getting information from the user would be useless if we didn't have anywhere to put that information and this is where variables come in.  In the previous program &lt;code&gt;user_input&lt;/code&gt; is a ''variable''.  Variables are like a box that can store some piece of data.  Here is a program to show examples of variables:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = 123.4
b23 = 'Spam'
first_name = &quot;Bill&quot;
b = 432
c = a + b
print(&quot;a + b is&quot;,c)
print(&quot;first_name is&quot;,first_name)
print(&quot;Sorted Parts, After Midnight or&quot;,b23)
&lt;/source&gt;

And here is the output:

 a + b is 555.4
 first_name is Bill
 Sorted Parts, After Midnight or Spam

Variables store data.  The variables in the above program are &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;b23&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;first_name&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;. The two basic types are ''strings'' and ''numbers''.  Strings are a sequence of letters, numbers and other characters. In this example &lt;code&gt;b23&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;first_name&lt;/code&gt; are variables that are storing strings. &lt;code&gt;Spam&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Bill&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;a + b is&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;first_name is&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;Sorted Parts, After Midnight or&lt;/code&gt; are the strings in this program.  The characters are surrounded by &lt;code&gt;&quot;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;'&lt;/code&gt;.  The other type of variables are numbers. Remember that variables are used to store a value, they do not use quotation marks (&quot; and '). If you want to use an actual ''value'', you ''must'' use quotation marks.

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
value1 == Pim
value2 == &quot;Pim&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Both look the same, but in the first one Python checks if the value stored in the variable &lt;code&gt;value1&lt;/code&gt; is the same as the value stored in the ''variable'' &lt;code&gt;Pim&lt;/code&gt;. In the second one, Python checks if the string (the actual letters &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt;,&lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt;) are the same as in &lt;code&gt;value2&lt;/code&gt; (continue this tutorial for more explanation about strings and about the &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt;).

=== Assignment ===

Okay, so we have these boxes called variables and also data that can go into the variable.  The computer will see a line like &lt;code&gt;first_name = &quot;Bill&quot;&lt;/code&gt; and it reads it as &quot;Put the string &lt;code&gt;Bill&lt;/code&gt; into the box (or variable) &lt;code&gt;first_name&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. Later on it sees the statement &lt;code&gt;c = a + b&lt;/code&gt; and it reads it as &quot;put the sum of &lt;code&gt;a + b&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;123.4 + 432&lt;/code&gt; which equals &lt;code&gt;555.4&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. The right hand side of the statement (&lt;code&gt;a + b&lt;/code&gt;) is ''evaluated'' and the result is stored in the variable on the left hand side (&lt;code&gt;c&lt;/code&gt;). This is called ''assignment'', and you should not confuse the assignment equal sign (&lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt;) with &quot;equality&quot; in a mathematical sense here (that's what &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; will be used for later).

Here is another example of variable usage:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = 1
print(a)
a = a + 1
print(a)
a = a * 2
print(a)
&lt;/source&gt;

And of course here is the output:

 1
 2
 4

Even if the same variable appears on both sides of the equals sign (e.g., spam = spam), the computer still reads it as, &quot;First find out the data to store and then find out where the data goes.&quot;

One more program before I end this chapter:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
number = float(input(&quot;Type in a number: &quot;))
integer = int(input(&quot;Type in an integer: &quot;))
text = input(&quot;Type in a string: &quot;)
print(&quot;number =&quot;, number)
print(&quot;number is a&quot;, type(number))
print(&quot;number * 2 =&quot;, number * 2)
print(&quot;integer =&quot;, integer)
print(&quot;integer is a&quot;, type(integer))
print(&quot;integer * 2 =&quot;, integer * 2)
print(&quot;text =&quot;, text)
print(&quot;text is a&quot;, type(text))
print(&quot;text * 2 =&quot;, text * 2)
&lt;/source&gt;

The output I got was:

 Type in a number: '''12.34'''
 Type in an integer: '''-3'''
 Type in a string: '''Hello'''
 number = 12.34
 number is a &lt;class 'float'&gt;
 number * 2 = 24.68
 integer = -3
 integer is a &lt;class 'int'&gt;
 integer * 2 = -6
 text = Hello
 text is a &lt;class 'str'&gt;
 text * 2 = HelloHello

Notice that &lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt; was created with &lt;code&gt;float(input())&lt;/code&gt; while &lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt; was created with &lt;code&gt;input()&lt;/code&gt;. 
&lt;code&gt;input()&lt;/code&gt; returns a string while the function &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt; returns a number from a string. &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; returns an integer, that is a number with no decimal point.  When you want the user to type in a decimal use &lt;code&gt;float(input())&lt;/code&gt;, if you want the user to type in an integer use &lt;code&gt;int(input())&lt;/code&gt;, but if you want the user to type in a string use &lt;code&gt;input()&lt;/code&gt;.

The second half of the program uses the &lt;code&gt;type()&lt;/code&gt; function which tells what kind a
variable is. Numbers are of type &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;, which are
short for ''integer'' and ''floating point'' (mostly used for decimal numbers), respectively. Text strings are of type &lt;code&gt;str&lt;/code&gt;, short for ''string''. Integers and floats can be worked on by mathematical functions, strings cannot. Notice how when python
multiplies a number by an integer the expected thing happens. However
when a string is multiplied by an integer the result is that multiple
copies of the string are produced (i.e., &lt;code&gt;text * 2 = HelloHello&lt;/code&gt;).

Operations with strings do different things than 
operations with numbers. As well, some operations only work with numbers (both integers and floating point numbers) and will give an error if a string is used. Here are some interactive mode examples
to show that some more.

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;This&quot; + &quot; &quot; + &quot;is&quot; + &quot; joined.&quot;)
This is joined.
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;Ha, &quot; * 5)
Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, 
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;Ha, &quot; * 5 + &quot;ha!&quot;)
Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, Ha, ha!
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(3 - 1)
2
&gt;&gt;&gt; print(&quot;3&quot; - &quot;1&quot;)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;&lt;stdin&gt;&quot;, line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'str'
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&lt;/pre&gt;

Here is the list of some string operations:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!Operation 
!Symbol 
!Example
|-
|Repetition 
|&lt;code&gt;*&lt;/code&gt; 
|&lt;code&gt;&quot;i&quot; * 5 == &quot;iiiii&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
|-
|Concatenation 
|&lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; 
|&lt;code&gt;&quot;Hello, &quot; + &quot;World!&quot; == &quot;Hello, World!&quot;&lt;/code&gt;
|}

=== Examples ===

'''Rate_times.py'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# This program calculates rate and distance problems
print(&quot;Input a rate and a distance&quot;)
rate = float(input(&quot;rate: &quot;))
distance = float(input(&quot;Distance: &quot;))
print(&quot;Time:&quot;, (distance / rate))
&lt;/source&gt;

Sample runs:

 Input a rate and a distance
 Rate: '''5'''
 Distance: '''10'''
 Time: 2.0

 Input a rate and a distance
 Rate: '''3.52'''
 Distance: '''45.6'''
 Time: 12.9545454545

'''Area.py'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# This program calculates the perimeter and area of a rectangle
print(&quot;Calculate information about a rectangle&quot;)
length = float(input(&quot;Length: &quot;))
width = float(input(&quot;Width: &quot;))
print(&quot;Area:&quot;, length * width)
print(&quot;Perimeter:&quot;, 2 * length + 2 * width)
&lt;/source&gt;

Sample runs:

 Calculate information about a rectangle
 Length: '''4'''
 Width: '''3'''
 Area: 12.0
 Perimeter: 14.0

 Calculate information about a rectangle
 Length: '''2.53'''
 Width: '''5.2'''
 Area: 13.156
 Perimeter: 15.46

'''Temperature.py'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# This program converts Fahrenheit to Celsius
fahr_temp = float(input(&quot;Fahrenheit temperature: &quot;))
print(&quot;Celsius temperature:&quot;, (fahr_temp - 32.0) * 5.0 / 9.0)
&lt;/source&gt;

Sample runs:

 Fahrenheit temperature: '''32'''
 Celsius temperature: 0.0

 Fahrenheit temperature: '''-40'''
 Celsius temperature: -40.0

 Fahrenheit temperature: '''212'''
 Celsius temperature: 100.0

 Fahrenheit temperature: '''98.6'''
 Celsius temperature: 37.0

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== While loops ===
Presenting our first ''control structure''.  Ordinarily the computer starts with the first line and then goes down from there.  Control structures change the order that statements are executed or decide if a certain statement will be run.  Here's the source for a program that uses the while control structure:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = 0            # FIRST, set the initial value of the variable a to 0(zero).
while a &lt; 10:    # While the value of the variable a is less than 10 do the following:
    a = a + 1    # Increase the value of the variable a by 1, as in: a = a + 1! 
    print(a)     # Print to screen what the present value of the variable a is.
                 # REPEAT! until the value of the variable a is equal to 9!? See note. 
                 
                 # NOTE:
                 # The value of the variable a will increase by 1
                 # with each repeat, or loop of the 'while statement BLOCK'.
                 # e.g. a = 1 then a = 2 then a = 3 etc. until a = 9 then...
                 # the code will finish adding 1 to a (now a = 10), printing the 
                 # result, and then exiting the 'while statement BLOCK'. 
                 #              --
                 # While a &lt; 10: |
                 #     a = a + 1 |&lt;--[ The while statement BLOCK ]
                 #     print (a) |
                 #              --
&lt;/source&gt;

And here is the extremely exciting output: 

 1
 2
 3
 4
 5
 6
 7
 8
 9
 10

(And you thought it couldn't get any worse after turning your computer into a five-dollar calculator?)

So what does the program do?  First it sees the line &lt;code&gt;a = 0&lt;/code&gt; and sets &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; to zero. Then it sees &lt;code&gt;while a &lt; 10:&lt;/code&gt; and so the computer checks to see if &lt;code&gt;a &lt; 10&lt;/code&gt;. The first time the computer sees this statement, &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is zero, so it is less than 10. In other words, as long as &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is less than ten, the computer will run the tabbed in statements. This eventually makes &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; equal to ten (by adding one to &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; again and again) and the &lt;code&gt;while a &lt; 10&lt;/code&gt; is not true any longer. Reaching that point, the program will stop running the indented lines.

Always remember to put a colon &quot;''':'''&quot; at the end of the &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; statement line!

Here is another example of the use of &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = 1
s = 0
print('Enter Numbers to add to the sum.')
print('Enter 0 to quit.')
while a != 0:                           
    print('Current Sum:', s)            
    a = float(input('Number? '))        
    s = s + a                            
print('Total Sum =', s)
&lt;/source&gt;

 Enter Numbers to add to the sum.
 Enter 0 to quit.
 Current Sum: 0
 Number? '''200'''
 Current Sum: 200.0
 Number? '''-15.25'''
 Current Sum: 184.75
 Number? '''-151.85'''
 Current Sum: 32.9
 Number? '''10.00'''
 Current Sum: 42.9
 Number? '''0'''
 Total Sum = 42.9

Notice how &lt;code&gt;print 'Total Sum =', s&lt;/code&gt; is only run at the end. The &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; statement only affects the lines that are indented with whitespace. The &lt;code&gt;!=&lt;/code&gt; means does not equal so &lt;code&gt;while a != 0:&lt;/code&gt; means as long as &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is not zero run the tabbed statements that follow. 

Note that &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; is a floating point number, and not all floating point numbers can be accurately represented, so using &lt;code&gt;!=&lt;/code&gt; on them can sometimes not work.  Try typing in 1.1 in interactive mode. 

==== Infinite loops or Never Ending Loop====
Now that we have while loops, it is possible to have programs that run forever. An easy way to do this is to write a program like this:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
while 1 == 1:
   print(&quot;Help, I'm stuck in a loop.&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

The &quot;&lt;tt&gt;==&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; operator is used to test equality of the expressions on the two sides of the operator, just as &quot;&lt;tt&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; was used for &quot;less than&quot; before (you will get a complete list of all comparison operators in the next chapter).

This program will output &lt;code&gt;Help, I'm stuck in a loop.&lt;/code&gt; until the heat death of the universe or you stop it, because 1 will forever be equal to 1.  The way to stop it is to hit the Control (or ''Ctrl'') button and ''C'' (the letter) at the same time.  This will kill the program.  (Note: sometimes you will have to hit enter after the Control-C.) On some systems, nothing will stop it, short of killing the process--so avoid!

=== Examples ===
==== Fibonacci sequence ====
'''Fibonacci-method1.py'''
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# This program calculates the Fibonacci sequence
a = 0
b = 1
count = 0
max_count = 20

while count &lt; max_count:

{{Solution|title=Solution|text=

Write a program that asks the user for a Login Name and password.  Then when they type &quot;lock&quot;, they need to type in their name and password to unlock the program.
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
name = input(&quot;What is your UserName: &quot;)
password = input(&quot;What is your Password: &quot;)
print(&quot;To lock your computer type lock.&quot;)
command = None
input1 = None
input2 = None
while command != &quot;lock&quot;:
    command = input(&quot;What is your command: &quot;)
while input1 != name:
    input1 = input(&quot;What is your username: &quot;)
while input2 != password:
    input2 = input(&quot;What is your password: &quot;)
print(&quot;Welcome back to your system!&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

If you would like the program to run continuously, just add a &lt;code&gt;while 1 == 1:&lt;/code&gt; loop around the whole thing.
You will have to indent the rest of the program when you add this at the top of the code, but don't worry, you don't have to do it manually for each line! Just highlight everything you want to indent and click on &quot;Indent&quot; under &quot;Format&quot; in the top bar of the python window.

Another way of doing this could be:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
name = input('Set name: ')
password = input('Set password: ')
while 1 == 1:
    nameguess=&quot;&quot;
    passwordguess=&quot;&quot;
    key=&quot;&quot;
    while (nameguess != name) or (passwordguess != password):
        nameguess = input('Name? ')
        passwordguess = input('Password? ')
    print(&quot;Welcome,&quot;, name, &quot;. Type lock to lock.&quot;)
    while key != &quot;lock&quot;:
        key = input(&quot;&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice the &lt;code&gt;or&lt;/code&gt; in while &lt;code&gt;(nameguess != name) or (passwordguess != password)&lt;code&gt;, which we haven't yet introduced. You can probably figure out how it works.

'''Windows'''

When the MagicJack USB device is inserted, two drives are created. One is a pseudo CD-Rom drive (read only). The other is a writable flash drive. In some cases, it may be necessary to force these drives to use other drive letters. This can be accomplished with the following instructions.

'''XP'''

# Start the Windows Computer Management tool by right clicking the &quot;My Computer&quot; icon on your desktop, and choose &quot;Manage.&quot;
#* Alternatively, this tool can be found in your Start-&gt;Settings-&gt;Control Panel-&gt;Administrative Tools.
# Navigate to Storage -&gt; Disk Management. It may take a few seconds for it to query your system.
# In the list you will see a drive labeled &quot;PHONE&quot; and a drive labeled &quot;magicjack.&quot;
# Right click on the drive labeled &quot;PHONE&quot; and in the subsequent pop-up window select &quot;Change drive letter and paths.&quot;
# Click on the 'Change' button, select an available drive letter from the drop-down list, and click the &quot;Ok.&quot;
# Repeat this process for the drive labeled &quot;magicjack.&quot;

Remove the MagicJack device (using &quot;Safely remove hardware), and plug it back it. It will start up using the new drive letters that you have assigned.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== If statement ===
As always I believe I should start each chapter with a warm-up typing exercise, so here is a short program to compute the absolute value of an integer:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
n = int(input(&quot;Number? &quot;))
if n &lt; 0:
   print(&quot;The absolute value of&quot;, n, &quot;is&quot;, -n)
else:
   print(&quot;The absolute value of&quot;, n, &quot;is&quot;, n)
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is the output from the two times that I ran this program:

 Number? '''-34'''
 The absolute value of -34 is 34

 Number? '''1'''
 The absolute value of 1 is 1

So what does the computer do when it sees this piece of code?  First it prompts the user for a number with the statement &quot;&lt;code&gt;n = int(input(&quot;Number? &quot;))&lt;/code&gt;&quot;.  Next it reads the line &quot;&lt;code&gt;if n &lt; 0:&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. If &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; is less than zero Python runs the line &quot;&lt;code&gt;print(&quot;The absolute value of&quot;, n, &quot;is&quot;, -n)&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. Otherwise it runs the line &quot;&lt;code&gt;print(&quot;The absolute value of&quot;, n, &quot;is&quot;, n)&lt;/code&gt;&quot;.  

More formally Python looks at whether the ''expression'' &lt;code&gt;n &lt; 0&lt;/code&gt; is true or false.  An &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement is followed by an indented ''block'' of statements that are run when the expression is true.  Optionally after the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement is an &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; statement and another indented ''block'' of statements.  This second block of statements is run if the expression is false.  

There are a number of different tests that an expression can have.  Here is a table of all of them:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!operator 
!function
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;&lt;/code&gt; 
|less than
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;=&lt;/code&gt; 
|less than or equal to
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&gt;&lt;/code&gt; 
|greater than
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; 
|greater than or equal to
|-
|&lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; 
|equal
|-
|&lt;code&gt;!=&lt;/code&gt; 
|not equal
|}

Another feature of the &lt;code&gt; if&lt;/code&gt; command is the &lt;code&gt; elif &lt;/code&gt; statement.  It stands for else if and means if the original &lt;code&gt; if&lt;/code&gt; statement is false but the &lt;code&gt; elif&lt;/code&gt; part is true, then do the &lt;code&gt;elif&lt;/code&gt; part. And if neither the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;elif&lt;/code&gt; expressions are true, then do what's in the &lt;code&gt;else&lt;/code&gt; block. Here's an example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = 0
while a &lt; 10:
    a = a + 1
    if a &gt; 5:
        print(a, &quot;&gt;&quot;, 5)
    elif a &lt;= 3:
        print(a, &quot;&lt;=&quot;, 3)
    else:
        print(&quot;Neither test was true&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

and the output:

 1 &lt;= 3
 2 &lt;= 3
 3 &lt;= 3
 Neither test was true
 Neither test was true
 6 &gt; 5
 7 &gt; 5
 8 &gt; 5
 9 &gt; 5
 10 &gt; 5

Notice how the &lt;code&gt;elif a &lt;= 3&lt;/code&gt; is only tested when the &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement fails to be true. There can be more than one &lt;code&gt;elif&lt;/code&gt; expression, allowing multiple tests to be done in a single &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statement.

=== Examples ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# This Program Demonstrates the use of the == operator
# using numbers
print(5 == 6)
# Using variables
x = 5
y = 8
print(x == y)
&lt;/source&gt;

And the output

 False
 False

Write a program that asks the user their name, if they enter your name
say &quot;That is a nice name&quot;, if they enter &quot;John Cleese&quot; or &quot;Michael
Palin&quot;, tell them how you feel about them ;), otherwise tell them &quot;You
have a nice name.&quot;

{{Solution|title=Solution|text=

{{fsharpTitle|Inheritance}}

Many object-oriented languages use '''inheritance''' extensively in the .NET BCL to construct class hierarchies.

== Subclasses ==
A subclass is, in the simplest terms, a class derived from a class which has already been defined. A subclass inherits its members from a base class in addition to adding its own members. A subclass is defined using the &lt;code&gt;inherit&lt;/code&gt; keyword as shown below:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
type Person(name) =
    member x.Name = name        
    member x.Greet() = printfn &quot;Hi, I'm %s&quot; x.Name
    
type Student(name, studentID : int) =
    inherit Person(name)
    
    let mutable _GPA = 0.0
    
    member x.StudentID = studentID
    member x.GPA
        with get() = _GPA
        and set value = _GPA &lt;- value
    
type Worker(name, employer : string) = 
    inherit Person(name)
    
    let mutable _salary = 0.0
    
    member x.Salary
        with get() = _salary
        and set value = _salary &lt;- value
    
    member x.Employer = employer
&lt;/source&gt;

Our simple class hierarchy looks like this:
&lt;pre&gt;
System.Object (* All classes descend from  *)
 - Person
   - Student
   - Worker
&lt;/pre&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;Student&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Worker&lt;/code&gt; subclasses both inherit the &lt;code&gt;Name&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Greet&lt;/code&gt; methods from the &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; base class. This can be demonstrated in fsi:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; let somePerson, someStudent, someWorker =
    new Person(&quot;Juliet&quot;), new Student(&quot;Monique&quot;, 123456), new Worker(&quot;Carla&quot;, &quot;Awesome Hair Salon&quot;);;

val someWorker : Worker
val someStudent : Student
val somePerson : Person

&gt; somePerson.Name, someStudent.Name, someWorker.Name;;
val it : string * string * string = (&quot;Juliet&quot;, &quot;Monique&quot;, &quot;Carla&quot;)

&gt; someStudent.StudentID;;
val it : int = 123456

&gt; someWorker.Employer;;
val it : string = &quot;Awesome Hair Salon&quot;

&gt; someWorker.ToString();; (* ToString method inherited from System.Object *)
val it : string = &quot;FSI_0002+Worker&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

.NET's object model supports ''single-class inheritance'', meaning that a subclass is limited to one base class. In other words, its not possible to create a class which derives from &lt;code&gt;Student&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Employee&lt;/code&gt; simultaneously.

=== Overriding Methods ===
Occasionally, you may want a derived class to change the default behavior of methods inherited from the base class. For example, the output of the &lt;code&gt;.ToString()&lt;/code&gt; method above isn't very useful. We can override that behavior with a different implementation using the &lt;code&gt;override&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
type Person(name) =
    member x.Name = name        
    member x.Greet() = printfn &quot;Hi, I'm %s&quot; x.Name
    
    override x.ToString() = x.Name    (* The ToString() method is inherited from System.Object *)
&lt;/source&gt;

We've overridden the default implementation of the &lt;code&gt;ToString()&lt;/code&gt; method, causing it to print out a person's name.

Methods in F# are not overridable by default. If you expect users will want to override methods in a derived class, you have to declare your method as overridable using the &lt;code&gt;abstract&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;default&lt;/code&gt; keywords as follows:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
type Person(name) =
    member x.Name = name        
    
    abstract Greet : unit -&gt; unit
    default x.Greet() = printfn &quot;Hi, I'm %s&quot; x.Name
    
type Quebecois(name) =
    inherit Person(name)
    
    override x.Greet() = printfn &quot;Bonjour, je m'appelle %s, eh.&quot; x.Name
&lt;/source&gt;

Our class &lt;code&gt;Person&lt;/code&gt; provides a &lt;code&gt;Greet&lt;/code&gt; method which may be overridden in derived classes. Here's an example of these two classes in fsi:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; let terrance, phillip = new Person(&quot;Terrance&quot;), new Quebecois(&quot;Phillip&quot;);;

val terrance : Person
val phillip : Quebecois

&gt; terrance.Greet();;
Hi, I'm Terrance
val it : unit = ()

&gt; phillip.Greet();;
Bonjour, je m'appelle Phillip, eh.
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Abstract Classes ===
An abstract class is one which provides an incomplete implementation of an object, and requires a programmer to create subclasses of the abstract class to fill in the rest of the implementation. For example, consider the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
[&lt;AbstractClass&gt;]
type Shape(position : Point) =
    member x.Position = position
    override x.ToString() =
        sprintf &quot;position = {%i, %i}, area = %f&quot; position.X position.Y (x.Area())
    
    abstract member Draw : unit -&gt; unit 
    abstract member Area : unit -&gt; float
&lt;/source&gt;

The first thing you'll notice is the &lt;code&gt;AbstractClass&lt;/code&gt; attribute, which tells the compiler that our class has some abstract members. Additionally, you notice two abstract members, &lt;code&gt;Draw&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Area&lt;/code&gt; don't have an implementation, only a type signature.

We can't create an instance of &lt;code&gt;Shape&lt;/code&gt; because the class hasn't been fully implemented. Instead, we have to derive from &lt;code&gt;Shape&lt;/code&gt; and override the &lt;code&gt;Draw&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Area&lt;/code&gt; methods with a concrete implementation:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
type Circle(position : Point, radius : float) =
    inherit Shape(position)
    
    member x.Radius = radius
    override x.Draw() = printfn &quot;(Circle)&quot;
    override x.Area() = Math.PI * radius * radius
    
type Rectangle(position : Point, width : float, height : float) =
    inherit Shape(position)
    
    member x.Width = width
    member x.Height = height
    override x.Draw() = printfn &quot;(Rectangle)&quot;
    override x.Area() = width * height
    
type Square(position : Point, width : float) =
    inherit Shape(position)
    
    member x.Width = width
    member x.ToRectangle() = new Rectangle(position, width, width)
    override x.Draw() = printfn &quot;(Square)&quot;
    override x.Area() = width * width
    
type Triangle(position : Point, sideA : float, sideB : float, sideC : float) =
    inherit Shape(position)
    
    member x.SideA = sideA
    member x.SideB = sideB
    member x.SideC = sideC
    
    override x.Draw() = printfn &quot;(Triangle)&quot;
    override x.Area() =
        (* Heron's formula *)
        let a, b, c = sideA, sideB, sideC
        let s = (a + b + c) / 2.0
        Math.Sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c) )
&lt;/source&gt;

Now we have several different implementations of the &lt;code&gt;Shape&lt;/code&gt; class. We can experiment with these in fsi:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; let position = { X = 0; Y = 0 };;

val position : Point

&gt; let circle, rectangle, square, triangle =
    new Circle(position, 5.0),
    new Rectangle(position, 2.0, 7.0),
    new Square(position, 10.0),
    new Triangle(position, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0);;

val triangle : Triangle
val square : Square
val rectangle : Rectangle
val circle : Circle

&gt; circle.ToString();;
val it : string = &quot;Circle, position = {0, 0}, area = 78.539816&quot;

&gt; triangle.ToString();;
val it : string = &quot;Triangle, position = {0, 0}, area = 6.000000&quot;

&gt; square.Width;;
val it : float = 10.0

&gt; square.ToRectangle().ToString();;
val it : string = &quot;Rectangle, position = {0, 0}, area = 100.000000&quot;

&gt; rectangle.Height, rectangle.Width;;
val it : float * float = (7.0, 2.0)
&lt;/source&gt;

== Working With Subclasses ==
=== Up-casting and Down-casting ===
A ''type cast'' is an operation which changes the type of an object from one type to another. This is not the same as a map function, because a type cast does not return an instance of a new object, it returns the same instance of an object with a different type.

For example, let's say &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt; is a subclass of &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;. If we have an instance of &lt;code&gt;B&lt;/code&gt;, we are able to cast as an instance of &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt;. Since &lt;code&gt;A&lt;/code&gt; is upward in the class hiearchy, we call this an up-cast. We use the &lt;code&gt;:&gt;&lt;/code&gt; operator to perform upcasts:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; let regularString = &quot;Hello world&quot;;;

val regularString : string

&gt; let upcastString = &quot;Hello world&quot; :&gt; obj;;

val upcastString : obj

&gt; regularString.ToString();;
val it : string = &quot;Hello world&quot;

&gt; regularString.Length;;
val it : int = 11

&gt; upcastString.ToString();; (* type obj has a .ToString method *)
val it : string = &quot;Hello world&quot;

&gt; upcastString.Length;; (* however, obj does not have Length method *)

  upcastString.Length;; (* however, obj does not have Length method *)
  -------------^^^^^^^

stdin(24,14): error FS0039: The field, constructor or member 'Length' is not defined.
&lt;/source&gt;

Up-casting is considered &quot;safe&quot;, because a derived class is guaranteed to have all of the same members as an ancestor class. We can, if necessary, go in the opposite direction: we can down-cast from an ancestor class to a derived class using the &lt;code&gt;:?&gt;&lt;/code&gt; operator:

&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
&gt; let intAsObj = 20 :&gt; obj;;

val intAsObj : obj

&gt; intAsObj, intAsObj.ToString();;
val it : obj * string = (20, &quot;20&quot;)

&gt; let intDownCast = intAsObj :?&gt; int;;

val intDownCast : int

&gt; intDownCast, intDownCast.ToString();;
val it : int * string = (20, &quot;20&quot;)

&gt; let stringDownCast = intAsObj :?&gt; string;; (* boom! *)

val stringDownCast : string

System.InvalidCastException: Unable to cast object of type 'System.Int32' to type 'System.String'.
   at &lt;StartupCode$FSI_0067&gt;.$FSI_0067._main()
stopped due to error
&lt;/source&gt;
Since &lt;code&gt;intAsObj&lt;/code&gt; holds an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; boxed as an &lt;code&gt;obj&lt;/code&gt;, we can downcast to an &lt;code&gt;int&lt;/code&gt; as needed. However, we cannot downcast to a &lt;code&gt;string&lt;/code&gt; because its an incompatible type. Down-casting is considered &quot;unsafe&quot; because the error isn't detectable by the type-checker, so an error with a down-cast always results in a runtime exception.


==== Up-casting example ====
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
open System

type Point = { X : int; Y : int }

[&lt;AbstractClass&gt;]
type Shape() =
    override x.ToString() =
        sprintf &quot;%s, area = %f&quot; (x.GetType().Name) (x.Area())
    
    abstract member Draw : unit -&gt; unit 
    abstract member Area : unit -&gt; float
    
type Circle(radius : float) =
    inherit Shape()
    
    member x.Radius = radius
    override x.Draw() = printfn &quot;(Circle)&quot;
    override x.Area() = Math.PI * radius * radius
    
type Rectangle(width : float, height : float) =
    inherit Shape()
    
    member x.Width = width
    member x.Height = height
    override x.Draw() = printfn &quot;(Rectangle)&quot;
    override x.Area() = width * height
    
type Square(width : float) =
    inherit Shape()
    
    member x.Width = width
    member x.ToRectangle() = new Rectangle(width, width)
    override x.Draw() = printfn &quot;(Square)&quot;
    override x.Area() = width * width
    
type Triangle(sideA : float, sideB : float, sideC : float) =
    inherit Shape()
    
    member x.SideA = sideA
    member x.SideB = sideB
    member x.SideC = sideC
    
    override x.Draw() = printfn &quot;(Triangle)&quot;
    override x.Area() =
        (* Heron's formula *)
        let a, b, c = sideA, sideB, sideC
        let s = (a + b + c) / 2.0
        Math.Sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c) )

let shapes =
        [(new Circle(5.0) :&gt; Shape);
            (new Circle(12.0) :&gt; Shape);
            (new Square(10.5) :&gt; Shape);
            (new Triangle(3.0, 4.0, 5.0) :&gt; Shape);
            (new Rectangle(5.0, 2.0) :&gt; Shape)]
        (* Notice we have to cast each object as a Shape *)
            
let main() = 
    shapes
    |&gt; Seq.iter (fun x -&gt; printfn &quot;x.ToString: %s&quot; (x.ToString()) )

main()
&lt;/source&gt;

This program has the following types:
&lt;source lang=&quot;ocaml&quot;&gt;
type Point =
  {X: int;
   Y: int;}

type Shape =
  class
    abstract member Area : unit -&gt; float
    abstract member Draw : unit -&gt; unit
    new : unit -&gt; Shape
    override ToString : unit -&gt; string
  end

type Circle =
  class
    inherit Shape
    new : radius:float -&gt; Circle
    override Area : unit -&gt; float
    override Draw : unit -&gt; unit
    member Radius : float
  end

type Rectangle =
  class
    inherit Shape
    new : width:float * height:float -&gt; Rectangle
    override Area : unit -&gt; float
    override Draw : unit -&gt; unit
    member Height : float
    member Width : float
  end

type Square =
  class
    inherit Shape
    new : width:float -&gt; Square
    override Area : unit -&gt; float
    override Draw : unit -&gt; unit
    member ToRectangle : unit -&gt; Rectangle
    member Width : float
  end

type Triangle =
  class
    inherit Shape
    new : sideA:float * sideB:float * sideC:float -&gt; Triangle
    override Area : unit -&gt; float
    override Draw : unit -&gt; unit
    member SideA : float
    member SideB : float
    member SideC : float
  end

val shapes : Shape list 
&lt;/source&gt;

This program outputs:
&lt;pre&gt;
x.ToString: Circle, area = 78.539816
x.ToString: Circle, area = 452.389342
x.ToString: Square, area = 110.250000
x.ToString: Triangle, area = 6.000000
x.ToString: Rectangle, area = 10.000000
&lt;/pre&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Connotations of the Text=
This poem is traditionally connected with the following, hence the numbering 58 and 58b.  It is a single sentence addresseed to a friend Caeilius.  It signals the end of Catullus infatuation with his lover, Lesbia.  Catullus is almost speechless with indignation regarding Lesbia's behaviour.  Catullus here contrasts the heights that Lesbia has enjoyed as Catullus' lover with the depths to which she has now sunk, 'having it off with anyone who comes along'.


===Line 1===

*'''''glubit'''''

The only occurrence of this verb in Catullus' work.  It literally means to strip the bark off.  It suggests a fairly crude sexual act performed in those areas of the city of Rome where the cheapest prostitutes could be found.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Québec, Canada.svg|thumb|right|200px|The location of Quebec]]
Quebec is a province in the central part of Canada. It is the only Canadian province with a majority of French-speaking pople and the only one whose sole official language is French at the provincial level. Quebec is Canada's largest province by area ; only the territory of [[Wikijunior:North America/Canada/Nunavut|Nunavut]] is larger. It is bordered to the west by the province of [[Wikijunior:North America/Canada/Ontario|Ontario]], James Bay and Hudson Bay, to the north by Hudson Strait and Ungava Bay, to the east by the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and the provinces of [[Wikijunior:North America/Canada/Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] and [[Wikijunior:North America/Canada/Labrador|Labrador]] and [[Wikijunior:North America/Canada/New Brunswick|New Brunswick]]. It is bordered on the south by the U.S. states of [[Wikijunior:North America/United States/Maine|Maine]], [[Wikijunior:North America/United States/New Hampshire|New Hampshire]], [[Wikijunior:North America/United States/Vermont|Vermont]], and [[Wikijunior:North America/United States/New York|New York]].

Quebec has a unique, dynamic culture, with a continual ebb and flow of widespread emotions that literally shape the history of the province. While French Canadians seem to comprise the most visible demographic, the Québécois society is becoming increasingly diverse.

Nunavut is the largest and newest territory of Canada; it was separated officially from the Northwest Territories on April 1, 1999 through the Nunavut Act and the Nunavut Land Claims Agreement Act, though the actual boundaries had been established in 1993. The creation of Nunavut resulted in the first major change to Canada's map since the addition of Newfoundland to the country in 1949.

{{C sharp/Navigation|Keywords|lock}}
__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The {{C sharp|lock}} keyword allows a section of code to exclusively use a resource, a feature useful in multi-threaded applications. If a lock to the specified object is already held when a piece of code tries to lock the object, the code's thread is blocked until the object is available.

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
using System;
using System.Threading;

class LockDemo
{
    private static int number = 0;
    private static object lockObject = new object();
    
    private static void DoSomething()
    {
        while (true)
        {
            lock (lockObject)
            {
                int originalNumber = number;
                
                number += 1;
                Thread.Sleep((new Random()).Next(1000)); // sleep for a random amount of time
                number += 1;
                Thread.Sleep((new Random()).Next(1000)); // sleep again
                
                Console.Write(&quot;Expecting number to be &quot; + (originalNumber + 2).ToString());
                Console.WriteLine(&quot;, and it is: &quot; + number.ToString());
                // without the lock statement, the above would produce unexpected results, 
                // since the other thread may have added 2 to the number while we were sleeping.
            }
        }
    }
    
    public static void Main()
    {
        Thread t = new Thread(new ThreadStart(DoSomething));
        
        t.Start();
        DoSomething(); // at this point, two instances of DoSomething are running at the same time.
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The parameter to the lock statement must be an object reference, not a value type:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
class LockDemo2
{
    private int number;
    private object obj = new object();
    
    public void DoSomething()
    {
        lock (this) // ok
        {
            ...
        }
        
        lock (number) // not ok, number is not a reference
        {
            ...
        }
        
        lock (obj) // ok, obj is a reference
        {
            ...
        }
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The {{C sharp|operator}} keyword allows a class to overload arithmetic and cast operators:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
public class Complex
{
    private double re, im;
    
    public double Real
    {
        get { return re; }

        set { im = value; }
    }
    
    // binary operator overloading
    public static Complex operator +(Complex c1, Complex c2)
    {
        return new Complex() { Real = c1.Real + c2.Real, Imaginary = c1.Imaginary + c2.Imaginary };
    }
    
    // unary operator overloading
    public static Complex operator -(Complex c)
    {
        return new Complex() { Real = -c.Real, Imaginary = -c.Imaginary };
    }
    
    // cast operator overloading (both implicit and explicit)
    public static implicit operator double(Complex c)
    {
        // return the modulus: sqrt(x^2 + y^2)
        return Math.Sqrt(Math.Pow(c.Real, 2) + Math.Pow(c.Imaginary, 2));
    }
    
    public static explicit operator string(Complex c)
    {
        // we should be overloading the ToString() method, but this is just a demonstration
        return c.Real.ToString() + &quot; + &quot; + c.Imaginary.ToString() + &quot;i&quot;;
    }
}

public class StaticDemo
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Complex number1 = new Complex() { Real = 1, Imaginary = 2 };
        Complex number2 = new Complex() { Real = 4, Imaginary = 10 };
        Complex number3 = number1 + number2; // number3 now has Real = 5, Imaginary = 12
        
        number3 = -number3; // number3 now has Real = -5, Imaginary = -12
        double testNumber = number3; // testNumber will be set to the absolute value of number3
        Console.WriteLine((string)number3); // This will print &quot;-5 + -12i&quot;.
        // The cast to string was needed because that was an explicit cast operator.
    }
}

==Concentration Camps==
==Slave Work==
--&gt;

==The Holocaust==

The Holocaust is a name given to the genocide (the mass murder of a specific group) or 'Final Solution' the Nazis carried out against groups they deemed unacceptable.  The aim of this policy was the complete destruction of the groups concerned.  These people were called &quot;Undesirables&quot; or &quot;Untermensch&quot; (&quot;Under-men&quot; or &quot;Sub-human&quot;), and consisted mainly of Jewish people but there were also many Gypsies (Roma), Polish and Slavic people, homosexuals, and people with mental or physical impairments.

Whilst the Nazis targeted many groups (including Poles, Serbs and Roma), by far the greatest victims were the Jews.  It is estimated, that between five and seven million Jews were killed as a direct result of 'The Holocaust'. For example in Central Europe, where pre-war there had been a substantial Jewish population, Over 70% died. Even today the exact number of deaths remains unknown.

To kill on such scale, the Nazi's had established &quot;Death Camps&quot;. In these camps, poison gas was used to kill the victims, the bodies being burnt in huge furnaces. Even those that were not killed straight away, faced harsh conditions. The regime in such camps was brutal. Those imprisoned were forced to work unpaid for 10-14 hours a day. Disease was also common. The Holocaust was so brutal and horrible that some people today still cannot accept that it happened.


&lt;!--
In order to kill such a large number of people, the Nazis established ''Death Camps'' where they used gas to kill the people and huge furnaces to burn their bodies. Those that weren't killed straight away were forced to work in very hard conditions, usually for 10 to 14 hours a day which often killed them in a few weeks. 
--&gt;
&lt;!--
To get an idea of the scale of the killing, in the worst affected area of Central Europe there were seven million Jews living before the war - five million of them were killed. 
--&gt;

&lt;!--
The Holocaust was one of the worst things that ever happened in history. Many things that happened are too horrible to tell to children. So, we won't say much here, but when you are older you can read other books to learn more if you want.
--&gt;
&lt;!--
The Holocaust is the name given to the killing of large numbers of ordinary people by the Nazis and its allies. Somewhere between five million and seven million Jews were killed as well as millions of Poles, Serbs and many many other people the Nazis didn't like. The total number of dead is thought to be between nine and 11 million people.

== Learning about Intelligent Robots ==
This book is geared towards students, teachers, hobbyists and researchers interested in intelligent robots. It will help you in understanding what robots are, what they can do for you, and most interestingly how to program them. It includes two parts: a short theoretical part and a longer practical part. The practical part is decomposed in one chapter about the computer configuration and five chapters of exercises corresponding to five levels of difficulty (see the next section). It relies on the Webots simulation software and the e-puck robot. After reading this book, you should be able to design your own intelligent robots.

      <comment>/* GOFAI versus New AI */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TOCright}}

Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an interdisciplinary field of study that includes computer science, engineering, philosophy and psychology. There is no widely accepted precise definition of Artificial Intelligence, because Intelligence is very difficult to define. John McCarthy defined Artificial Intelligence as &quot;the science and engineering of making intelligent machine&quot; 
&lt;ref&gt;
See [[w:John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]],
[http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/whatisai/whatisai.html What is Artificial Intelligence?]
&lt;/ref&gt; which does not explain what intelligent machines are. Hence, it does not help either to answer the question &quot;Is a chess playing program an intelligent machine?&quot;.

== GOFAI versus New AI ==

AI divides roughly into two schools of thought: GOFAI (Good Old Fashioned Artificial Intelligence) and New AI. GOFAI mostly involves methods now classified as machine learning, characterized by formalism and statistical analysis. This is also known as conventional AI, symbolic AI, logical AI or neat AI. Methods include:

* ''Expert Systems'' apply reasoning capabilities to reach a conclusion. An Expert System can process large amounts of known information and provide conclusions based on them.
* ''Case Based Reasoning'' stores a set of problems and answers in an organized data structure called cases. A Case Based Reasoning system upon being presented with a problem finds a case in its knowledge base that is most closely related to the new problem and presents its solutions as an output with suitable modifications.
* ''Bayesian Networks'' are probabilistic graphical models that represent a set of variables and their probabilistic dependencies.
* ''Behavior Based AI'' is a modular method building AI systems by hand.

New AI involves iterative development or learning. It is often bio-inspired and provides models of biological intelligence, like the Artificial Neural Networks. Learning is based on empirical data and is associated with non-symbolic AI. Methods mainly include:

* ''Artificial Neural Networks'' are bio-inspired systems with very strong pattern recognition capabilities.
* ''Fuzzy Systems'' are techniques for reasoning under uncertainty; they have been widely used in modern industrial and consumer product control systems.
* ''Evolutionary computation'' applies biologically inspired concepts such as populations, mutation and survival of the fittest to generate increasingly better solutions to a problem. These methods most notably divide into ''Evolutionary Algorithms'' (including ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm Genetic Algorithms]'') and ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swarm_intelligence Swarm Intelligence]'' (including ''Ant Algorithms'').

Hybrid Intelligent Systems attempt to combine these two groups. Expert Inference Rules can be generated through Artificial Neural Network or Production Rules from Statistical Learning, Naeneng ka anto? Kopyam yaning, Naeneng ka anto? Kopyam yaning, Naeneng ka anto? Kopyam yaning, Naeneng ka anto? Kopyam ya

== History ==

Early in the 17th century, René Descartes envisioned the bodies of animals as complex but reducible machines, thus formulating the mechanistic theory, also known as the &quot;clockwork paradigm&quot;. Wilhelm Schickard created the first mechanical digital calculating machine in 1623, followed by machines of Blaise Pascal (1643) and Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz (1671), who also invented the binary system. In the 19th century, Charles Babbage and Ada Lovelace worked on programmable mechanical calculating machines.

Bertrand Russell and Alfred North Whitehead published Principia Mathematica in 1910-1913, which revolutionized formal logic. In 1931 Kurt Gödel showed that sufficiently powerful consistent formal systems contain true theorems unprovable by any theorem-proving AI that is systematically deriving all possible theorems from the axioms. In 1941 Konrad Zuse built the first working mechanical program-controlled computers. Warren McCulloch and Walter Pitts published A Logical Calculus of the Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity (1943), laying the foundations for neural networks. Norbert Wiener's Cybernetics or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine (MIT Press, 1948) popularized the term &quot;cybernetics&quot;.

Game theory which would prove invaluable in the progress of AI was introduced with the paper, Theory of Games and Economic Behavior by mathematician John von Neumann and economist Oskar Morgenstern
&lt;ref&gt;Von Neumann, J.; Morgenstern, O. (1953), [https://www.ams.org/bull/2000-37-01/S0273-0979-99-00832-0/home.html &quot;Theory of Games and Economic Behavior&quot;], New York&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== 1950's ===
The 1950s were a period of active efforts in AI. In 1950, Alan Turing introduced the &quot;Turing test&quot; as a way of creating a test of intelligent behavior. The first working AI programs were written in 1951 to run on the Ferranti Mark I machine of the University of Manchester: a checkers-playing program written by Christopher Strachey and a chess-playing program written by Dietrich Prinz. John McCarthy coined the term &quot;artificial intelligence&quot; at the first conference devoted to the subject, in 1956. He also invented the Lisp programming language. Joseph Weizenbaum built ELIZA, a chatter-bot implementing Rogerian psychotherapy. The birth date of AI is generally considered to be July 1956 at the Dartmouth Conference, where many of these people met and exchanged ideas.

=== 1960s-1970s ===
During the 1960s and 1970s, Joel Moses demonstrated the power of symbolic reasoning for integration problems in the Macsyma program, the first successful knowledge-based program in mathematics. Leonard Uhr and Charles Vossler published &quot;A Pattern Recognition Program That Generates, Evaluates, and Adjusts Its Own Operators&quot; in 1963, which described one of the first machine learning programs that could adaptively acquire and modify features and thereby overcome the limitations of simple perceptrons of Rosenblatt. Marvin Minsky and Seymour Papert published Perceptrons, which demonstrated the limits of simple Artificial Neural Networks. Alain Colmerauer developed the Prolog computer language. Ted Shortliffe demonstrated the power of rule-based systems for knowledge representation and inference in medical diagnosis and therapy in what is sometimes called the first expert system. Hans Moravec developed the first computer-controlled vehicle to autonomously negotiate cluttered obstacle courses.

=== 1980s ===
In the 1980s, Artificial Neural Networks became widely used due to the back-propagation algorithm, first described by Paul Werbos in 1974. The team of Ernst Dickmanns built the first robot cars, driving up to 55 mph on empty streets.

=== 1990s &amp; Turn of the Millennium ===

The 1990s marked major achievements in many areas of AI and demonstrations of various applications. In 1995, one of Ernst Dickmanns' robot cars drove more than 1000 miles in traffic at up to 110 mph, tracking and passing other cars (simultaneously Dean Pomerleau of Carnegie Mellon tested a semi-autonomous car with human-controlled throttle and brakes). Deep Blue, a chess-playing computer, beat Garry Kasparov in a famous six-game match in 1997. Honda built the first prototypes of humanoid robots (see picture of the Asimo Robot).



During the 1990s and 2000s AI has become very influenced by probability theory and statistics. Bayesian networks are the focus of this movement, providing links to more rigorous topics in statistics and engineering such as Markov models and Kalman filters, and bridging the divide between GOFAI and New AI. This new school of AI is sometimes called `machine learning'. The last few years have also seen a big interest in game theory applied to AI decision making.

== The Turing test ==
&lt;noinclude&gt;{{wikipedia|Turing test}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
Artificial Intelligence is implemented in machines (i.e., computers or robots), that are observed by ”Natural Intelligence” beings (i.e., humans). These human beings are questioning whether or not these machines are intelligent. To give an answer to this question, they evidently compare the behavior of the machine to the behavior of another intelligent being they know. If both are similar, then, they can conclude that the machine appears to be intelligent.

Alan Turing developed a very interesting test that allows the observer to formally say whether or not a machine is intelligent. To understand this test, it is first necessary to understand that intelligence, just like beauty, is a concept relative to an observer. There is no absolute intelligence, like there is no absolute beauty. Hence it is not correct to say that a machine is more or less intelligent. Rather, we should say that a machine is more or less intelligent for a given observer. Starting from this point of view, the Turing test makes it possible to evaluate whether or not a machine qualifies for artificial intelligence relatively to an observer.

The test consists in a simple setup where the observer is facing a machine. The machine could be a computer or a robot, it does not matter. The machine however, should have the possibility to be remote controlled by a human being (the remote controller) which is not visible by the observer. The remote controller may be in another room than the observer. He should be able to communicate with the observer through the machine, using the available inputs and outputs of the machine. In the case of a computer, the inputs and outputs may be a keyboard, a mouse and computer screen. In the case of a robot, it may be a camera, a speaker (with synthetic voice), a microphone, motors, etc. The observer doesn't know if the machine is remote controlled by someone else or if it behaves on its own. He has to guess it. Hence, he will interact with the machine, for example by chatting using the keyboard and the screen to try to understand whether or not there is a human intelligence behind this machine writing the answers to his questions. Hence he will want to ask very complicated questions and see what the machine answers and try to determine if the answers are generated by an AI program or if they come from a real human being. If the observer believes he is interacting with a human being while he is actually interacting with a computer program, then this means the machine is intelligent for him. He was bluffed by the machine. The table below summarizes all the possible results coming out of a Turing test.

The Turing test helps a lot to answer the question &quot;can we build intelligent machines?&quot;. It demonstrates that some machines are indeed already intelligent for some people. Although these people are currently a minority, including mostly children but also adults, this minority is growing as AI programs improve.

Although the original Turing test is often described as a computer chat session (see picture), the interaction between the observer and the machine may take very various forms, including a chess game, playing a virtual reality video game, interacting with a mobile robot, etc.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ All possible outcomes for a Turing test

! The machine runs an Artificial Intelligence program
|-
! The observer believes he faces a human intelligence
| '''undetermined:''' the observer is good at recognizing human intelligence
| '''successful''': the machine is intelligent for this observer
|-
! The observer believes he faces a computer program
| '''undetermined''': the observer has troubles recognizing human intelligence
| '''failed''': the machine is not intelligent for this observer
|}

Similar experiments involve children observing two mobile robots performing a prey predator game and describing what is happening. Unlike adults who will generally say that the robots were programmed in some way to perform this behavior, possibly mentioning the sensors, actuators and micro-processor of the robot, the children will describe the behavior of the robots using the same words they would use to describe the behavior of a cat running after a mouse. They will grant feelings to the robots like ”he is afraid of”, ”he is angry”, ”he is excited”, ”he is quiet”, ”he wants to...”, etc. This leads us to think that for a child, there is little difference between the intelligence of such robots and animal intelligence.

== Cognitive Benchmarks ==

Another way to measure whether or not a machine is intelligent is to establish cognitive (or intelligence) benchmarks. A benchmark is a problem definition associated with a performance metrics allowing evaluating the performance of a system. For example in the car industry, some benchmarks measure the time necessary for a car to accelerate from 0 km/h to 100 km/h. Cognitive benchmarks address problems where intelligence is necessary to achieve a good performance.

Again, since intelligence is relative to an observer, the cognitive aspect of a benchmark is also relative to an observer. For example if a benchmark consists in playing chess against the Deep Blue program, some observers may think that this requires some intelligence and hence it is a cognitive benchmark, whereas some other observers may object that it doesn't require intelligence and hence it is not a cognitive benchmark.

Some cognitive benchmarks have been established by people outside computer science and robotics. They include IQ tests developed by psychologists as well as animal intelligence tests developed by biologists to evaluate for example how well rats remember the path to a food source in a maze, or how do monkeys learn to press a lever to get food.

AI and robotics benchmarks have also been established mostly throughout programming or robotics competitions. The most famous examples are the AAAI Robot Competition, the FIRST Robot Competition, the DARPA Grand Challenge, the Eurobot Competition, the RoboCup competition (see picture), the Roboka Programming Contest. All these competitions define a precise scenario and a performance metrics based either on an absolute individual performance evaluation or a ranking between the different competitors. They are very well referenced on the Internet so that it should be easy to reach their official web site for more information.

The last chapter of this book will introduce you to a series of robotics cognitive benchmarks (especially the Rat's Life benchmark) for which you will be able to design your own intelligent systems and compare them to others.

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are many different training regimes instituted by climbers. As with all sports, training should chosen with respect to the climber's goals and experience level. Training regimes may include a mixture of bouldering, caving, finger and body weight exercises, versa-climber training, route climbing, and up/down climbing.

== Technique ==
Bouldering usually consists of climbing at a low height without supports and moving laterally, and vertically along the climbing surface. Bouldering routes can be very useful to practice technique as it's easy to start at difficult parts and practice them specifically.

== Strength and endurance ==
Caving adds an extra dimension of climbing beneath overhanging surfaces, and hanging from the roof.

Body weight exercises or ''calisthenics'' that focus on the back,leg, and finger muscles should be a focus for any climber. Leg exercises are essential as climbing is more like crawling than doing repeated chin-ups and a lot of technique is aimed at maximising the use of all limbs, balancing weight between hand- and foot holds.

A Versa climber is cardiovascular machine, sometimes used to train upper body and lower body endurance.

Up/Down climbing is used to also train endurance, and involves climbing up to a location and then climbing back down.

'''Ajwain''' or '''Ajowan Caraway''' also known as '''Ajowan caraway''', '''carom seeds''' or mistakenly as '''bishop's weed''', is an uncommon spice except in certain areas of Asia. It is the small seed-like fruit similar to that of the Bishop's Weed (Ammi majus) plant, egg-shaped and grayish in colour. The plant has a similarity to parsley. Because of their seed-like appearance, the fruit pods are sometimes called ajwain seeds or mistakenly as bishop's weed (Ammi majus) seeds.

Ajwain is often confused with lovage seed; even some dictionaries mistakenly state that ajwain comes from the lovage plant.
Ajwain is also called 'owa' in Marathi, 'vaamu' or Oma in Telugu, &quot;omam&quot; (ஓமம்) in Tamil, &quot;ajwana&quot; in Kannada, &quot;ajmo&quot; (અજમો) in GujaratiGujarati, &quot;jowan&quot; in Bengali and &quot;asamodagam&quot; in Singhalese.</text>

== Vandalism ==

Just wanted to report repeated vandalism by [[User:Gotyhy]]: [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Spanish&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1353354] [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Spanish&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1353378] [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=New_Zealand_History&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=1353379].  --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 11:58, 5 December 2008 (UTC)

Would any administrator please be so kind and block user Gotyhy? Thanks. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 13:16, 5 December 2008 (UTC)

== Clojure_Programming &quot;Flagged Rev&quot; ==

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Clojure_Programming
Has been given a &quot;Flagged Rev&quot; which is preventing subsequent changes from being displayed.
This page is being improved from quite a wide community so this is undesirable.
Can the flag be removed?

:Actually, that page's latest version is sighted. Furthermore, you can see the draft version at any time - sighted or quality versions are shown by default for ''anonymous'' visitors only. If that's not the case, then something is wrong. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:00, 21 November 2008 (UTC)

Thanks Mike! What is the process for having a version 'sighted'? The concern from the Clojure contributors is that if there is a significant delay updating the changes then it reduces the value of the wiki, as additions/changes are regular. It seems that the versions get sighted quite quickly automatically, so perhaps this fear is unfounded. What are the requirements to become a 'sighter' (ie: so member of the Clojure community could 'sight' the pages)? Also in this case if we were to have sub pages could they be free of the review process to some extent - would this be desirable?

[[User:Timothypratley|Timothypratley]] ([[User talk:Timothypratley|talk]]) 01:36, 21 November 2008 (UTC)
:All editors meeting the requirements will be automatically promoted by the system. It requires a certain number of edits, your account must be 30 days old, you must have an email confirmed in [[Special:Preferences]], [[Wikibooks:FlaggedRevs Extension|etc.]] &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:43, 21 November 2008 (UTC)

Ok thanks for the clarification
[[User:Timothypratley|Timothypratley]] ([[User talk:Timothypratley|talk]]) 05:46, 21 November 2008 (UTC)

:&quot;Sighting&quot; basically is a way to review the content of a page, and make sure that nonsense and vandalism aren't being shown to new readers. People with +editor permission can review a page. You can request this permission at [[WB:RFA]]. Also, if you don't want to request it, the system will give it to you automatically after a certain amount of time (or, it should, as Mike pointed out). This tool is not a problem ''and'' it's not a big deal, so any active contributors who want it should feel free to request it. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:45, 21 November 2008 (UTC)

Hi, this is still being a problem for us:
The latest sighted revision (list all) was approved on 25 November 2008. 3 changes need review. (+/-) I asked on that page previously for permission, but was told it is not usually given out until the requirements are automatically met. Is there any way for me to tell how close I am to the requirements, or what I need to do to meet them?
[[User:Timothypratley|Timothypratley]] ([[User talk:Timothypratley|talk]]) 00:47, 16 December 2008 (UTC)

:Requirements are listed on [[Wikibooks:Reviewers]]. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:29, 16 December 2008 (UTC)

== content.css ==

Hi,
I've posted a message on [[:User_talk:Whiteknight#TOClimit_problem]] about fixing the common.css file to allow use of the TOClimit functionality in tables of contents. I guess Whiteknight is busy with other wikibooks stuff, so maybe there is another admin out there who can help? I've also summarised the problem on the [[:MediaWiki_talk:Common.css#TOClimit| common.css talk page]].

Cheers [[User:HYanWong|HYanWong]] ([[User talk:HYanWong|talk]]) 18:33, 15 December 2008 (UTC)

:{{Done}}. Sorry to have ignored you for so long! I have been busy but I shouldn't have put this off for so long. I've made the change now, refresh your browser and make sure it works the way you expect. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:19, 16 December 2008 (UTC)

::Fantastic. This now works. Thanks [[User:HYanWong|HYanWong]] ([[User talk:HYanWong|talk]]) 13:42, 17 December 2008 (UTC)

== Book Rename ==

This is probably the best place to ask someone that has a bot that can perform book renames, so I'll advance [[Computer programming]] for renaming to [[Computer Programming]], the book has already been using the latter name as a  category for all the pages (I've been fixing some) and since Categories have been mostly used only the first letter in upper case this will make it conform, I've not seen any special activity on the book recently, but posting a 7 days warning on the talk page wouldn't harm if any one can and is willing do the rename please consider that...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 01:34, 18 December 2008 (UTC)
: Done. A bot isn't required to perform this task. Any administrator can do it now. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 01:46, 18 December 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== What is debugging? ===
:&quot;As soon as we started programming, we found to our surprise that it wasn't as easy  to get programs right as we had thought.  Debugging had to be discovered.  I can remember the exact instant when I realized that a large part of my life from then on was going to be spent in finding mistakes in my own programs.&quot; &amp;mdash; ''Maurice Wilkes discovers debugging'', 1949

By now if you have been messing around with the programs you have probably found that sometimes the program does something you didn't want it to do.  This is fairly common.  Debugging is the process of figuring out what the computer is doing and then getting it to do what you want it to do.  This can be tricky.  I once spent nearly a week tracking down and fixing a bug that was caused by someone putting an &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; where a &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; should have been.  

This chapter will be more abstract than previous chapters.

=== What should the program do? ===

The first thing to do (this sounds obvious) is to figure out what the
program should be doing if it is running correctly.  Come up with some
test cases and see what happens.  For example, let's say I have a
program to compute the perimeter of a rectangle (the sum of the length
of all the edges).  I have the following test cases:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!height !! width !!perimeter
|-
|3 ||4 ||14
|--
|2 ||3 ||10
|-
|4 ||4 ||16
|-
|2 ||2 ||8
|-
|5 ||1 ||12
|-
|}

I now run my program on all of the test cases and see if the program does what 
I expect it to do.  If it doesn't then I need to find out what the computer is
doing.

More commonly some of the test cases will work and some will not.  If that is the case you should try and figure out what the working ones have in common. 
For example here is the output for a perimeter program (you get to see the code in a minute):

 Height: '''3'''
 Width: '''4'''
 perimeter = 15

 Height: '''2'''
 Width: '''3'''
 perimeter = 11

 Height: '''4'''
 Width: '''4'''
 perimeter = 16

 Height: '''2'''
 Width: '''2'''
 perimeter = 8

 Height: '''5'''
 Width: '''1'''
 perimeter = 8

Notice that it didn't work for the first two inputs, it worked for the next
two and it didn't work on the last one.  Try and figure out what is in common 
with the working ones.  Once you have some idea what the problem is finding the
cause is easier.  With your own programs you should try more test cases if you need them.

=== What does the program do? ===

The next thing to do is to look at the source code.  One of the most important things to do while programming is reading source code.  The primary way to do this is code walkthroughs.  

A code walkthrough starts at the first line, and works its way down until the program is done.  &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loops and &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; statements mean that some lines may never be run and some lines are run many times.  At each line you figure out what Python has done.

Lets start with the simple perimeter program.  Don't type it in, you are going to read it, not run it.  The source code is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
height = int(input(&quot;Height: &quot;))
width = int(input(&quot;Width: &quot;))
print(&quot;perimeter =&quot;, width + height + width + width)
&lt;/source&gt;

; ''Question:'' What is the first line Python runs?
: ''Answer:'' The first line is always run first.  In this case it is: &lt;code&gt;height = int(input(&quot;Height: &quot;))&lt;/code&gt;
; What does that line do?
: Prints &lt;code&gt; Height: &lt;/code&gt;, waits for the user to type a string in, and then converts the string to an integer variable height.
; What is the next line that runs?
: In general, it is the next line down which is: &lt;code&gt;width = int(input(&quot;Width: &quot;))&lt;/code&gt;
; What does that line do?
: Prints &lt;code&gt;Width: &lt;/code&gt;, waits for the user to type a number in, and puts what the user types in the variable width.
; What is the next line that runs?
: When the next line is not indented more or less than the current line, it is the line right afterwards, so it is: &lt;code&gt;print(&quot;perimeter = &quot;, width + height + width + width)&lt;/code&gt; (It may also run a function in the current line, but that's a future chapter.)                                                                       
; What does that line do?
: First it prints &lt;code&gt;perimeter = &lt;/code&gt;, then it prints the sum of the values contained within the variables, &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;height&lt;/code&gt;, from &lt;code&gt;width + height + width + width&lt;/code&gt;.
; Does &lt;code&gt;width + height + width + width&lt;/code&gt; calculate the perimeter properly?
: Let's see, perimeter of a rectangle is the bottom (width) plus the left side (height) plus the top (width) plus the right side (huh?). The last item should be the right side's length, or the height.
; Do you understand why some of the times the perimeter was calculated &quot;correctly&quot;?                                                                             
: It was calculated correctly when the width and the height were equal.

The next program we will do a code walkthrough for is a program that is supposed to print out 5 dots on the screen.  However, this is what the program is outputting:

 . . . . 

And here is the program:
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
number = 5
while number &gt; 1:
    print(&quot;.&quot;,end=&quot; &quot;)
    number = number - 1
print()
&lt;/source&gt;

This program will be more complex to walkthrough since it now has indented portions (or control structures).  Let us begin.
; What is the first line to be run?
: The first line of the file: &lt;code&gt;number = 5&lt;/code&gt;
; What does it do?
: Puts the number 5 in the variable number.
; What is the next line?
: The next line is: &lt;code&gt;while number &gt; 1:&lt;/code&gt;
; What does it do?
: Well, &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; statements in general look at their expression, and if it is true they do the next indented block of code, otherwise they skip the next indented block of code.
; So what does it do right now?
: If &lt;code&gt;number &gt; 1&lt;/code&gt; is true then the next two lines will be run.
; So is &lt;code&gt;number &gt; 1&lt;/code&gt;?
: The last value put into &lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt; was &lt;code&gt;5&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;5 &gt; 1&lt;/code&gt; so yes.
; So what is the next line?
: Since the &lt;code&gt; while&lt;/code&gt; was true the next line is: &lt;code&gt;print(&quot;.&quot;,end=&quot; &quot;)&lt;/code&gt;
; What does that line do?
: Prints one dot and since the extra argument &lt;code&gt;end=&quot; &quot;&lt;/code&gt; exists the next printed text will not be on a different screen line.
; What is the next line?
: &lt;code&gt;number = number - 1&lt;/code&gt; since that is following line and there are no indent changes.
; What does it do?
: It calculates &lt;code&gt;number - 1&lt;/code&gt;, which is the current value of &lt;code&gt;number&lt;/code&gt; (or 5) subtracts 1 from it, and makes that the new value of number.  So basically it changes &lt;code&gt; number&lt;/code&gt;'s value from 5 to 4.
; What is the next line?
: Well, the indent level decreases so we have to look at what type of control structure it is.  It is a &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; loop, so we have to go back to the &lt;code&gt;while&lt;/code&gt; clause which is &lt;code&gt;while number &gt; 1:&lt;/code&gt;
; What does it do?
: It looks at the value of number, which is 4, and compares it to 1 and since &lt;code&gt;4 &gt; 1&lt;/code&gt; the while loop continues.
; What is the next line?
: Since the while loop was true, the next line is: &lt;code&gt;print(&quot;.&quot;,end=&quot; &quot;)&lt;/code&gt;
; What does it do?
: It prints a second dot on the line, ending by a space.
; What is the next line?
: No indent change so it is: &lt;code&gt;number = number - 1&lt;/code&gt;
; And what does it do?
: It takes the current value of number (4), subtracts 1 from it, which gives it 3 and then finally makes 3 the new value of number.
; What is the next line?
: Since there is an indent change caused by the end of the while loop, the next line is: &lt;code&gt;while number &gt; 1:&lt;/code&gt;
; What does it do?
: It compares the current value of number (3) to 1. &lt;code&gt;3 &gt; 1&lt;/code&gt; so the while loop continues.
; What is the next line?
: Since the while loop condition was true the next line is: &lt;code&gt;print(&quot;.&quot;,end=&quot; &quot;)&lt;/code&gt;
; And it does what?
: A third dot is printed on the line.
; What is the next line?
: It is: &lt;code&gt;number = number - 1&lt;/code&gt;
; What does it do?
: It takes the current value of number (3) subtracts from it 1 and makes the 2 the new value of number.
; What is the next line?
: Back up to the start of the while loop: &lt;code&gt;while number &gt; 1:&lt;/code&gt;
; What does it do?
: It compares the current value of number (2) to 1.  Since &lt;code&gt;2 &gt; 1&lt;/code&gt; the while loop continues.
; What is the next line?
: Since the while loop is continuing: &lt;code&gt;print(&quot;.&quot;,end=&quot; &quot;)&lt;/code&gt;
; What does it do?
: It discovers the meaning of life, the universe and everything.  I'm joking. (I had to make sure you were awake.)  The line prints a fourth dot on the screen.
; What is the next line?
: It's: &lt;code&gt;number = number - 1&lt;/code&gt;
; What does it do?
: Takes the current value of number (2) subtracts 1 and makes 1 the new value of number.
; What is the next line?
: Back up to the while loop: &lt;code&gt;while number &gt; 1:&lt;/code&gt;
; What does the line do?
: It compares the current value of number (1) to 1. Since &lt;code&gt;1 &gt; 1&lt;/code&gt; is false (one is not greater than one), the while loop exits.
; What is the next line?
: Since the while loop condition was false the next line is the line after the while loop exits, or: &lt;code&gt;print()&lt;/code&gt;
; What does that line do?
: Makes the screen go to the next line.
; Why doesn't the program print 5 dots?
: The loop exits 1 dot too soon.
; How can we fix that?
: Make the loop exit 1 dot later.
; And how do we do that?
: There are several ways.  One way would be to change the while loop to: &lt;code&gt;while number &gt; 0:&lt;/code&gt;  Another way would be to change the conditional to: &lt;code&gt;number &gt;= 1&lt;/code&gt;  There are a couple others.

=== How do I fix my program? ===

You need to figure out what the program is doing.  You need to figure out what the program should do.  Figure out what the difference between the two is.  Debugging is a skill that has to be practiced to be learned. If you can't figure it out after an hour, take a break, talk to someone about the problem or contemplate the lint in your navel.  Come back in a while and you will probably have new ideas about the problem.  Good luck.

''This tutorial has been created with Blender v2.47''
[[Image:Blender Koordinatensystem.jpg|framed|right|'''Figure 1:''' Right-handed coordinate system in Blender]]

You may already be familiar with the X and Y axes from math class, where you were asked to plot points on a set of axes, namely the X and Y axes. Since we will be dealing with three dimensions, you will now become acquainted with the Z axis.

It feels quite natural to let the Z-axis run up and down, and keep the X-axis point to the right, but where shall the Y-axis go? Well, it points away from you into your monitor ('''Fig. 1'''). So how do you go about graphing it? Well, to sketch it on paper, you would draw a line that appears to go backward and draw tick marks to show its ''depth''.

{{Clr}}
[[Image:Rechte-hand-regel.jpg|thumb|right|200px|'''Figure 2:''' Right handed system]]
Because of the way the axes are orientated, this system is called '''right-handed'''. If you let the thumb of your right hand point in the direction of the X-axis, your index finger points in the direction of the Y-axis, and the braced middle finger points in the direction of the Z-axis.

As you can see in '''Fig. 2''', you can rotate the coordinate system, so it is not important where the axes point to, as long as their relative relations are kept, e.g. you will often find that the Y-axis points upwards and the Z-axis points towards you.

{{Clr}}
[[Image:Blender3D DirectionOfRotation.png|framed|'''Figure 3:''' Direction of rotations]]
If you use your right hand again you can also determine the direction of a rotation. If you point your thumb into the direction of the positive rotation axis and close your fingers, they show the direction of the rotation, i.e. the angles get larger in that direction.

There are several ways to depict a 3D object on a 2D surface (paper, monitor, etc.). In this book we will cover the three most important types of projections/views: '''orthographic''', '''isometric''' and '''perspective'''.

== Overview ==

[http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato Tomato] is a free firmware which replaces the factory firmware of [http://www.polarcloud.com/tomatofaq#what_will_this_run_on many popular routers]. It provides features not found in most consumer-grade routers.

For a full description of Tomato's features, see the [[Tomato_Firmware | Tomato's Wikibook]].

For general information about QoS, see [[MagicJack/Support Resources/How-To/QoS | the main QoS How-To]].

== Alternatives ==

For information about alternatives, see [[MagicJack/Support Resources/How-To/QoS | the main QoS How-To]].

== How to flash Tomato ==

This article does not cover the process of flashing your router. You are encouraged to fully understand how to flash before doing it. If done carelessly, you can &quot;brick your router&quot; (make it unusable). The following suggestions are provided as a starting point:

* See 
** The [[Tomato_Firmware#Installing | installation instructions]].
** The [http://www.polarcloud.com/tomatofaq Tomato FAQ].
** The readme which comes with the Tomato 7-zip file (unarchived using the free [http://www.7-zip.org/download.html 7-zip]).
* For questions (before and after flashing), see [http://www.linksysinfo.org/forums/ the Tomato support forum]. 
* If you need to buy a router to use with Tomato, this [http://www.linksysinfo.org/forums/showthread.php?t=60335 poll of which router is most commonly used with Tomato] may help you guage which router is &quot;best&quot; (simply based upon popularity).

== How to configure Tomato ==

After flashing your router with Tomato, open a web browser to your router's IP address, most likely &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://192.168.1.1&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;. This is Tomato's Administration UI. The default login is user = &lt;tt&gt;root&lt;/tt&gt;, password = &lt;tt&gt;admin&lt;/tt&gt;.

=== Step 1: Basic Settings -- Outbound ===

# Refer to [[#screenshots | Figure 1]].
# Navigate to ''QoS'' and ''Basic Settings.''
# Make the top of your page look like Figure 1.

However, the ''Max Bandwidth'' should be changed to reflect '''your''' maximum upload bandwidth. You can go to [http://www.speedtest.net speedtest.net] and run some tests to determine your speed.

Be sure to ''Save'' your changes.

Note: ''Max Bandwidth'' should be a conservative value. For example, if your speed varies throughout the day, you should use the slowest speed you regularly experience. If you use cable internet, and it has &quot;speed boost&quot; (a temporary increase in bandwidth), you should take that into consideration too.

The importance of this speed being accurate (and conservative) is that Tomato not only prioritizes packets according to the rules you specify (see [[#Step 3: Classification | Step 3]]), but it will also throttle the speed at which it sends them. If you set your ''Max Bandwidth'' too aggressively, Tomato will send packets too fast, causing congestion which will diminish the benefits of prioritization.

==== TCP Vegas ====

Starting with version 1.23, Tomato includes a new feature called ''TCP Vegas''. You will see it at the bottom of the page. This is an outbound congestion avoidance algorithm built into the Linux kernel. For some people this may work better than QoS. For others, it may improve QoS by reducing the problems associated with variable bandwidth speeds, and specifying your ''Max Bandwidth'' to the minimum. The theory is that you could set your ''Max Bandwidth'' to represent your actual maximum, and ''TCP Vegas'' will avoid congestion due to sending packets faster than the actual maximum at any particular moment. (This is new and results are mixed. Whatever you do should be compared to following the QoS instructions in this document, without ''TCP Vegas'' enabled.).

=== Step 2: Basic Settings -- Inbound ===

# Refer to [[#screenshots | Figure 2]].
# Navigate to ''QoS'' and ''Basic Settings.''
# Scroll down, and make the bottom of your page look like Figure 2.

However, as described in [[#Step 1: Basic Settings -- Outbound | Step 1]], the ''Max Bandwidth'' should reflect '''your''' max bandwidth.

Be sure to ''Save'' your changes.

Note: [[#Step 1: Basic Settings -- Outbound | Step 1's]] caution about the conservative accuracy of ''Max Bandwidth'' applies here too.

If you read the novice introduction to QoS,&lt;ref&gt;The [http://vonage.nmhoy.net/qos.html basic QoS primer], mentioned on the [[MagicJack/Support Resources/How-To/QoS | main QoS How-To]] page.&lt;/ref&gt; you will have learned that some controversy exists over inbound QoS. Tomato's inbound QoS is not true &quot;traffic shaping.&quot; It involves trickery, such as delaying acknowledgments, discarding packets, etc., to (hopefully) cause the sender to slow down, retry, etc.

In the experience of the author of this How-To, whatever Tomato is doing, it's very effective. Others have suggested that setting the outbound ''Max Bandwidth'' to a maximum value (all 9s) works better. This may depend on the speed of your internet connection, whether you have a cable provider who uses &quot;speed boost&quot; (or other conditions which cause the speed to vary). The speed of the author of this How-To is a constant 1600kbs down, and he notice's a considerable improvement using Tomato's inbound QoS feature as described in this section.

The [[#Additional thoughts | Additional thoughts section]] contains instructions to test the effectiveness of your QoS. This can be used to test different outbound ''Max Bandwidth'' values, including unlimited (all 9s).

=== Step 3: Classification ===

Navigate to ''QoS'' and ''Classification.''

==== Dedicated Computer ====

If you use a dedicated computer to run MagicJack only, all you have to do is create the QoS ''classification'' rule changing &quot;Any Address&quot; to the Source (Src) MAC Address of the computer's network interface card's (NIC).

After creating that rule, move it to the top of the list so that it's traffic will be caught first, before other rules may catch it. (For example, if you leave it at the bottom, the ''Bulk Traffic'' rule would catch all your VOIP traffic, and it would be categorized as ''Lowest''.).

==== Traditional (mixed use) Computer ====

# Refer to [[#screenshots | Figure 3]].
# Make your page look like Figure 3.

This is where you define how traffic should be identified and classified. The classes here relate to the percentages specified in the prior two steps.

On this screen you should add the two highlighted rules seen in Figure 3, using the following values:

# MJ SIP signaling
#* Any address
#* UDP
#* Destination (Dst) port: 5060-5070
#* Layer 7: sip
#* Class: Highest.
#* Description: MJ SIP signaling.
# MJ RTP voice
#* Any IP address
#* UDP
#* Destination (Dst) port: 10000-30000&lt;ref&gt;On January 23, 2009 it was noticed that this changed from port range 10000-20000 to 10000-30000. It appears MagicJack is now opening ports in the 20000-30000 range. Setting this port range too narrowly will cause the RTP voice traffic to go to the &quot;Lowest&quot; category, seriously degrading the audio quality.&lt;/ref&gt;
#* Layer 7: (In Tomato v. 1.23 use rtp-2. In later versions use rtp. See the [[#classification_l7_note | important note]] below.).
#* Class: Highest.
#* Description: MJ RTP voice

Move these rules ''up,'' above the ''Bulk Trafic'' rule (as shown in Figure 3.).

The order of the rules is important. If they are after the ''Bulk Traffic'' rule, that rule will apply to the MagicJack traffic before these rules are considered.

Also, there's no reason to move them even higher. These rules apply when a connection is created. You'll probably open more web and DNS (hostname lookup) connections than you will telephone calls. There's no reason for Tomato to even consider applying these rules to those more frequent connections.

Be sure to ''Save'' your changes.

&lt;span id=&quot;classification_l7_note&quot;&gt;IMPORTANT:&lt;/span&gt; The ''Layer 7'' ''rtp'' filter did not work prior to Tomato v1.23. In v1.23, only the ''rtp-2'' filter works. In future versions, that fix will be moved into the ''rtp'' rule (and the ''rtp-2'' rule may disappear).

=== Step 4: Check the classification ===

# Refer to [[#screenshots | Figure 4]].
# If your MagicJack is already started, go to the softphone's Menu-&gt;Advanced Users-&gt;Restart and restart it. Otherwise, connect/start your MagicJack.
# Call the special echo number (which will echo what you say back to you): 909-390-0003.
# Navigate to ''QoS'' and ''View Graphs.''
# Click on the slice of the pie that represents ''Highest.''

Note: Refer to the color code on the left side of the screen to understand which slice is ''Highest''. If you place your cursor over a slice of the pie, a bubble-help should tell you which classification it represents.

NOTE: In Internet Explorer, you must install the Adobe SVG plugin to see the graphs.

=== Step 5: View classification details ===

# Refer to [[#screenshots | Figure 5]].
# Check ''Automatically Resolve Addresses.''

You should see two items on this page related to &quot;talk4free.com.&quot; One is to a host named &quot;proxy1&quot; (the SIP connection). The other is to &quot;vms1&quot; (the RTP connection).

The city name of both hosts is dependent upon on your location.

The &quot;proxy1&quot; connection occurs when you start MagicJack. It is a control connection. The &quot;vms1&quot; connection occurs when you place or receive a call. It is the connection which carries the voice traffic (the bulk of traffic).

If you don't see either of these items, you will have to click on other slices of the pie to see where they were classified. If your rules didn't apply, then it probably fell into the &quot;bulk&quot; rule (which is &quot;lowest&quot;). Depending on the speed of your connection and whether it was the vms1 (RTP) connection, speaking into the special echo number will probably produce unusable results. Especially if you are doing anything else, like browsing the web.

Alternatively, you can navigate to &quot;QoS&quot; and &quot;View Details.&quot; This is the same screen you are on when navigating through the pie chart, but it shows all traffic. You can click the headings (&quot;destination&quot; or &quot;class&quot;) and it will sort everything. This might help you locate either of those servers if you have trouble locating them by going through the pie chart.

== Additional thoughts ==

* Remember that [http://www.polarcloud.com/tomato the Tomato page] contains a link to make a donation. If Tomato is useful, buy the author lunch at McDonald's. (If it's really useful, ''Super Size'' it.).
* It's a good idea to perform steps 4 &amp; 5 occasionally to check that it is operating as expected. And, keep them in mind if your voice quality ever deteriorates significantly. QoS is an excellent tool. But, if the rules don't apply as you expect, it can make things '''much worse.''' 
** '''WARNING: You have the responsibility to check how the rules are being [mis-]applied before reporting a voice-quality problem to MagicJack support.'''
* You can use [http://www.speedtest.net www.speedtest.net] to test the effectiveness of your QoS (and any changes you make to the settings suggested by this document). Call the special echo number (see [[#Step 4: Check the classification | Step 4]]) and while counting into the phone, start a speed test. The speed test will saturate your connection (down first, then up).
** You can also use this test to compare the difference between QoS enabled and disabled. (You can disable QoS on the ''QoS-&gt;Basic Settings'' page.).
** BTW: If QoS is operating correctly, you should see about 100kbs difference in speedtest results (with and without QoS).
* Unrelated to QoS (except that unwanted traffic will compete with your voice traffic): By default, Tomato 1.23 has UPnP enabled. The author of this document recommends you navigate to ''Port Forwarding'' and ''UPnP'' to disable this feature. If you see any ports on that page that have already been opened, delete them (unless you know why they are open). After saving changes to this page, check back to make sure it's still disabled. (Sometimes it takes a couple tries to make the disable take effect.).
** UPnP allows processes to open ports without your approval. In a perfect world, this seems nice. However, it can be a security hole. And, if something opens a lot of ports without your knowledge, you could have a high amount of traffic consuming bandwidth, degrading your voice quality, without you knowing it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">It might be interesting to (ab)use parserfunctions to pseudo-randomly swap out the image &amp; caption so we can rotate through a few of them for each page. So, as you go through the book, you'll end up with different stuff shown (1 apple, 2 dogs, 3 cakes... next time is 1 carrot, 2 parrots, 3 cars...) &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:15, 3 January 2009 (UTC)

== Series ==

I was thinking about making this a series like the Alphabet books.
*[[Wikijunior: Numbers from 1 to 20|Numbers from 1 to 20]] - Original: Would have all of the categories that the other books would be based upon.
*These would be individual books:
*Numbers from 1 to 20 - Food
*Numbers from 1 to 20 - Inanimate Objects
*Numbers from 1 to 20 - Animals

We would have to decide on a specific format for the pictures on the pages especially for the larger numbers. We would also have to determine what type of picture could be displayed on the front page to show the difference between the original. I would love to here your opinions on this.

==3 lemons==
Is wrong, there are only 2 lemons in the picture (one is cut in half).

== Lining up ten pictures in each row.==
I wonder if it would be a good idea to line up the pictures so that there are ten pictures per row. Just looking at page 17 for example does not give an emediate impression about that there is 17 fishes there if one not realy counts. But if there where ten fishes in a first row and seven fishes in a second row with fish 11 emediatly under fish 1, fish 12 under fish 2 and so on, one would emediatly realize that there are seventeen fishes depicted. I think such lining up of the pictures would help a child to get a feeling for the base-ten number system.

== Spelling ==

As many kids are just learning to write as this age it would be useful not to have words which are spelt ''incorrectly'' in the country of the child.  The text below '''20''' states ''TWENTY colored pencils''.  Obviously to most of the world this is a spelling mistake although it's perfectly fine in the USA.  Rather than giving International and US English it would be better to find other pictures whose words don't have spelling differences between countries.

== Patch Meshes ==
Patch Meshes are simple polygon meshes that are 0 units high. The front side is visible and solid, the backside is not, allowing the player to go through it from one side only. They consist of vertices, e.g. you have to use the vertex editor ('''V''') to edit and manipulate them. To create a patch you have to create a brush first. Then press '''SHIFT+P''' and the brush side you are looking at in the 2D window, will turn into a 3x3 patch mesh.

== Cylinders ==


== Caps &amp; Bevels ==



== Editing Patches/Curved Objects ==
With &quot;'''Curve &amp;rarr; Insert/Delete'''&quot; you can add or remove columns or rows to a selected patch, cylinder, cap or bevel.

Press '''V''' to move vertices around.

Use '''SHIFT+LMB''' to select more than one vertex.

Press '''CTRL+I''' to invert front side and backside.

Press '''CTRL+C''' to add a cap to bevels and cylinders.

== Usage ==
*sprites, flares
*wires, cables, pipes
*arches
*round corners
*railings

=='''Goulash of Chanterelles'''==

'''Goulash of Chanterelles''' is a typical Austrian main dish, which is served mainly during the summer season. That is because in Austria mushrooms only grow between June and September, which makes this dish even more special. Although it is possible to freeze mushrooms, the taste of frozen chanterelles cannot be compared to the taste of fresh ones. Another aspect that makes this dish so special is the mushroom hunting. Adults, as well as children enjoy it; but unfortunately, some people over do it and take mushrooms by the kilo out of the forests. In 2008, the government tried to impose a fee for mushroom hunting in order to protect the nature, however without success. 

The goulash which consists of chanterelles, some chopped onions, sour cream, different herbs and spices, is traditionally served with either dumplings, or 'Spaetzle'.  The most important spice is the paprika powder that adds the typical sweet flavor to the goulash. The preparation process is not difficult and usually does not take longer that 25 minutes.

==General Information==
The Chanterelle grows on the whole northern hemisphere, especially in conifer forests, but rarely in deciduous forests. It grows on moss-covered ground and primarily below pine and spruce trees, but you also find it below fallen off foliage. The term 'chanterelle' derives from Latin ''Cantharellaceae'' / ''Cantharellus cibarius''. In Austria the mushroom is called 'Pfifferling' or 'Eierschwammerl'. The translation for 'Eierschwammerl' is egg-mushroom; that is because it shows an egg yolk yellow hat that can grow up to a size of 12 cm. In beech forests, its hat is almost white. Also, high solar radiation can cause the chanterelle to lose its color. 
At the start of the growth phase, the hat is curved and the edge of it is rolled up, but becomes funnel-shaped at an advanced age. On the bottom side of the chanterelle are thick egg yolk yellow irregular grooves. The stem thickens and smoothly proceeds to the hat.

==Chanterelles Hunting==
First of all, the right equipment is of great importance. Mushrooms need air and therefore you should not use a plastic bag to collect them. Either a basket, or a burlap bag is suitable for transport. Especially in steep forests, a bag is more comfortable than a basket and should be preferred. Another helpful tool for collecting chanterelles is a jackknife, with which a little of the cleansing can be done on the spot. Furthermore, mushrooms in general need to be cut off rather than hoicked. This spares the mycelium, which is the vegetative part of a mushroom. Finally, taking along a mushroom guidebook increases safety for collectors who do not look for chanterelles only.
 
Only young and unscathed chanterelles are worth to be collected. Older ones are often seized with maggots that hollow out the stem of the mushroom. Whether a chanterelle still has a solid stem can easily be figured out with a soft squeeze. Furthermore, the larger the chanterelles are, the more the taste diminishes and the consistency of the mushrooms weakens, which means they are likely to break into parts. 

==Ingredients==
'''For 4 persons'''                                               
*800g chanterelles
*60g butter
*100g onions
*1/8l sour cream
*10g paprika powder
*3-4 tbsp. white wine vinegar
*1 tsp. flour
*1 tbsp. parsley
*salt
*pepper
'''Side Dishes'''
*dumplings
*'Spaetzle'

==Directions==
Before you start cooking, cut the big mushrooms into halves. All of them should have approximately the same size, which averages 2-3 cm. Peel the onions and chop them finely into small cubes. Then take out a casserole and heat the butter in it. Although the original recipe uses butter, many people prefer oil for the simple reason that it can withstand a higher temperature. When the casserole is hot enough, add the chopped onions and roast them golden brown before you append the paprika powder. Churn the powder and the onions and immediately deglaze it with the prepared white wine vinegar. It is important that the paprika powder does not get too hot because it turns bitter at a certain temperature. Now put the chanterelles into the saucepan and add pepper and salt. Put a lid on it and steam the mixture for about 10-12 minutes until the chanterelles are soft. Take off the lid and raise the temperature in order to preserve the escaping liquid of the chanterelles. After this, take a small bowl, put the sour cream and the flour into it and mix it thoroughly. Pour it into the casserole and reduce the temperature. After 5 minutes, the goulash of chanterelles should be done.

      <text xml:space="preserve">1. Degenerate

2. There are 6 coordinate bonds on the same axes of two of the orbitals so they have higher energy

3. 3d&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;2 and 3d&lt;sub&gt;x2y2&lt;/sub&gt;

4. The energy of light absorbed during a promotion of an electron to a higher energy obital corresponds to the frequency and therefore wavelength of light

5. Ligand substitution reactions will change the ligands in the compex. Different ligands will change the energy gap and therefore the frequency and colour of light absorbed. change to bigger energy gap will decrease wavelength of absorbed light.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Children cannot be considered to be little adults.  Child and adolescent psychiatry is a unique area and conceptualisations typical of adult mental health are often either not helpful such as the rubric of personality disorders, or fall short in terms of emphasis.  For example whilst adult practitioners will consider the patient’s family, in childhood and adolescence the family may be a source of solutions that lead to symptom reduction, a barrier to change or indeed the cause of the child's presentation.

Child and adolescent psychiatrists conceptualise their patients and their patient’s challenges in a unique way. This focuses on the twin concepts of development, the changes that occur as part of growing up, and of the inter-relatedness of the child and those around them which as a shorthand can be called the systemic perspective.  

To elaborate, a fundamental task of infants, children and adolescents is to grow and in so doing learn to regulate, or achieve mastery over physiological, behavioural and emotional systems such as the ability to sleep, eat, self-soothe and control the excesses of behaviour and impulsivity.  As adults we do not, and cannot live life as ‘toddlers’ and few adults would tolerate temper tantrums in their work colleagues.  A developmental perspective allows the child and adolescent psychiatrist to know that stranger danger in a baby is normal and separation anxiety for the first few days of school is also within the normal limits.  Similarly, the child and adolescent psychiatrist knows there should be a gradual improvement in the young boy’s ability to sit still and attend in class.  Not to do so may suggest pathology.  A grounding in what abilities and limitations to expect of children and adolescents, by age, gender and influenced by cultural expectation is essential to working in this area.

The content of some child and adolescent conditions demonstrate a developmental presentation pattern. For example, an underlying vulnerability to anxiety may become manifest in different ways across the child and adolescent developmental span.  Of the anxiety-related presentations early issues include prolonged and excessive stranger danger; in the older child prolonged school-related separation anxiety. In pre-school children phobias often manifest as a fear of animals, in early school-age children as fear of the dark and/or burglars, school phobia around the age of entry to high school, in adolescence social phobia and late adolescence sees the onset of agoraphobia and panic disorder. 

A systemic perspective emphasises that infants, children and adolescents are not ‘islands’, indeed the very young cannot live without the care and protection of adults.  Further, children develop within systems or social networks, most obviously the immediate and extended family and the school environment, the latter including peers and teachers.  Included in such understandings will be culturally dependent rules such as how extended is the typical family. For example, is it the norm for grandparents to live with the child and parents; how open or closed is the family to non-familial influences such as the impact of religious or village leaders and the influence of the media.  As well as the generally applicable culture within which the family sits there are patterns of interaction and belief which may be more individual to the particular family and not necessarily shared by their neighbours.  The parents may be in conflict and the child caught in the middle.  A parent may be chronically ill and the child adopting a carer role.  Understanding of both individual family systemic issues and the wider cultural influences are important to the practice of child and adolescent psychiatry in a variety of ways. In terms of engagement for instance one must to know whether it is appropriate to conduct a home visit, how to address parents and grandparents and what sort of formulations are likely to make sense to the child and family. A systemic perspective is also important to management. This is universal in child and adolescent psychiatry, not restricted to cases where the treatment modality is family therapy. Clearly an intervention that contravenes a local or family belief is unlikely to be supported by the family, and is therefore unlikely to be successful.  

Biological thinking, whilst in children less likely to lead to pharmacological interventions, is highly relevant to child and adolescent psychiatry.  Biological constructs that may be important to a child's mental health presentation include a history of any pathological processes that may have affected the child’s developing brain.  Examples include infections and toxic insults during pregnancy or anoxic brain damage during labour or the first minutes of life.  The child and adolescent psychiatrist routinely takes a history about such issues, as well as considering the child's facial and body morphology for possible chromosomal or genetic abnormalities, and any evidence of developmental delay during the early years.  Developmental delays may be circumscribed but more commonly may cross functional domains so a broad and comprehensive assessment is required. It will be found, for example, that many children with behavioural problems are also clumsy.  Developmental problems, even though due to problems before or around birth, may not manifest themselves immediately.  For example a lowered intelligence or specific learning or speech problems may not become obvious until the child enters the late preschool or early school period.  In adolescence biological issues that arise are less likely to be developmental and more likely to be the adverse mental health effects of injury or misadventure, or related to the development of an acute or chronic medical illness such as diabetes or drug use and abuse.

Later in this chapter issues of disease classification relevant to child and adolescent psychiatry will be discussed.  The preceding introductory comments may lead some readers away from classifications that are primarily categorical such as the ICD-10 and DSM systems.  These classifications are important in child and adolescent psychiatry and facilitate good communication, research and service planning.  However, child and adolescent psychiatrists are equally influenced by and comfortable with dimensional views of psychopathology.  For example, where the child lies on a dimension of inattention is as important as is the question as to whether the child has Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder.  A dimensional view has the added benefit of potentially being less ‘pathologising’ in that embedded in this approach is the understanding that healthy children also have a degree of “whatever it is” (i.e. inattention) but either have a more “healthy” amount or are more able to cope with it. With this perspective, rather than seeking cure of a categorical disorder, the child and adolescent psychiatrist will work to help the child and family move towards a more functional developmental trajectory. An example of this might be, in the case of a child with attention deficit, to attend more to the need to achieve education and less to the treatment of symptoms.  This might, for instance, lead to the planning of a medication regime in a way which gives maximal attentional enhancement when the child is in school. 

A useful dimensional nosology often used in child and adolescent mental health is the distinction between internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Formally derived from the scoring system of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL: Achenbach, 1991) and related measures, this terminology has now entered more general usage. Externalising symptoms are clearly witnessed or reported, obvious to an observer whereby the child will ‘externalise’ an assumed feeling state, cognition or demonstrate lack of age-appropriate regulation. Typical symptoms include anger, aggression and hyperactivity. Internalising symptoms are less obvious, indeed may go unreported without appropriate questioning. Typical internalizing symptoms are depressed mood and specific and generalized fears.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Phenomenology 
Epidemiology
Population based surveys across numerous countries and cultural groups have recorded the prevalence of mental health disturbance in children and adolescents at between 15 - 20%. Methodological and design issues include whether the research was primarily parent report which finds higher rates of externalising disorders; child and youth self-report which provides better estimates of internalising disorders; or more robust designs which included information from multiple informants. General trends include higher rates of externalising disorders in males and of internalising disorders in females.  Often, as is the case with depression, gender-based rates are similar in the pre-pubertal period. Post-puberty rates of depression are higher in females. Some conditions present at specific developmental stages, for example early onset psychosis is rare before the middle teenage years, or demonstrate a clear developmental relationship or progression.  An example of the latter is the common trajectory from oppositional defiant disorder (ODD) in children to conduct disorder in adolescents. 

It is probable there are many reasons for cross-cultural differences in the prevalence of specific conditions. One is that the prevalence of illness/disorder will be influenced by local conditions; anorexia nervosa is more common in affluent developed world.  Another is the willingness to diagnose depends on culture; what was naughtiness in some western societies is now ODD or ADHD. With these caveats in mind useful prevalence estimates include a rate and diagnosable depressive disorder of approximately 3%, anorexia nervosa 0.5%, ADHD 6%, ODD and CD 6-10% (increasing with age) and autism 0.1%. Note one cannot simply add these prevalence figures and conclude that most children have a mental health problem.  Conditions are often comorbid with one individual sometimes experiencing two or three mental health disorders. 

Another consideration is impairment. Many symptoms such as mild anxiety, brief lowered mood or nightmares after a traumatic event are often normal. Key to the diagnosis and subsequent management plan is the impairment in daily functioning. If symptoms  interrupt the child’s family or peer relationships, or impede their ability to attend and take advantage of school and other activities i.e. if symptoms either prevent normal function or normal development, then the presentation is more serious and worthy of an intervention. One measure of impairment is the disability adjusted life years (DALY) methodology.  A recent application of this methodology to the child and adolescent mental health area suggests the impairment burden of neuropsychiatric conditions in children will double by the year 2020.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the management of child and adolescent mental health presentations it is usual to begin with mono-therapy; usually in the form of one of the ‘talking’ therapies. Across a range of approaches psychotherapy is not only helpful for symptom reduction but also enhancing resilience. Most treatment algorithms cite that for some conditions addition of a drug treatment can be beneficial. In this sense the medication is adjunctive to the primary psychotherapeutic interventions. For example addition of an SSRI medication to either Bulimia nervosa or OCD where psychological treatment alone produces insufficient benefit, is warranted and has an evidence base. Further, some studies, including those with ADHD, have concluded that combination of medication with psychotherapy decreases the ultimate dose of medication required. Combined treatments can also potentially lead to more rapid symptom reduction and be more cost effective.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Psychotherapy with children and adolescents can be divided into individual, family and group approaches. Individual therapies are usually either psychodynamically informed or a cognitive- behavioural intervention, often with variations of cognitive or behavioural interventions depending on the age of the child, cognition being treated or the experience and training of the psychiatrist. Key elements across types of psychotherapy include therapy designed to be appropriate to the developmental stage of the child, all therapy being delivered within a family construct (not just ‘family therapy’) and the therapist being suitably trained and their work is related to a known theoretical framework.
Behaviour therapy is usually symptom focused where the symptom is a problematic behaviour. Therapy is often brief, may involve the parent as a ‘coach’ and helps promote desired behaviours and eliminate the problem behaviour. Whilst initially in the clinic or hospital, behaviour therapy works well in the real-world, addressing actual difficult symptoms such as agoraphobia or social phobia. Therapy tends to be practical, ‘here and now’ and there is little emphasis on cognitions or dynamic insights. An example of behaviour therapy is ‘flooding’ the child with separation anxiety disorder by assisting the parents to take the child to school and then leaving the children with teaching staff. Or if the same is done in a more gradual fashion then this may be more akin to desensitization. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) expands on behaviour therapy  by adding interventions that identifies problematic thoughts or cognitive schema and introducing practices that directly challenging unhelpful thoughts and replace the with more helpful cognitions. There is considerably variation within CBT as regards the extent to which therapy focuses on behaviour, on cognitions or even on the underlying patterns of thinking and relating which form the fertile ground from which symptomatic thoughts and behaviours may arise.  CBT is active, often ‘now’ orientated and relies on out of session work by the child, often with parent assistance. Home work is a feature of CBT. Some CBT interventions are manualised and this greatly aides their formal research evaluation.  Indeed the evidence base for many CBT programs is more robust than other forms of psychotherapy. There exist CBT packages for children who experience depression and different types of anxiety such as OCD, panic-agoraphobia and social phobia.  It is perhaps the manualisaton, the growing evidence base and the relative brevity of these forms of therapy that may result in their rapidly increasing popularity over recent years.
Psychodynamic psychotherapy generally is longer term.  While it is the existence of the presenting problem that is the stimulus for treatment, the therapy is generally more focused on helping the patient to gain insight, to understand the patterns in their thinking, feeling and relating which cause repeated difficulties and to be able to communicate in more healthy ways.  Although the description of psychodynamic psychotherapy may resemble that of other therapies, for instance schema based cognitive behaviour therapy, it is marked out from these by its trade mark technology which is the focus on the way the patient relates to the therapist and to material from the patient’s unconscious mind. The focus on the “underlying” may be problematic if the therapy does not seem sufficiently relevant to the presenting symptom, but does have the potential for personal growth and resilience should symptoms recur at a later time. Dynamic approaches vary across the child and adolescent span. At younger ages therapist employ more creative techniques such a drawing and play. Indeed Art and Play Therapy are generally psycho-dynamically informed and require further training and supervision. Longer term strategies have great value especially for seriously abused children and youth who are often in crisis and cannot make use of the structure inherent to CBT and the motivation required. With these individuals psychodynamically informed support and containment can be very helpful. With improvement the focus of psychodynamic therapy can alter from support to more insight oriented techniques or incorporate elements of CBT.
There are many schools of family therapy and there are many differences between these.  What they have in common is a perspective which brings to the foreground, not the inner world of the child or adolescent (though for some schools this remains important), but the relationships, communication patterns and shared beliefs within the family and other social systems within which the patient lives and functions.  The developmental life cycle perspective is as integral to understanding families as it is to thinking about individuals. Some presentations can best be understood in terms of difficulties in negotiating family life cycle stages e.g. teenager becoming more independent and eventually leaving home and what this means for other family members and relationships.  A narrative approach to family therapy might explore the way the family members understand their difficulties and whether there are alternative understandings which might lead to new possibilities. Family counselling and psychoeducation is also part of the repertoire of family interventions, often to help families cope with presentations that may be primarily biological not family dynamic in origin, for instance assistance coping with the behaviour of an autistic child.   Confusion may arise with family therapy in terms of who is the patient.  Some families bringing an identified patient are comfortable with the idea that the whole family is the patient and that all in the family will need to change.  Others find this an alien concept and feel blamed when family therapy is recommended for a problem which, to them, resides within one member.  It may be helpful to explore this and to address the issue of family being helped to help one of its members versus family being treated as the patient.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Prior to a discussion of pharmacotherapy it is prudent to discuss the decision-making process around the use of medication, especially given the rapid advances in this area and the array of medications now available.  Whilst in some centers there is easy access to senior colleagues for advice, as a default strategy this is generally unsustainable and clearly does not work in regional hospitals or rural and remote settings. To this end practitioners need to be adept at accessing contemporary clinical practice guidelines from professional organizations (e.g. N.I.C.E.), Cochrane reviews, other published meta analyses and systematic reviews. Pharmacotherapy texts are often very informative, so too formularies that are often produced by government bodies; albeit care is required as some information can become out of date. The technology age has also made long distance communication available to many and so advice via email or phone can be obtained even if geographically remote. On-line discussion groups are also becoming more popular. 

If these strategies do not provide the answer required then one should consider the conclusions of a seminal study in the area. Prior to accepting the findings of a seminal study the practitioner should determine whether the study is methologically sound, has sufficient power, both genders and a range of ethnicities and social economic groups are included as participants thereby allowing generalization of findings into various practice settings. Finally, conclusions should be conservative in that they are consistent with the rigour of the methodology and strength of the analysis.

Various authors have published psychopharmacology practice advice relevant to children and adolescents. The over-arching principle is that medication prescription should only follow an adequate assessment and formulation.  A broad formulation will determine whether there are ongoing causal or maintaining factors within the family system or local ecology. Many practitioners find the ‘predisposing, precipitating and perpetuating factor’ heuristic helpful. An example being one should not prescribe medication for anxiety if the child is still being physically abused. In this case the treatment is to facilitate the provision of a safe environment. A prescribing generalisation is to start with a low dose. Child and parent compliance can be radically undermined by early adverse side-effects and so slowly increasing medication dose at the same time as predicting typical adverse events is prudent. Whenever possible dosage regimes should be dependant on the child's weight. There are adequate milligrams (drug) per kilogram (child weight) dosage schedules for stimulant medication, some atypical psychotics, tricyclic antidepressants such as Clomiprame for OCD and Sodium Valproate. Once a decision to prescribe is undertaken then the medication trial should continue, with regular monitoring, until an adequate dose has been trialed for an adequate period of time. Premature cessation creates uncertainty as to whether a certain medication is beneficial or not. If available and there are no financial constraints, new medications are preferable especially given their greater safety profile and fewer side-effects. Good prescribing needs to consider whether there are physical factors that influence the bioavailability of the medication such as concurrent liver or renal disease and in the patient with epilepsy some medications, especially anti-psychotic medication, can lower the fit threshold. Drug-drug interactions can occur, especially when drugs are combined which both affect these same neurotransmitter pathway.

When practicing child and adolescent psychiatry or behavioural paediatrics, there can be pressure from parents or teachers to increase medication dose beyond the usual parameters or too prescribe additional medications to obtain symptom control.  This can be a serious problem in the overall management of the case.  Family dysfunction including arguments between parents or the threat of school suspension is not a valid reason to increase the child's medication.  There are persuasive research findings, for instance in the area of ADHD, that combining psychological interventions with medication is associated with lower medication dose.  One assumes combined therapy can also decrease the number of medications required.  Symptom deterioration is a reason to (a) review the diagnosis, (b) review barriers and maintaining factors, (c) look for new causal factors (d) review your therapeutic alliance with the child and family and (e) to consider comorbidity.  The latter may be secondary to the original presentation, for instance a depressive illness in a teenager struggling with chronic anorexia nervosa. When these factors have been accounted for then increasing the dose or considering a second medication is reasonable. The prudent practitioner will also decide upon a small selection of medications with which they become very familiar with and prescribe preferentially.  Use of a small number of medications allows greater knowledge of the typical dosage regime, side-effects and interaction profiles and also allows the practitioner to prepare and have ready access to patient information handouts.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An approach seen across many areas of psychiatry is the biopsychosocial-cultural schema. This schema emphasises the child lives within a family, school, local environment context and there may need to be interventions at numerous parts of the individual and social ecology to achieve a successful outcome.  Rather than consider biopsychosocial-cultural factors during the infant, child, early and late adolescent stages separately, this section will take an over-arching developmental view and integrate these various ecological influences at different stages of development.
A developmental approach acknowledges differences in the child's integration of biological, emotional, cognitive and behavioural systems and differences peer and family interactions across the life span.  Developmental theory highlights it is the interplay of these factors that determines whether development approximates to the normal trajectory or whether deviation occurs. The later, if significant, is synonymous with the presence of symptoms and impairment. The 'normal trajectory' does not imply there is a single pathway to a particular outcome. Critical aspects of the biopsychosocial frame are required, including for example an intact central nervous system, availability of at least one attachment figure and an environment with the potential of providing at least food and shelter. Other useful concepts in the developmental context are protective, resilience or vulnerability factors. We will refer to descriptors for the major development epochs: fetal, infant, child and adolescent periods, despite some conjecture about when difference stages begin and end. Developmental is, after all, continuous.  
	Biological fetal determinants of later mental health include toxic fetal environmental factors and the adverse effects of maternal malnutrition. Toxic effects can be from infections (e.g. rubella, herpes, human immunodeficiency virus, cytomegalovirus and toxoplasmosis); excessive maternal alcohol intake and deficiency states such as folate deficiency, the later commonly following malnutrition.  Genes controlling major organogenesis are operant during the fetal period and toxic effects at this stage can be catastrophic including mal-development of the central nervous system.  Although birth-weight may give some indication of the success and traumas of the gestational period it is a very coarse and non-specific marker. However, intrauterine growth retardation (measures of which include both birth-weight and gestational age) is a useful predictor of later hyperactivity, academic performance and possibly other outcomes. Important psychosocial factors during the fetal period include maternal perception of social support, the development of attachment to the developing fetus and whether the wider system such as father, grandparents and wider community are involved or supportive.
	The infant phase is obviously influenced by persisting fetal factors. From a mental health perspective a psychological construct of major importance in this stage is attachment. Attachment theory has essentially either replaced or lead to profound modification of previously held psychodynamic and learning paradigms. Understanding of attachment has progressed with recent cognitive and developmental psychology research finding the infant’s competence is greater at an earlier age than previously thought. Early behaviours include the infant's ability to recognise their mother's voice in the hours after birth and preferential eye tracking around two months of age. One must remember attachment is not uni-directional but rather relates to the relationship between infant and primary caregiver. Attachment has both cross-sectional and longitudinal links with mental health. Up to 80% of the offspring of depressed mothers display insecure attachment. This attachment style is also related to the child’s delayed expressed language and cognitive development. 
	As is expected the childhood period continues the development of the infant period including the attachment pattern established at that time. The child period is a time of continued cognitive, speech, language and psychological development underpinned by continued synapse formation, continuous (CNS) reorganisation and maturation of neuronal circuits.   It is a time of an increased sense of self-efficacy, competence and mastery of more complex social circumstances.  Social development includes a move from solitary play to parallel and then cooperative play, with the locus of contact not solely restricted to the family home.  Relationships with non-family individuals such as school friends become more common, complex and incorporate increasing imagination and fantasy. Peers and group membership become important and the experience of rejection by peers can have major consequences including development of anxiety and lowered mood.  Indeed children can develop both depressive and anxiety disorders of a degree of severity which justifies professional intervention.  Consequences can include impaired social relationships, diminished social support, diminished self-esteem and increased deviant behaviour. These can then in turn result in further deterioration of the child’s mental state with a resulting downward spiral.  Conversely, childhood can be a time of an increased sense of self-efficacy, competence and mastery of more complex social circumstances such as interactions in the school domain.
	Definitions of Adolescence vary are often culture bound. One could argue that adolescence, or at least its recognition as a significant developmental stage is a relatively recent phenomenon and one of most relevance to the affluent developed world.  There are many societies where work, marriage and the taking on of adult type responsibilities, unfortunately including going to war, occur at ages where the typical western teenager is engrossed in adolescent experimentation and is very far from these things. 
From a biological perspective the onset of adolescence is defined by the hormonal changes of puberty and the effects these changes have on body morphology including the development of secondary sexual characteristics.  Behaviour is in part gender-specific with greater levels of aggression in males and depression in females. Biological influences during the adolescent stage are not limited to physiological maturational processes. Environmental toxins include exposure to illicit drugs and legal substances such as cigarettes, alcohol and inappropriate use of over-the-counter medication.  
Psychological factors include increased capacity for self-reflective thinking and development of a more sophisticated sense of self.  A more robust self-identity is related to the development of personal values with may include moral, political, sexual, religious or spiritual values as well as future educational and work aspirations.  Much psychological development occurs within the context of the school environment. 
To conclude this discussion on aetiology, it should be acknowledged that several factors are not development stage specific but rather are factors that are influential across developmental phases.  The family's resources; financial, emotional and cultural, and social economic class (SEC) are influential developmental factors.  Socioeconomic disadvantage and poverty have been linked to not only child and adolescent behaviour problems and conduct disorder but also more bio-behavioural processes such as the exposure of children to spoken and written language and the number of encouragements and discouragements given to the child during the early years. Note it is simplistic to ascribe causation to family SEC, rather this is a summary of a complex variety of constructs, for example may include parent mental health, parent availability, dislocation from extended family resources and access to other resources that enrich the child’s development. 
Biological effects can be influential across the lifespan such as some genetic factors, for example the presence of a genetic mutation seen with Velocardiofacial syndrome or the persistence of problems caused by anoxic brain damage at birth.  Parental influence is also a persisting developmental effect.  For example parents who have a coercive parenting style will continue to demonstrate this parenting style unless helped to do otherwise. In turn coercive parenting is related to the development of oppositional defiant disorder and later conduct disorder.   
Finally, the child and family’s culture must be considered in any aetiological formulation. Culture affects many of the determinants of health, as well as the construction of whether a given phenomenon is a health issue. For examples some cultures are more willing to acknowledge youth suicide. Whilst clearly effecting data and statistical analysis, at a personal level help seeking behavior for suicidal youth is likely to be effected by social views on this issue. Culture is often seen as a strong developmental continuity. However, for some countries in the developing world cultural change is rapid and has profound effects on children, an example being prolonged parental absence due to adults following employment opportunities in major cities.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As previously mentioned, as a generalisation children live within a family context and so it is usual to begin with interviewing the whole family.  If there are no biological parents then the child is seen with the usual caregivers; for orphaned children the child is seen with the adult responsible for their care. Again, the practitioner needs to be knowledgeable on the child's developmental stage and what are the usual capacities and competencies for a child of that age.  Importantly, this includes knowledge of the communication style and ability that would be expected.  Some practitioners are fortunate in that they have been personally exposed to caring for young children in non-clinical settings.  If this is not the case the practitioner can be guided by the type of school activities that are typical for children of different ages and school grades.  For example, very young children in the school setting are often engaged in creative activities.  Play is the primary communication mode of young children.  Older children will draw, colour in or engage in imaginary play with toy figures. Towards the end of primary school children will more readily engage in conversation, although will often give few details spontaneously.  Guiding the conversation with drawings or timelines or an activities leads to greater richness of detail. Adolescents will usually engage in greater self reflection and prolonged conversation and are often seen before other family members to emphasise their progress towards individuation from the family.  Cultural issues are important when considering what information should come from father or mother and whether children should be seen by themselves or only when other family members present.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A major issue differentiating child and adolescent psychiatry from practice with adults is that the content of symptoms varies across the child and adolescent developmental span.  Consider the example of depression.  The symptoms displayed by older adolescents are often identical to the adult criteria for a major depressive disorder, for example a pervasively lowered mood, often with diurnal mood change, anhedonia, neurovegetative changes in sleep, appetite, weight and energy and typical depressive cognitions of helplessness, hopelessness and possibly suicidal thinking. This is very different from the picture seen in younger children.  An eight year old, for example, can become profoundly depressed in mood without much in the way of depressive cognitions and is unlikely to report suicidal thinking.  The very young child may seem sad without much verbal elaboration, relatively mute and markedly withdrawn with no pleasure in play or during other typical childhood activities. Uncertainties over whether a low mood in a younger child without significant depressive cognitions is the equivalent of a more adult type picture in an older adolescent, have, in the past, and perhaps in the present too, lead to difficulties in making valid diagnoses particularly in the younger age group.

Another group of disorders which show considerable variation with age are the anxiety disorders.  Fear of the dark is so common in very young children as to be normal. However, with increasing age fears become more related to social interaction such as fear about being asked questions or giving presentations in class, difficulties talking to peers, or to adults when attempting to buy food, clothes or bus tickets. Similarly, age differences are seen in the anti-social domain; younger children rarely engage in assault with weapons or force others into sexual activity, these are features of conduct disturbance in older age groups.

Often clinicians will ask screening questions about typical externalising and internalising symptoms.  Considering the former, disruptive young children are oppositional, defiant, easily angered, have prolonged or severe tantrums and actively defy authority figures. Older children and adolescents engage in aggressive behaviour: fighting, bullying, sometimes using a weapon, cruelty to animals or forcing others into sexual activity.  They may also steal or vandalise property.  The oppositional defiant behaviour seen at a younger age may also persist into adolescence. Other common behavioural presentations are inattentive and/or hyperactive behaviour which may occur in isolation or co-occur with aggressive or defiant behaviour. Children with these symptoms may demonstrate problems with their ability to maintain age-appropriate attention and concentration, problems controlling impulsivity or demonstrate hyperactive behaviour. “Age-appropriate’ is a key construct in that there may be a considerable gap between this and the behaviour expected by parents. The latter can be either too permissive or inappropriately demanding for the child’s developmental stage. The symptoms are often prominent in classroom settings; they are of greater significance if they are present across numerous settings, typically including home and school. Hyperactive symptoms include the sense that child is always moving, cannot remain still even for an enjoyable activity and the behaviour may lead to dangerous play with risk of injury. Another group of behavioural presentations are the stereotypical, repetitive behaviors such as hand twirling or flapping or unusual mannerisms seen in children with autism and pervasive developmental disorders. Such behaviours have no functional significance, begin early in life and often persist. These behaviours should be differentiated from tics, for instance seen with Tourettes disorder or from medication side effects such as may be caused by some anti-psychotic medication. Autistic children may also demonstrate hyperactive and aggressive behaviours.

Internalising symptoms are often considered to be synonymous with anxiety and depressive symptoms. However, a broader definition is probably more useful. This would for example, include the body image disturbance typical of eating disorders. Many internalizing symptoms have been previously mentioned in this chapter. Childhood fears are common. In young children these are often poorly elaborated fearful feelings. With increased age they may be associated with cognitions typical of panic such as pre-event wishes to avoid the situation, or feelings that symptoms such as tachycardia are evidence of impending physical illness or death. Other common anxiety symptoms of children are obsessional thoughts, especially about ‘germ’s or poisons, fears about school, and nightmares seen in Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). As with anxiety, depressive symptoms too change with age.  In younger children they are not specific, and often take the form of a desire to withdraw and be alone and a general lowered mood. With age the child may become more pessimistic, hopeless and feel they are worthless or incompetent. From the mid-teen years onwards suicidal thoughts are common. These are of more concern if the thoughts are accompanied by detailed planning and a desire to enact the plan. In children and adolescents it is useful to identify the symptom of anhedonia (loss of the typical pleasure response). It is unusual for primary-school age children to avoid parties or activities and lose interest in interacting with friends. Adolescents can often describe an altered sense of pleasure; the younger child may not be able to describe this change. However, parents are often able to report this phenomenon as altered behavior – parents notice the child does not take as much pleasure in their usually enjoyed activities. 


It is beyond the scope of this chapter to discuss all symptoms seen in child adolescent psychiatric practice.  Many low prevalence conditions have typical or pathognomic symptoms such as eating non nutritious substances (Pica), being persistently mute despite normal speech and vocalisation apparatus, especially when outside the home environment (Selective Mutism), deficiencies in reciprocal social awareness and behaviours (Autism and Pervasive developmental disorder), tics, encopresis, enuresis and disturbances of attachment to name some. A comprehensive child adolescent mental health text is recommended to further study such conditions.  

Attachment related symptoms are common and require some comment. Infants, including very young children are innately social and from birth demonstrate a repertoire of behaviours that promote attachment to parents, primary caregivers and other adults.  Normal, adaptive, ‘secure’ attachment behaviour is demonstrated by the infant maintaining suitable proximity to the parent, a willingness to explore the environment whilst repeatedly seeking assurance and a developing ability to self-soothe during brief periods of separation. Attachment styles where the infant is more anxious, ambivalent or disorganized include infants who are overly vigilant and excessively watchful, overly withdrawn or inconsistent in developmentally appropriate social interactions. Such behaviours are more likely to cause both current difficulties with establishing eating and sleeping and other routines, as well as the infant being more likely to develop mental health problems during later childhood.

      <text xml:space="preserve">__NOTOC__
Hi, fellow Wikibookians!

I'm a [http://www.bch.msu.edu/faculty/wedemeyer.htm professor] in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology at [[:w:Michigan State University|Michigan State University]] (MSU).  My laboratory uses computational and experimental methods to study protein structure, and to investigate the molecular forces and events involved in folding and self-assembly.  

I'm a relative newbie to Wikibooks, so I hope you'll forgive any accidental lapses on my part.  I'm doing my best.  I've collected a lot of material for textbooks over the years, which I'll gradually begin to add.  Having several young nieces, nephew and a godchild, I'm also interested in producing books for [[Wikijunior]]. 

My e-mail address is given on my MSU faculty webpage linked above.  It's basically the same as my user name here.  Anyone who wishes to verify that I am a professor is cordially invited to send me an e-mail, to which I'll be happy to reply.  Since professors are notorious for missing e-mails, please make sure that your subject heading has something attention-grabbing in it.  Thanks!

==Thoughts for textbooks==

In general, I like the idea of producing ''sets'' of graded books, with each one building on its predecessors.  However, I also like the idea of keeping materials modular, so that different people can mix and match modules to make their own textbooks.  In the latter case, however, it would be convenient if we could mark the modules with the preliminary knowledge needed.  

* General physics
* Electronics
* Geometry
* Protein science
* Structural biology
* Mathematical methods
* Bioinformatics
* Planetary motion
* Classical mechanics
* Learning the stars
* Craft books
* Naval architecture
* Music composition
* New Testament Greek
* Medieval Latin
* Rules of games
* Localized collections of rocks, plants, animals, etc.  
**Have users enter their position and generate the book on the fly from the nearby modules.

==Reading level==

Think about how to score books for reading level using the word-frequency ranking of Zipf's law.  Also think about ways of using a controlled vocabulary, how to list it, and how to flag violations.

==Common types of pre-schooler books==

{| class=&quot;wikitable sortable&quot; id=&quot;types_preschooler_books&quot;
! Type !! Wikibook category !! Description !! Ideas

Cool things for kids: farms and farm animals, faraway countries and peoples, dinosaurs, space, stories and myths,...

Remember that many adults would benefit from books to help them learn to read.

==Random thoughts==

; Dealing with subpages, navigation and searching
* Special:PrefixIndex (and possibly DPL) can be used to list all the modules in a book.  Write a template to list those modules and perhaps their categories; there's no need to have a separate category.  That spares us the confusion between books and true categories.  Write an extension to the Media software to automatically generate a table of contents template from those modules.  Need to work out new method for Subjects and to avoid clutter in Categories; perhaps include an option on Category pages to suppress the display of subpages.

; Textbook ideas
* Make similarity (same angles) one of the first topics in a beginning geometrical course; exploit symmetries as well.  These are more intuitive to beginners.  It's important that people get some exposure to actual geometry before launching into Euclid and proofs.  Those serve the justify why the methods work.  Then move to spherical geometry and see what fails.  Also consider using examples from architecture, building construction and ship lofting.</text>

*The phonetic notation in this book is CXS (Conlang X-SAMPA).  (The choice of CXS was discussed in [[Talk:Conlang#Phonetic notation|this talk thread]].)

You may contribute any linguistic knowledge you have, but
*keep in mind this book is a tutorial for anyone wishing to create a language &amp;mdash; which is a bit different from a tutorial on linguistics.
*think about which level your knowledge belongs on.  For example, the Beginner level tries to keep technical terms to a bare minimum, so if it can't be said without those, maybe it's at least Intermediate.  Also keep in mind that ''because'' this is a conlanging book, technical linguistic knowledge is liable to go at a higher level here than it would in a linguistics book.
A high-quality module will be easy to understand while going in-depth, and will explain early and often how it could be used in a conlang.  Examples are important, and detailed explanations are great things to have, without being redundant or droning on.  So get out there and write some great modules!

      <text xml:space="preserve">__TOC__

This article describes how to diagnose what is commonly described as &quot;choppy,&quot; &quot;garbled&quot; or &quot;robot&quot; voice. The following are common causes. The problem can be a combination of any (or all) of them.

When testing the following solutions you can [[MagicJack/Support_Resources/FAQ#Can_I_make_test_calls_without_bothering_anyone.3F | use the special echo-test phone number]] to avoid bothering others with your tests.

== Specific to using a handset ==

If you use a handset the first thing to do is unplug it from the USB device and see if you have choppiness when making calls using the softphone and a headset connected to the computer's speaker/mic jacks.

If the choppiness is specific to using a handset, try using a powered USB hub. See the FAQ: [[MagicJack/Support_Resources/FAQ#Why_do_I_keep_hearing_so_much_about_.22powered_USB_hubs.22.3F | Why do I keep hearing so much about powered USB hubs?]] 

The following may also help (and may eliminate the need for a powered USB hub):

'''Windows XP'''

Disable power management for all your USB devices in Device Manager. Follow these steps:

# Right click &quot;My Computer&quot; and choose &quot;Manage.&quot;
# Click on &quot;Device Manager&quot; and expand the &quot;Universal Serial Bus Controllers&quot; branch in the pane on the right side.
# For '''every''' &quot;USB Root Hub,&quot; 
#* Double click it, click the &quot;Power Management&quot; tab, and uncheck the box saying &quot;Allow the computer to turn off this device to save power.&quot;

Note: This will make your computer less energy efficient, and will drain your laptop's battery. If you notice no improvement, you should reverse the change.

Credit: The power-management suggestion comes from http://www.phoneservicesupport.com/post29629.html#29629. There have not been many reports of this making a difference. If you find that it improves choppiness, please post to that thread.

Note: If, after trying the advice on this page herein and from other sources, you do not succeed in eliminating the choppiness or echo, you may want to consider switching to the use of a headset with mouthpiece microphone.  While this solution for most people may require them to remain at their computers while on calls, several sources have reported that use of a headset with mouthpiece microphone saw a complete elimination of the choppiness or echo.  These users also reported that they had been using radio (ie, cordless) telephones prior to their switching over to headphones.

== Not enough CPU or memory ==

This can occur if you have an old computer, a computer with a slow CPU, and/or too many processes consuming too much CPU (anti-virus, firewall, etc.). Too little memory could contribute, causing the CPU to spend time swapping memory to disk (which could be further aggravated for Windows users by an excessively-fragmented hard disk).

This can be eliminated as a cause by following the [[MagicJack/Support_Resources/How-To/Priority | How-To: Set priority]].

If you run an extremely old/slow computer, there are &quot;tweak&quot; guides on the Internet explaining how to adjust (and disable) Windows features to get better performance. (Google for &quot;Windows tweak guide.&quot;).

If your computer appears to be unusually slow, it's worth considering whether it is infected with spam bots, spyware, viruses, etc.

== Router Security Features ==

Routers typically come with a number of security features. One feature in particular, DoS attack prevention, may interfere with communication. Routers with this security feature enabled may interpret the incoming call as a DoS attack causing the audio to sound choppy, as though the signal is being rapidly switched on and off. The outgoing audio remains unaffected. Disabling the DoS attack prevention feature resolves the issue described in this section.
How do I do this?

== Connecting to your router wirelessly ==

Wi-fi can cause (or contribute to) this problem. It can introduce latency delays and lost packets (due to interference from microwaves, cordless phones, garage-door openers, etc.).

To eliminate this as a cause, connect the computer to the router with a wire until the problem is resolved.

If this proves to be a problem it can be improved by:

* Change the wireless channel to one that isn't as congested in your area, or one less susceptible to common interference (I think that's channel 11, but that's a common channel, meaning it's probably congested.).
* If your router has a detachable antenna, a high-gain antenna may help.
** A directional antenna is even better, if you can place the wireless router in a location of the house where broadcasting in one direction makes sense. 
** Wireless PC cards are available with an external directional wireless antenna.&lt;ref&gt; See http://wifi-link.com/ (&quot;Wireless USB Adapter&quot; under &quot;&quot;Wlan Accessories.&quot;). &lt;/ref&gt;. 
** In the most extreme conditions you could use a directional antenna at '''both''' the wireless router and the computer, creating a point-to-point beam. 
** It is possible to flash a router with the free Tomato or DD-WRT firmware. These allow the user to increase the wireless router's transmit power.

==  Not enough bandwidth ==

This problem is often due to too many processes (or computers on the same internal LAN) competing for bandwidth, robbing MagicJack of the bandwidth it needs. This can be compounded by a slow broadband connection.

Additionally, some broadband services are prone to quality problems. This includes municipal wireless (wi-fi), cellular (EVDO) wireless, and satellite. These types of broadband can introduce latency, jitter, dropped packets.

This topic leads to QoS as a solution. QoS always helps. It's just a matter of how much. Many people will find it easier to jump to the [[MagicJack/Support Resources/How-To/QoS | QoS section]] without spending time to understand their existing condition. Others will want to know how QoS will help before investing in it. The following [[#Analysis | section on analysis]] is for them. Those who jump to QoS first, but continue to have quality problems should consider the following analysis.

In this topic, you will need to understand the following:

# The perceived sound quality of an actual call.
# The measured (technical) quality of your broadband connection.
# Your computer's
## Ambient network activity, when nothing is happening.
## Common network activity, as you normally use the computer.
# Steps 1 &amp; 2 should be conducted under ''both'' ambient and common network activity.
# If you already use QoS, you should try the above with QoS enabled and disabled.

==== Perceived sound quality ====

Test the quality of your voice by using the special &quot;echo&quot; phone number: 909-390-0003. This will echo anything you say back to you, giving you an idea of what other people are hearing (without bothering anyone with test calls). 

After getting an idea of your call quality under normal conditions, perform another test to simulate the worst possible condition. While keeping the echo call active, start a [http://www.speedtest.net speed test]. This will saturate your broadband connection (down first, then up). During this test speak into the phone (count from 1 to 20). This will give you an idea of how badly your quality ''could'' deteriorate under worst-case conditions.

==== Measured quality ====

Test your system's (connection's) [http://myspeed.visualware.com/voip/index.html VOIP quality]. When the test finishes you'll see five vertical tabs on the left. It may take awhile for all of them to appear. On the &quot;Summary&quot; tab is a link to &quot;click here for detailed analysis.&quot; This is a semi-permanent URL. Copy the URL and save it somewhere. You may need it later. 

This page is more useful than the information on the tabs because it provides graphs showing ''all'' the activity. For example, if the summary information says you have a very high &quot;max&quot; delay, it doesn't mean much if it was just one spike, and the rest of the test was very low.

The important elements of this test are:

* The down/up speeds
* Delay
* Jitter.
* Packet Loss.

You can go to [[MagicJack/Support Resources/Requesting Help#Alternative Forums | the user forums]] and request help interpreting this information. You should provide the URL to the &quot;detailed analysis.&quot; However, you should perform the following [[#Network activity | network activity test]] and provide that information with these results. It will give some context to these results.

==== Ambient network activity ====

The above tests will be more useful if you understand how much bandwidth is consumed '''while''' the tests are performed. To do this, use the correct method for your platform,&lt;ref&gt;'''Windows'''&lt;br/&gt;
* Go into your Start-&gt;Settings-&gt;Network Connections and open the connection you are using (like &quot;Local Area Connection&quot; or &quot;Wireless Network Connection&quot;). Watch the &quot;Activity&quot; section.&lt;br/&gt;
* Write down the received and sent packets. 
* Wait one minute, then write them down again. 
* Subtract the before and after values to get the number of packets received and sent in one minute.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Then conduct either of the [[#Perceived sound quality | sound-quality]] or [[#Measured quality | measured-quality]] tests. When the test is complete, capture one minute of ambient activity again (so you have a before and after measurement of background activity.).

It is suggested that you capture ambient network activity (and perform quality tests) two different ways: 1) Under normal usage. And, 2) stop all known processes that consume bandwidth.

===== Quiet test =====

Stop all obvious processes that consume network activity on your computer. (Close unnecessary web browser sessions, email client, instant messenger, torrent file transfers). 

This is a good opportunity to identify unknown (unexpected) activity. Random activity is normal. But, you shouldn't see a steady rate of activity (unless you know you're running something that uses a steady rate of bandwidth. In that case, you should stop that activity prior to measuring your network activity.). If this time-test measurement shows high or steady levels of unattended, background activity, you may want to investigate whether your computer is infected with spyware, spambots, viruses, etc. Or, consider whether if you installed something (like Bit Torrent's btdna) which is consuming bandwidth in the background.

Note: If multiple computers share your broadband connection, you should collect the before/after ambient traffic mentioned above.

===== Normal usage test =====

You can perform the preceding ambient measurement under normal activity (without closing web browsers, email, IM or torrent downloads). This will give you an idea of the difference QoS will make.

=== QoS ===

QoS is a router function to give priority to internet traffic, in this case MagicJack's traffic. It is always a good idea. The extent to which it may help can only be determined from the preceding [[#Analysis | analysis section]]. Or, you can just implement QoS and see if it fixes any problems. If it not, you can return to the preceding section to determine what problems may exist with your broadband connection.

To implement QoS see the How-To: [[MagicJack/Support_Resources/How-To/QoS | QoS]].

== MagicJack server problems ==

The server(s) your MagicJack uses are regional. It has been observed that some regions seem to have more load (oversold?) than others. If you use one of these regional servers your choppy voice may be partially (or entirely) due to capacity problems of that server. Similarly, the network routes (the &quot;hops&quot; as seen by executing the &lt;tt&gt;tracert&lt;/tt&gt; command) may be better between you and other servers.

To eliminate this as a contributing factor, please see the FAQ Answer: [[MagicJack/Support_Resources/FAQ#How_do_I_find.2Fchange_my_proxy.3F | How do I find/change my proxy?]] Keep in mind that you may want to perform &lt;tt&gt;tracert&lt;/tt&gt; commands on the servers (proxy and vms) and take that information into consideration when comparing performance.

== Image questions ==

Hi,
I'm cleaning up images and get confused: you uploaded many images, e.g.: [[:File:Image feature extraction.png]] with Source: http://www.cyberbotics.com and author: ''Cyberbotics Ltd.''. Checking these page, I believe that you meant that you created these images on your own with that software, or?

(Oh and by the way: you should create a [[:meta:SUL|SUL]] account by clicking at [[Special:MergeAccount]] and merge the other two accounts if they are created by you)

John Blair

==What did he do that made him important?==
Blair was a Patriot in the Revolution, meaning he supported the Americans against the British.  He supported some measures against British taxes, but was a moderate, meaning he didn't go as far as other Patriots.  However, he did support stopping importing British goods until the taxes were repealed. 

During the war, Blair served as a member of the convention that drew up Virginia's constitution and held a number of important committee positions. The legislature elected him to a judgeship in the General Court in 1778 and soon thereafter to the post of Chief Justice. He was also elected to Virginia's high Court of Chancery. In 1786, the legislature appointed him Thomas Jefferson's successor on a committee revising the laws of Virginia.  That was because they thought Blair knew a lot about the law.

Blair was one of the men Virginia sent to the Constitutional Convention in 1787.

Blair was a Freemason.  He was named Grand Master of Freemasons in Virginia under the newly organized Grand Lodge of Virginia in 1778.

==What did he do when he was young?==
Blair was born into a wealthy Virginia family in 1732. He went to the College of William and Mary, then went to London to study law. He returned to Virginia and practiced law. In 1766, he was elected to the Virgina House of Burgesses.  He went on to become clerk of the Royal Governor's Council, the upper house of the colonial legislature.

==What did he do afterward?==
Blair went on to become a judge on the Virginia Court of Appeals where he helped influence the interpretation of the Constitution.  He was also on the Supreme Court of the United States from 1789 to 1795.  He died in 1800 in Williamsburg, Virginia.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Business Cycles ==

Business cycles or economic flucuations are the upswings and downswings in aggregate economic activity. Business cycles are composed of two phases and two turning points.

 1. Two Phases
  
  a. Expansion
   i. Time in which real GDP rises and unemployment declines.
   ii. Sometimes called recovery.
  
  b. Contraction
   i. Time in which real GDP declines and unemployment rises.
   ii. Recession - Six consecutive months of decrease.
    1. A &quot;severe recession&quot; is called a depression.
    2. No official definition of severe (length and depth).

 2. Turning points
  
  a. Peak
   i. Real GDP reaches its maximum, stops rising, and begins to decline.
   ii. Determined after the fact.
  
  b. Trough
   i. Real GDP reaches its minimum, stops declining, and begins to rise.
   ii. Determined after the fact.

The sequence from one peak to the next, or from one trough to the next, is a business cycle. The pattern of contraction–trough–expansion–peak occurs over and over again but not at regular,
predictable intervals.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{C sharp/Navigation}}

''Threads'' are tasks that can run concurrently to other threads and can share data. When your program starts, it creates a thread for the ''entry point'' of your program, usually a {{C sharp|Main}} function. So, you can think of a &quot;program&quot; as being made up of threads. The .NET Framework allows you to use threading in your programs to run code in parallel to each other. This is often done for two reasons:

# If the thread running your graphical user interface performs time-consuming work, your program may appear to be unresponsive. Using threading, you can create a new thread to perform tasks and report its progress to the GUI thread.
# On computers with more than one CPU or CPUs with more than one core, threads can maximize the use of computational resources, speeding up tasks.

== The {{C sharp|Thread}} class ==
The {{C sharp|System.Threading.Thread}} class exposes basic functionality for using threads. To create a thread, you simply create an instance of the {{C sharp|Thread}} class with a {{C sharp|ThreadStart}} or {{C sharp|ParameterizedThreadStart}} {{C sharp/kw|delegate}} pointing to the code the thread should start running. For example:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
using System;
using System.Threading;

public static class Program
{
    private static void SecondThreadFunction()
    {
        while (true)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(&quot;Second thread says hello.&quot;);
            Thread.Sleep(1000); // pause execution of the current thread for 1 second (1000 ms)
        }
    }
    
    public static void Main()
    {
        Thread newThread = new Thread(new ThreadStart(SecondThreadFunction));
        
        newThread.Start();
        
        while (true)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(&quot;First thread says hello.&quot;);
            Thread.Sleep(500); // pause execution of the current thread for half a second (500 ms)
        }
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

You should see the following output:

 First thread says hello.
 Second thread says hello.
 First thread says hello.
 First thread says hello.
 Second thread says hello.
 ...

Notice that the {{C sharp/kw|while}} keyword is needed because as soon as the function {{C sharp/kw|return}}s, the thread exits, or ''terminates''.

=== ParameterizedThreadStart ===
The {{C sharp|void ParameterizedThreadStart(object obj)}} delegate allows you to pass a parameter to the new thread:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
using System;
using System.Threading;

public static class Program
{
    private static void SecondThreadFunction(object param)
    {
        while (true)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(&quot;Second thread says &quot; + param.ToString() + &quot;.&quot;);
            Thread.Sleep(500); // pause execution of the current thread for half a second (500 ms)
        }
    }
    
    public static void Main()
    {
        Thread newThread = new Thread(new ParameterizedThreadStart(SecondThreadFunction));
        
        newThread.Start(1234); // here you pass a parameter to the new thread
        
        while (true)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(&quot;First thread says hello.&quot;);
            Thread.Sleep(1000); // pause execution of the current thread for a second (1000 ms)
        }
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The output is:

 First thread says hello.
 Second thread says 1234.
 Second thread says 1234.
 First thread says hello.
 ...

== Sharing Data ==
Although we could use {{C sharp|ParameterizedThreadStart}} to pass parameter(s) to threads, it is not typesafe and is clumsy to use. We could exploit anonymous delegates to share data between threads, however:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
using System;
using System.Threading;

public static class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        int number = 1;
        Thread newThread = new Thread(new ThreadStart(delegate
        {
            while (true)
            {
                number++;
                Console.WriteLine(&quot;Second thread says &quot; + number.ToString() + &quot;.&quot;);
                Thread.Sleep(1000);
            }
        }));
        
        newThread.Start();
        
        while (true)
        {
            number++;
            Console.WriteLine(&quot;First thread says &quot; + number.ToString() + &quot;.&quot;);
            Thread.Sleep(1000);
        }
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice how the body of the anonymous delegate can access the local variable {{C sharp|number}}.

== Asynchronous Delegates ==

Using anonymous delegates can lead to a lot of syntax, confusion of scope, and lack of encapsulation. However with the use of lambda expressions, some of these problems can be mitigated. Instead of anonymous delegates, you can use asynchronous delegates to pass and return data, all of which is type safe. It should be noted that when you use an asynchronous delegate, you are actually queuing a new thread to the thread pool. Also, using asynchronous delegates forces you to use the asynchronous model.

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
using System;

public static class Program
{
     delegate int del(int[] data);
     
     public static int SumOfNumbers(int[] data)
     {
          int sum = 0;
          foreach (int number in data) {
               sum += number;
          }

          return sum;
     }

     public static void Main()
     {
          int[] numbers = new int[] { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
          del func = SumOfNumbers;
          IAsyncResult result = func.BeginInvoke(numbers, null, null);
          
          // I can do stuff here while numbers is being added
          
          int sum = func.EndInvoke(result);
           sum = 15
     }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

== Synchronization ==
In the sharing data example, you may have noticed that often, if not all of the time, you will get the following output:

 First thread says 2.
 Second thread says 3.
 Second thread says 5.
 First thread says 4.
 Second thread says 7.
 First thread says 7.

One would expect that at least, the numbers would be printed in ascending order! This problem arises because of the fact that the two pieces of code are running at the same time. For example, it printed 3, 5, ''then'' 4. Let us examine what may have occurred:

# After &quot;First thread says 2&quot;, the first thread incremented {{C sharp|number}}, making it 3, and printed it.
# The second thread then incremented {{C sharp|number}}, making it 4.
# Just before the second thread got a chance to print {{C sharp|number}}, the first thread incremented {{C sharp|number}}, making it 5, and printed it.
# The second thread then printed what {{C sharp|number}} was before the first thread incremented it, that is, 4. Note that this may have occurred due to console output buffering.

The solution to this problem is to synchronize the two threads, making sure their code doesn't interleave like it did. C# supports this through the {{C sharp/kw|lock}} keyword. We can put '''block'''s of code under this keyword:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
using System;
using System.Threading;

public static class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        int number = 1;
        object numberLock = new object();
        Thread newThread = new Thread(new ThreadStart(delegate
        {
            while (true)
            {
                lock (numberLock)
                {
                    number++;
                    Console.WriteLine(&quot;Second thread says &quot; + number.ToString() + &quot;.&quot;);
                }

                Thread.Sleep(1000);
            }
        }));
        
        newThread.Start();
        
        while (true)
        {
            lock (numberLock)
            {
                number++;
                Console.WriteLine(&quot;First thread says &quot; + number.ToString() + &quot;.&quot;);
            }

            Thread.Sleep(1000);
        }
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The variable {{C sharp|numberLock}} is needed because the {{C sharp/kw|lock}} keyword only operates on reference types, not value types. This time, you will get the correct output:

 First thread says 2.
 Second thread says 3.
 Second thread says 4.
 First thread says 5.
 Second thread says 6.
 ...

The {{C sharp/kw|lock}} keyword operates by trying to gain an '''exclusive lock''' on the object passed to it ({{C sharp|numberLock}}). It will only ''release'' the lock when the code block has finished execution (that is, after the &lt;code&gt;}&lt;/code&gt;). If an object is already locked when another thread tries to gain a lock on the same object, the thread will '''block''' (suspend execution) until the lock is released, and then lock the object. This way, sections of code can be prevented from interleaving.

=== {{C sharp|Thread.Join()}} ===
The {{C sharp|Join}} method of the {{C sharp|Thread}} class allows a thread to wait for another thread, optionally specifying a timeout:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
using System;
using System.Threading;

public static class Program
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        Thread newThread = new Thread(new ThreadStart(delegate
        {
            Console.WriteLine(&quot;Second thread reporting.&quot;);
            Thread.Sleep(5000);
            Console.WriteLine(&quot;Second thread done sleeping.&quot;);
        }));

        newThread.Start();
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;Just started second thread.&quot;);
        newThread.Join(1000);
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;First thread waited for 1 second.&quot;);
        newThread.Join();
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;First thread finished waiting for second thread. Press any key.&quot;);
        Console.ReadKey();
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The output is:

 Just started second thread.
 Second thread reporting.
 First thread waited for 1 second.
 Second thread done sleeping.
 First thread finished waiting for second thread. Press any key.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{C sharp/Navigation}}

The .NET Framework currently supports calling unmanaged functions and using unmanaged data, a process called ''marshalling''. This is often done to use Windows API functions and data structures, but can also be used with custom libraries.

== GetSystemTimes ==
A simple example to start with is the Windows API function {{C sharp|GetSystemTimes}}. It is declared as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
BOOL WINAPI GetSystemTimes(
  __out_opt  LPFILETIME lpIdleTime,
  __out_opt  LPFILETIME lpKernelTime,
  __out_opt  LPFILETIME lpUserTime
);
&lt;/source&gt;

{{C sharp|LPFILETIME}} is a pointer to a {{C sharp|FILETIME}} structure, which is simply a 64-bit integer. Since C# supports 64-bit numbers through the {{C sharp/kw|long}} type, we can use that. We can then import and use the function as follows:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
using System;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

public class Program
{
    [DllImport(&quot;kernel32.dll&quot;)]
    static extern bool GetSystemTimes(out long idleTime, out long kernelTime, out long userTime);
    
    public static void Main()
    {
        long idleTime, kernelTime, userTime;
        
        GetSystemTimes(out idleTime, out kernelTime, out userTime);
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;Your CPU(s) have been idle for: &quot; + (new TimeSpan(idleTime)).ToString());
        Console.ReadKey();
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that the use of {{C sharp/kw|out}} or {{C sharp/kw|ref}} in parameters automatically makes it a pointer to the unmanaged function.

== GetProcessIoCounters ==
To pass pointers to structs, we can use the {{C sharp/kw|out}} or {{C sharp/kw|ref}} keyword:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
using System;
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;

public class Program
{
    struct IO_COUNTERS
    {
        public ulong ReadOperationCount;
        public ulong WriteOperationCount;
        public ulong OtherOperationCount;
        public ulong ReadTransferCount;
        public ulong WriteTransferCount;
        public ulong OtherTransferCount;
    }

    [DllImport(&quot;kernel32.dll&quot;)]
    static extern bool GetProcessIoCounters(IntPtr ProcessHandle, out IO_COUNTERS IoCounters);

    public static void Main()
    {
        IO_COUNTERS counters;

        GetProcessIoCounters(System.Diagnostics.Process.GetCurrentProcess().Handle, out counters);
        Console.WriteLine(&quot;This process has read &quot; + counters.ReadTransferCount.ToString(&quot;N0&quot;) + 
            &quot; bytes of data.&quot;);
        Console.ReadKey();
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;</text>

Negative powers

When ''d'' is negative the set surrounds but does not include the origin. There is interesting complex behaviour in the contours between the set and the origin, in a star-shaped area with {{nowrap|(1 &amp;minus; ''d'')-fold}} rotational symmetry. The sets appear to have a circular perimeter, however this is just an artifact of the fixed maximum radius allowed by the Escape Time algorithm, and is not a limit of the sets that actually extend in all directions to infinity.

(%o6) -3*zx*zy^2+zx^3+zx
(%i7) imagpart(z+z^3);
(%o7) -zy^3+3*zx^2*zy+zy
&lt;/pre&gt;

Finding roots and its multiplicity :

:&lt;math&gt;z^3 + z = z&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;z^3 = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

so root z=0 has multiplicity 3.

Finding roots and its multiplicity :

'''Attracting vectors '''

Multiplier of fixed point −i is a fourth root of unity ( q=4), thus we examine 4-th iteration :
&lt;pre&gt;
(%i1) z1:z^4-%i*z;
(%o1) z^4-%i*z
(%i2) z2:z1^4-%i*z1;
(%o2) (z^4-%i*z)^4-%i*(z^4-%i*z)
(%i3) z3:z2^4-%i*z2;
(%o3) ((z^4-%i*z)^4-%i*(z^4-%i*z))^4-%i*((z^4-%i*z)^4-%i*(z^4-%i*z))
(%i4) z4:z3^4-%i*z3;
(%o4) (((z^4-%i*z)^4-%i*(z^4-%i*z))^4-%i*((z^4-%i*z)^4-%i*(z^4-%i*z)))^4-%i*(((z^4-%i*z)^4-%i*(z^4-%i*z))^4-%i*((z^4-%i*z)^4-%i*(z^4-%i*z)))
(%i6) taylor(z4,z,0,20);

&lt;/pre&gt;

Next term after z is a :

 (-76*%i-84)*z^13

so here :
* k=13 and n=m*q = k-1 = 12
* a = -76*%i-84

Attracting vectors satisfy :

&lt;math&gt;nav^n = -1&lt;/math&gt;

so here :

&lt;math&gt;-12(76i + 84)v^{12} = -1&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;v^{12} = \frac{1}{912i + 1008}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;m*q = 3*2 = 6&lt;/math&gt;

'''Atracting vectors '''
Denominator of internal angle &lt;math&gt;\theta = \frac{p}{q} = \frac{1}{2} &lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;q = 2 &lt;/math&gt; so one have to check second iteration of function :
&lt;pre&gt;

(%o5) z^4-z
(%i6) z2:z1^4-z1;
(%o6) (z^4-z)^4-z^4+z
(%i8) expand(z2);
(%o8) z^16-4*z^13+6*z^10-4*z^7+z
&lt;/pre&gt;

Next term after z is a -4z^7. Then :
* k = 7 and n=m*q = k-1 = 6
* a = -4

Attracting vectors satisfy :

&lt;math&gt;nav^n = -1 &lt;/math&gt;

so here :

&lt;math&gt;-24v^6 = -1 &lt;/math&gt;



&lt;math&gt;v^6 = \frac{1}{24} &lt;/math&gt;

One can solve it using Maxima CAS :

The iterated function can become [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivalued_function multivalued] and the structure of the set is then affected by the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_logarithm#Log.28z.29_as_a_multi-valued_function 'arbitrary' choice] of which value is chosen.

      <comment>Mentioning an inconsistency in the axioms as stated/repeated</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Though I enjoyed reading this page I think that if I where new to geometry and algebra then much of this text would be meaningless. For starters the sigma notation is way too advanced. It could be replaced by what the Greeks used to prove this theorem, a square arrangement of dots. 

I would like to see a more gradual intuitive approach in this first chapter as promised in the introduction. It should be built from wikibook [[Geometry for elementary school]] which is very good.

Imagine if all you could do was basic arithmetic and perhaps solve a first degree equation. What then would make sense to you starting geometry? Imagine how a good geometry teacher might start the first week.  I think s/he would start with lots of blackboard drawings and practical discussions about easy to understand useful geometric ideas.

Any ideas?--[[User:Cretaceous9|Cretaceous9]] ([[User talk:Cretaceous9|talk]]) 14:15, 4 January 2009 (UTC)

I am afraid the problems with this text are worse than that: in section 1.4 where he introduces axioms/postulate, he states his first axiom one way, asserting the existence of a line between two points, but then in 1.5 theorems, he states postulates again, this time asserting the uniqueness of the line we are guaranteed we can draw in his first version of the axiom/postulate. But these two statements are NOT equivalent. Rather, given the first 4 postulates of Euclidean geometry the student should be able to prove the uniqueness, i.e., &quot;between any two points, there exists one and only one line [segment]&quot;.

== How are titles of Wikibooks changed? ==

I'm looking to see if I can help develop some of the books on basic mathematics.  The sections in the current book [[Beginning Mathematics]] are actually about the underlying philosophy of mathematics with later sections focusing on Set Theory and Number Theory.  The title is misleading as it makes it sound like the book is for people who have little or no experience with math and are looking to start learning how to do simple things like add and subtract and maybe eventually move on to algebra.  Another user suggested that the title of this book therefore be changed to 'Foundations of Mathematics' which I think is an excellent idea.  But I don't know how to make the change.  I haven't been able to find it easily looking through some of the editing guidelines, although I suspect I just haven't been looking in the right place.  So, what is the process for changing the titles of Wikibooks? Thanks, [[User:Atrytone|Atrytone]] ([[User talk:Atrytone|talk]]) 06:02, 11 December 2008 (UTC)

:Book renames result of plainly moving pages about, the best method (less conflict and work for all) should be to propose the name change on the book's talk page stating a timeout (&gt;= 7 days) to arrive to a decission, you should also place a notice on the books cover/entry page (to publicize the discussion), if no opposition arises, then you are free to rename it by hand (move page, check what links to the old one and if none tag it for deletion), if there to many page needing moving, ask in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Administrative Assistance]] (pointing to the previous discussion about the name change), and all those tedious changes will then be made by a bot.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 06:34, 11 December 2008 (UTC)

== How do you add a book to the new books list? ==

I started a new book [[A guide to identifying rocks and minerals]] and can't figure out how to add it to the new books list. I added the new book template to the main page but it still isn't on the list. '''Pleas help!!''' [[User:Summergirl|summergirl]] ([[User talk:Summergirl|talk]]) 03:22, 19 December 2008 (UTC)

: I see you already figured it out -- you've added the &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{new book}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; template to [[A guide to identifying rocks and minerals]], and now I see it listed at [[:Category:New Books]]. Good job. --[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 06:47, 19 December 2008 (UTC)

:: The list at [[Wikibooks:Bulletin_board]] didn't include the new book because of caching problems. I just edited and saved that page (without any changes) in order to bring it up-to-date. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 09:45, 19 December 2008 (UTC)

== Stable Versions Extension ==

For those who haven't noticed, the Stable Versions extension has been installed tonight. The extension, which we discussed a while back, allows people to review each revision of a page and mark it's quality. Good revisions of the page will be shown by default to anonymous users, instead of the most recently edited version. This is generally going to help us by not showing things like vandalism to school students by default. The inability to protect children from this kind of vandalism is one of the biggest complaints about Wikibooks I've heard from teachers in the past. This extension should help to alleviate that.

This extension is ''very very configurable''. We've selected one particular configuration, but there are a lot of options we could change over time. As you use this extension, take notes and generate some good feedback. As a community we can figure out what works and what doesn't work, and make the necessary changes over time to suit our style of work. In fact, if we decide later that we hate this extension, we could even have it removed (but I doubt that's going to happen!). --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 23:12, 14 November 2008 (UTC)

:I have had a play around with this tool but don't really understand the use of it.  Wouldn't a vandal just review his own vandalism and say that it's top quality?  The drop-down list gives options like 'accuracy', 'spelling and grammar', etc. but you can only choose one option.  Maybe someone who understands it can write a nice guide at some point once any bugs have been ironed out.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 00:04, 15 November 2008 (UTC)
::No, they wouldn't have access to the interface. [[Help:Flagged revisions]] will be expanded as we get more experience with things. As well note that this configuration isn't final - we should make a point to review this in a month or so and decide whether any changes are needed. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:11, 15 November 2008 (UTC)

=== User Flags ===

In response to Xania's question above, the flaggedrevs extension comes with two new user flags: +editor and +reviewer. The exact uses of each are still being determined, but here is what we do know now:
#You can't review a page until you are a +editor or +reviewer. Bureaucrats can set these flags. Admins can also set both flags (We're probably going to need to add this to [[WB:RFA]] to select users who are trusted enough to get these.
#New page patrolling is affected by this extension. Patrollers cannot patrol pages in reviewable namespaces (main, wikijunior, cookbook, image, subject, template), which basically makes the patroller flag worthless I think. In place of simply marking a page &quot;patrolled&quot;, our +editors and +reviewers can rate the page based on various criteria (spelling, grammar, structure, etc). This is more descriptive.
#We don't know yet what exactly the differences are between +editor and +reviewer. Darklama thinks (and we need to do a little testing) that +reviewers can mark pages higher then +editors can. So, a +editor can say that a page is ''at least'' good, while a +reviewer can say that a page is great, or something like that. If that's the case, +reviewers will probably be related to [[WB:FB|the featured books program]], being able to mark books and pages which are of a quality worthy of being featured.

We're working on it, I'll post more info as I get it. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:30, 15 November 2008 (UTC)

:I know I've been essentially absent from here for a few months but I am quite excited to see this installed and usable. The Muggles' Guide will love this. -[[User:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;'''within'''&lt;/font&gt;]][[User talk:Withinfocus|&lt;font color=&quot;#7A7A7A&quot;&gt;'''focus'''&lt;/font&gt;]] 03:40, 15 November 2008 (UTC)


:I've also been playing with the new tool, and confess that I don't particularly like that it substitutes the patrolling feature (that verifies only validity) to a quality rating system, even more if the poor or objectionable content is just left as un-reviewed. The patrol did serve its purpose and function, and conflicts of edits were made in a plain field were every Wikibookians could make changes as needed. In this case quality of the content will be rated (or at least stated on the review ), and so, to preserve equality, granting the new tool will need to be subjected to lower standards, so anyone can &quot;review&quot; content. Ultimately due to the structure of Wikibooks not every Wikibookian will be capable of reviewing every type of subject let alone share a similar aesthetic taste (this is not a problem within projects like Wikipedia).
:How much does the new tools affect the footprint of the project on Wikimedia servers? (due to the stable versions, reviews, etc) 
:There is still a problem with the patrolled status of pages on the new restricted namespaces, they aren't being tagged as patrolled (even after review), and removed from the new page list (not big problem now since there aren't patrollers anymore), but they are never the less patrol logs and the infrastructure created around patrolling that will need rewrite.
:Another problem is that even if reviews are logged there isn't the same infrastructure to check for un-reviewed pages...
:At first inspection the usefulness of the new tools seems to be restricted only to reviewers being able to establish feature quality of pages (and this only directed to the future possibility to print featured works, this also has limitations since we aren't dealing with articles as Wikipedia does but with specific projects were asserting that the hole project has is pages in a feature state seem not to be available), any other benefits that would exist if the scope of the reviews could be restricted inside projects (for instance attributing the editor status to contributors with a set number of edits to it isn't possible at the moment) will be absent.
:The new tools are new and more time should be given to test them out, but speaking of the use I will give them, it will be district from the patroller function, since there is no way to know what pages were patrolled, I will halt patrolling functions (except that vandalism is in evidence) to dedicate time to qualify and add reviews (stable versions) to the works I've been contributing so anonymous readers aren't given a warning about the probability that the content quality and validity hasn't been checked.
:I think that it is of major importance to address the issue of how to verify the patrolled status of pages, even more than the makeshift solution to do quality checking that the tools permit (ultimately to be fair the tool has to be made accessible to all and that will also reduce any quality checking ability that they pretend to validate, possible solutions were advanced  so to improve this effect, like DL advanced the idea to not base the quality status of a page on the last review but on the sum of average of all reviews made to it, but implantation will certainly not be kick if even possible).
:I dread the backlog this will ultimately generate, if a solution to the patrol status isn't found and vandalism increases we should seriously rethink if this new setup is of any real benefit to us at this state. Without being restricted by projects and a real substitute to patrolling, I very skeptic about any benefit to the previous way of operating.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 04:07, 15 November 2008 (UTC)
:Reviewed pages are not considered patrolled (and removed from the new page lists), so that is fixed, but due to the quality assurance needed, processing pages takes more time and requires a bit more work to be done.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:56, 16 November 2008 (UTC)

As well, it takes more trust, which is why the Featured level is restricted to admins and reviewers. (And yes, admins can flag to any level without adding other rights).

=== Effect on newcomers to wikibooks ===

Ever since this extension was first installed here, I've been worried about the possible effect on potential new members of the wikibookian community; but I've held off voicing my concerns because the facility was clearly very far from full deployment, and it seemed possible that my fears would be obviously groundless once the shape of full deployment became clear.  Further hints at that shape haven't done anything to make me less worried, though, so I have a couple of specific questions about where all this is going.
* If, say, a year from now with flaggedrevs fully deployed, a freshly registered wikibookian were to come to a neglected wikibook, would they be unable to make any of their edits appear on the primary copies of the book's pages since there would be no-one around to sight their edits?
* If a registered user makes an edit that is neither sighted nor reverted, does it count toward the 100 edits after which (with some other conditions) that user automagically becomes an editor?
[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 13:09, 23 November 2008 (UTC)

: With the settings requested for, I think all registered users see the latest unstable revision of a page, regardless of how new they are. Only anonymous users should be effected by the presence of a sighted revision. I don't think the 100 edit count considers whether their revisions were sighted or reverted, which should mean registered users can become editors without another editor being present to sight their revisions. In theory the settings picked should be as non intrusive as possible while requiring a bit of devotion to contributing to Wikibooks to become an editor automatic. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:54, 23 November 2008 (UTC)

=== Self-review, and verifiability ===

I have two questions about the decision-making involved in reviewing articles (as my subject heading suggests).  An associated meta-question is, are either or both of these discussed somewhere, and I just haven't seen it?
* What, ''if any'', are the ethical boundaries of an author reviewing their own work?
: Is the fact that editors can't review beyond level 3 the extent of the community's (generic) reservations about the power to review?
* What is required in practice to achieve page verifiability?
: The paragraph about accuracy level 3 at ''Using Wikibooks'' is laudably nonprescriptive, but I admire less that I don't really don't know what substance it's asking for.  Riffling through some Featured Books leaves me unsure how or even ''whether'' they address verifiability.  Do the existing Featured Books meet the new standards?  [[Latin]]?  [[This quantum world]]?  Is the means to verify the pages provided by the books as a whole, let alone by the pages themselves?

== Using Template:Page-break ==

I've begun work on a Wikibook intended for use as a printed workbook.  Each &quot;chapter&quot; is a page of the workbook and needs to start on a new page of the printout.  I tried using {{tlx|Page-break}} and {{tlx|Page-break/end}} on my print-version page, both in front of each chapter (template inclusion), and surrounding each chapter, but when I printed (using Firefox browser), no page breaking occurred between the chapters.  Is there a discussion or example somewhere that shows how to cause page-breaks on the print version?

:::The problem seems to be that most of the functionality offered by {{tl|Page-break}} is not supported by popular browsers (Firefox, IE). However, some of it is.

:::::Great. I'm also using it now to produce a PDF version of a multi-module wikibook and realized that it is recommendable to have no white space (in particular no empty lines) right '''before''' {{tl|Newpage}} in order to avoid completely blank pages. However, two or more empty lines '''after''' {{tl|Newpage}} are a good idea to have some vertical spacing if there are no page breaks at all as in the HTML rendering of the print version.

Why are there both ''category'' and ''subject'' links in book pages?

but why don't I just need ''subject'' links?
What are category links for?  How are these intended to differ?

:Are you asking what the difference is between {{tlx|subject|Foobar}} and &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Foobar]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;? The first is a template which uses category underneath. You can include multiple categories (up to about 10 categories) using subject so less typing is involved and can make things look nicer. The subject template also automatically includes the book category when used. There is no real reason to use both. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:34, 12 December 2008 (UTC)
== How to create sub-pages or sub-topics? ==

I am almost ready to start a book. But, I don't understand how to create sub pages. For example, 
# If I start a book with a brief overview, and then link to major subtopics like &quot;Introduction&quot;, how do I use *my* introduction and not someone else's?
# If others contribute to this book, adding further sub pages, how can it be assured that they create pages so that they are kept within this book's &quot;namespace&quot; (so to speak). So that someone doesn't create a sub-page that is a &quot;book&quot; instead of a sub-page (or topic) of this book?

I've looked at other books, and seen two possible ways.

* This book[1] seems to &quot;namespace&quot; the subpages by naming convention:

:&lt;nowiki&gt;  :[[Software Engineers Handbook:Sectors:Finance|Finance]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

* This book[2] uses a convention I don't understand:

:&lt;nowiki&gt;| 2. [[/Booting/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

What does the &quot;/&quot; characters do?

Thanks for any help. I've spent a lot of time reading the help materials and I barely understand more now than I did two days ago. Wiki stuff isn't clear to me. And it seems like the information is spread around in different places. It seems hard to tie it all together.

Just for the sakes of completeness. &lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Page/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; is a relative path that means the same as &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Book/Page|Page]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; when added to a page named &quot;Book&quot;. Every page in a book should include the name of the book followed by a slash before the page name in order to ensure its part of the right book and not the start of a new book or made part of another book. Wikibooks has not always required this convention, so that is why you might see some books still using a colon instead.  --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 22:39, 26 December 2008 (UTC)

== [[User:Whiteknight/Visual Book Designer]] ==

I've been doing a lot of development work on my book designer gadget, and today I released a new version of it. I've taken into account a lot of the feedback I got after the last release, and I think it's becoming a pretty cool and easy tool for making new books. I would love people to try it out and give me some more feedback. Some features:

# The tool now supports collections. You can load an outline from a collection, or save an outline as a collection (personal or private). Combine this ith the ability to load in an outline from an existing book TOC, and you have a cool semi-automated tool for creating collections. I've used it for this purpose myself on a few books already and the results are good.
# I streamlined the interface, there are now fewer links and things to look at (they're mostly hidden behind menus). It should be more straightforward to use now
# Added an AJAX editing mode, for administrators only. I might open it up to all autoconfirmed users in the future, but it's a beta test so I want it limited to users who could clean up any mistakes that are made. Once you have an outline made, you click a '''Create''' link to make the book. It will create all the necessary pages for you.

These are the biggest changes made, but not the only ones. Again, I would appreciate any feedback that people get and I would be happy to hear if anybody uses this tool to actually create a book.

== '''wikibooklets''' ==

{| style=&quot;float: right;&quot;
|-
| {{User audiobooks}}
|-
|}
I'm working on the wikibook [[Spanish by Choice]] that accompanies some shows of the podcast [[Spanish by Choice/SpanishPod lessons|SpanishPod]] and a Spanish audiobook for listening practice: [[Spanish by Choice/Novelas Cortas|Novelas Cortas]]. The longer I work on this, the more I'm convinced that the idea of wikibooks, or &quot;wikibooklets&quot;, accompanying audiobooks and podcasts is quite powerful. There are many very good educational podcasts and audiobooks, which sometimes come with transcripts and additional images, tables, collections of links, and other textual material. While the majority of these podcasts and audiobooks might not be suitable for a wikibook for one or another reason, I think there are several podcasts that are excellent candidates for wikibooks. To give you an example, have a look at the [http://germangrammarpod.blogspot.com/ German GrammarPod] and the corresponding [http://uk.geocities.com/germangrammarpod/ web page] with transcripts and tables. (Note that I don't know whether the author of this particular podcast would be interested in licensing this material under the GFDL.)

Currently, I see three basic types of wikibooklets of this form:
#transcripts of educational podcasts or audiobooks
#*although the style is often more informal than in a traditional textbook, this type of material will usually qualify as a good candidate for a wikibook 
#*example: [http://uk.geocities.com/germangrammarpod/ German GrammarPod]
#visual and textual materials accompanying educational podcasts or audiobooks
#*for example transcripts of lesson dialogues of podcasts or audiobooks for foreign language learning
#*other possible materials are: vocabulary lists, exercises, images, links to related material, etc.
#*example: [[Spanish by Choice/SpanishPod lessons]]
#*the problem with this type is that there is no continuous text; I think it depends on the amount of additional material and its educational value to determine whether it qualifies as a wikibook even if it has no continuous text (which is after all provided by the audiobook or podcast).
#annotated texts of audiobooks
#*annotated texts is one of the few areas where WikiSource and WikiBooks overlap
#*for listening and reading practice, annotated texts of audiobooks in foreign languages can have great educational value; again it depends on the amount of the additional material (the annotations, translations, exercises, etc.) whether this material qualifies as a wikibook 
#*example: [[Spanish by Choice/Novelas Cortas]]

As I said, I'm currently working on the wikibook [[Spanish by Choice]], which seems to follow this idea of a &quot;wikibooklet&quot;, and I hope that it will illustrate the potential of &quot;wikibooklets&quot; and provide solutions to several practical problems. However, I would also be very interested in opinions and comments of other users about this idea. In particular, whether there are any related (wiki) projects (I'm only aware of the [http://www.librivox.org LibriVox] site for public domain audiobooks). I would also be interested in any existing wikibooks, which are related to this idea. Also, would a new category &quot;Wikibooklets&quot; be a good idea?

== Problem with Listen and Audio Templates ==

Just wanted to let the Admins know that there is a problem with the Audio and Listen templates on this site. The code is different than what is currently on Wikipedia. I did not want to just do a cut and paste, because I did not know if the problem is with just these two templates or whole bunch of templates need to get synchronized with the main Wikipedia site. Also, does anybody know if there is a version of the gallery code that allows for adding a sound file as well as an image and text? Basically I want to add a gallery of a bunch of images, and if the image has a sound file that goes with it (eg. image of a bear and a sound file of a bear growl) I want to place them nicely into the gallery setup. Thanks. [[User:Zzmonty|Zzmonty]] ([[User talk:Zzmonty|talk]]) 01:06, 30 December 2008 (UTC)

: Wikibooks doesn't normally synchronize templates with Wikipedia typically that I know of. Books are different from articles, so there are different needs here than from Wikipedia. I wouldn't call differences between templates here and on Wikipedia a problem in and of itself. What matters is whether the changes would be considered beneficial to the people who are using the templates.
: I think you can add sound files to a gallery as you would an image and it will work, but I could be wrong. Another option is including the sound file as a link within the description. Would either of those be what your after? --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 02:56, 30 December 2008 (UTC)

:: No, I did try to add a sound file as I would an image file, actually below the image file with the text part.  The problem is that I end up with a question mark icon that I do not want, and the image and sound icons don't line up.  When I try to use the template, the visual aspect is now correct, but you can't play the sound.  The one in Wikibooks prompts you to download something.  The one in Wikipedia provides an interface to play the sound directly.  The Templates just need to be updated.  It has nothing to do with articles vs. books.  It just has to do with an original design that was not perfect.  It was updated on Wikipedia to be a better design, but that change was not moved over here.  At some point today when I have time, I will try to just copy and paste the templates over to here.  Hopefully, the fix will be that simple.  I was just concerned that if there are problems with audio files, then the same problems also probably exist in video files.  [[User:Zzmonty|Zzmonty]] ([[User talk:Zzmonty|talk]]) 11:30, 30 December 2008 (UTC)

::: Copying from Wikipedia can break current uses of templates in unexpected ways. So I don't think its going to be that simple. There have already been several reverts to some templates due to undesired breakage from people trying to copy over from Wikipedia. Changes at a minimum need to be backwards compatible so that current uses don't break, otherwise someone is likely to revert since its less work than trying to fix every usage of a template. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:54, 30 December 2008 (UTC)

:Well, updating templates is a bit of a problem. For example, I'm using the {{tl|Listen}} template in a specific way which includes the graphical interface to play sound files. Thus, if the template itself is changed to do this, my specific usage of the template might break. Thus, it's not just a matter of updating templates, you also have to make sure that the updated template still works fine with all the ways it is used here at Wikibooks. Please keep this is in mind if you are really going to change templates such as {{tl|Listen}}.

(See the wiki text of this page for details of how to generate the two solutions.)--[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 12:25, 30 December 2008 (UTC)

Well, since an IP has changed the implementation of {{tl|Listen}} to Wikipedia's implementation, I checked several pages using this template and almost all of them seem to require adjustments to the new implementation. I suggest that we first discuss whether the implementation should be changed and if yes, we should make sure that all Wikibook pages using it are either adjusted or the reference is replaced by {{tl|Listen old version}}. (Since I finally decided to no longer use {{tl|Listen}} due to the obvious instability of its implementation, I no longer feel biased about this issue.) --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 15:01, 30 December 2008 (UTC)
== Congratulations on starting a new book! ==

I'm revisiting WikiBooks after a long absence and looking at some of the new books.  When I look at them, up the top of the page it says (for example):

&quot;Congratulations on starting a new book!
You have created the new book Open Collaboration in Aging Research. Please properly categorize your book using {Subject}. Read The Wikibooks Writer for more information about starting books. Ask questions in the Reading Room.
Keep this template for at least 1 week to advertise your book. Do not remove this template until your book is properly categorized. If this is not a new book, but is not properly categorized, use {Cleanup-link} instead.&quot;

Why is the casual reader seeing this information that's clearly intended for the creator of the book?

Thanks. --[[User:Irrevenant|Irrevenant]] ([[User talk:Irrevenant|talk]]) 01:03, 12 December 2008 (UTC)

: Good question. For visibility, I suspect. It could be more appropriate to place these on the talk page, but new users might not notice the talk page being created. A solution to that potential problem would be to place the template on the talk page and alert users on their talk pages too (which would also teach them about the talk page). --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 01:48, 12 December 2008 (UTC)
: The information is not just for the creator of the book. Anyone including casual readers can help improve books by categorizing them and the like. Visibility is only part of it. This approach awhile ago replaced the manual approach where people who didn't know about a list for new books didn't get their books listed there with an automated approach that lists books that make use of the template automatically. I've gone ahead and modified the new book template some to make use of collapsing so it doesn't take up as much space and people who are already familiar with the information don't have to see most of it. In collapsed form people only see &quot;Congratulations on starting a new book!&quot; I hope this is a reasonable compromise. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:20, 12 December 2008 (UTC)

::I removed the {{tl|new book}} template from several pages, in particular those that had it for some weeks and have a {{tl|query}} template now. I don't think queried pages (which usually do not even qualify as stubs) should be advertised as new books longer than a few weeks. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 13:35, 15 December 2008 (UTC)

== Box templates ==

I've been writing a textbook and looking for templates to implement textbook &quot;boxes&quot;: the sort of thing that contain supplementary information to the main text, labelled &quot;Box 1.1&quot;, etc. These are often independent (to some extent) from the main text, so I'm guessing that for these, book writers will want the content to be transcluded from another page. The nearest I've seen are the various [[:Category:PrettyTextBox_Templates | PrettyTextBox templates]], but these aren't quite flexible enough (for example, I'd like to be able to collapse the box) 
I've written a template myself, which allows a fair amount of flexibility, but it's not been given a very sensible name [[Template:Code:Transclude]], and I have a few questions:
* Am I reinventing the wheel: is there some template designed for this already?
* If not, I'd like to rename mine to something more generic (e.g. FancyBox, SupplementaryBox, TranscludeBox, BookBox). Any suggestions as to a good name?
Cheers, [[User:HYanWong|HYanWong]] ([[User talk:HYanWong|talk]]) 18:28, 15 December 2008 (UTC)

:Now modified and saved under [[Template:DropBox]] and [[Template:TranscludeBox]]. The latter is a bit hacky, but seems to do the job. [[User:HYanWong|HYanWong]] ([[User talk:HYanWong|talk]]) 00:47, 19 December 2008 (UTC)
== Subjects and Categories ==

Hello again,
Can an admin advise on this please?
*Can new subject pages, (not general category pages), be made, or are users stuck with the existing structure?
*If they can be made, how is it done?  I get spurious results trying to make one with the ''subject'' syntax.
*The number of miscellaneous subjects is quite large and the top level subject list is quite restricted.  For example, there is not even a 'Recreation' or 'Sport' top level subject.   Is there any existing group that is working on the subject structure. 
*Thanks for any input, as I have just realised that I do not understand the subject that I am trying to write about!!!  [[User:Armchair|Armchair]] ([[User talk:Armchair|talk]]) 15:46, 16 December 2008 (UTC)

::New Subject pages can be created - Whiteknight has the templates ([[User:Whiteknight/Simple Subject|1]], [[User:Whiteknight/Sibling Subject|2]]) for that. But, I'd suggest that they be kept to a minimum.

:Armchair, if you intend to put some time into organizing the subject namespace, try to talk with Witheknight he has done some preliminary work on that topic, remember to avoid using the subject namespace in a way similar to the category namespace, my believe is that it should replace the bookshelves that exist (they provide a similar function), avoid creating subjects dealing only one book and try to make a connection to categories, I have created subject pages to categories with more that one book, see [[Subject:C++]], similar problems exist, names given to subjects should avoid conflict with book names and try to extend the information present on categories, with extended information on the books sharing a subject, as you can see in that example. If you have some ideas please use this space so work is synchronized.
:For categories, I have been removing them from subpages and were relevant added what I removed to the book category so categories are crosslinked by the topic they share, for the names due to what is already present I've selected to keep using the prominent method, names start in upper case and the rest is always lower case (this avoids most conflicts with book names ie: [[:Category:Windows Programming]] all pages of Wikibook [[Windows Programming]] and [[:Category:Windows programming]] general and should also point to a [[:Subject:Windows programming]], were all books on the subject are given small description...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 23:55, 18 December 2008 (UTC)

== Chords diagram ==

Hi. I came across [[Guitar/Chord Reference]], which is both inaccurate and frumpy. I wonder if it would be possible to enable an appropriate chords output package for LaTeX, such as [http://www.aei.mpg.de/~peekas/gchords/ GChords], which is versatile enough to handle not only the guitar but also several fretted chordophones/plucked string instruments. [[User:Jd|Jd]] ([[User talk:Jd|talk]]) 11:31, 20 December 2008 (UTC)

:I'm not aware of a way to do this kind of advanced type setting with the wiki markup language. Thus, I'm afraid you'll have to create an appropriate image (preferable SVG: scalable vector graphics) for each chord and upload it (preferable to Wikimedia Commons) to use it here at Wikibooks. There are a few such images already available in Wikimedia Commons, e.g.: [http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/Category:Chords_in_guitar here] but many are missing and you might prefer a different notation. One way to create these SVG images might be to compile LaTeX code to Postscript, convert that to PDF and from that to an SVG image. There should be free software available for all the steps. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 21:04, 20 December 2008 (UTC)
== [[Wikistudy]] ==

During my work on the [[Special:Categories|Categories]] I've came across this project (it's not really a Wikibook) and it says so &quot;Wikistudy is the home to textbooks that are directed towards specific syllabi and academic exams&quot; and it crosslinks pages (I've found at least 2) that are out of scope in dangling namespaces, I would put this project for a VFD vote but it seems to be of some usefulness probably not as a Wikibook but as a navigational aid. So I'm making this post so other Wikibookians can   take the issue under consideration or the original maintainer gives a rational, is it obsolete as advanced on the project's talk page or is anyone willing to take up the job of maintaining this ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:08, 21 December 2008 (UTC)

== [[Use the Source]] ==

I've made an undo that seemed needed and reworded it a bit to be more friendly and clear, this will probably no be consensual, the special problem here is that the author imparted a one sided view to the book so it somewhat violated the NPOV or what I think it pretends to defend in absolute terms, but this work is just in a gray area, see and say what you think of it.&lt;br&gt;
We have already discussed the other issues involved several times, but I think the request made here is not abusive of the standing policies and guidelines and I and others have taken similar steps to refrain BeBold actions (if deletive, contrary to the scope of the book) or just to give a definition of an wanted state or structure for a work, this reduces destructive edits that can be generators of conflicts if options and approaches are not clearly stated and given a chance to discussion.&lt;br&gt;
I make note that no one opposed the stated request since 2005 and that the Wikibookian that removed it did it anonymously, but  I think this case is important to how we interpret the [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view]] policy and what latitude we should give to it.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 05:02, 22 December 2008 (UTC)

== New book doesn't have the hierchical links pointing back to parent pages? ==

I created a new book, [[Magicjack]]. It refers to sub-pages using links like

&lt;pre&gt;[[MagicJack/Introduction | Introduction]]&lt;/pre&gt;

I created those sub-pages by following the link. However, when I visit them, I don't see the small links in the top-left to follow the hierarchy back. (See [[MagicJack/Introduction | MagicJack, Introduction]].).

And, if I visit a page two levels deep, like:

&lt;pre&gt;[[MagicJack/Support_Resources/New_users]]&lt;/pre&gt;

it shows the navigational/hierarchical link, but the base of the link doesn't contain the two components &quot;MagicJack&quot; and &quot;Support Resources&quot;. (See [[MagicJack/Support Resources/New users | MagicJack, Support Resources, New users]].).

When I developed these pages in my userspace (User:Az2008) the link looked different. (See: [[User:Az2008/MagicJack/Support Resources/Orientation | the same page in my userspace]].).

Can someone please tell me why it's different? Did I do something wrong? 

Thanks. --[[User:Az2008|Az2008]] ([[User talk:Az2008|talk]]) 01:02, 30 December 2008 (UTC)

;Update: I found my problem. I created the book name with the wrong capitalization. All the sub-pages were created with the correct capitalization. So, the links worked. But, the little link-back links in the top-left weren't right. Sorry. --[[User:Az2008|Az2008]] ([[User talk:Az2008|talk]]) 01:19, 30 December 2008 (UTC)
:: Hint for the future:  You could have left off the &quot;MagicJack&quot; part, and made your links like this: &lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Introduction|Introduction]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;.

{{Wikipedia|Samp}}
Also known as '''gnush''', this dish is traditionally eaten in winter, often with rice or buttered bread.

There is no one definitive recipe, as nearly every family has its own variation. Some other recipes use chicken or no meat at all.

== Ingredients ==

* 2 lb beef or mutton
* 1½ Tbsp. salt
* 1 tsp. ground black pepper
* 3 Tbsp Oil
* 2 Tbsp butter or margarine
* Samp and beans
* Onions (Chopped finely)
* Grated tomato

== Procedure ==

# In a big pot add samp and beans. Rinse well and half fill the pot with water.
# Add salt and bring to a boil. Thereafter, boil on low heat until the samp and beans are cooked.
# In another pot, braise onions in a pot with oil.
# When onions are cooked add meat and braise until tender.
# Add grated tomato, samp and beans. Cook on low heat for about one hour and a half.
# Before serving,add butter and let it simmer.
# Serve in a bowl with a side plate or buttered bread or rice.</text>

I'm skeptical about the usefulness of a general AI timeline as a section in a textbook. A narrative history seems more likely to be read and digested. This seems like an appendix, or worthy of a link to [[w:Timeline of artificial intelligence|Wikipedia]] for further information. --[[User:Mrwojo|Mrwojo]] ([[User talk:Mrwojo|talk]]) 20:45, 4 January 2009 (UTC)
: This timeline may be used as a reference appendix. The usefulness would be of use once the topics highlighted in the chronology are discussed in the book. This way, we can link those particular links to the text in the book rather than Wikipedia. For the moment, the timeline's just eye-candy! --[[User:Arunreginald|Arunreginald]] ([[User talk:Arunreginald|talk]]) 19:33, 22 January 2009 (UTC)</text>

Thanks a lot for that comment, I'll move it as fast as I can... do you know if the wiki syntax is the same that the wikibooks/wikipedia? One more question do you know how long my book can stay on wikibooks until it will be all transfer. [[User:DJ K-Jtan|DJ K-Jtan]] ([[User talk:DJ K-Jtan|talk]]) 13:10, 5 January 2009 (UTC)

: &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller&quot;&gt;(apologies if I'm intruding)&lt;/span&gt;
: [http://strategywiki.org/ StrategyWiki] uses [http://www.mediawiki.org/ MediaWiki] just like the Wikimedia wikis Wikibooks and Wikipedia (phew... that's a lot of wikilingo) so the syntax should be the same, but depending on which version they are running and which extensions they've activated some features might not match.
: As I mentioned in the deletion discussion, there is no particular rush to delete this. The deletion is more a matter of policy than urgency.
: Sorry you had to take a useful book off Wikibooks. I hope it will be well received over at StrategyWiki and that Wikibooks will still offer you some use. All the best. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 14:13, 5 January 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The tip of a wood bow is fairly fragile, so it is advised not to place it under undue stress (from tapping, dropping, etc.).

A typical cello bow is tightened by a cylindrical screw located at the frog end of the bow. While it is important to maintain tension during playing, leaving the bow tightened when not in use for extended periods of time may warp the shape of the wood and reduce its ease of use and quality of sound. Some players recommend leaving the hair loose but not entirely slack, so as to keep the hair straight.

The hair can be cleaned of excess oil or grease using shampoo or alcohol, although alcohol may damage the bow stick so care must be taken if using this method. If using shampoo, it is also important to ensure that the bow hair is entirely rinsed clean before playing or it may affect the sound quality.

Repairs to bows typically require a great deal of skill, and as a result it is recommended to take yours to a luthier or professional if necessary. For students and others who use inexpensive bows, often the cost of replacing the bow is less than that of repairing it.

Extension methods are a feature new to C# 3.0 and allow you to extend existing types with your own methods. While they are static, they are used as if they are normal methods of the class being extended. Thus, new functionality can be added to an existing class without a need to change or recompile the class itself. However, since they are not directly part of the class, extensions cannot access private or protected methods, properties, or fields. 

Extension methods should be created inside a {{C sharp/kw|static}} class. They themselves should be {{C sharp/kw|static}} and should contain at least one parameter, the first preceeded by the {{C sharp/kw|this}} keyword:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
public static class MyExtensions
{
    public static string[] ToStringArray&lt;T&gt;(this List&lt;T&gt; list)
    {
        string[] array = new string[list.Count];

        for (int i = 0; i &lt; list.Count; i++)
            array[i] = list[i].ToString();

        return array;
    }

    // to be continued...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The type of the first parameter (in this case {{C sharp|List&lt;T&gt;}}) specifies the type with which the extension method will be available. You can now call the extension method like this:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
List&lt;int&gt; list = new List&lt;int&gt;();

list.Add(1);
list.Add(2);
list.Add(3);

string[] strArray = list.ToStringArray(); // strArray will now contain &quot;1&quot;, &quot;2&quot; and &quot;3&quot;.
&lt;/source&gt;

Here is the rest of the program:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

public static class MyExtensions
{
    ... // continued from above

    public static void WriteToConsole(this string str)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(str);
    }

    public static string Repeat(this string str, int times)
    {
        System.Text.StringBuilder sb = new System.Text.StringBuilder();

        for (int i = 0; i &lt; times; i++)
            sb.Append(str);

        return sb.ToString();
    }
}

class ExtensionMethodsDemo
{
    static void Main()
    {
        List&lt;int&gt; myList = new List&lt;int&gt;();
        
        for (int i = 1; i &lt;= 10; i++)
            myList.Add(i);
        
        string[] myStringArray = myList.ToStringArray();
        
        foreach (string s in myStringArray)
            s.Repeat(4).WriteToConsole(); // string is extended by WriteToConsole()
        
        Console.ReadKey();
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that extension methods can take parameters simply by defining more than one parameter without the {{C sharp/kw|this}} keyword.

'''Problem''': Compute the magnitude and phase of the frequency response of the circuit below, where ''R''=1&amp;Omega;, ''L''=0.025H and ''C''=0.4F. Find both of the frequency boundaries of the stop-band.
[[image:Band-Reject Filter.svg|center]]

We use our method of considering the circuit as a voltage divider to find the frequency response:

::{|
|&lt;math&gt;H(j \omega)&lt;/math&gt;||&lt;math&gt;= \frac{V_o}{V_i}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&amp;nbsp;||&lt;math&gt; = \frac{\frac{1}{LC}-\omega^2}{\frac{1}{LC}-\omega^2+j \omega \frac{R}{L}}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|&amp;nbsp;||&lt;math&gt; = \frac{100-\omega^2}{100-\omega^2+40j\omega}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

Let us first consider the general shape of the graph before we plot it.

*At ''&amp;omega;''=0, the imaginary part of the denominator disappears and the response is unity (1∠0°). At ''&amp;omega;''=∞, the quadratic dominates and the numerator and denominator cancel and the response is unity (1∠0°). Therefore, the magnitude of the response tends to 1 at ''&amp;omega;''=0 and ''&amp;omega;''=∞, and the phase tends to 0.
*At ''&amp;omega;''=10, the magnitude falls to zero. However, if we approach this frequency from below, we find that at ''&amp;omega;''=10&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt;, the response amplitude is 0∠–90°, but from above, at ''&amp;omega;''=10&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, the response amplitude is 0∠90°, indicating a very rapid phase flip.

We see that the graph shows exactly this:

:''4: Interview someone you know fairly well, like, or respect because of his or her position, talent, career or life experiences. Listen actively to learn as much as you can about the person. Then prepare and deliver to your counselor an introduction of the person as though this person were to be a guest speaker, and include reasons why the audience would want to hear this person speak.  Show how you would call to invite this person to speak.''

==Tips for Interviewing and Introducing a Guest Speaker==

Let's say you have a neighbor who is a police detective. To fulfill requirement 4, you would like to interview him and prepare an introduction to deliver to your counselor, as though he were to be a guest speaker at your next troop meeting. You also need to show your counselor how you will invite your neighbor to speak at the meeting. Here is how you could approach the task. 

First, have a small notepad and pen with you when you make the call. Call your neighbor on the telephone and ask him politely if you could interview him as part of your Communications merit badge requirements. Explain that the requirements include interviewing and preparing to introduce a guest speaker. 

If he agrees to help you, and now is a convenient time, ask him to tell you a little about his background, and take notes. If it's not a good time, ask when you could call again. Do not be afraid to politely ask the person to slow down or repeat a statement if you were not able to write down the information fast enough. 

Here are some questions to break the ice and help you prepare an introduction: 

*What is your full name and professional title? 
*What are your duties? 
*What do you like best about your career? 
*What is the most difficult challenge you face in your position? 
*Did you go to college or receive special training? 
*What do you enjoy doing when you are not working? 

Depending on whom you are interviewing, craft your questions accordingly. Based on the person's answers, write a brief, upbeat introduction to the speaker. Practice your introduction several times. 

When you demonstrate to your counselor how you would introduce a speaker, bring a couple of index cards with notes just in case you forget some detail that you would like to include about the person. 

Stand up, go to the front of the room, face the &quot;audience,&quot; smile at your counselor confidently, and address the audience. They know you so keep this informal. Then give a brief introduction of the speaker and sit down. 

For example: 

&quot;Thanks for coming today. We have a special guest speaker today, Detective Tom Jackson with the Minneapolis Police Department. Detective Jackson is a ten year veteran of the police department and has solved many puzzling crimes in our area. He has a bachelor's degree in law enforcement from Iowa State University. When he is not working, he teaches karate and coaches Little League baseball. Detective Jackson has graciously agreed to speak to us today about his position and other career opportunities in law enforcement. Please welcome Detective Jackson .... &quot;

The {{C sharp|add}} and {{C sharp|remove}} keywords allow you to execute code whenever a delegate is added or removed from an event. Its usage is similar to the {{C sharp/kw|get|{{C sharp|get}}}} and {{C sharp/kw|set|{{C sharp|set}}}} keywords with properties:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
public event MyDelegateType MyEvent
{
    add
    {
        // here you can use the keyword &quot;value&quot; to access the delegate that is being added
        ...
    }
    
    remove
    {
        // here you can use the keyword &quot;value&quot; to access the delegate that is being removed
        ...
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The code in the {{C sharp|add}} block will be executed when a delegate is added to the event. Similarly, the code in the {{C sharp|remove}} block will be executed when a delegate is removed from the event.

{{C sharp/Navigation|Keywords|global}}
__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The {{C sharp|global}} keyword is useful in some contexts to resolve ambiguity between identifiers. If you have a conflict between a class name and a namespace, for example, you can use the {{C sharp|global}} keyword to access the namespace:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
namespace MyApp
{
    public static class System
    {
        public static void Main()
        {
            global::System.Console.WriteLine(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);
            // if we had just used System.Console.WriteLine, 
            // the compile would think that we referred to a 
            // class named &quot;Console&quot; inside our &quot;System&quot; class.
        }
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

{{C sharp|global}} does not work in the following situation, however, as our {{C sharp|System}} class does not have a namespace:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
public static class System
{
    public static void Main()
    {
        global::System.Console.WriteLine(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;);
        // &quot;System&quot; doesn't have a namespace, so the above
        // would be referring to this class!
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">__TOC__

Telecommuters often connect to their employer through a VPN (a secure tunnel). VPNs make the client computer part of the host network. The problem is, the firewall of the host network may block the connections initiated by the softphone to MagicJack's servers. 

This can be fixed by using the &quot;route&quot; command to associate MagicJack IP addresses to your local gateway instead of the VPN (and your employer's gateway). 

You must first understand the addresses used by your MagicJack.

== Prerequisite ==

To use a VPN, you will need to understand MagicJack's use of SIP/proxy, RTP/vms and administrative servers. You may need to create static routes for all of them.

# Review the [[MagicJack/Support_Resources/How-To/Proxy_Find2#Background | background information in the How-To: Find your proxy]] regarding the SIP, RTP and administrative servers MagicJack connects to. 
# Next, you must identify your actual proxy (and vms) server as described in [[MagicJack/Support_Resources/How-To/Proxy_Find2#Identify_your_proxy | How-To: Find your proxy]].
# Finally, you should review how to identify '''all''' possible proxy servers in the [[MagicJack/Support_Resources/How-To/Proxy_Find2#Identify_all_available_proxies | How-To: Find your proxy, identify all available proxies]].

== Preparation ==

Determine the IP addresses you will later create routes for.

=== SIP and RTP Servers ===

As mentioned in the [[#Prerequisite | Prerequisite section]], you can identify the SIP/proxy and RTP/vms server you are currently connected to. Initially, these addresses are all you need.

However, MagicJack may connect to other servers when it is unable to connect to the proxy server associated with your area code. Therefore, you should follow the instructions in the [[MagicJack/Support_Resources/How-To/Proxy_Change#Force a specific server | How-To: force a specific server]] to find all the SIP/proxy servers you could possibly use.

After obtaining that list you can resolve them to hostnames (using [http://www.kloth.net/services/nslookup.php nslookup]), change the hostnames from &quot;proxy1&quot; to &quot;vms1,&quot; and then obtain the IP addresses for those RTP/vms servers. 

These SIP/proxy and RTP/vms IP addresses are all the possible SIP and RTP servers MagicJack may connect to.

=== Administrative servers ===

As mentioned in the [[#Prerequisite | Prerequisite]], administrative servers exist. It may not be necessary to route the traffic associated with these servers too. 

Use [http://www.kloth.net/services/nslookup.php nslookup] to resolve those hostnames into IP addresses. But, be aware that 

# Administrative servers may use the same IP address.
# nslookup may return two addresses for some administrative servers. (For example, at the time of this writing, render.talk4free.com returns two addresses associated with that hostname.). You should record all the IP addresses associated a hostname. It will be important to route each one.

== The route command ==

There are two ways to create static routes to MagicJack servers. 1) Route each server individually. Or, 2) route all addresses for a first-level octet. Your choice depends on how much control you want, and whether routing an entire top-level octet interferes with your use of the VPN connection. (For example, some private networks unwisely use public IP addresses internally.).

Notes:
* The following route commands must be executed each time you start your computer. 
* You can simulate restarting your computer (clearing any routes you made) by executing
:: &lt;tt&gt;ipconfig /release&lt;/tt&gt;
:: &lt;tt&gt;ipconfig /renew&lt;/tt&gt;.
* You can make routes persistent (so you don't have to create them each time you start your computer) by adding the &lt;tt&gt;-p&lt;/tt&gt; option. (Ex. &lt;tt&gt;route -p add&lt;/tt&gt;.).
** Be careful creating persistent routes. You can wreck your network. Keep track of the routes you create so you can delete them if you encounter a problem.
* You can delete a route (even persistent route) using: 
:: &lt;tt&gt;route delete {MJ server address}&lt;/tt&gt;.
* For more information: 
** '''Windows:''' type &lt;tt&gt;route /?&lt;/tt&gt; from a Windows command (DOS) window.

=== Route individual addresses ===

Using the IP addresses you obtained from the [[#Preparation | preparation section]], perform the following route command for each one:

''' Windows '''

The format of the route command is:

&lt;pre&gt;route add {ip address of MJ server} mask 255.0.0.0 {your local gateway address} metric 1&lt;/pre&gt;

For example, if you connect to the Phoenix servers and your local gateway is 192.168.1.1, you would do this:

&lt;pre&gt;# Phoenix SIP/proxy server
route add 66.104.81.70 192.168.1.1 metric 1

# Phoenix RTP/voice server
route add 66.104.81.75 192.168.1.1 metric 1&lt;/pre&gt;

Notes:
* You may want to create routes for other proxy1/vms1 servers in case your MagicJack accesses a different server due to problems connecting to the one which your area code is associated with. 
* You may want to create routes for the administrative servers.

=== Route an entire block of addresses ===

Using the IP addresses you obtained from the [[#Preparation | preparation section]], use only the first-level octet (the first number in the dotted decimal string), and remove duplicate values. The resulting unique numbers are the only routes necessary to create. 

'''Windows'''

The format of the route command:

&lt;pre&gt;route add {octet}.0.0.0 mask 255.0.0.0 {your local gateway address} metric 1&lt;/pre&gt;

For example, if the unique first-level octets are 64, 66, 67, 71, 207, 216, you would create the following routes:

&lt;pre&gt;route add 64.0.0.0  mask 255.0.0.0 192.168.1.1 metric 1
route add 66.0.0.0  mask 255.0.0.0 192.168.1.1 metric 1
route add 67.0.0.0  mask 255.0.0.0 192.168.1.1 metric 1
route add 71.0.0.0  mask 255.0.0.0 192.168.1.1 metric 1
route add 207.0.0.0 mask 255.0.0.0 192.168.1.1 metric 1
route add 216.0.0.0 mask 255.0.0.0 192.168.1.1 metric 1&lt;/pre&gt;

Note: There are more servers under those high-level octets than just MagicJack's. The above routes may route more traffic through your local gateway if you happen to access other servers which fall into those blocks of addresses. This shouldn't be a problem unless the VPN you connect to uses any of these public IP addresses internally. Private networks shouldn't do that. But, some do. If the above block routes affect your VPN, try routing individual addresses as described in the previous sub-topic.

Is this page necessary in the light of [[Discrete mathematics/Logic]]? I've listed [[Discrete mathematics]] as a prerequisite for this book because of this and other directly relevant topics that I'd expect it to introduce (trees and tree searching, probability, etc.). It seems time would be better spent here focusing on propositional logic in the context of AI. --[[User:Mrwojo|Mrwojo]] ([[User talk:Mrwojo|talk]]) 03:49, 5 January 2009 (UTC)</text>

User:Trolli101 ? That's me !

I've been introduced to wikibook by a friend who wrote a wikibook to document a piece of software he wrote. I've been writing a whole tutorial called [[Cyberbotics' Robot Curriculum]] on how to program the [http://www.e-puck.org/ e-puck] robot with the [http://www.cyberbotics.com Webots™] software. The whole book is available as a PDF and this version was updated as often as necessary during the writing of the book. Now Cyberbotics has the responsability of the book, I'm not in the project anymore. Here is the link : [[File:Cyberbotics'_Robot_Curriculum.pdf]]

I'll be happy of any remark/comment/help :-)

{{C sharp/Navigation|Keywords|var}}
__TOC__&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The {{C sharp|var}} keyword can be used in place of a type when declaring a variable to allow the compiler to infer the type of the variable. This feature can be used to shorten variable declarations, especially when instantiating generic types, and is even necessary with [[:w:Language Integrated Query|LINQ]] expressions (since queries may generate very complex types).

The following:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
int num = 123;
string str = &quot;asdf&quot;;
Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt; dict = new Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt;();
&lt;/source&gt;

is equivalent to:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
var num = 123;
var str = &quot;asdf&quot;;
var dict = new Dictionary&lt;int, string&gt;();
&lt;/source&gt;

{{C sharp|var}} does '''not''' create a &quot;variant&quot; type; the type is simply inferred by the compiler. In situations where the type cannot be inferred, the compiler generates an error:

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
var str; // no assignment, can't infer type

void Function(var arg1, var arg2) // can't infer type
{
    ...
}
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;noinclude&gt;
{{C sharp/Keywords}}
&lt;/noinclude&gt;

=== Learning about Intelligent Robots ===
This book is intended for students, teachers, people that have this as a hobby, and researchers interested in the most intelligent robots. It will help you in understanding what robots are, what they can do for you, and most interestingly how to program them so you can have the perfect robot for you. It includes two parts: a short theoretical part and a longer practical part. The practical part is decomposed in one chapter about the computer configuration and five chapters of exercises corresponding to five levels of difficulty. After reading this book, you should be able to design your own intelligent robots.

=== From Beginners to Robotics Experts ===
Even if you never wrote a computer program before, you will learn easily how to graphically program the behavior of a simple robot. From this first experience, you will be smoothly introduced to higher level computer programming to  discover more possibilities of intelligent robots. This practical investigation is organized in projects for which a difficulty level is associated. You are free to stop at any level if the projects suddenly become too difficult to handle, but if you reach the latest levels successfully, you should consider yourself as a genuine robotics researcher! Here are the levels of difficulty:

* Beginner: no prior knowledge needed, suitable for children from 8 years old and people without a scientific background (see [[../Beginner programming Exercises/ | Beginner programming Exercises]])
* Novice: scientific or technological interest needed, suitable for children from 8 years old (see [[../Novice programming Exercises/ | Novice programming Exercises]])
* Intermediate: general computer science background needed, intended to student from 12 years old with some interest in computer science (see [[../Intermediate programming Exercises/ | Intermediate programming Exercises]])
* Advanced: programming skills needed, intended to post-graduate students and researchers (see [[../Advanced Programming Exercises/ | Advanced Programming Exercises]])
* Expert: research spirit needed, intended to post-graduate students and researchers (see [[../Cognitive Benchmarks/ | Cognitive Benchmarks]])

=== Easy-to-use robotics Tools ===
The practical part of this book relies on a couple of software and hardware tools that will allow you to practice intelligent robot programming for real life. These tools are the e-puck robot and the webots software. They are both widely used for education and research in universities worldwide and are commercially available and well supported. These tools will be described in chapter [[../E-puck and Webots/ | E-puck and Webots]].

=== Enjoy Robot Competitions ===
Several exercises are provided along with this book. Starting from very simple introductory exercises in chapter [[../Beginner programming Exercises/ | Beginner programming Exercises]], the reader will learn progressively how to create more and more advanced robotics controllers throughout the following chapters. Finally, the chapter [[../Cognitive Benchmarks/ | Cognitive Benchmarks]] will introduce the reader into the realm of robot competitions through a cognitive benchmark: Rat's Life
&lt;ref&gt;See their website, [http://ratslife.org Rat's Life Programming Contest]

Bearded Dragons are lizards, in the genus ''Pogona'', that are native to Australia. Bearded Dragons are often kept as exotic pets, especially the Inland Bearded Dragon (species ''Pogona vitticeps''). These pets are also affectionately called &quot;Beardies&quot; by those who breed or raise them.
They are a popular breed among children, because of their friendly and calm nature. 

== Characteristics ==
Bearded Dragons have broad triangular heads and flattened bodies, with adults reaching approximately 18 to 24 inches head-to-tail &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Caring for an Australian Bearded Dragon |author= K. W. Tosney |year= 2004 |month= 01 |accessdate= 2008-02-06 |url=http://www.bio.miami.edu/ktosney/file/BDcare.html#Anchor-General-14210}}&lt;/ref&gt;. When threatened, they will expand a spiny pouch under their jaw and turn it black, as well as inhale air and puff up to make them appear larger. The pouch resembles a beard, lending the animal their name. Males are often slightly larger than females, with a broader head in proportion to their bodies, but females are often slightly more heavily set. Bearded Dragons have a distinctive series of lateral spines (specialized scales) radiating horizontally from the head to the base of the tail. Their color ranges from light tan to dark brown, depending on their native soil, often with highlights of black, brilliant red, or gold, and can change somewhat depending upon their internal condition. Some captive populations have been selectively bred for more brilliant colorations. As juveniles they spend some of their time in trees. Adults are usually ground dwelling, but will climb trees to bask and search for prey. Bearded Dragons  occupy a large range of habitats in their native environment, from the desert to dry forests and scrublands &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Dragons Down Under: The Inland Bearded Dragon |author= Melissa Kaplan |date= 2007-04-19 |accessdate= 2008-02-06 |url=http://www.anapsid.org/bearded.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All species are from Australia, but they have been exported worldwide and bred successfully in captivity. In the wild, the various species are widely distributed throughout different regions of Australia. Bearded Dragons live about 10-15 years with proper care in captivity, though some can live up to 20 years old&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bearded Dragons |accessdate= 2008-02-06 |url=http://www.burkesbackyard.com.au/factsheets/Others/Bearded-Dragons/364}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Bearded Dragons are omnivorous, consuming many different sorts of plants and animals. In the wild, Bearded Dragon live in places that are dry and sparsely vegetated, so food may often be difficult to find. As a result, Bearded Dragons are capable of subsisting on a wide variety of food sources.

Their stomachs are large enough to accommodate large quantities of food. At a young age, Bearded Dragons will not to eat as much vegetation as their adult counterparts. As a Bearded Dragon ages it will eat less animal matter and more plants, leveling off at around an 80% plant and 20% animal diet&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Frequently Asked Questions |author= Robert and Victoria Daichu |date=2007-05-26 |accessdate= 2008-02-06 |url=http://www.dachiu.com/care/abeard.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

These lizards have animated and highly social behavior, mild temperament, willingness to breed in captivity, flexible diet, and a robust nature. Because of the characteristics, Bearded Dragons are popular among reptile enthusiasts as pets. 

=== Feeding === 
Bearded Dragons are omnivorous, requiring both insects and vegetable food. A typical diet for captive Bearded Dragons includes leafy greens and vegetables, and regular meals of feeder insects.

Diet includes crickets, roaches, locusts, silkworms, hornworms, butterworms, and phoenix worms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bearded Dragons Care Sheet |author= Jeremiah Jaeger |accessdate= 2008-02-06 |url=http://www.beardeddragon.org/articles/caresheet/?page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The mealworm has a fairly hard chitin (exoskeleton) and is generally low in the &quot;chitin to meat&quot; ratio, making it less nutritious than other feeder insects&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Caring for an
Australian Bearded Dragon |author= K. W. Tosney |year= 2004 |month= 01 |accessdate= 2008-02-06 |url=http://www.bio.miami.edu/ktosney/file/BDcare.html#Anchor-Insects-23240}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Chitin is hard enough that large amounts of it can cause impaction in the Bearded Dragon's digestion system, and can lead to death, especially in younger animals. Waxworms can be given as a treat, but no more than 1 or 2 a week in most cases as they are extremely fatty, and in some cases very addictive. The rule of thumb on feeder insects is that the food fed to the animal must not be larger than the space between the eyes; feeding something larger could make it hard for the animal to swallow the food and can lead to the aforementioned fatal impaction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Impaction in Bearded Dragons |coauthors= Alex Sleeis and Denise Bushnell |date= 2006-07-07 |accessdate= 2008-02-06 |url=http://www.beardeddragon.org/articles/impaction/}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Before being offered to the Dragon, it is recommended that insects be fed for at least 24 hours in advance, or as they are called &quot;gut-loaded&quot; to increase their nutritional value. Commercial cricket foods for gut-loading are available, but many household food items may be used instead, such as a half a slice of potato or carrot. It is essential that most of the dragon's food (especially livefood) first be dusted with a phosphorus-free commercial calcium supplement, as Bearded Dragons are susceptible to Metabolic Bone Disease (MBD) if their calcium and vitamin D3 requirements are not met. A vitamin supplement should also be applied, but no more than twice a week as overuse can also cause health problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Caring for an
Australian Bearded Dragon |author= K. W. Tosney |year= 2004 |month= 01 |accessdate= 2008-02-06 |url=http://www.bio.miami.edu/ktosney/file/BDcare.html#Anchor-Supplements-35326}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Insects caught in the wild are not recommended, due to the increased risk of pesticide exposure and parasites. Fireflies and all other animals with bioluminescence chemicals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Two Cases of Firefly Toxicosis in Lizards |coauthors= Michael Knight, Richard Glor, Scott R. Smedley, Andres Gonzalez, Kraig Adler, and Thomas Eisner |accessdate= 2008-02-06 |url=http://www.nbb.cornell.edu/neurobio/eisner/pogona.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be fatal to Bearded Dragons.

A significant portion of the Bearded Dragon's diet may consist of leafy greens. Dragons enjoy many types of readily available greens, including: collard greens, spring greens, escarole, turnip greens, mustard greens, romaine lettuce, dandelion greens, parsley, and carrot tops&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nutrition Content |author= Beautiful Dragons |accessdate= 2008-02-06 |url=http://www.beautifuldragons.503xtreme.com/Nutrition.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It is also recommended that this portion of the Dragon's diet be supplemented with a variety of finely diced fruits, vegetables, and legumes. Feeding a mixture of these plants ensures a wider variety of nutrients, and variations in texture to aid digestion. As with insects, however, certain plants can be toxic to Dragons. The Avocado and rhubarb are lethal to Dragons, as well as particular greens; iceberg lettuce is mostly water and causes diarrhoea, which can be fatal.  Rhubarb, kale, cabbage, and spinach contain high oxilates which bind to calcium and in large amounts can lead to metabolic bone disease.

=== Housing ===
A 20 gallon (75 litre) aquarium is the bare minimum for a juvenile Bearded Dragon, however they will fast outgrow this within their first year. For an adult the minimum is a 4ft x 2ft x 2ft Wooden Vivarium with front opening doors,  40 gallon (150 litre) breeder, though many breeders recommend a 55 gallon (200 litre) breeder instead&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bearded Dragon Stats and Facts |coauthors= Drs. Foster &amp; Smith |accessdate= 2008-02-06 |url=http://www.peteducation.com/article.cfm?cls=17&amp;cat=1796&amp;articleid=2730}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This allows the Dragon ample space to turn around, lie down, and run to and fro as it chooses.

Bearded Dragons bask most of the day, absorbing the heat they need to digest their food. It is important that there are at least one or two good basking spots in the Dragon's habitat. Rocks are preferable to logs as they hold heat better, though logs can also provide stimulation for the animal as they will climb up and down it. Any item taken from the outside must first be boiled or baked, however, to remove contaminants. Electric or battery powered heating devices such as HotRocks and Heat Mats should never be used™ these can cause horrific stomach burns if they malfunction and fires, so they are never recomended. A habitat should also include something the Dragon can hide under.

Bearded Dragons also need proper lighting. A UVB light is needed, with two options being available, Fluorescent strip bulbs or mercury vapor bulbs. These bulbs will need to be kept within 8 inches of the basking spot so your lizard can properly absorb the rays and need to be replaced every 6 months&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lighting and Heating for Reptiles |author= Melissa Kaplan |date= 2007-04-19 |accessdate= 2008-02-06 |url=http://www.anapsid.org/liteheat.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Without a good UVB the Dragon will develop MBD and not eat as much. A Dragon needs between 12 and 14 hours of daylight; much less or more causes problems with their circadian rhythms and makes them lethargic and sick&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Caring for an Australian Bearded Dragon |author= K. W. Tosney |year= 2004 |month= 01 |accessdate= 2008-02-06 |url=http://www.bio.miami.edu/ktosney/file/BDcare.html#Anchor-Lighting-44867}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For heating, Bearded Dragons need bright white light during the day.Do not use a red light at night,it has been proved that Bearded Dragons can see this and can disturb there sleep, Under tank heaters should not be used as a Beardie can only feel heat from above,a low wattage ceramic heat emitters are best
If your basking lights and low end temps are correct during the day , should should not require any night time heating, as in the wild they sustain much lower temps than 65F.
If your house is exceptionally cold at night then use could use low wattage ceramic heater..


Temperature is one of the most important health factors. A Dragon needs the correct temperature to digest, so a good thermometer is essential. Analog, Round, stick-on, and other non-digital thermometers do not measure basking temperature properly as they do not measure the actual basking spot, just the temperature of the air or glass. A digital thermometer with a probe or an Infrared thermometer are two recommended types of thermometers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bearded-Dragons.com Caresheet |date=2006-05-05 |accessdate= 2008-02-06 |url=http://bearded-dragons.com/boards/index.php/topic,3164.0.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Temps need to be 101F-110F [basking spot] during day and 60F-65 at night (the higher end of this range for babies, the lower portion of the range for adult Dragons). If the dragons do not receive the proper heat they will become lethargic, and they will eat less. Eventually the lack of proper heating will become fatal.

Substrate is another very important factor in keeping a healthy Dragon. Babies and Juveniles are particularly at risk of impaction and are often kept on paper towels, as they are easy to dispose of and clean up after, and there is no risk of the baby ingesting substrate. Tile is another popular choice, as is reptile carpet. As the Dragon gets older is can be put on finely sifted play sand. Calcium sand is often used and widely recommended, but is also reported to be a cause of impaction due to 'clumping' in the gut if ingested, while play sand will pass straight through a well fed individual. Walnut shells, wood chips, and anything else of that sort are never to be used. They are large, with sharp edges, and can be swallowed. They are not digestible, however, and will swell and clog the gut, causing a very painful fatal impaction.

=== Personality ===
Bearded Dragons are known to be very docile and trusting, yet at the same time, outgoing and curious lizards.They may  make faint clucking noises. If you scare them they may make a loud hissing sound. Their behaviour includes body language such as head bobbing and leg waving. It is not recommended to try and arouse this behaviour, however, as it is territorial in nature.

''Pogona vitticeps'' is one of the more docile and friendly lizard species in the lizard pet trade. Unlike many large Monitor lizards and smaller lizards like Anoles, Bearded Dragons tend to enjoy human contact and to be handled by humans. They rarely bite, scratch, or otherwise attack a human. They are likeable and get the owner lots of attention, especially if you take them out and about for a walk (providing it isn't too cold) in fact civilians have been known to stop people and take pictures. As a result, Bearded Dragons are a suitable reptile for a house with children provided hands are washed after contact.

Bearded Dragons can be perfectly happy when kept singly, and in general don't live very well together if kept in pairs or even small groups with just one male. Keeping two males together above about six months of age is a recipe for disaster inevitably, as they will almost certainly fight, and there may well be bloodshed and even fatality.
In pairs and groups one dragon may become bullied and lose-out with regard to food, so well-being should always be monitored. In poor and stressful conditions there may be minor skirmishes and it is possible, though rare,that they will nip at each other, causing the loss of toes or even the end of the tail. Some of this can be worked around by having a larger tank and feeding the Dragons separately, such as in a feeder tank outside of the main one&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Caring for an
Australian Bearded Dragon |author= K. W. Tosney |year= 2004 |month= 01 |accessdate= 2008-02-06 |url=http://www.bio.miami.edu/ktosney/file/BDcare.html#Anchor-Background-47857}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Dragons may brumate, a period similar to a mammal's hibernation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Brumation (hiberation) in the Australian Bearded Dragon |author= K. W. Tosney |year= 2004 |month= 10 |accessdate= 2008-02-06 |url=http://www.bio.miami.edu/ktosney/file/BDbrumate.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The animal will become lethargic and not come out that often, eating less, if anything, for a period of two to three months. It's often a concern to those unfamiliar with it, as lethargy and lessened appetite usually mean illness. When brumation starts to happen, it's suggested to go to a veterinarian with a fresh fecal sample for inspection for illness and parasites.

=== Breeding ===
Due to selective breeding, Dragons have begun to exhibit rather distinctive colorations. These &quot;designer&quot; Dragons display brilliant hues of pastel oranges, violets, and reds&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Bearded Dragon Gallery |author= Robert and Victoria Daichu |accessdate= 2008-02-06 |url=http://www.dachiu.com/gallery/pix.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The most popular morph thus far has been the &quot;Sand Fire&quot; Dragon, which exhibits a bright red-orange color with black stripes. A more unusual sub-breed is the leatherback, and another of that is the silk-back. These Dragons have reduced or no scales respectively, creating a smoother appearance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Upcoming Projects for 2007 |author= Robert and Victoria Daichu |accessdate= 2008-02-06 |url=http://www.dachiu.com/projects.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Much like designer dogs, the price tags of these customized pets are many times the price of Dragons without a specific morph. 

To sex a Dragon, one must hold the tail up and look above the cloaca, also known as the vent. Males have two hemipenal bulges just above it, creating an hourglass shaped indent. Females have only a single lump. Males are also known to have large femoral pores along the inner thigh&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sexing Your Bearded Dragon |accessdate= 2008-02-06 |url=http://www.beardeddragon.org/articles/sexing/}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Dragons can lay up to 50 eggs a clutch&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Egg laying in the Australian Bearded Dragon |author= K. W. Tosney |year= 2004 |month= 10 |accessdate= 2008-02-06 |url=http://www.bio.miami.edu/ktosney/file/BDeggs.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Females have been known to eat the eggs that are stillborn or unfertilized.
they can come in differnt colers

=== Diseases ===
When provided with the proper habitat, temperatures, and UVB lighting, Bearded Dragons are hardy lizards. They are also pets who do their best to hide health problems when becoming ill (as do most reptiles). This is probably an instinctual behavior, since a sick Dragon in the wild would probably not live long. The most common diseases they get are: mites, terminal ingestion, thermal burns, calcium deficiency, impaction, hypovitaminosis A, respiratory infections, dehydration, stomatitis, internal parasites, coccidia and other parasites, dystocia (egg binding), and MBD.

Anyway, why these are there? Not many people still use this old version, and if they do, they should update to 2.6 or at least 2.4. What do you think?

:Sorry for being late. I split the sections up because it was clearer that way for 2.2 users, and I'm guessing that the reason the GIMP 2.2 image was there is because when it was written, there were still a lot of 2.2 users, so it was kept. But I guess now, since no one uses 2.2 anymore, I can remove it while moving the navbar format in the same edit. --[[User:Chelseafan528|Chelseafan528]] ([[User talk:Chelseafan528|talk]]) 13:47, 18 February 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to the Wikibook on World War I.

This book is intended to serve individuals interested in the subject of World War I, but not necessarily experts or very knowledgeable amateurs. Very little prior knowledge of World War I is presumed, so if you already have a significant knowledge of World War I this may not be the book for you. If, however, you only know the basic facts, or even nothing, about World War I, this book may be for you.

&lt;big&gt;'''Recurrent H&amp;N Cancer'''&lt;/big&gt;

==Overview==
Results of treatment:
*Chemotherapy alone: MS 7-9 months, 5-10% long-term survival
*RT alone (hyperfractionated): LRC 40%
*RT + 5-FU/hydroxyurea: 5-yr OS 14.6%
*RTOG 96-10: BID RT + 5-FU/hydroxyurea, MS 8 mos, OS 1 yr 41.7%, 2 yr 16.9%
*RTOG 99-11: BID RT + cisplatin/taxol, 2 yr OS 25.2%

==Surgery +/- Reirradiation==
'''''Randomized studies:'''''
*'''GETTEC/GORTEC''' (1999-2005) -- salvage surgery +/- reirradiation + chemotherapy
**Randomized. 130 patients, H&amp;N cancer, either recurrence or second primary in a previously irradiated area, no major sequelae. Treated with R0-R1 surgery. Arm 1) adjuvant salvage chemotherapy + re-irradiation vs. Arm 2) observation. RT given 60 Gy over 11 weeks with concurrent 5-FU and hydroxyurea
**'''2008''' PMID 18936479 -- &quot;Randomized Trial of Postoperative Reirradiation Combined With Chemotherapy After Salvage Surgery Compared With Salvage Surgery Alone in Head and Neck Carcinoma.&quot; (Janot F, J Clin Oncol. 2008 Oct 20. [Epub ahead of print])
***Outcome: DFS improved (HR 1.68, SS), OS no difference
***Late toxicity: 2-years Grade 3-4 RT arm 39% vs. observation arm 10% (p=0.06)
***Conclusion: Full-dose reirradiation combined with chemo after salvage surgery significantly improved DFS but not OS. Toxicity was higher

'''''Non-randomized:'''''
*'''U. Penn''' (1998-2001) -- salvage surgery + reirradiation + chemotherapy
**16 pts, pilot study. Chemo/RT given with 1.5 Gy BID given for 2 weeks (to 30 Gy), followed by a break of &amp;ge;1 week, then additional RT (w/ reduced fields, if feasible) to cumulative dose of 54-66 Gy given in 5-5.5 weeks. (Median 60 Gy; pts with negative margins given 54 Gy.) Cisplatin (25 mg/m2 on days 1-3, total 75 mg/m2) and 5-FU (continuous infusion, 500 mg/m2/d for 4 days) given weeks 1 and 5.
**'''2004''' PMID 15093901 -- &quot;Pilot study of postoperative reirradiation, chemotherapy, and amifostine after surgical salvage for recurrent head-and-neck cancer.&quot; (Machtay M, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2004 May 1;59(1):72-7.)
***LRC 2-yr 100%, 3-yr 81%. OS 2-yr 81%, 3-yr 63%. EFS 2-yr 81%, 3-yr 50%. FFDM 2-yr 88%, 3-yr 80%
***Tox: Grade 3 or higher late effects in 38% (3 - grade 4; 1 - death due to bilateral stroke).
***Conclusion: Feasible, with acceptable acute toxicity, but with significant severe late effects.

*'''Institut Gustave-Roussy''' (1991-96) -- salvage surgery + reirradiation + chemotherapy
**25 pts. Chemo/RT given with 5-7 cycles of 2 Gy/day (days 1-5), hydroxyurea (days 1-5), and 5-FU (days 1-5); 1 week rest between cycles; median was 6 cycles giving 60 Gy. 
**'''2001''' PMID 11391587 [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1097-0142%2820010601%2991:11%3C2071::AID-CNCR1234%3E3.0.CO;2-Z/abstract Full text] -- &quot;Full dose reirradiation combined with chemotherapy after salvage surgery in head and neck carcinoma.&quot; (De Crevoisier R, Cancer. 2001 Jun 1;91(11):2071-6.) 
***Median f/u 66 mo. DFS 2-yr 36% and 5-yr 26%. OS 4-yr 43%. Of 9 pts still living, 6 were in CR at a median f/u of 67 mo.
***Tox: acute gr3-4 mucositis (40% and 12%). Late toxicities -- 16% osteoradionecrosis, 40% gr2-3 cervical fibrosis.
***Post-operative re-irradiation + chemotherapy was feasible with acceptable toxicity. (Note: led to the GETTC/GORTEC randomized trial.)

==Reirradiation and chemo-reirradiation==
'''''With chemotherapy:'''''
*'''RTOG 99-11''' 
**Phase II. 105 patients with recurrent SCCHN or second primary tumor (SPT, 23%) in prior RT field. Oropharynx 40%, oral cavity 27%. Median prior RT dose 65 Gy. RT 1.5 Gy/fx BID x5 days, every 2 weeks, x4. Concurrent cisplatin 15mg/m2 + paclitaxel 20mg/m2. GM-CSF on off weeks. (RT the same as RTOG 96-10). 
**'''2007''' PMID 17947728 -- &quot;Phase II study of low-dose paclitaxel and cisplatin in combination with split-course concomitant twice-daily reirradiation in recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck: results of Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Protocol 9911.&quot; (Langer CJ, J Clin Oncol. 2007 Oct 20;25(30):4800-5.)
***Outcome: median OS 12 months; 2-year OS 26%
***Toxicity: Grade 4-5 in 28%, treatment-related death 8% (n=8)
***Conclusion: Despite high incidence of Grade 5 toxicity, results better than chemo alone

*'''U. Chicago; 2006''' (1986-2001) PMID 16213104 &amp;mdash; &quot;Long-term outcome of concurrent chemotherapy and reirradiation for recurrent and second primary head-and-neck squamous cell carcinoma.&quot; Salama JK et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2006 Feb 1;64(2):382-91.
**115 patients. Previously irradiated, recurrent or second primary. Treated on seven consecutive trials of hydroxyurea and 5-FU with an optional 3rd agent (CDDP, Taxol, CPT-11) or 5-FU + Taxol + Gemcitabine. Treated on 14 day cycles with chemo/RT given on days 1-5 followed by a 9 day break. Pts received 4 to 7 cycles. Most were treated at 2 Gy/day or 1.5 Gy BID. At least 70 Gy to gross disease. Included trials are: PMID 2715806 (1989), PMID 1602911 (1992), PMID 7525886 (1994), PMID 9469365 (1998), PMID 10942062 (2000), PMID 15297392 (2004), PMID 15969989 (2005)

*'''RTOG 96-10'''
**86 patients. Recurrent squamous cell cancer or a second primary in a previously irradiated field. RT finished &gt; 6 months prior. RT 60 Gy at 1.5 Gy BID, with &gt; 4 hrs between fractions, given on weeks 1, 3, 5, 7. Chemo (5-FU/hydroxyurea) given prior to 2nd daily dose. Dose to spinal cord limited to 50 Gy (prior + current).  Fields include tumor with 2 cm margins. Treated with standard fields or 3D-CRT, no IMRT.
**'''2001''' PMID 11728690 &amp;mdash; &quot;RTOG 96-10: reirradiation with concurrent hydroxyurea and 5-fluorouracil in patients with squamous cell cancer of the head and neck.&quot; Spencer SA et al. Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2001 Dec 1;51(5):1299-304.
**'''2008''' PMID 17764087 -- &quot;Final report of RTOG 9610, a multi-institutional trial of reirradiation and chemotherapy for unresectable recurrent squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck.&quot; (Spencer SA, Head Neck. 2008 Mar;30(3):281-8.)
***Outcome: 2-year OS 15%, 5-year OS 4%; better survival if &gt;1 year from prior RT. No dose-response
***Toxicity: Acute Grade 4 in 18%, Grade 5 in 8%. Late (&gt;1-year) Grade 3-4 9%
***Conclusion: Feasible approach with acceptable acute and late effects

*'''MSKCC; 2007''' PMID 17379449 &amp;mdash; &quot;Salvage re-irradiation for recurrent head and neck cancer.&quot; (Lee N, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2007 Jul 1;68(3):731-40.)
**105 pts w/ recurrent HNSCC. Median time from previous RT 38 mo (all &gt;5 mo). Median previous dose 62 Gy. Only 1 pt w/ new primary, rest recurrent.
**71% rec'd concurrent chemo; 70% treated w/ IMRT. 25% had gross total resection prior to re-RT.
**Median re-RT dose was 59.4 Gy, mostly delivered in QD fx's (87%). No effort to spare parotids. Cumulative cord dose limited to 50 Gy, brainstem 60 Gy. 
**Non-nasopharynx recurrence and non-IMRT pts did worse.  Pts w/ LC had better 2-yr survival (56% vs 21%) than those w/ local failure.
**Severe late grade 3-4 complications in 11%, at median time 6 mo.
**Conclusions: achieving local control is crucial in prolonging survival in recurrent HNSCC; IMRT associated w/ better LC


'''''With or without chemotherapy:'''''
*'''Institut Gustave-Roussy; 1998''' (1980-96) PMID 9817275 -- &quot;Full-dose reirradiation for unresectable head and neck carcinoma: experience at the Gustave-Roussy Institute in a series of 169 patients.&quot; (De Crevoisier R, J Clin Oncol. 1998 Nov;16(11):3556-62.) 
**169 pts with recurrences or new primary tumors (19%). Treated with either: 1) RT alone 65 Gy over 6.5 weeks at 2 Gy/d (n=27); 2) Chemo/RT with conv. fx RT week-on-week-off, median 60 Gy at 2 Gy/d, with 5-FU + hydroxyurea (n=106); or 3) Chemo/RT with hyperfractionated RT week-on-week-off, 60 Gy at 1.5 Gy BID, with mitomycin + 5-FU + cisplatin (n=36).  Median cumulative dose 120 Gy.
**Median f/u 70 months. 37% of pts in complete response at 6 months. 5 died of carotid hemorrhage. OS 21% at 2 yrs, 9% at 5 yrs. MS 10 months. 13 pts were long term survivors (of whom 12 pts were treated with the 2nd regimen: conv. fx. RT wo/wo + chemo).
**Conclusion: full-dose reirradiation was feasible


'''''Attempted studies:'''''
*'''RTOG 04-21''' -- closed due to poor accrual
**Randomized to re-irradiation + concurrent chemotherapy (cisplatin/taxol) vs chemo alone. Chemo is choice of cisplatin/taxol, cisplatin/5-FU, or cisplatin/taxotere

'''''Reviews:'''''
*'''2011''' PMID 22115554 -- &quot;Practical Considerations in the Re-Irradiation of Recurrent and Second Primary Head-and-Neck Cancer: Who, Why, How, and How Much?&quot; (Chen AM, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2011 Dec 1;81(5):1211-9.)

==Chemo Alone==
*'''EXTREME''' (2004-2005) -- Chemotherapy (cisplatin or carbo/5-FU) +/- cetuximab
**Randomized. 442 patients with recurrent or metastatic SCC of H&amp;N. Arm 1) chemotherapy (cisplatin 100 mg/m2 or carbo AUC 5 + 5F-FU 1000 mg/m2) x6 cycles vs. Arm 2) same chemotherapy + cetuximab 250 mg/m2 x6 cycles. If stable disease, cetuximab until disease progression or toxicity
**'''2008''' PMID 18784101 -- &quot;Platinum-based chemotherapy plus cetuximab in head and neck cancer.&quot; (Vermorken JB, N Engl J Med. 2008 Sep 11;359(11):1116-27.)
***Outcome: Median OS chemo 7 months vs. chemo+cetuximab 10 months (SS)
***Toxicity: Grade 4 comparable except sepsis worse in cetuximab arm
***Conclusion: Cetuximab + platinum chemotherapy improved overall survival compared with chemotherapy alone


==SBRT==
*'''Catholic University of Korea; 2009''' (2004-2006) PMID 19117695 -- &quot;Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy as reirradiation for locally recurrent head and neck cancer.&quot; (Roh KW, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2009 Aug 1;74(5):1348-55. Epub 2008 Dec 29.)
**Retrospective. 36 patients, 44 sites, recurrent HNC. Median dose 30 Gy (18-40) in 3-5 fractions, prescribed to 65-85%. Prior RT median 70.2 Gy. Median GTV 23 cm3. Median F/U 1.5 years
**Outcome: CR 43%, PR 37%, SD 9%, progression 11%. 
**Toxicity: Late Grade 3 in 8% (1 bone necrosis, 2 soft tissue necrosis)
**Conclusion: Effective salvage, with good short-term control; more experience needed

==Pattern of Failure==
*'''Michigan; 2009''' PMID 19135312 -- &quot;The pattern of failure after reirradiation of recurrent squamous cell head and neck cancer: implications for defining the targets.&quot; (Popovtzer A, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2009 Aug 1;74(5):1342-7. Epub 2009 Jan 8.)
**Retrospective. 66 patients, curative-intent re-RT for unresectable recurrence. Target was rGTV + 0.5 cm margin, no prophylactic LN or subclinical disease around rGTV. Median re-RT dose 68 Gy, concomitant chemo 71%, AHFX 47%. Median F/U 3.5 years
**Outcome: 3rd recurrence or persistent disease in 77%. Majority (96%) of failures were within rGTV
**Toxicity: Late Grade 3+ toxicity 29%, mostly dysphagia
**Conclusion: Confine re-RT targets to rGTV to reduce reirradiated normal tissue</text>

      <comment>/* Math Equations */ escaping math tags with nowiki</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This open-content textbook is based on the existing ''Chemical Principles, 3rd edition'' by Dickerson, Gray and Haight. The text is used as the starting point for this open-content edition with the permission of the authors. The 3rd edition is currently available from http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechBOOK:1979.001

Although the purpose of an open-content book is to allow authors to improve upon the existing text, we have established some general guidelines to encourage uniformity of formatting across chapters.

Here is a simple guide to creating the most common types of objects in the text. You can edit this page, or any section of the page, in order to see how a particular formatting example was created.  Feel free to cut/paste the examples into the chapters to serve as a guide to creating similar objects there

More detailed help with editing wikibooks can be found at [[Help:Editing]]

==Regular Text==
Please insert normal text without any special formatting.  Because this is a chemistry text, there are many chemical formulas that involve both subscripts and superscripts. For example, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. Use the editing tools to put these in using HTML codes

Use two RETURN keystrokes to create a blank line for a new paragraph. Please do not indent new paragraphs.

To create a new section, type a section heading surrounded by double equals signs like this: &lt;nowiki&gt;==New Section Heading==&lt;/nowiki&gt;

To create a new subsection, type a subsection heading surrounded by triple equals signs like this: &lt;nowiki&gt;===New Subsection Heading===&lt;/nowiki&gt;

==Equations==
There are two basic types of equations, numbered and unnumbered.  Chemical equations almost always use the forward arrow. This can be inserted directly using a special button located below the editing box. Alternatively, you may enter the right arrow using the code &amp;amp;rarr; (&amp;rarr;) and similarly for a left arrow &amp;amp;larr; (&amp;larr;).

===Equations Without Numbers===
If an equation does not have a number, then enter it in the normal text format, except that it should be indented, like this:
:2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''(g)'' + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''(g)'' → 2 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O''(l)''
Indentation should be done using a colon to start the line containing the equation. Sometimes, it is desirable to use a table to format a complex equation. The table can be indented using a leading colon, too. Here's an example where a table with no borders has been used to align the labels with the chemical formulas in the equation:

:{|border=0
|CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH||→|| CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|acetic acid|| ||acetate ion
|}

===Numbered Equations===
The original text has many equations that are numbered in order to be able to refer to them in the text.  To create a numbered equation, enter it on a separate line beginning with a space.  For uniformity, I have been entering equations with 7 blank spaces preceding the first character.  The equation number goes on the right hand side, and is entered as the chapter number and equation number, e.g., (2-6) for the 6th numbered equation in Chapter 2. Here's an example of a numbered equation:
       CaCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''(s)'' + 2 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''(aq)'' → Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;''(aq)'' + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''(g)'' + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O''(l)''        (2-6)

===Math Equations===
Mathematical expressions appear throughout the text, usually in the example boxes.  Use the TeX language, embedded in a pair of &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;math&gt;&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags, to create these. Here's an example:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{2.5}{5}=0.5&lt;/math&gt;
More detailed help with the TeX formatting language can be found at [[w:TeX|Wikipedia:TeX]].
A &quot;cheat sheet&quot; with examples you can copy-and-paste can be found at [[meta:Help:Displaying a formula]].

==Example Boxes==
The text is littered with example calculations, like the one below. The format is a table surrounded by a two-pixel solid blue border. Use the editing box to cut/paste this into the page that you are editing in order to create a new one in the same style. Simply edit the example number, question and solution text. Example boxes are not indented.  They frequently contain math equations, though.

{|style=&quot;border:2px solid blue&quot;
|+'''Example 15'''
|-
|To what volume must 5.00 mL of 6.00''M'' HCl be diluted to make the concentration 0.100''M''?
|-
|'''Solution'''
&lt;math&gt;V_2=\frac{c_1}{c_2}\times V_1=\frac{6.00M}{0.100M}\times 5.00\mbox{ mL}=300\mbox{ mL}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br&gt;
This does not mean that 300 mL of water must be added, but that the total volume of solution must be brought up to 300 mL
|}

==Figures==
[[Image:ChemicalPrinciplesFig2-3.jpg|frame|right|'''Fig. 2-3''' Schematic diagram of an acid-base 
titration showing the position of the burette and the color change expected at the end point 
of the titration.]]

To insert a figure, first copy/paste it from the original PDF image into your favorite graphics program.  Resize and crop it to be approximately 3 inches wide at 72 dpi resolution (216 pixels), maintaining the original aspect ratio. Save it as a JPG file.

Upload the image to wikibooks using the &quot;Upload file&quot; link on the wikibooks navigation bar (under Tools): 
*Use the naming convention ChemicalPrinciplesFig2-3.jpg (for the 3rd figure in Chapter 2)
*You should provide the following information in the Summary box on the upload page. (If the figure comes from some other source, follow the instructions on the Upload File page for indicating attribution and permission.)
 &lt;pre&gt; {{Information
 |Description=Schematic diagram of an acid-base titration
 |Source=http://resolver.caltech.edu/CaltechBOOK:1979.001
 |Date=1979
 |Author=Dickerson, Gray and Haight
 |Permission=used with the explicit written permission of the author
 }} &lt;/pre&gt;
*Choose the Creative Commons 3.0 license

On the wikibook page, use the following example to link to the image, create a frame, bind the frame to the right margin, and include a caption:

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hey, thanks for your message about the Catullus project.
Sadly you're right, there is no real activity with this anymore but I do visit occasionally to check on it and add some stuff myself.

I would welcome your additions to it, it is growing (very slowly!), so please continue. If you have any questions, leave another message on my page, I'll be sure to get back to you.

PS: Sign four tildes (~) at the end of a message to time-stamp your text. Like so: &lt;b&gt;[[User:Alakazam38|&lt;font color=&quot;teal&quot;&gt;Al&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;darkblue&quot;&gt;ak&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;gold&quot;&gt;az&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;crimson&quot;&gt;am&lt;/font&gt;]] &lt;font color=&quot;silver&quot;&gt;|&lt;/font&gt; &lt;font color=&quot;orange&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Alakazam38|Talk]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt; 20:54, 5 January 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">I am a software engineer from Hull, and an undergraduate student studying Computer Science and Mathematics at The University of York. 

My current project is the [[Scheme Programming|Scheme Programming]] wikibook
&lt;!-- I plan to create a book on Scheme programming.

This will, hopefully, be the home of it until I work up the nerve to publish it to the 'real' WikiBooks. This is my first WikiBook. It will need clean up at a later date, etc.


=== Why Learn Scheme? ===

Scheme is an excellent language to learn the principles of most languages in. It's built with a small syntax, and abstracts the programmer far enough away from the machine to effectively express algorithms and ideas simply and concisely.

=== Why Scheme rather than Java, Python or another high-level language? ===

Java and Python are very powerful real world languages, but they often struggle as languages for learning, because of the extra syntax they have for enabling the programmer to easily access the more advanced features, but in doing so quickly complicate the whole matter, thus defeating the point of being easy to learn.

=== Using a Scheme interpreter. ===

On most Unix machines, 'scm' can be installed. This is a Scheme interpreter which adheres to R5RS very well. At the time of writing, I have no experience with other Scheme interpreters on other operating systems.

To invoke the interpreter, simply type 'scm' at the command line. It is common to write your programs into a text file using Vim or emacs, and then load them in using the 'load command':
&lt;pre&gt;
$ scm
&gt; (load &quot;myFile.scm&quot;)
#&amp;lt;unspecified&amp;gt;
&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== A taste of Scheme ===

Like almost every single programming language out there, we might as well start out with the tried-and-true 'Hello, World!' Program. In Scheme, this is spectacularly easy. From the shell, invoke the scm interpreter, and enter (print &quot;Hello, World!&quot;)

&lt;pre&gt;
$ scm
&gt; (print &quot;Hello, World!&quot;)
Hello, World!
&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

== Beginning Scheme ==
=== Scheme datatypes. ===

Scheme has several datatypes, there are atomic datatypes and compound.

Atomic:
* Numbers,
* Symbols,
* Strings.

Compound:
* Pairs,
* Lists,
* Vectors,
* Closures.

Most programmers will be familiar will most of those, or atleast have an idea of what they do, but a closure is more mysterious. In it's simplest form, it's a function, or procedure.

=== Simple Expressions ===

As we have already seen, Scheme expressions have the form:
&lt;pre&gt;
(&amp;lt;Operation&amp;gt; &amp;lt;Operand 1&amp;gt; ... &amp;lt;Operand n&amp;gt;)
&lt;/pre&gt;

However, much simpler expressions are possible; all of the following are valid Scheme expressions and will be evaluated by the interpreter.

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; 3
3
&gt; #t
#t
&gt; 6+1i
6.0+1.0i
&gt; '(1 3 5)
(1 3 5)
&gt; '(1 . ())
(1)
&gt; #(1 3)
#(1 3)
&gt; +
#&lt;primitive-procedure +&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

We have, in their respective order:

* A number
* A Boolean
* A complex number (A number with and imaginary component)
* A list
* A pair
* A vector.
* A primitive procedure (I.e. something that scm can use in order to evaluate data)

=== Simple Maths ===

We can use combinations of the datatypes and primitive procedures to perform simple (and not so simple) caluclations using the scm interpreter:

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; (+ 2 2)
4
&gt; (* 2 8)
16
&gt; (- 2 1)
1
&gt; (/ 3 4)
0.75
&lt;/pre&gt;

These are, in order, 

* Addition
* Multiplication
* Subtraction
* Division

Each of these expressions can be nested within one another, thus:

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; (+ (* 2 4) (/ 3 4) (- 2 1) (+ 2 2))
13.75
&lt;/pre&gt;

This shows 2 important things about Scheme expressions:

* Scheme expressions can be nested, leading to an important concept, the Substitution Model.
* Some procedures can take a variable number of arguments; we'll show how to do this later.

The first point is most important at this point.

==== The Substitution Model ====

The substitution model for computing expressions is one of the simplest and most powerful ways of thinking about scheme expressions. It can be regarded as the basis of a large portion of Scheme.

In order to understand the substitution model, I'll give you a simple example, the one given before, and work through it.

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; (+ (* 2 4) (/ 3 4) (- 2 1) (+ 2 2))
&lt;/pre&gt;

In order to evaluate this, the scheme interpreter must evaluate every sub-expression, thus decomposing it to atomic datatypes and primitives:

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; (+ 8 0.75 1 4)
13.75
&lt;/pre&gt;

This same model can be applied to extra layers of nesting.

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; (* (+ 13 1) (+ (* 2 4) (/ 3 4) (- 2 1) (+ 2 2)))
&gt; (* (+ 13 1) (+ 8 0.75 1 4))
&gt; (* 14 13.75)
192.5
&lt;/pre&gt;

The best way to think about this is as a basic algorithm.

# Has the expression any subexpressions? 
## yes: Evaluate subexpressions using this algorithm
## no: Evaluate whole expression of primitives.

=== Further Maths ===
==== Trigonometric Functions ====

Scheme always uses radians for its internal representation of angles, so it's sine, cosine, tangent, arcsine, arccosine, and arctangent functions operate as such:

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; (sin 0)
0.0
&gt; (cos 0)
1.0
&gt; (tan 0)
0.0
&gt; (asin 1)
1.5707963267948965
&gt; (acos 0)
1.5707963267948965
&gt; (atan 1)
0.7853981633974483
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Hyperbolic Functions ====

Scheme provides a number of hyperbolic functions, such as hyperbolic sine, cosine, tangent and their inverses.

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; (sinh 0)
0.0
&gt; (cosh 0)
1.0
&gt; (tanh 1)
0.7615941559557649
&gt; (asinh 0)
0.0
&gt; (acosh 1)
0.0
&gt; (atanh 0)
0.0
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Power Functions ====

===== Raising a base to a power =====

Scheme provides the &lt;code&gt;expt&lt;/code&gt; function to raise a base to an exponent.

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; (expt 2 10)
1024
&lt;/pre&gt;

===== Finding the Square root of a number =====

Scheme provides a &lt;code&gt;sqrt&lt;/code&gt; function for finding the square root of a number.

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; (sqrt 2)
1.4142135623730951
&gt; (expt 2 0.5) ; Note an ingenious way to find the n-th power of something!
1.4142135623730951
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Exponential and logarithmic functions ====

===== Exponential =====

Scheme provides a &lt;code&gt;exp&lt;/code&gt; function for raising base &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; to a power:

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; (exp 2)
7.3890560989306504
&lt;/pre&gt;

===== Logarithm =====

Scheme provides a &lt;code&gt;log&lt;/code&gt; function for finding the natural logarithm of a number:

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; (log 7.389056)
1.999999986611192
&lt;/pre&gt;

Note that there is no built-in procedure for finding any other base logarithm other than base &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;.

==== Other useful maths functions (rounding, modulo, gcd, etc.) ====

===== Rounding functions. =====

Scheme provides a set of functions for rounding a real number up, down or to the nearest integer:

* &lt;code&gt;(floor x)&lt;/code&gt; - This returns the largest integer that is no larger than x.
* &lt;code&gt;(ceiling x)&lt;/code&gt; - This returns the smallest integer that is no smaller than x.
* &lt;code&gt;(truncate x)&lt;/code&gt; - This returns the integer value closest to x that is no larger than the absolute value of x.
* &lt;code&gt;(round x)&lt;/code&gt; - This rounds value of x to the nearest integer as is usual in mathematics. Even when halfway between values.
* &lt;code&gt;(abs x)&lt;/code&gt; - This returns the absolute value of x.

===== Number theoretic division =====

In order to perform mathematically exact divisions and accomplish tasks for number theorists, Scheme provides a small number of division specific functions:

* &lt;code&gt;(remainder x y)&lt;/code&gt; - Calculates the remainder of dividing x into y:

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; (remainder 5 4)
1
&gt; (remainder -5 4)
-1
&gt; (remainder 5 -4)
1
&gt; (remainder -5 -4)
-1
&lt;/pre&gt;

* &lt;code&gt;(modulo x y)&lt;/code&gt; - Calculates the modulo of x and y.

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; (modulo 5 4)
1
&gt; (modulo -5 4)
3
&gt; (modulo 5 -4)
-3
&gt; (modulo -5 4)
3
&lt;/pre&gt;   

There is clearly a difference between modulo and remainder, one of them not shown here is that remainder is the only on which will return an inexact value, and can take inexact arguments.

=== Using Variables ===

In order to make your program a little more dynamic, it is often necessary to declare a variable, there are 2 main ways of doing this, using &lt;code&gt;define&lt;/define&gt; and &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt;. The difference between the two is simple once fully grasped.

For example, using define:

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; (define x 2)
#&lt;unspecified&gt;
&gt; (* x 3)
6
&gt; x
2
&lt;/pre&gt;

This shows that even once used, the variable &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; continues to exist, it is defined for all the see, use and (as we shall see later on) modify at will. 

In general, the form of a define statement for a variable is as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
(define &lt;variable name&gt; &lt;variable value&gt;)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Now we will see the use of &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; (let ((x 2) (y 4)) (* x y))
8
&gt; x
;ERROR: &quot;/usr/lib/scm/Iedline.scm&quot;: unbound variable:  x
&gt; y
;ERROR: &quot;/usr/lib/scm/Iedline.scm&quot;: unbound variable:  y
&lt;/pre&gt;

Notice here, how once the block of code has finished executing, the variables &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; are no longer accessible. This is a very bulky and slow way to do this at this point, but it allows for more elegant programs later.

In general, the form of a let statement is as follows:

&lt;pre&gt;
(let ((var1 val1) ... (varn valn)) (&lt;body&gt;))
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Conditionals ===

This is a very important part of any program, as it can allow your program to make decisions, based on simple rules and the data it is given. Almost all useful Scheme programs make use of conditional expressions. Whether deciding if a number is even or odd, or if two strings are equivalent, conditionals litter most Scheme programs, and are a core part of all Turing complete languages.

In order to tackle conditionals, we must understand relational, equivalence and Boolean logic expressions 

==== Relational and Equivalence Expressions ====

These determine how one value relates to another, is x larger than y? Is x the same as y? And so on and so forth.

; (&lt; a b): #t if 'a' is strictly less than 'b', #f otherwise.
; (&lt;= a b): #t if 'a' is less than or equal to 'b', #f otherwise.
; (&gt; a b): #t if 'a' is strictly greater than 'b', #f otherwise.
; (&gt;= a b): #t if 'a' is greater than or equal to 'b', #f otherwise.
; (equal? a b): #t if 'a' is exactly equal to 'b', #f otherwise.

==== Conditionals ====

Now we know how to compare variables with one another, we can start executing code based on this, using an &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; expression:

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; (if (&gt; 6 5) (+ x y) (- x y))
11
&lt;/pre&gt;

This code is very simple to understand; if the first expression is #t (i.e. true), then evaluate the second expression, otherwise evaluate the third.

In general, an if expression has the form:

&lt;pre&gt;
(if (&lt;Predicate&gt;) (&lt;Body for True&gt;) (&lt;Body for False&gt;))
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Szegedin Goulash'''
{{recipesummary|Main dishes|4 - 6|prep: 30 min., cooking: 70 min|1}}

Originally, goulash was a shepherd's stew of the Magyars, a people living in Eastern Europe, mainly in the Pannonian plains of Hungary. From there, it started its triumphal march into the world.
In Hungary, the term &quot;goulash&quot; is used for soups containing solid ingredients such as noodles, vegetables, or meat cubes. What the rest of the world calls &quot;goulash&quot;, in Hungary is called &quot;paprikas&quot; or &quot;pörkölt&quot;.

Goulash is a ragout that can be prepared in innumerable varieties with pork, beef, lamb, veal and even horse meat. Beside the meat, which is cut into cubes, onions, garlic and paprika are further important ingredients. Paprika is the spice that ads specific taste and colour to the dish. Most varieties have in common that the goulash is braised slowly and in large quantities. Frequent reheating is said to improve the taste of goulash. The variety I am going to present in the recipe below is the so called Szegedin Goulash. It is a variety in which sauerkraut and sour cream are added to the ingredients mentioned above. Most people believe that the name &quot;Szegedin Goulash&quot; derives from Szeged, a town in Hungary. But in fact, the Hungarian name &quot;Székély goulash&quot; comes from Jozsef Székély, a Hungarian journalist and poet who lived from 1825 to 1895.

I owe my first encounter with the Szegedin Goulash to my mother-in-law's cookbook. My mother-in-law originated from Bohemia and got married to a merchant in Hamburg, where she lived for the rest of her life. As a young woman, she brought all the recipes from her homeland to provide her with some comfort in what some people would call &quot;the Rough North&quot;. Bohemian cooking to a great extent consists of the Austrian-Hungarian cuisine. 

As my mother-in-law was a dedicated and very good cook, both her friends - she was a generous host - and her family praised her delicious cooking. Being tired of the frequent recipe questions about her meals, she decided one day to create her own family cookbook as a gift to her four children. She gathered the most successful recipes she had cooked during her long experience as a housewife and cook, and there were many of them! The first step was to give the cookbook a structure and to divide the recipes into various chapters such as &quot;starters&quot;, &quot;main dishes&quot;, or &quot;children's party&quot;.  She took some of the recipes from various magazines, simply copied them and added to her collection. But most of the recipes she had to write down out of her memory or she had to cook them again. This turned out to be quite challenging, for she actually was a rather intuitive cook. For the first time in her life, she had to pay attention to weighing, measuring and counting accurately all of the ingredients she would use for a meal. The result was a wonderful and very personal cookbook, which for the most part is handwritten. Thus, with &quot;Mamis Schmankerln&quot;, as my mother-in-law called her cookbook, she left a unique and unforgettable heritage to both her children and their spouses.

The Szegedin Goulash, one of her favourites, has also become a &quot;winter-favourite&quot; for all members of our own family. The following recipe is taken from this cookbook but it is slightly modified.

[[image:Bon_appetit_goulash.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Media:Bon_appetit_goulash.jpg|actual size]]]]

===Ingredients===

* 600 g  pork shoulder, cut into bite-sized cubes
* 700 g  sauerkraut
* 1      large onion, finely chopped
* 100 g  lard
* 1 - 2  tbsp. tomato purée
* 1 1/2  tsp. paprika
* 1 - 2  garlic cloves, finely chopped
* 2      bay leaves
* 125 ml sour cream
* salt, freshly ground pepper
* water or beef stock

serves 4 - 6


===Procedure===

Heat the lard in a casserole, add the pork and sauté it for about 3 minutes. Take out the pork and set it aside on a plate. Put the finely chopped onions into the casserole and fry until they become golden brown. Stir in the tomato purée and paprika, and add some water or stock. Then add the meat, bay leaves and garlic; pour in more water or stock and season with salt and pepper. Reduce the heat and cook all for about 70 minutes. Add the sauerkraut after about 30 minutes. 
Uncooked sauerkraut is supposed to be very healthy because it contains many vitamins. To preserve the vitamins, I recommend to set aside 1/5 of the sauerkraut and to just add it by the end of the cooking process. 
Finally, add the sour cream, mix it thoroughly with the goulash and serve it on warm plates.

A good side dish for the Szegedin Goulash are boiled potatoes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
This is another approach for a horizontal file tab menu.

== Approach: Use a binding with a relevant attribute and the CSS-3  &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;:enabled&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;:disabled&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; pseudo classes ==

This example uses an instance to record which tab is currently selected. In conjunction with a binding with a relevant attribute it is possible to use the CSS-3 &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;:enabled&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&lt;b&gt;:disabled&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/code&gt; pseudo classes to highlight the selected tab. The relevant condition is the &lt;code&gt;selected&lt;/code&gt; attribute of a tab. The triggers refer to the instance. If a tab in the instance has a &lt;code&gt;selected&lt;/code&gt; attribute set to &quot;true&quot; the corresponding trigger is &quot;enabled&quot; the other triggers are disabled (and by default not visible). They are made visible in the CSS statement for the disabled triggers.
Two additional lines are needed in the case statements to toggle the &lt;code&gt;selected&lt;/code&gt; attribute in the instance for each tab. The two events &quot;xforms-select&quot; and &quot;xforms-deselect&quot; are used to set the values.

&lt;font color=&quot;red&quot;&gt;Note: This approach is only tested with Firefox 3.0 and the Mozilla XForms Plugin 0.8.6ff3.&lt;/font&gt;

Note that this example is based on the [[XForms/Horizontal File Tab Menu Highlighted|Horizontal File Tab Menu Highlighted]] example but uses a trigger, menu and events to toggle the tabs instead.

&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Discussion ==
The selected file-tab should highlight in a light grey. Setting the &lt;code&gt;selected&lt;/code&gt; attribute of a tab to &quot;true&quot; in the instance, highlights the tab on page load. The corresponding selected attribute of the case should be set accordingly.
Some additional code is needed to simulate the toggeling of the triggers. 
A better approach would be to have a build in mechanism doing something similar.

{{programming language|c|3|category=}}
{{programming language|c|4|category=}}
Placing the {{tlx|programming language}} userbox template on your user page automatically lists you in the category system under the corresponding category so that other users may find you based on your skills.  See below for details on the template's use as well as a list of the languages supported.  

You can place a box around all your userboxes by putting {{tlx|userboxtop}} above them and {{tlx|userboxbottom}} below them, though the programming userboxes will automatically float to the right side of the page by default and need no box to enclose them.
{{clear}}

==Usage==
&lt;pre&gt;
{{programming language|c|4}}
&lt;/pre&gt;
Copy and paste the example code above, and replace &quot;c&quot; with the desired language's code and &quot;4&quot; with one of the following characters representing your proficiency level:&lt;br /&gt;
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Level
! Description
|- style=&quot;vertical-align: top;&quot;
! 1
| This user is a beginning coder in this language.
|- style=&quot;vertical-align: top;&quot;
! 2
| This user is an intermediate coder in this language.
|- style=&quot;vertical-align: top;&quot;
! 3
| This user is an advanced coder in this language.
|-  style=&quot;vertical-align: top;&quot;
! 4
| This user is an expert coder in this language.
|}

==Customizing format==
It is possible to customize the behavior and appearance of the template with the following override parameters (for example, &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{programming language|c|4|align=left}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;).
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! align
| Set the alignment on the page. Possible values are left, center, and right (default). This also sets appropriate clearing, so that the boxes will stack automatically in that position (you can override this with the &quot;css-box&quot; override below).
|-
! css-box
| Apply arbitrary [[w:CSS|CSS]] to the box.
|-
! css-left
| Apply arbitrary [[w:CSS|CSS]] to the left cell.
|-
! css-right
| Apply arbitrary [[w:CSS|CSS]] to the right (main) cell.
|-
! category
| Setting this parameter to empty (&lt;code&gt;category=&lt;/code&gt;) displays the language box without categorizing the page. For the opposite effect&amp;mdash;categorizing the page without displaying the box, see the {{nowrap|{{tlx|Programming language/category}}}} template.
|}

      <text xml:space="preserve">This template has an error in the coding; the border attribute in the table line needs to be rewritten as a style property within its style expression.   When this is done, the failure to centre the drop box will be corrected; the invalid border attribute blocks the align attribute that follows it at present.

On addition, to clear the newly added show/hide text the navhead styles need to include a padding-right property of 3em to make sure that long headings clear that text.  This means that its all-round padding of 5px is best removed.  

I have tried to change these points but the template refuses to be modified by me.   Perhaps it is to do with flagged revisions.  Needless to say, as the author in another name I am a bit concerned by this.

On review please make sure that the changes are made.   I thank you, [[User:Repairman|Repairman]] ([[User talk:Repairman|talk]]) 16:08, 6 January 2009 (UTC)

::In addition to anything else, the margin entry for the table line prevented the align to centre.   I have removed the margin entry without incident, and the centering is now OK.   Apparently the margin style overrides the attribute for alignment.   An additional problem noted today is that a gallery within a drop box will not center even when the attribute in the gallery is specified as such; there must be a style override somewhere; perhaps in the stylesheet?.
