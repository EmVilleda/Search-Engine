      <text xml:space="preserve">I am quite active in wikiversity. [[v:User:JoliePA]]

I am editing two books
== [[US_History]]==

from the [[US_History/Contents/Preface]]

&quot;This textbook is based initially on the College Entrance Examination Board test in Advanced Placement United States History. This seems to be the best reference on which to build a textbook, since it is a standard on the subject and covers what most U.S. history students study in high school and college. 

It has been reorganized and re-edited in Nov 2008 to better meet the content and organization that the college board has defined for a course in AP U.S. History.  The content of the book was carefully chosen for NPOV, significance and interest.  We are very interested in the success of the book and any feedback and improvments would be greatly appreciated.

Enjoy!
AP Course Description http://www.collegeboard.com/student/testing/ap/history_us/topics_1_9.html?ushist&quot;

== [[River_Fishing]] ==

from the [[RiverFishing/Introduction]]

Recreational fishing might be one of the most popular widely intensively studied learning experiences that Americans (and indeed many other nationalities) participate in.  According to the American Sportfishing Association nearly 40 million angler generate 45 billion dollars in sales with perhaps an total contribution of 125 billinod dollars to the US economy.

A definite portion of this is funneled into guides, magazines, and other learning experiences for the many americans that seek improvement in the activity of catching a fish on a hook (angling.)

It is then with pleasure that I begin the process of defining one of my most intensive learning effort.  I look forward to and hope for collaboration from the many Americans whom have superior knowledge in the recreational activity.  

Fishing has so many different forms, waters and specialties.  Many I am unfamiliar with.  I do though have some knowledge and experience angling for many different kinds of fish in Eastern (US) rivers.  Despite the apparent ease of not needing expanisive water craft, or the complexities of fly casting and downrigger trolling; river fishing has its own mystique and difficulty.  I hope to document some of what I have learned.

If there is any urgent needs for this project, it is definitely for experience in larger waters.  Having defined a river, as 'big enough to support a diverse gamefish population', my experiences definitely are with smaller waters than the major rivers of the United States.

I thank you for your curiousity and invite you to ask questions and post comments, questions and content as much as you are able.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Regulation'''

== Objectives for Government Intervention ==
There are many different objectives that governments might pursue by way of intervention in private markets.  These objectives fall under a few broad categories that characterize many of the efforts at government regulation.  The following are some of the more commonly observed regulatory objectives.

=== Maximize social welfare ===

Among the most common set of objectives for government regulatory policy is the maximization of social welfare through the remediation of various types of [[w:market failure|market failure]].  For example, agents can gain [[w:market power|market power]] through the creation of monopolies, cartels, or other forms of organization that limit the benefits from competitive markets and trade.  [[w:Natural monopoly|Natural monopolies]] are one such type of market failure that has been prevalent throughout the historical development of transportation networks, often due to the high fixed costs of developing infrastructure.

[[w:Externality|Externalities]] are another common type of market failure that can justify regulatory intervention.  Regulatory efforts toward externalities often focus on negative externalities.  For example, in the context of transportation many modes experience congestion where prices as a means of rationing capacity are absent.  Likewise, the consumption of energy often leads to emission of pollutants which, when unpriced, can lead to undesirable outcomes.  [[Transportation Economics/Positive externalities|Positive types of externalities]] are also possible and can in some situations justify government intervention.  For example, in systems where [[w:Network effects|Network effects]] are present, government may be able to increase social welfare by speeding up the growth of the network so that it serves a large number of users.

Other types of market failure justifications for intervention involve the provision of certain [[w:public good|public goods]] (a classic example being national defense) and the remediation of some types of [[w:information asymmetry|information asymmetry]].

=== Macro-economic objectives ===
A second set of objectives that are pursued primarily by national governments revolve around [[w:macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] performance.  Macroeconomic objectives include efforts to control [[w:inflation|inflation]], for example through the adoption of [[w:monetary policy|monetary policy]].  They also include efforts to counteract the effects of economic cycles, for example by adopting policies to maintain employment during periods of [[w:recession|recession]].  Some governments may also seek to actively control their country's [[w:balance of payments|balance of payments]] through the use of policies aimed at promoting or discouraging exports or imports (e.g. through tariffs and subsidies).

=== Socio-economic objectives ===
Government may also intervene in order to promote a range of socio-economic objectives.  Many of these objectives may be motivated by concerns over fairness, such as efforts to achieve a desired income distribution, or a desire to provide a basic standard of service to all citizens, such as programs that offer mobility to people with mental or physical disabilities.  Other interventions may be designed to promote safety where it is thought that market participants are unable to account for certain types of risk.  An example of this in the United States is the [[w:U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission|Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC)]], an agency that has the authority to regulate the sale and manufacture of thousands of consumer products.  Still other socio-economic objectives may include things like [[w:industrial policy|industrial policy]], where governments intervene to promote certain sectors of the economy, or even to promote individual industries or firms.

=== Other objectives ===
Apart from the three categories of objectives for intervention listed above, governments may intervene for other reasons broadly related to national interests.  Some interventions are undertaken to promote national unity, such as the construction of the [[w:First Transcontinental Railroad|Transcontinental Railroad]] in the US during the Civil War.  The provision of national defense which, as noted above is an important type of public good, is almost universally seen as grounds for government intervention.  Finally, some interventions are undertaken in order to promote national prestige.  Efforts in many world cities and their respective countries to attract the summer or winter [[w:Olympic Games|Olympic Games]], which may often involve the development of expensive new infrastructure projects, might fall into this category.

== Instruments of Government Intervention ==
Governments have many different instruments of intervention at their disposal in order to pursue the types of objectives outlined in the previous section.  These may range in scope from simple instruments such as exhortation and information provision to actual ownership and operation of enterprises in certain industries.  [[w:Regulation|Regulation]] is among these instruments and will be introduced in the context of some of the more common instruments of intervention.

=== Moral suasion ===

[[Image:Ride with hitler.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Here, government attempts to affect user choice through propaganda.]]

* speeches, conferences, information,
* advisory and consulting bodies,
* studies/research
* reorganizing agencies
Governments and politicians may influence policy outcomes in ways that involve little or no direct expenditure or regulatory action.  The provision of information by itself may sometimes be enough to influence desired outcomes.  Public speeches and [[w:Advice (opinion)|exhortation]] may sometimes be used as a way to influence support for a particular policy.  For example, the US Vice President Joe Biden, a former senator from the state of Delaware, frequently commutes to Washington, D.C. by rail on [[w:Amtrak|Amtrak]], the national passenger rail service.  He often uses public speaking engagements to tout the benefits of Amtrak and to encourage support, both through actual patronage of the system and through support for [http://www.cnn.com/2009/POLITICS/03/13/biden.amtrak/index.html additional public spending].

The use of exhortation to influence policy outcomes is one example of a set of policy instruments collectively referred to as &lt;i&gt;moral suasion&lt;/i&gt;.  Moral suasion strategies may rely on a variety of mechanisms in order to enhance policy success, but they tend to have common elements of the use of persuasion (such as appealing to moral authority or community spirit), as opposed to outright coercion, in order to achieve desired outcomes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=&quot;moral suasion&quot; | publisher=Encyclopedia.com | date=2006 | work=A Dictionary of Business and Management | url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O18-moralsuasion.html | accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Several prominent examples of the use moral suasion appeared in the US during World War II.  The US government used several types of propaganda appealing to citizens' sense of patriotism in order to mobilize resources for the war effort.  Posters were issued by the government and distributed throughout the country to promote programs such as the planting of [[w:Victory garden|victory gardens]] and investment in [[w:War bond#United States|war bonds]].  The propaganda poster to the right, promoted the conservation of energy through voluntary carpooling (referred to in the poster as &quot;car-sharing&quot;) during WWII, appealing to citizens with the phrase &lt;i&gt;&quot;When you ride alone, you ride with Hitler!&quot;&lt;/i&gt;. 


In addition to exhortation, several other types of instruments of moral suasion are frequently used.  These include the promotion of research, organization of academic or professional conferences on a given topic, the establishment of advisory and consulting bodies, and the reorganization of existing agencies.  Where regulatory bodies are involved, the threat of regulation (if not actual use) can sometimes be used in order to achieve compliance.  While moral suasion in general does not serve as a good substitute for more direct economic incentives, it can complement other types of policy instruments in order to increase the chances of policy success.  Romans&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Romans | first=J.T. | year=1966 | month=December | title=Moral suasion as an instrument of economic policy | journal=The American Economic Review | volume=56 | issue=5 | pages=1220-1226 | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1815305 | accessdate=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; identifies two necessary conditions for the success of a moral suasion policy:

# The public must support the government's position
# The populations to be persuaded must be small 

&lt;!-- Green campaigns --&gt;

Recent successful efforts to promote recycling and discourage smoking include large elements of moral suasion.

=== Government expenditures ===
One of the more common methods of government intervention is to provide direct expenditures in order to ensure the production of goods considered socially beneficial.  Government expenditures may be justified on the grounds that they promote the provision of public goods or quasi-private goods that have some public good aspects, such as education.  [[w:Grant (money)|Grants]] and [[w:Subsidy|subsidies]] may be used to encourage the production of a good by public or private sector.  Often these instruments are combined with the direct public provision of facilities.  For example, the US federal government makes grants to state and local governments for the provision of highway and public transit networks, payed for largely with revenues from the [[w:Highway Trust Fund|Highway Trust Fund]].  In most cases, the recipients of these funds are public entities that build and maintain these networks.  A common rationale for the public provision of these networks is that they display characteristics of [[w:Natural monopoly|natural monopolies]].

=== Regulation - economic and other regulation; ===
Governments may also reserve the right to regulate certain activities for economic, social or other purposes.  In the transportation sector, for example, many industries have market structures that inherently limit entry and can lead to [[w:Market concentration|concentration]] or monopoly (e.g. railroads, airlines).  Rather than provide these services directly, many governments have chosen instead to maintain private provision, subject to some form of regulation.  Some examples of these will be provided in the next section.  In the US, the power to regulate transportation derives mostly from the [[w:Commerce Clause|Commerce Clause]] of the US Constitution. 

There are many instruments that governments may use in order to implement and enforce regulation.  Most government regulatory bodies promulgate rules or guidelines in order to set standards of firm behavior in a regulated industry.  Fines and penalties may be used as tools of compliance in order to punish violations of established rules.  In the context of international trade, where [[w:Sovereign state|sovereign]] nations may have no formal legal powers over their trading partners, taxes and [[w:Tariff|tariffs]] may be used in order to influence trade activities.  These instruments may also be used by voluntary associations that govern trade activities, such as the [[w:European Union|European Union]] and the [[w:World Trade Organization|World Trade Organization]].

=== Government ownership and/or control of enterprise ===
Where other forms of regulation are deemed infeasible for dealing with potential market failure problems, governments may simply choose to directly provide a good or service through a public agency or [[w:Government-owned corporation|state-owned enterprise]] (sometimes referred to as a [[w:Crown corporations of Canada|crown corporation]]).  The use of public ownership may allow governments to set more efficient prices in cases where production is subject to strong [[w:Economy of scale|scale economies]], or where regulation of an activity through conventional means is particularly difficult.  Government provision of a good may rely on direct ownership and operation, or may involve some form of [[w:Public-private partnership|private involvement]], perhaps through a lease arrangement with the public owner.  This type of arrangement will be discussed further in the chapter on [[Transportation Economics/Ownership|ownership]].

== Rationales for Economic Regulation ==
Economic regulation is an attempt by government to deliberately alter the allocation of resources and distribution of incomes away from that which would have occurred in the absence of such regulation. It is thus a means by which government can attempt to substitute its judgement of what constitutes a 'proper' allocation of resources and distribution of income for the outcome yielded by the market. Transportation had been a heavily regulated industry in the US until recently.

There are two major opposing theories on why economic regulations exist, consumer protection and industry protection, which are discussed below. Some other rationales for regulation are also described which don't fit neatly into these two categories.

=== Consumer Protection ===
The traditional and ideal view is that regulation is a device for protecting the public against the adverse effects of monopoly. This view, as described by Posner&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Posner | first=Richard A. | year=1974 | title=Theories of economic regulation | journal=The Bell Journal of Economics and Management Science | volume=5 | issue=2 | pages=335-358 | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3003113 | accessdate=2010-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, is commonly referred to as the [[w:Public interest theory|public interest theory]] of regulation.  Nominally, the main objective is to maximize social welfare by correcting market failure, which may occur in several forms.

For example, governments may choose to regulate monopolies in order to force them to produce the level of output that maximizes social welfare.  Monopolies may arise for a couple of reasons.  In some cases, an industry might be inherently &quot;monopolistic&quot; due to the existence of economies of scale, limited markets, or requirements for high levels of initial investment, which may deter entrants.  In other cases, industries may exhibit high fixed costs (indvisibilities), [[Transportation Economics/Costs#Jointness and Commonness|common and/or joint]] costs, which make them prone to monopoly.



Another consumer protection rationale for the provision of regulation is the need to correct for [[Transportation Economics/Negative externalities|externalities]].  Where negative externalities like pollution are present and serious enough to merit intervention, governments may intervene to correct these externalities by regulating the [[w:Emissions trading|quantity of pollution]] emitted, or by setting [[w:Ecotax|higher prices]] to induce less production/consumption of the externality.

=== Industry Protection ===
The contrasting and more recent view, that of [[w:Regulatory capture|regulatory capture]], is that regulation is procured by politically effective groups (assumed to be composed of the members of the regulated industry itself), for their own protection.     

The reasoning behind this view is that industry attempts to acquire regulation mainly because regulation will help them generate [[w:economic rent|economic rents]].  Furthermore, producers in an industry are more likely to have an incentive to influence regulatory activities, given their greater financial interest relative to individual consumers.  Thus, producers are far more effective in pressuring government than are general interest consumer groups. Stigler&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Stigler | first=George J. | year=1971 | title=The theory of economic regulation | journal=The Bell Journal of Economics and Management Science | volume=2 | issue=1 | pages=3-21 | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3003160 | accessdate=2010-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that producers essentially &quot;capture&quot; regulatory agencies, stating that &lt;i&gt;&quot;as a rule, regulation is acquired by the industry and is designed and operated for the industry and not for the &quot;public interest&quot;&lt;/i&gt; (p. 3).  Therefore, regulatory commissions end up &quot;protecting&quot; industry from consumers, conferring benefits on producers that they would not be able to obtain in more competitive markets.  Stigler's ideas were formalized in a later paper by Peltzman&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Peltzman | first=Sam | year=1976 | month=August | title=Toward a more general theory of regulation | journal=Journal of Law and Economics | volume=19 | issue=2 | pages=211-240 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Similar arguments have been used by political scientists to describe the relationship between Congress, federal agencies, and interest groups, often under the term [[w:Iron triangle|iron triangle]].  In this case, the relationship is tripartite, disaggregating the role of government into objectives pursued by elected officials and those pursued by agencies responsible for administration and oversight of federal programs.  This framework has been used to analyze the behavior of certain federal agencies, such as the [[w:Iron triangle#Tennessee Valley Authority|Tennessee Valley Authority]], as well as to describe the dynamics of industry-government relationships in the [[w:Military-industrial complex|Military-industrial complex]].

An interesting variation on the regulatory capture framework, commonly referred to as [[w:Bootleggers and Baptists|Bootleggers and Baptists]], has been applied to describe situations in which incumbent firms demand greater regulation, often with lobbying support from groups with conventionally opposing positions &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Yandle | first=Bruce | year=1983 | month=May/June | title=Viewpoint:  bootleggers and baptists -- the education of a regulatory economist | journal=Regulation | volume=7 | issue=3 | pages=12-16 | url=http://www.cato.org/pubs/regulation/regv7n3/v7n3-3.pdf | format=pdf | accessdate=2010-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The namesake application of the theory describes the phenomenon, frequently observed in southern states, of alcohol sales being banned on Sundays.  The ban is supported primarily by Baptists and other groups that seek to limit the consumption of alcohol, ostensibly for moral reasons.  The ban also enjoys tacit support from illegal suppliers of alcohol (the &quot;bootleggers&quot;), who benefit from the prohibition in the form of greater market power in the provision of alcoholic beverages on Sundays.  

Outside of this traditional application, the framework has been applied to other areas of regulatory policy, such as certain aspects of environmental regulation.   The framework describes regulators' preference for certain technology-specific mandates (e.g. &quot;scrubbers&quot; for power plant smokestacks in the 1977 Clean Air Act) as a means of reducing pollution&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Yandle | first=Bruce | year=1999 | title=Bootleggers and baptists in retrospect | journal=Regulation | volume=22 | issue=3 | url=http://www.id.iit.edu/externalID/documents/bootleggers.pdf | format=pdf | accessdate=2010-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.  In this case, environmentalists demanding greater regulation to ensure better air quality serve as the Baptists, while the equipment suppliers who manufacture the scrubbers serve as the bootleggers and lobby for specific provisions requiring the use of scrubbers.  

A common feature of firm behavior in this framework is the use of regulation to obtain market power, often through entry restrictions.  In the clean air example, plants that must comply with the regulation often have incentive to support it after it has been implemented.  Compliance in this case involves one-off expenditures on the procurement of the pollution control equipment.  The equipment might be expensive, but becomes a [[w:Sunk costs|sunk cost]] after implementation.  The requirements for this expensive, new equipment become a barrier to entry for prospective firms looking to enter the market.  The incumbent firms also tend to operate at higher levels of output, thus enabling them to spread the costs of the pollution control equipment across a greater number of consumers, lowering average costs.

=== Infant Industry ===
Economic regulation has also historically been employed in some cases where a government sought to promote the growth of an [[w:Infant industry argument|infant industry]].  The infant industry argument for regulation is typically invoked in cases where a nation sees the existence of potentially large external benefits from the growth of an industry, or the potential for other important non-economic benefits.  A classical example of the promotion of an infant industry is the US federal government's promotion of the growth of air travel on the grounds that it would provide a faster, cheaper and more effective means of delivering [[w:Airmails of the United States|air mail]].  While air mail was initially provided by the US government between 1911 and 1918, the 1926 Kelly Act contained provisions that required the US Post Office Department to contract with commercial air carriers for the delivery of air mail on intercity routes.  These contracts were an important source of revenue for the nascent airline industry.  

The mail contracts may be considered a form of implicit subsidy to the early airline industry.  In addition to subsidization, other instruments that may be used by government to promote infant industries include regulations on entry (entry barriers) or regulations mandating the supply of a specific quantity of a good.

=== Cut-throat Competition ===
Governments have sometimes intervened in markets in order to prevent what is know as destructive or [[w:Cut-throat competition|cut-throat]] competition.  Cut-throat competition is one example of [[w:Anti-competitive practices|anti-competitive]] business practices, that is, practices that reduce or prevent competition in a market, and is characterized by competitive situations where prices do not cover production costs over extended periods.  Several types of outcomes may emerge from such competitive environments which could provide a theoretical justification for some form of regulatory intervention:
 
* instability in supply prices -- governments may regulate to smooth out output prices
* uneconomic rate levels;
* [[w:Predatory pricing|predatory pricing]], where firms set artificially low prices in order to deter competition from potential market entrants, or to drive existing competitors out of business.
* immature pricing behavior -- [[w:Oligopoly|oligopolists]] may overreact to a competitive event, as when airlines engage in [[w:Price war|price wars]]
* high fixed cost with slow adjustment - short run pricing falls below average total costs, especially in recession when there are a lot of excess capacity

When dealing with instability in supply prices in certain industries, as for example with electric power, regulation is used to smooth output prices.  In other cases, as with road networks, the infrastructure tends more often to be publicly owned.  In the case of road networks, especially in urban areas, congestion can create instability in supply prices, since the &quot;supply&quot; function for a road link is a [[Transportation Economics/Pricing#Theory|function of traffic volumes]].  To achieve efficiency in this case, governments (or even private owners) can set prices equal to marginal cost in order to eliminate the congestion externality and smooth output prices.  

Uneconomic rate levels can arise (at least in the short run) through anti-competitive practices, though in practice it has more commonly been the result of regulatory rate-setting practices that have been ameliorated through regulatory reforms.  For example, many streetcar and subway networks in the US were formerly privately owned, though as participants in local franchise agreements with local governments they were subject to several forms of regulation, including price regulation.  Limits on the rail operators' ability to increase revenues through fare increases, which were politically unpopular, were a contributing factor toward the [[w:Great American streetcar scandal#Background|decline]] of many urban rail systems.  The inability to raise revenues through fares frequently led to deferred maintenance of the capital stock of these systems, which in turn led to declining service quality and lower ridership, an example of a [[Transportation Economics/Positive externalities#Positive and Negative Feedback:  A Systems Approach|vicious circle]].

Predatory pricing is most common in markets characterized by few firms, intense competition and low profit margins.  Deregulated local bus services in many British cities have seen instances of predatory behavior, such as the [[w:Darlington Bus War|Darlington Bus War]] which took place in the English town of Darlington following the deregulation of local bus service in the mid-1980s.  The fact that local bus services in many British cities continue to be supplied by a single, incumbent firm in spite of some limited competition from new market entrants has led some observers to suggest that urban bus services may be natural monopolies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Evans |first=Andrew W. |year=1991 |title=Are urban bus services natural monopolies? |journal=Transportation |volume=18 |issue=2 |pages=131-150 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/t61x51467t1468x5/ |accessdate=2010-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Immature pricing behavior has been observed to some extent in the deregulated US airline industry.  The entry of new carriers on an airline route, in addition to multimarket contact between carriers, frequently leads to price wars.  Price wars may dampen carrier profits and increase their volatility, but they also confer significant benefits on consumers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Morrison |first=Steven A. |coauthors=Clifford Winston |year=1996 |title=Causes and consequences of airline fare wars |journal=Brookings Papers on Economic Activity, Microeconomics |volume=1996 |pages=85-123 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2534747 |accessdate=2010-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Some industries with high fixed costs may adopt uneconomic pricing levels, at least in the short run, in situations where there is significant excess capacity (perhaps due to recession) and the process for adjusting capacity is slow or difficult.  In this case, firms may price output to cover variable costs, but not average total costs.  Private toll roads, especially those built at the fringe of developing urban areas, tend to have traffic levels that are sensitive to economic growth rates.  Recessions can cause declines in demand that sharply lower revenues.  Owners may respond by lowering toll rates to encourage traffic, since in this case significant excess capacity may exist.  The revised toll rates may cover the variable costs of operating and maintaining the road, but may not contribute to recovering its fixed costs.  Airlines may be vulnerable to similar types of conditions.  Demand for air travel is known to be income-elastic and airlines must often place orders for new aircraft several years in advance.  This combination of volatile demand and slow supply-side adjustment often leads to excess capacity during recessions.  Airlines tend to respond by lowering fares in order to fill available capacity, even if the fares fall below average total cost.

== Tools of Economic Regulation in Transport ==

The regulatory agencies are granted a broad power to regulate the following aspects of the industry:

* price regulation - maximum rate, minimum rate, rate structure
* rate-of-return regulation
* condition-of-service regulation
* entry and exit regulation
* antitrust (anti-combines) regulation including mergers and acquisition
* regulation on financial arrangements and accounting practices

Regulators may also establish safety standards, which are not discussed here.

=== Price Regulation ===

Price regulation involves the setting of limits (maximum or minimum) on the prices firms may charge for their product.  In cases where prices are regulated to limit the potential abuses of monopoly suppliers, regulators may impose [[w:Price-cap regulation|price-cap regulations]] or alternatively [[w:Revenue-cap regulation|revenue-cap regulations]].  Price-cap regulations typically limit price increases to changes in economy-wide price indices (such as the [[w:Consumer price index|consumer price index]]).  This approach has the advantage of controlling unreasonable price increases, while retaining incentives for producers to increase profits by reducing their costs.  Price regulations may also be employed to set minimum rates in cases where cut-throat competition drives prices below marginal costs for extended periods of time.  Minimum rate regulations, for example, could prevent the exercise of predatory pricing in industries with few competitors.

Prior to deregulation, carriers applied to regulators for any rate change; the regulatory agency could approve, deny or vary the changes. However, generally no inflation adjustments were built into rates, and the burden was on the carrier to prove need for changes. Unjust and unreasonable rates were not allowed; e.g. youth fares could be judged as justly high, while monopoly or predatory prices could be judged as being unreasonably high or low. 

Since deregulation, carriers simply file proposed fare changes, and make fares available for customers to look at. Regulator can disapprove or vary changes in 'basic fare level' upon complaints, but this rarely happens. 

=== Rate of Return Regulation ===

Under [[w:Rate-of-return regulation|rate-of-return]] regulation, regulatory authorities explicitly or implicitly use rate-based regulation for the carrier when they examine proposals for fare change.  If the carrier made more than fair returns, fare change proposal may not get approved. 

=== Condition of Service Regulation ===
Airline regulation in pre-deregulation Canada included condition-of-service regulation, which affected: 
* capacity offered
* type of aircraft used 
* frequency of service
* stopover condition; (e.g., PWA had to stop between Calgary and Toronto)

=== Entry and Exit  Regulation ===

Regulation of entry and exit was commonplace prior to deregulation. Entry both into the industry, and onto specific routes was regulated (as was exit).

Prior to deregulation, entry of a new firm into the industry required a certificate of Public Convenience and Necessity (PCN), where burden of proof (of need for new services) was on applicant. After deregulation, new entrants needed to demonstrate they are &quot;Fit, Willing and Able&quot;, and no longer need to show need for new service. Nevertheless, the [[w:Common carrier|common carrier obligation]] remains, and new carriers  must serve all requests from public.

Entry onto routes prior to deregulation was also quite cumbersome. A route license was required for airlines and truckers. That license may have restricted carriers to certain commodities or classes of service. Since deregulation, entry onto routes was much more open.

Exit was also regulated. Prior to deregulation, it  was almost impossible to abandon uneconomic routes or branchlines; therefore, carriers were required to cross-subsidize between profitable and unprofitable routes. Since deregulation, carriers can apply to the regulatory agency to abandon branchlines or exit from a route. In aviation this is straight-forward, in rail it tends to be somewhat more cumbersome. The regulatory agency either approves abandonment or gives direct subsidy to maintain uneconomic services. Usually abandonment or exit requires advance notice.

== Regulation by Mode ==
=== Railway Regulation ===
Regulation of US railroads was initiated 1887 with the passage of the [[w:Interstate Commerce Act of 1887|Interstate Commerce Act]].  The law was designed to curb the monopoly power that railroads enjoyed in many markets, with the objective of protecting shippers from paying monopoly rents.  The law created a new federal regulatory agency, the [[w:Interstate Commerce Commission|Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC)]], which had jurisdiction over commerce taking place across state lines.  Importantly, intrastate commerce issues were largely left to the states.  

The Interstate Commerce Act was motivated by political pressure from the railroads' customers (primarily Western farmers) to regulate alleged monopoly abuses and collusion among several of the country's large railroads.   Railroads often faced limited and inferior competition along routes and had characteristically high fixed costs, which limited the possibility of multiple railroads competing for traffic along the same route . Due to limited competition and availability of substitutes, demand for the railroads' services was price inelastic and the railroads responded by using [[w:Price discrimination|price discrimination]] at stations which only they served&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Hilton | first=George W. | year=1966 | month=October | title=The consistency of the Interstate Commerce Act | journal=Journal of Law and Economics | volume=9 | pages=87-113 | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/724995 | accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Act gave the ICC the power to set maximum rates for the railroads, while the subsequent [[w:Elkins Act|Elkins Act]] required railroads to publish their rates, a provision designed to prevent them from price discriminating against similar groups of customers.  Later amendments to the Act allowed for &lt;i&gt;minimum&lt;/i&gt;, in addition to maximum, rate regulation.  This provision reflected the suspicion of some ICC members that short-run marginal costs seemed too low relative to &quot;full costs&quot;.  The original Act had contained language that banned charging more for a shorter haul than a longer one.  Later microeconomic research would demonstrate that the costing and rate-setting procedures of the ICC were fundamentally flawed.  They reflected a misunderstanding of the relationship between costs and various types of outputs, a mistake that eventually led to uneconomic rate setting and imperiled the financial health of the industry until its deregulation in the late 1970s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Braeutigam | first1=Ronald R. | last2=Gomez-Ibanez | first2=Jose A. (ed.)| last3=Tye | first3=William B. (ed.) | last4=Winston | first4=Clifford (ed.) | title=Essays in Transportation Economics and Policy:  A Handbook in Honor of John R. Meyer | publisher=Brookings Institution Press | year=1999 | pages=57-97 | chapter=Chapter 3:  Learning about transport costs}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The Act also contained provisions requiring the railroads to provide services to uneconomic points, a requirement that eventually led to the practice of [[w:Cross subsidization|cross-subsidization]] of services.

railway monopoly in many markets: user protection
need to provide services to uneconomic points: cross-subsidy
some destructive competition; anti-trust need

=== Trucking Regulation ===
Started regulation in 1930s.
began to question the efficacy of competition as a regulator of business;
a strong push for &quot;codes of fair competition&quot; in society as a whole;
start to regulate trucking although it was a competitive industry.

The [[w:Motor Carrier Act of 1980|Motor Carrier Act (MCA) of 1980]] largely deregulated the interstate trucking industry in the US, reducing or eliminating most price and entry controls imposed by the federal government.  Interestingly, while most federal regulatory efforts were abandoned relating to interstate trucking, states retained considerable regulatory power over the activities of &lt;i&gt;intrastate&lt;/i&gt; truckers.  Teske et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Teske | first1=Paul | last2=Best | first2=Samuel | last3=Mintrom | first3=Michael | year=1994 | title=The economic theory of regulation and trucking deregulation:  shifting to the state level | journal=Public Choice | volume=79 | pages=247-256 | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/x464225r13663224/ | accessdate=2010-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; argue that truckers turned their attention to the state level following the Motor Carrier Act, and were able to effectively capture state regulators and extract monopoly rents in what would otherwise be a competitive industry.  They show that in the decade following the MCA, only eight of the 50 states had adopted legislation to loosen regulations that existed prior to 1980.  Further, they argue that state-level trucking regulation is consistent with theories that emphasize regulation as serving to protect industry interests.

=== Airline Regulation ===
Started regulation in late 1930s.
to help create national network 
subsidization of the infant industry	
protection from competitive entry to effect cross-subsidization (taxation by regulation - regulatory inspired cross-subsidization).

Economic regulation of airlines in the United States began in earnest in the 1930s with the passage of the [[w:United States government role in civil aviation#Civil Aeronautics Authority|Civil Aeronautics Act (CAA)]] of 1938.  The CAA was the result of lobbying by the airlines to protect themselves from what they considered to be &quot;excessive&quot; competition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Morrison | first1=Steven A. | last2=Winston | first2=Clifford | year=1989 | title=Airline deregulation and public policy | journal=Science | volume=245 | issue=4919 | pages=707-711 | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/245/4919/707 | doi=10.1126/science.245.4919.707 | accessdate=2010-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The CAA created a new regulatory agency, the Civil Aeronautics Authority, which was subsequently split into two separate agencies, the Civil Aeronautics Administration and the Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB), in 1940 by President Roosevelt.  The former had responsibility for air traffic control, safety programs, and airway development, while the latter was responsible for safety rulemaking, accident investigation and various types of economic regulation.  The CAB carried out most of the regulatory activities of the CAA, which included regulating airline fares, as well as entry into and exit from airline markets.

Entry into airline markets was limited by the CAB.  It required carriers to obtain a &quot;certificate of public convenience and necessity&quot; (issued by the CAB) as a condition of entry in order to serve a particular route.  Entry into major existing routes was difficult, as incumbent carriers often objected and appealed to the CAB.  Thus, the CAB never admitted new entrants on routes that already had two or more carriers.  Withdrawal of services (exit) from a route also required CAB approval.  If a carrier went bankrupt, the CAB would typically arrange a [[w:Mergers and acquisitions|merger]] which allowed the failing carrier to be acquired by a larger, healthier carrier (and giving the latter greater route authority in the process).

Although the CAB did not set fares directly, it did have approval power over fares filed by carriers.  Since fares were set in terms of industry-wide rather than route-specific costs, the result was often fares that were much higher than costs on many routes.  Airlines were not permitted to engage in price competition on routes, leading them to instead engage in intense, quality of service-based competition.  The primary means for this was increases in the frequency of flights, particularly on long-distance routes.  While this type of competition may have improved service quality, it also led to lower average load factors as airlines operated planes at loads substantially below capacity.

== Effects of Economic Regulation  ==

There are numerous effects of economic regulation. 

Entry regulation relieves competitive pressure. Entry regulation induces x-inefficiency in the industry - gold plating, feather-bedding, etc.  It was found there was a 16% cost increase due to this and crown ownership of carriers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Gillen | first=David W. | coauthors=Tae H. Oum, Michael W. Tretheway | year=1990 | month=January | title=Airline cost structure and policy implications:  a multi-product approach for Canadian airlines | journal=Journal of Transport Economics and Policy | volume=24 | issue=1 | pages=9-34 | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20052902 | accessdate=2010-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Entry regulation transfers economic rents to organized input suppliers; e.g., labor unions, aircraft manufacturers, and thereby dissipates economic rents the industry hopes to gain. Services are unresponsive to customer needs, and there are allocative inefficiencies.

Price regulations leads to excessive quality competition, see e.g., Douglas and Miller's&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Miller | first=George W. | coauthors=James C. Miller III | title=Economic Regulation of Domestic Air Transport:  Theory and Policy | publisher=Brookings Institution | year=1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; work on airline quality competition. The system is much less flexible and far more inefficient.

Exit regulation leads to cross-subsidization from profitable to unprofitable routes. Society as a whole loses as the total welfare under cross-subsidization is lower than with direct subsidy where funds come either from government general or through air transport tax.

Rate-of-return regulations are sometimes used as a constraint to guide decisions by rate-makers concerning raising or lowering prices.  That is the regulatory authority allows a fair rate of return on the value of the assets (&quot;rate base&quot;) required to produce the services. This gives incentives for the firm to increase its &quot;rate base&quot; by investing more on capital input relative to labour input;  In other words, the firm under rate-of-return constraint has relatively more capital vis-a-vis labor than is required to produce any given output. This is an important source of allocative inefficiency caused by the regulation. Over-capitalization, the ([[w:Averch–Johnson effect|Averch–Johnson effect]])  is the tendency of companies to engage in excessive amounts of capital accumulation in order to expand the volume of their profits. If companies profits to capital ratio is regulated at a certain percentage then there is a strong incentive for companies to over-invest in order to increase profits overall.

Regulatory administration is not itself free, and this high cost needs to be considered in any analysis of welfare gains and loses from regulation. Further, regulation reduces dynamism in the industry, there are fewer innovations, which are difficult to capture in static economic analyses, yet need to be considered.

Making travel by one mode more expensive leads to a  misallocation of traffic across modes, as other modes carry more traffic than a welfare analysis would suggest is optimal. These additional costs also may cause distortions elsewhere in the economy.

Note that if market failure does not exist, there is no economic need for any economic regulation.  Numerous studies have investigated the effect of regulation on the airlines, highway trucking, intercity bus, and taxicab industries.  In all four cases there is an ample body of empirical evidence which suggests that in the absence of regulation the market mechanism would yield an output close to a competitive equilibrium.  For these industries, economic regulation has become a prime cause of market failure, far from being a remedy for market failure. Therefore, the impact of regulation on price and quantities traded in these industries can be assessed by using a competitive solution as the appropriate benchmark.

== Effects of Economic Deregulation ==
Early economic criticisms of regulation emerged in the 1940s and 1950s; and a growing number of academic researchers criticized regulation during the 1960s. These critiques plus empirical measures of the economic cost of regulation in 1970s led to political support, and ultimately, deregulation became the default policy. Deregulation of airlines began in 1978 and railroads and trucking in 1980. The 1970s and 1980s saw a wave of [[w:deregulation|deregulation]] across many other sectors of the US economy, in addition to substantial regulatory reforms in the transportation . 

There are a couple of important points to note regarding the regulatory reforms of the 1970s and 1980s.  First, most of the regulatory reforms that were undertaken addressed &lt;i&gt;economic regulation&lt;/i&gt;, that is, regulation that directs or constrains the behavior of firms in terms of pricing, entry and exit decisions.  They did not address other types of regulation such as safety, environmental, and antitrust regulation, which continued to be enforced in their previous forms and in many cases increased.  Second, most of the regulatory reforms represented only &lt;i&gt;partial&lt;/i&gt; deregulation of industries.  For example, in the transportation sector prices, entry, and exit were mostly deregulated in the airline and interstate trucking industries by the early 1980s, while the ICC retained some control over railroad rate regulation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Winston | first=Clifford | year=1993 | month=September | title=Economic deregulation:  days of reckoning for microeconomists | journal=Journal of Economic Literature | volume=31 | issue=3 | pages=1263-1289 | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2728241 | accessdate=2010-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  The Interstate Commerce Commission was later formally abolished in 1995, though some of its regulatory powers were transferred to a new agency, the [[w:Surface Transportation Board|Surface Transportation Board]].

== Theory of Contestable Markets ==
Typically, a limited number of producers in an industry (monopoly being the extreme case) is thought to lead to outcomes which deviate from the ideal of competitive markets.  However, economists have more recently discovered conditions under which markets can function competitively, even in the absence of a large number of producers.  Baumol, Panzar and Willig &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baumol |first=William J. |coauthors=John C. Panzar, Robert D. Willig |title=Contestable Markets and the Theory of Industry Structure |publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich |year=1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; formalized the conditions under which natural monopolies could be expected to reach efficient equilibria without regulation, an idea put forward by Harold Demsetz&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Demsetz | first=Harold | year=1968 | month=April | title=Why regulate utilities? | journal=Journal of Law and Economics | volume=11 | issue=1 | pages=55-65 | url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/Page?handle=hein.journals/jlecono11&amp;div=9&amp;g_sent=1#61 | accessdate=2010-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; earlier.  This theory, known as the theory of [[w:Contestable market|contestable markets]], broadened the potential areas in which the outcome of perfect competition applies.  Some of the principles of contestable market theory suggest that:

*Potential competition can replace actual competition
*A single firm (monopoly) may behave like a competitive firm
*A crucial condition for a market to be contestable is ''free entry and exit''

Levine&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Levine | first=Michael E. | year-1987 | title=Airline competition in deregulated markets:  theory, firm strategy, and public policy | journal=Yale Journal on Regulation | volume=4 | pages=393-494 | url=http://www.theairlinezone.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/AIRLINE-COMPETITION-IN-DEREGULATED-MARKETS.pdf | format=pdf | accessdate=2010-04-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see page 404) identified some of the conditions considered by economists to be necessary in order for markets to be contestable.  They included:

*equal access to scale economies and technology, whether expressed as access to competitive levels of unit cost or as equivalent access to product quality
*no [[w:Sunk costs|sunk costs]] -- a firm can enter and exit without entry and exit costs, including operating losses resulting from predation.
*price sustainability, there is a set of prices that can occur after the entry of at least one firm which will support profitable operation.
* free entry: no entry barrier
* costless exit

The concept of contestable markets provided a broader condition supporting deregulation of transportation markets than the assumption of perfect competition.  It was no longer implicitly assumed that markets in which there were not a large number of actual competitors could not function competitively in the absence regulation.

=== Implications for Regulation ===
Contestable market theory has several implications for regulation.  For example, there is little need for regulation if sunk costs in an industry are low, thus regulation should be designed to focus on industries with substantial sunk costs. In that case regulation should regulate sunk facilities only and  modify institutional arrangements for sunk assets. Regulators can rely on contestability theory only partially in deregulated airline markets mainly due to existence of entry barriers.

Several studies looking at the airline industry have pointed out that the airline market is only partially contestable&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Bailey | first=Elizabeth E. | couathors=John C. Panzar | year=1981 | title=The contestability of airline markets during the transition to deregulation | journal=Law and Contemporary Problems | volume=44 | issue=1 | pages=125-145 | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1191388 | accessdate=2010-04-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, and that the existence of actual competition is more effective than potential competition, as determined by the overall level of welfare provided by the market&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Morrison |first=Steven A. |coauthors=Clifford Winston |year=1987 |month=April |title=Empirical implications and tests of the contestability hypothesis |journal=Journal of Law and Economics |volume=30 |issue=1 |pages=53-66 |url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/725391 |accessdate=2010-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Fares in markets with potential competition were also shown to be lower than in completely monopolized markets, but higher than in markets with actual competition.  The implications of these findings are that regulators should concern themselves more with fostering competition in airline markets, for example by reducing barriers to entry, in order to achieve more of the benefits from competition.

== Thanks ==
Dear Jcwf, thanks for your attention. Congratulations on your contribution on the Dutch book, there is a lot of work there. I had not noticed that my discussion was back, I had deleted it (and wrote a softer comment)(and never came back to that book), because that discussion lead to a very long and tiring dispute, that went everywhere (with more deleted discussions), up to the Reading room. Unfortunately the dispute had nothing to do with &quot;learning Dutch&quot;, but with &quot;supposed to be wikimanners&quot;. I appreciate your tolerance and understanding that my comment is honest, although provocative. In art we are used to hard comments, aren´t we? I even enjoy them. Please tell me, if possible, what part of Netherlands are you from? (I wanted to learn Dutch because I am considering moving there with my wife). What would be a &quot;second best&quot; city to live? Rotterdam or Den Haag? (I say &quot;second best&quot; because amsterdam was my first choice, but it is almost out of our shortlist) (rents too high... stupid reason?)(I know, for some people my second options are their first options).
kind regards: )
--[[User:Ricardoramalho|Ricardoramalho]] ([[User talk:Ricardoramalho|talk]]) 12:41, 27 June 2009 (UTC)   PS: I promess not to bother you too much

:Dear Jcwf! Thanks for the tips on Rotterdam!! (cultural programs are a vital aspect, it is interesting your view that Rdam has more of it than Adam). It has been hard to find positive comments on Rotterdam recently, I have been probably asking the wrong persons about it. 

:Regarding the pronunciation tool in the Dutch book, it is okay. When I click on the icon it opens the itunes... which is good for ipod transfering. Another approach to pronunciation is the system in www.merriam-webster.com it is faster, but it cannot be stored in Itunes as easily. Feel free to ask me for more help with the Dutch book anytime! The next week up to July 3 I will be quite busy writing works for my masters degree, but after that I will have more time to study the Dutch book. keep in touch! --[[User:Ricardoramalho|Ricardoramalho]] ([[User talk:Ricardoramalho|talk]]) 11:32, 28 June 2009 (UTC)</text>

== Possible Typo ==
There appears to be a typo in this page. Where it says: &quot;Specifically if &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\partial\psi}{\partial x}(x,y)=P(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\partial\psi}{\partial x}(x,y)=Q(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;&quot;, it should be &quot;&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{\partial\psi}{\partial y}(x,y)=Q(x,y)&lt;/math&gt;&quot; (Q(x,y) is the partial wrt y) [[Special:Contributions/69.255.224.70|69.255.224.70]] ([[User talk:69.255.224.70|discuss]]) 20:55, 15 January 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''High Pressure Liquid Chromatography''' (HPLC for short or also called High Performance Liquid Chromatography) is a precise and hi-spec form of column chromatography that can separate and identify components in an unknown (or known) compound mixture. 

Like all forms of chromatography, HPLC consists of a stationary phase and a mobile phase. The stationary phase is some solid material packed into the column, while the mobile phase is a liquid solvent that carries the analyzed compound through the column. 

Chromatography operates on the principle of polarity where the compound interacts with the solid stationary phase based on their differences in polarity. In general, if the stationary phase is very polar, a non-polar component of the compound would exit the column faster than a polar component would.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 02:37, 11 October 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The story of life on Earth is a fascinating one. Life is more interesting than almost anything else -- certainly more interesting than simple rocks, water, and gases. Life is above all else a very complex set of chemistry known as biochemistry -- the chemistry of life itself. 

So far as we know the Earth is the only place in the universe with life. We may find other places in time, places with very different life. We may even create life. But life has to come from somewhere.

When it formed, the Earth had no life. It couldn't hold life; its surface was hot from either a glob of congealing, molten rock or from giant pieces of rock slamming together. It may have had no gases, and certainly no liquid water. Deadly ultraviolet radiation would have killed anything. But eventually as the rocks cooled, some of them released some of the chemicals of life. Most importantly, liquid water emerged from the rocks or fell to the early Earth and formed early lakes, seas, and oceans. Some of the water evaporated and formed clouds from which rain fell. Other substances emerged from the rocks, like rock phosphates and salts of magnesium, calcium, sodium, potassium, and iron. Some others may have been captured from space when the planets were young, such gases as carbon dioxide or carbon monxide, methane, ammonia, and hydrogen sulfide. Some of those chemicals are dangerous to us -- like hydrogen sulfide, ammonia, methane, and carbon monoxide. Don't worry; we weren't around for them to hurt us. There was no oxygen; that would come into existence later.

A remarkable experiment in 1954 by the physicist Harold Urey and the chemist Stanley Miller showed how the early chemicals of life came into existence. They put small amounts of water, ammonia, and methane into chemical flasks and simulated lightning upon the chemicals. (Don't try this at home!) They got some chemicals known as amino acids necessary for proteins. Other people have done similar experiments with slight changes and gotten slightly different effects -- but also the chemicals essential to life.  

Sulfur was necessary for some vital proteins for all later life, and where there a little hydrogen sulfide, some of those proteins were possible. But proteins are not life themselves. Life cannot form until it has some unique substances called RNA and DNA that control the chemistry of life and define life itself. DNA and RNA require phosphates, compounds that contain phosphorus and oxygen. Life came into existence when it controlled its own chemistry, defined itself in cells, and reproduced. 

We don't know the whole story of life. Much of it is genetics whose chemical basis is DNA or RNA -- and every living thing has its own DNA or RNA (if not both). They are very complicated compounds with subtle effects. We don't know how cells came into existence -- yet. We can't create life -- but we know that it came into existence. 

Life became increasingly complex. Some of it simply devoured the early material of life. Some devoured creatures that came into existence before it. Some (most of which would become plants) used sunlight to get energy to store in sugars. Plants would do a process called photosynthesis -- taking carbon dioxide, water, and sunlight and turning them into sugar (their own food) and oxygen. 

Plants released oxygen into the atmosphere, but only from water. The lands were barren of life of any kind for millions of years. Some animals began to eat plants, and some animals ate the animals that ate the plants. All animals would use oxygen. But oxygen would enter the atmosphere. Some of the oxygen would go to the top of the atmosphere and become ozone that would absorb deadly ultraviolet radiation. Then, and only then could animals and plants enter the land.  By then the Earth was no longer young. But the chemistry of life was itself very old by then, and that chemistry has changed little to our time -- but  the great variation possible due to subtle differences DNA and RNA now makes possible the great variety of life -- and even the uniqueness of you and me.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Why shouldn't we add the little cats and change the title to &quot;Cats&quot;?

The domestic cat is so obviously similar in build and behavior to all of the bigger cats, and several of the Big Cats are so compared. The only anomaly for the domestic cat is its relationship to humans. The other small cats have their own stories.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== General Information ==

&lt;b&gt;Gel-filtration chromatography&lt;/b&gt; is the simplest and mildest technique that separates molecules based on their size difference (also known as hydrodynamic volume). This way each polypeptide is purified from other different sized polypeptides. Gel-Filtration Chromatography is also known as '''&lt;b&gt;Size-Exclusion chromatography&lt;/b&gt;''', '''&lt;b&gt;Molecular-Exclusion chromatography&lt;/b&gt;''' or '''&lt;b&gt;Molecular Sieve chromatography&lt;/b&gt;'''.
 
When an organic solvent is used as a mobile phase, chemists tend to call it &lt;b&gt;Gel permeation chromatography&lt;/b&gt;. This technique is used to analyze the molar mass distribution of organic-soluble polymers. It was invented by Grant Henry Lathe and Colin Ruthren who were working at Queen Charlotte's Hospital in London, United Kingdom. 

The sample solution is applied to the top of a column containing a stationary phase of porous beads made of an insoluble but highly hydrated polymer such as dextran or agarose. These beads span a relatively narrow size range. When an aqueous solution of molecules of various sizes is passed through a column containing these 'molecular sieves,' small molecules can enter them but the large ones cannot. As a result, the big molecules are located in the solution around the beads while the smaller ones are able to penetrate the beads and the solution between them. The most important point is that large molecules flow more rapidly through this column and emerge first because a smaller volume is accessible to them and this is what enables the collection of fractions where the first set collected contains bigger molecules and the last set contains smaller molecules. And, theoretically, molecules that have the same size should elute simultaneously. An elution diagram, or a chromatogram, can be constructed to verify complete separation.

Within the size range of molecules that are subjected to gel-filtration chromatography and are separated by a particular pore size of beads in the column, there is a linear relationship between the relative elution volume of a substance (i.e., the volume of the fractions in which the molecule is found)and the logarithm of its molecular mass (this is assuming that the molecules have similar shapes). If a given gel filtration column is calibrated with several proteins of known molecular mass, the mass of an unknown protein can be estimated by its elution position.


== Analogy ==
An analogy to understand (this is CONCEPTUAL, not even remotely a literal representation of what happens in ME chromatography) why gel filtration works is to picture several whiffle balls (or sponges or Swiss cheese-whatever cratered object works for you) suspended in a glass tank.  Now imagine that you have a mixture of sand, small marbles, and golf balls in a bucket; you dump it in.  As you watch, first the golf balls reach the floor of the tank, then the marbles, and finally a layer of sand settles.  Why?  Essentially all of the sand goes into the holes of the whiffle balls(or Swiss cheeses or sponges), and it tends to fall from the interior of one whiffle ball to the interior of another,  significantly slowing passage of the sand to the bottom of the tank.  The marbles are only slightly smaller than the holes in the whiffle ball, so they sometimes fall into the holes on the way down but also sometimes bounce off; again, the whiffle balls slow their progress, but to a lesser extent.  The golf balls are way too big to fit the holes of a whiffle ball, and so they push straight through the whiffle balls--the fastest and most direct route. 
Key: sand=small molecules; marbles=medium molecules; golf balls=large molecules; whiffle balls=porous beads; tank of water=column &amp; aqueous solution

== General Procedure ==
First, apply the sample or mixture to the top of the gel filtration column that is filled with insoluble carbohydrate polymer beads with different sizes of pores. [Agarose, dextran, or polyacrylamide are usually used as the stationary phase (gel medium) under low pressure. However, silica or cross-linked polystyrene can also be used as a stationary phase under a higher pressure.]
As the mixture flows towards to the bottom of the column, large molecules will emerge first because they cannot distribute inside the beads - they can only exist in between the beads in the column and they have a smaller accessible volume, whereas smaller molecules can distributed into both inside and between the beads. Thus, small molecules will take a long time to elute because they have a longer tortuous path before they come to the exit of the column.


Gel-Filtration Chromatography is commonly used for analysis of synthetic and biological polymers such as nucleic acid, proteins, and polysaccharides. A downfall to this technique is that the stationary phase may also interact in an undesirable way with a molecule and affect its retention time.

Gel-Filtration Chromatography should not be confused with gel electrophoresis, where electricity is applied to create an electric field to separate molecules through the gel towards the electrode (anode and cathode) depending on their electric charge.

Look at the following pictures. 
The caption below each picture describes in Punjabi the object in the picture. 
Once you have recognized the objects, use your knowledge of Gurmukhi to read the captions. 
The captions contain the initial letter of the object name besides the object name in Punjabi and in English. 
Follow this by loudly reading each caption without the English word. 
Take the help of the sound file if necessary. 
Practise it repeatedly till you master it i.e. till you are able to fluently speak it.

== Muharni ==
Welcome to Muharni, the next big step in learning Punjabi. 
You will learn here how to speak Punjabi words by a lot of practice. 

''If you have not mastered the Gurmukhi script you are strongly advised to go back to the [[Punjabi/Gurmukhi|Gurmukhi]] script module and practise thoroughly before returning. In this module you will be expected to have the basic skills of using the letters, matras and the diacritics.''

You have already learnt the Gurmukhi script. 
You came across many English examples to illustrate the sounds 
represented by the Gurmukhi letters. 
We now gradually introduce you to Punjabi words. 
Muharni is the traditional way of learning words by reciting them. 
Muharni consists of the letters of Gurmukhi script in its natural order each letter 
followed by a word starting with that letter. 
It is recited as a rhyme. 
The result is that while you learn some 
Punjabi words you also acquire some proficiency in speaking Punjabi. 

The Muharni module will consist of 8 chapters and shall be finished in two weeks. 
You are expected to practice thoroughly each lesson before moving to the next. The final lesson contains all the words learnt in other lessons. You can assume that you are ready to move to the next module if you can continously speak all the words of the full muharni.

== Re-order words ==

Perhaps the purpose of this page would be better served if the words were not in the same order as the main survival kit table?  When looking at this table, I find that I'm not so much remembering the meaning of the word as the English meaning of the word in that position.  Thoughts?

Look at the following pictures. 
The caption below each picture describes in Punjabi the object in the picture. 
Once you have recognized the objects, use your knowledge of Gurmukhi to read the captions. 
The captions contain the initial letter of the object name besides the object name in Punjabi and in English. 
Follow this by loudly reading each caption without the English word. 
Take the help of the sound file if necessary. 
Practise it repeatedly till you master it i.e. till you are able to fluently speak it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ion Exchange Chromatography (IEC)''' is a [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Purification|purification]] method aimed at separating proteins based on charge. A column is packed with a resin (usually cellulose or agarose) with a charged group bonded to it. For a positively charged resin, a protonated diethylaminoethyl (DEAE) group is used. For negatively charged resin, a deprotonated carboxymethyl (CM) group is used. Ion exchange chromatography consists of cation exchange chromatography and anion exchange chromatography. Whatever one wants to purify is known as the sample and the parts that are separated are known as the analytes. The sample is added to the top of the column and a buffered solution is used to elute it.

==Techniques==
In cation exchange chromatography, a sample consisting of a certain protein that bears a net positive charge at a certain pH is a added to a column. In anion exchange chromatography, a sample with a protein that bears a net negative charge at a certain pH is added to a column. (Anet charge is the sum of partial charges for each amino acid's particular R group at a given pH). The columns have resin that consists of cellulose (or agarose) beads, which have a function group covalently bonded to it. For cation exchange a carboxylate group is used, and for anion exchange a diethylaminoethyl group is used. A buffer solution, also called a mobile phase, has its pH set between the pl or pKa of protein and the pKa of the beads on the columns. The buffer solution then runs the sample through the column. Molecules with no charge or the same charge as the beads will pass through, while molecules with the opposite charge will bind to the column of beads. Like a magnet, it'll stick and stay there. To elute the bound proteins, the column is flushed with  a salt, usually excess NaCl. In cation exchange chromatography the Na+ ion will compete with the bound protein for the negative functional group, and in anion exchange chromatography, the Cl- ion will compete to bind the columns. Another way to flush the system would be with a low pH buffer. The more acidic conditions will lower the net charge (or make it more positive) of the protein. Since the protein now bears a positive net charge, it no longer feels compelled to be around the like-charged resin (since like charges repel), and it'll come out of the column pure. 

If there are impurities in the sample that have a similar charge of the protein being isolated, a pH gradient buffer solution is needed. Unless the proteins have exactly the same amino acids, it is unlikely that they will have exactly the same charge at the same exact pH. Raising (or lowering) the pH, which is in effect causing more molecules to be deprotonated (or protonated), will cause the molecule to have a slight change in charge negatively (or positively). This will affect the ionic interaction between the molecule and the resin, causing some of the molecules to elute from the column. By changing the pH, different molecules will have different charge densities (or degree of negative charge; -2,-1,-3, etc.). So at a certain pH, a protein might have a higher or lower charge density and will thus bind to the resin differently, and those with a lower charge density will elute first.

For another example, say we are analyzing an air sample that has been collected onto an air filter and put through filter extraction (adding water to the filter, purifying by putting through another filter, and extracting the water to be the sample). The samples are then further prepared to put into the IC (ion chromatograph) by adding a given amount of the sample and a given amount of a water. A series of standard solutions and water are first put through the IC in order to calibrate the instrument. The standard solutions consist of certain cation or anion, depending on which ion chromatography is being performed, that are to be detected in the samples. Once all the samples have been put through the IC an ion chromatrogram (see image)is created for each standard and sample solution. In the ion chromatogram the analyte separation can been seen. Each analyte travels through the column at a different rate due to the positively or negatively charged resin. In the ion chromatogram the time at which it takes each analyte to pass through as well as the amount present can be seen. Each analyte will travel through the column at a consistent time in each sample thus each peak can be determined to be certain analytes.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Important|Please save your work periodically.}}

==Creating the Scene==
*Open ''css-lr300-idle.exp''.
*Go to File&gt;Save As. Save it as ''css-lr300-shoot.exp''.
*Match the scene's FPS with the QC's shoot1/2/3 fps. (You should already know how to do this from the idle animation page.) The fps for the sg552 draw animation is 37.
*Match the scene's end frame with the SMD's end frame minus one. (31 - 1 = 30). The end frame is 30 for the sg552 draw animation.
*Find the null ''Frame''. Below the ''Parent'' button, there is a ''CnsComp'' button. Press it.
*Click the word ''Constrain'' above the ''Parent'' button, and click ''Pose''.
*Click the left hand null. Now whenever you rotate or move the hand, the gun will follow it.
*Now constrain the right arm to the left hand.

==Animating==
*Set keys for rotation and translation (hint: '''VKCK''') at the last frame for every null in the scene. This ensures that the gun is in its idle position after it is drawn.}}
{{NOTE|The draw animation can be really easy or really hard depending on how you want it to look. The easy way is to make one start frame and one end frame so the gun just rotates out to its idle position. The hard way is to add a bolt pull some aesthetic move while drawing the weapon. This tutorial will explain the easy way.}}
*Set the current frame to 0.
*Set a key for the left hand and left arm at where you want the gun to begin drawing out.
*Review the animation in the ''Camera'' viewport.

==FCurve Editor==
*Press '''0''' to bring up the FCurve Editor.
*Select a null such as the hand.
*Click one of the rotation items. (rotx, roty, rotz)
*At the bottom there is an animation marker that you can move around.
*On the left and right there will be keys. Keys are represented as little colored squares in the FCurve Editor.
*Click one of them.
*Now a little black handle will pop out of the key. Drag it around to edit the interpolation.
*Some shortcuts:
**'''Shift+Z''': Rectangular zoom
**'''A''': Frame curve
**'''S''': Multi-purpose navigation tool (Similar to using '''S''' in a viewport.)
*Now you can edit the interpolation (in between frames) of the draw animation as a curve. Experiment and have fun with it.
*There are also plenty of buttons and fields.
**One useful button is the ''Linear Interpolation'' button. This will straighten out a curve's interpolation. It is useful when you have two keys at two different places and you want them to stay and not move.
**Another useful button is the ''Add Key'' button. Its icon has a picture of a key with a plus sign on it. Click it and then click on somewhere on the FCurve plane to add a key. To exit Add Key mode, click the button with the picture of a cursor on the far left.
*Toward the top of the FCurve editor are text boxes for Frame and Key values. To use these, select a key and set the values using the text boxes.
==Adding an Inverse Kinematic Controller==
{{NOTE|This is another way to make a draw animation.}}
{{Tip|A forward kinematic controller is useful for changing the pivot of a null.}}
*A controller is an object used to control another object from a different location. See [[../Questions|Questions]] if you don't know what inverse kinematics are.
*For this animation it is useful to add an inverse kinematic bone to the supporting arm. The supporting arm supplies some of the force that brings out the weapon.
*Press '''2''' to bring up the green animation panel on the left.
*On the left hand panel under ''Create'', select Skeleton&gt;Draw 2D Chain.
*Click on any two points on any viewport. Then right click.
*Make sure all three elements that you have just created are selected. Press '''Control+Shift+R''' to reset their positions.
*Select each object individually and reset their locations again.
*Press '''Control+J''' to bring up the Move Joint tool.
*Put the root on the elbow area of the supporting arm.
*Put the effector on the wrist joint.
*Rotate the bone so the effector's axes properly line up with the rotation of the arm.
*Right click any part of the chain (root, bone, or effector) to select its components.
*Click ''Transform'' on the right panel and click ''Set Neutral Pose''.
*Setting keys for an inverse kinematic chain using the shortcut ''K'' is ambiguous in XSI. It is better done in the animation editor.
*Using what you have learned about the FCurve editor animate the root and effector in the FCurve Editor. Try to think about how the root's and effector's movement are represented in real life.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
The process of &quot;salting out&quot; is a [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Purification|purification]] method that relies on the basis of [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|protein]] solubility. It relies on the principle that most proteins are less soluble in solutions of high salt concentrations because additional ions of the salt shield protein with multi-ions charges. Those charges help protein molecules interact, aggregate, and precipitate. The exact concentration resulting in precipitation varies from protein to protein, allowing separation of different proteins (as they will precipitate at different points when increasing salt concentration).  Salting out can also concentrate dilute solutions of proteins; once the protein precipitates, the remaining liquid can be removed. However, the salt can pose a problem to the purity of protein. 

&quot;Salting in&quot; refers to the observation that at dilute solutions of low salt concentrations, the solubility of the protein increases. As the solubility of the salt added in higher than protein, it is more likely dissolve and take most of the space in the solution; therefore, proteins aggreate and precipitate.  Whereas, its opposite, &quot;salting out,&quot; requires high salt concentration for the precipitation of the protein. There are two ways of &quot;salting out&quot;.  One in which proteins are exposed to high concentrations of salt solutions, and the other is where the proteins are exposed to a series of low concentrated solutions. 

Proteins contain various sequences and compositions of amino acids. Therefore, their solubility to water differs depending on the level of [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Hydrophobic interaction|hydrophobic ]] or hydrophilic properties of the surface.  Proteins with surfaces that have greater hydrophobic properties will readily precipitate. The addition of ions creates an electron shielding effect that nullifies some activity between water particles and the protein, reducing solubility as the proteins bind with each other and begin to aggregate. Generally, larger proteins require less ionic input than do smaller proteins with lesser weight.

In the process of using low concentrations of salt solutions, the proteins are precipitated early in the process.  In order to extract the proteins from the solution, cold solutions of ammonium sulfate at a series of decreasing concentrations are used on the precipitate.  In order to recover the extracted protein, it is then recrystallized by warming the cold solution to room temperature.  This process has many advantages because depending on the extracted protein, the efficiency rate can run anywhere from 30-90%, and rarely fails.

Ammonium sulfate is common substance to precipitate proteins selectively since it is very soluble in water, it allows high concentration about 4M. At this state, harmful effects of proteins like irreversible denaturation are absent and NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; and SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; are both favourable, non-denaturing, end of the Hofmeister series. Ammonium sulfate provides quantative precipitation of one protein from the mixture. This method is very useful to purify soluble proteins from the cell extracts.&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;
 
While proving itself to be an efficient method of protein separation, salting out requires that the solubility of the protein to be calculated or known initially. Proteins have differing amino acid chains and solubility. In trying to change the salt concentration to the point where the protein becomes insoluble, different ions can either increase or decrease the solubility of the protein. Hence, one must be careful in selecting the correct ions to alter salt concentration.  A protein is typically least soluble near its isoelectric point, pI, or where it contains minimal net charge. The precipitation by salting out results in fractionation. An amount of precipitated protein is collected at one salt concentration and another amount from a different concentration. This is because some parts of the protein may be more soluble than another region.

Proteins with different pI values can be separated with salting out techniques via dynamic pH values in varying salt concentration.  Since proteins are least soluble near their isoelectric point (pI), it is possible to cause them to precipitate them out of solution by increasing the salt concentration. This is possible since the hydration shell surrounding the protein structure is displaced by the increasing ionic concentration in the solvent. Thus by replacing the hydration shell with other ions, the water networks that solubilize proteins and allow for
aggregation at high salt concentration due to hydrophobic groups coming together become destabilized. Ultimately proteins are precipitated with aggregation (or &quot;crashed out&quot;). This technique can be used to separate proteins that initially have similar precipitation points.  By modifying the pH of the solution, one can increase or decrease the solubility of one protein without affecting the target protein.  Furthermore, the solution can later be purified by using dialysis to remove the salt ions in solution.

== Hofmeister Series ==
The effectiveness of the different ions was established by Franz Hofmeister in 1888. The first ion in the anion and cation series is the most effective in precipitating a protein out (dubbed &quot;kosmotropes&quot;: ions that interact well with water, forming H-bonds and dehydrating proteins), and the ions at the end are the least (&quot;chaotropes&quot;: ions that free up water by breaking H-bonds between [[Structural Biochemistry/Water|water]] molecules, increasing protein solubility). {{note|ProteinsStruc}}

'''Cations''': N(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; Li&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; guanidinium

'''Anions''': SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; citrate &gt; tartrate &gt; F&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; Br&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; I&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; ClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; SCN&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

The starting molecules strengthen hydrophobic interactions by decreasing solubility of the nonpolar molecules, thus salting out the system. However, the later molecules begin to denature the structure of the protein because of strong ionic interactions that disrupt hydrogen bonding. Although the later molecules can be salted out through solutions such as Ammonia Sulfate, certain molecules can also experience salting in, where the solubility of the protein increases through the later molecules of the list.

==Dialysis==

Dialysis is a protein [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Purification|purification]] process that separates proteins from other small molecules, such as salt, by using a semipermeable membrane. This membrane contain micro pores through which the small molecules will escape. Therefore, protein molecules having dimensions significantly greater than the pore diameter are retained inside the dialysis bag. The small molecules and salt will diffuse out through the membrane and into the dialysate outside of the bag. This technique is useful to remove salt ions and other small molecule but can not be used to distinguish proteins. To enhance the separation of the proteins in the bag from other impurities such as salt we can also take advantage of the equilibrium constants. In an aqueous environment the salt will flow through the plasma membrane until its concentration outside the dialysis bag is equal to the concentration inside the bag. At this point there is no net flow of salt through the membrane because equilibrium is reached. But if we add in a new solution of buffer, then the remaining amount of salt will then flow out of the dialysis bag until the concentration of salt in the new buffer equals the concentration in the dialysis bag. If we keep replacing the buffer solution this will enhance the purity of the proteins inside the dialysis bag because each time we replace the buffer the salt has to flow out inorder to attain its equilibrium constant. This principle can also be applied for other impurities that are able to escape through the membrane.

==Dialysis in human body==

In kidney-compromised patients, dialysis is often used as a procedure for removing undesirable solutes in the blood.  For example, the calcium, potassium, and urea concentration of the dialysate is kept at low concentrations, enabling the target solutes in the blood to diffuse across the semi-permeable membrane.  However, this entails the dialysate to be constantly cleaned in order to prevent concentration equilibrium, which would ultimately lead to a rising concentration of unwanted solutes in the blood.  In another case, solutes can also be introduced into the blood.  For example, bicarbonate ions are in high concentration in the dialysate, which diffuse across the membrane.  This is done to prevent metabolic acidosis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Eventually, [[WB:ADMIN]] and [[WB:BOT]] (if ever approved) should get merged to here. Or maybe this should be a dab page and all rights get their own page... &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 00:08, 12 October 2008 (UTC)

:I think merging them into a single policy wouldn't be a bad idea, but I wonder if we'd ever be able to agree to it as one policy. I think the name needs to change though, maybe &quot;User tools&quot;. &quot;User rights&quot; might be confused with a Terms of Service type policy or what rights users have to use Wikibooks. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:33, 18 October 2008 (UTC)
::If they're all policies, then does it really matter what page(s) they're on? We don't have to re-negotiate [[Wikibooks:Administrators]] if we decide to move it elsewhere, do we? Or if we want to create [[Wikibooks:Bureaucrats]], we wouldn't need to have a discussion about what the policy would say, since that's already been determined (in [[Wikibooks:Administrators]]). So, I'd like to see the bot policy improved and approved first, then we can figure out if there's a more logical way to organize the policies concerning user rights.

      <comment>[[WB:REVERT|Reverted]] edits by [[Special:Contributions/184.90.150.174|184.90.150.174]] ([[User talk:184.90.150.174|talk]]) to last version by Adrignola</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This page documents two bots used extensively by countervandalism channels.

==Bot overview==
'''Computer''' was the original recent changes filtering bot written as a [[w:mIRC scripting language|mIRC script]], developed by [[user:White Cat|White Cat]]. It was replaced by pgkbot in 2005.

'''pgkbot''' is a [[w:Python (programming language)|python]] bot developed by [[user:pgk|pgk]]. It is designed for use in one channel, and includes a number of customization options such as plugin support, complex event routers, individual lists, individual user name and article title watchlists, detection of page move vandalism, and IP address categories (like open proxies). However, configuration is difficult and it is relatively resource-intensive.

'''SWBot''' is a [[w:C Sharp|C#]] bot developed by [[user:Tangotango|Tangotango]] and [[user:Az1568|Az1568]]. It is designed for use in networked or multiwiki channels. Features include dynamic loading and unloading of wikis and channels, a central configuration file and database, global lists, auto-broadcast of global changes to all other SWBot instances, and detection of page blanking and replacement using automated MediaWiki summaries. However, per-channel event configuration is not possible.

'''CVNbot''' is a unified centralized bot written in Perl by [[user:Pathoschild|Pathoschild]]. It is currently in development and not actively used. The bot is intended to facilitate channel network administration and provide edit monitoring, without extraneous features.

==pgkbot==
: ''Common bots: ErosionBot-1, MiszaBot, TheDJBot, ClueBot(RC).''

===Operation===
====Using commands====
Commands are issued to the bot by appending their name or &quot;computer&quot; to the beginning of the line. If you append the name, the command will only be recognized by the bot named. If you append &quot;computer&quot;, all bots present will recognize the command. For example, if you want to add a user to pgkbot's blacklist, you would say ''&lt;code&gt;pgkbot bl add username&lt;/code&gt;''. Alternately, you could add the user to the blacklist of every bot in the channel. This is recommended, as it synchronises the backup bots. To do this, you would say ''&lt;code&gt;computer bl add username&lt;/code&gt;''.

Which commands a user can issue depends on which list they are in.

| '''Operation'''
| Voiced users
| watchlist; intelligence; ''help'', ''status'', ''quiet'', ''speak''.
|-

|}

====Lists of users====
The bots maintain several lists of users, which can be reported, formatted, and treated differently from each other.

* '''Admins:'''  this is a list of admins on the project. The relevant command is ''&lt;code&gt;computer al add|del username&lt;/code&gt;''.
* '''Whitelist:''' this is the list of trusted users. The relevant command is ''&lt;code&gt;computer wl add|del username&lt;/code&gt;''.
* '''Greylist:''' this is a temporary blacklist which the bot automatically populates with users that have recently been reverted, or matched one of the bnu list expression. Entries can be removed from the list, but cannot be added manually.
* '''Blacklist:''' this is a list of suspicious users. All edits by blacklisted users are reported. The relevant command is ''&lt;code&gt;computer bl add|del username&lt;/code&gt;''.
* '''Bots:''' this is a list of bots on the project. The relevant command is ''&lt;code&gt;computer bot add|del user&lt;/code&gt;''.

====Reference table====
This table is a quick overview of commands. For additional help, address the following command to pgkbot on IRC: ''&lt;code&gt;pgkbot help &amp;lt;command&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;''. There are two optional flags which can be used with most commands. These can be used by appending them to the end of the command (expiry must be stated before the reason, if both are used).
* &quot;''&lt;code&gt;r=value&lt;/code&gt;''&quot; provides a reason. This is useful for other users, who may not know why something has been added to the list without.
* &quot;''&lt;code&gt;x=value&lt;/code&gt;''&quot; provides an expiry time in hours. After the specified number of hours, the command will be automatically undone.

Note that the symbols &quot;[|]&quot; are used in the table; these symbols should ''not'' be used with the bot (for example, use &quot;pgk add blah&quot; and not &quot;pgk [add] blah&quot;).

==SWMTBot==
: ''Common bots: SWBot* (except SWBot2), SWMTBot*, TheDJBot(3-5).''

===Comparison with pgkbot===
SWMTBot is a port of pgkbot to C#, specially made to suit the needs of the [[m:Small Wiki Monitoring Team|Small Wiki Monitoring Team]] and other users who monitor a large number of feeds in one channel. Most commands have been kept identical to their pgkbot equivalents except where necessary; messages have also been kept as close to pgkbot's as possible.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Features new to SWMTBot
! Features in pgkbot but not in SWMTBot
|- valign=&quot;top&quot;
| 
* Hot-pluggable wikis (load/unload on demand)
* Supports simultaneous monitoring of a very large number of wikis with minimal resource usage
* One small configuration file containing information for all wikis
* One SQLite database, using minimal resources, for all wikis
* Global blacklists/whitelists/greylists
* Global username/article title watchlists (supports regular expressions)
* Global edit summary watchlist (flags potentially vandalistic edit summaries; supports regular expressions)
* Auto-broadcast of all global lists to other SWMTBots

|}

===Usage===
====Lists====
All '''global''' lists are automatically synchronized across all SWMTBots; '''per-wiki''' lists are not. There is a global article watchlist for all wikis, and one for each one; you can add/delete/show items on the global list by leaving out the &quot;p=&quot; parameter (see the command lists below for more information).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Welcome to nuclear engineering. This book is designed to given you an overview of what nuclear engineers do and basic concepts and vocabulary in the nuclear field. This book will only make minimal use of calculus for derivation purposes only, but a working understanding of pre-calculus, elementary physics, and elementary chemistry is needed to fully understand the concepts.

So, why study nuclear engineering? What can you do with such specific knowledge?</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Metal-affinity column.jpg|thumb|An affinity column.]]

Affinity chromatography is an applicable technique used to purify [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|proteins]]. It is performed depending on the advantage of the high affinity of proteins for specific chemical groups. Affinity chromatography was discovered by Pedro Cuatrecasas and Meir Wilcheck in 1968.

This process is generally used to isolate interested protein from the pool of proteins. A column is filled with beads that contain covalently attached glucose residues. It is taken in consideration that these residues are chosen corresponding to the target protein. As the protein mixture is poured into the column, the proteins will travel down through the beads. The target protein will be recognized and get trapped to the column by [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Covalent bonds|covalent]] bond because of its affinity for glucose. The rest of proteins will run down to the column and be separated. The portion of buffer needed to be added to the column to wash out completely the unbounded protein. Lastly, a concentrated solution of glucose with be added to separate the target protein from the column-attached glucose residues. 

The starting part included an undefined heterogeneous mixture of molecules in solution. The desired molecules will have defined property which can be exploited during the affinity purification process. The process is a setup in which the target molecule becoming trapped on stationary medium. The non-target heterogeneous mixture will not become trapped due to its unbounded ability. The solid medium can then be removed from the mixture, washed multiple times, and the target molecule released from the entrapment in a process known as elution with high concentration of specific chemicals or altering the conditions to decrease the binding ability. Also, it is important that the reaction is carried in an appropriate pH; otherwise, it may reduce the affinity and change the conformation of the proteins, preventing the target protein to bind to the residues as expected.

Affinity chromatography is a powerful means of isolating transcription factors, proteins that regulate gene expression by binding to specific [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/DNA|DNA]] sequences. A protein mixture is percolated through a column containing specific DNA sequences attached to a matrix. Proteins with a high affinity for the sequence will bind and be retained. In this instance, the transcription factor is released by washing with a solution containing a high concentration of salt. 

In general, affinity chromatography can be effectively used to isolate a protein that recognizes group X by:covalently attaching X or a derivative of it to a column, adding a mixture of proteins to this column, which is then washed with buffer to remove unbound proteins, eluting the desired protein by adding a high concentration of a soluble form of X or altering the conditions to decrease binding affinity. Affinity chromatography is most effective when the interaction of the protein and the molecule that is used as the bait is highly specific.

== Utilization ==
Affinity chromatography is mainly used in biochemistry to 

• Purify certain proteins from a mixture 

• Reduce the amount of a certain protein molecule in a mixture of multiple proteins

• Discover the affinity of substances to biological compounds, in this case protein.

[[Image:tinoCM.jpg|thumb| Carboxylmethyl group used to bind positive charge group]]

== Combinatorial Chemistry ==
Affinity chromatography can also be used in combinatorial chemistry (in-vitro evolution), in which you can imitate the process of evolution by creating large sets of molecules and selecting for a specific function. In this case, you start from a diverse population of molecules, then select for particular proteins, and reproduce that molecule. For instance, starting with a randomized pool of RNA segments and an ATP affinity column, you would apply the RNA pool to the top of the column. Next, you would allow the selection of ATP-binding molecules to occur, eluting from the RNA pool all the segments that did not bind to the ATP. Then to elute the bound RNA molecules, you apply ATP to the top of the column. This isolates the selected RNA molecules that are bound to ATP. You can expand this selection by using different salt concentrations, with increased salt concentrations being more selective.

== Immunoaffinity  Chromatography ==
An example of  immunoaffinity chromatography is  by   the use of blood antibodies. Blood antibodies  can  be  purified  by  use of affinity  purification form the  blood plasma (serum). If there is antibodies in the blood plasma that are against  some  particular antigen  we can use this for the antigen purification  by  using affinity.    
A common example to see if  an organism is  immune against a GST-fusion protein  by observing if it produces antibodies against  GST tag and the fusion-protein.  Foremost, the  GST affinity  matrix is allowed to  bind to the  blood plasma.  Allowing the blood plasma to  bind helps remove antibodies  against the GST. Separation of the blood plasma form the solid  helps it bind to the GST-fusion protein matrix which in turn  traps the antigen that is recognized by the antibody in the solid support. Using  low pH ( pH  3 )  buffers for  elution helps obtain the  desired antibodies. Collection of the eluate is mostly  done in phosphate buffer to neutralized the low pH.

==Immobilized metal ion affinity chromatography (IMAC)==

IMAC is particular based on  coordination with covalent bonds form amino acids to metals. The concept of this technique  is to keep  in the  column proteins with affinity to the metal ions which get immobilized inside the column.  Iron, gallium  or  zinc can be used to  purify  phosphorylated proteins  or peptides.  Common metals for binding histidine are copper, cobalt, and  nickel.  DNA recombinant  technologies are use since  many  natural occurring proteins  do not  have affinity to metal ions.

== Interaction materials ==
These are typical biochemical interactions in nature that have been used extensively in affinity chromatography:

•  Enzyme will bind to substrate analogue, inhibitor, and cofactor

•  Lectin will bind to polysaccharide, glycoprotein, cell surface receptor, cell

•  Antibody will bind to antigen, virus, cell

•  Nucleic acid will attach to complementary base sequence, histones, nucleic acid polymerase, and nucleic acid binding protein

•  Hormone, vitamin will bind to receptor, carrier protein

•  Glutathione will bind to glutathione-S-transferase or GST fusion proteins

•  Metal ions will attach to Poly (His) fusion proteins, native proteins with histidine, cysteine and tryptophan residues on their surfaces.

==First technique==

Commonly, affinity chromatography will be done through column chromatography. First of all, the binding ability of protein must be studied. Then, the solid medium modified with the binding material is packed in a chromatography column. Then, the initial mixture that contained desired proteins was added through the column to allow binding to occur. A wash buffer was gradually added to the addition of mixture. The elution buffer subsequently removes unbounded protein from the column and collected. 

[[File:Affinity Chromatography Technique.jpg]]

== Elution Methods ==
There is no generally applicable elution methods for all affinity media. When substances are very tightly bounded to the affinity medium, it may be useful to stop the flow after applying eluent, usually 10 minutes to 2 hours is referred, before continuing the elution process. This extra time helps to improve recovery percentage of bounded protein.

Forces that maintain the complex of substrate and bound substances include electrostatic interactions, hydrophobic interactions, and hydrogen bonding. Agents that deteriorate these interactions may be expected to function as efficient eluting agents. The optimal flow rate to achieve efficiency may vary according to the specific interaction.

== pH elution method ==
This is one of most common techniques that are used to remove bounded protein from the ligands. A change in pH alters the charged groups on the ligands and/or the bound protein. This change may directly affect the binding sites and reducing their affinity. On the other hand, a change in pH can cause indirect modification in affinity by altering in conformation of proteins. A sudden decrease in pH is one of the most common methods to elute bounded proteins. The chemical stability of the ligand and target proteins determines the limitation of pH change. The column should always return to neutral pH immediately after the elution to avoid irreversible denature of proteins.

== Ionic strength changing method ==
Changing ionic strength of buffer solution will alter the specific interaction between the ligand and target protein. This method is a mild elution using a buffer with increased ionic strength usually sodium chloride,  applied as a linear gradient or in steps. 

== Competitive agents elution ==
Selective eluents are often utilized to separate substances on a specific medium or in the presence of high binding affinity of the ligand/target protein interaction. The eluting agent competes either for binding to the target protein or for binding to the ligand. This is an example of competitive inhibitors that occur in nature. Substances may be eluted either by a concentration gradient of a single eluent.
In this method, the concentration of competitive agents should be added equally to the concentration of the coupled ligand. However, if the free competing compound binds more weakly than the ligand to the target protein, use a higher concentration of competitive agent to achieve efficiency in elution.

For example of competitive affinity chromatography, There is R1a protein. The target R1a protein bind to cAMP resin. The interaction between R1a protein and cAMP would separate by using cGMP elution buffer. This cGMP compete with target protein, however the elution buffer which contains high concentration of cGMP would bind to resin more. The separated R1a protein will eluted out.
[[File:CAMP.svg|thumb|cAMP]]

==Reduced polarity of eluent==
Conditions are used to lower the polarity of the eluent promote elution without inactivating the proteins. Dioxane or ethylene glycol are typical of this type of eluent.

==Chaotropic eluents==
In case of other elution methods fail, deforming buffer solution, which alters the structure of proteins, can be used to achieve separation of ligand and target proteins. Typical chaotropic agents are guanidine hydrochloride and urea. Although this method will yield the highest percentage of recovery, chaotropes method should be avoided whenever possible since they are to denature the eluted protein.
[[File:Harnstoff.svg|thumb|Urea]]
[[File:Guanidinium chloride V.2.svg|thumb|Guanidinium chloride]]

==Histidine tag==
Affinity chromatography can be performed using a number of different protein tags. One of the common tag using in laboratory is poly-hisitidine. Its shortness in length prevents altering the conformation of the tagged protein. Histidine tagging is favorable because it is very specific, allowing for a high level of purification. 

The gene which encodes for a specific protein is first modified to include the tag. A string of histidine residues may be added to the amino or carboxyl terminus of the expressed protein. The tagged proteins are then passed through a column of beads containing covalently attached, immobilized nickel(II) (Ni 2&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.) This His-tag binds tightly to the immobilized metal ions because the side chain of Histidine, imidazole, has a specific binding affinity to metal ions (in this case, nickel II). As a result, the desired protein is binded tightly to the beads while other proteins flow through the column easily. Even other, non-desired proteins, that have Histidine side chains will flow through because they do not have as many as the desired, tagged protein, which would have about 6 adjacent Histidine residues. The protein can then be eluted from the column by addition of imidazole or some other chemicals that bind to the metal ions and displace the proteins. The presence of desired proteins can be verified through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

[[Image:Histag.jpg|450px]]
[[Image:L-Histidin - L-Histidine.svg|thumb|Histidine]]

'''Nickel resin regeneration'''

In recombinant DNA, histidine tag on the desired protein and Nickel resin are commonly used to purify desired protein via affinity chromatography. That is, histidine has strong affinity towards the nickel resin which does not flow through the column. Undesired proteins do not have the designed histidine sequences hence could not bind to Nickel resin; those protein flow though the column. During elution, we add a relatively high concentration of imidazole buffer. Imidazole compete with our desired protein to bind with the nickel resin. 
In practice, Nickel resin is rather expensive. Regeneration of Nickel resin is essential. It involves several steps. First, there are possible left over protein remained on used Nickel resin; these left over protein are denatured and washed away using Guanidinium chloride and corresponding buffer. The Nickel resin is washed with Milli Q water and increasing concentration of Ethanol. One essential step in Nickel resin regeneration is recharging the Nickel. We first remove the Nickel with EDTA, which is a hexa-dendate compound that releases the Nickel ion. The Resin would then turn white without Nickel. Then the resin is recharged with high concentration of nickel salt to obtain our slightly green resin.

[[File:Nickel-resin regeneration.jpg|thumb|Add caption here]]

==  Glutathione S-transferase (GST) tags ==
GST has an affinity for glutathione, which is available immobilized as glutathione agarose. An excess amount of gluthione is used to displace the tagged protein for elution. Together with the histidine tags, the [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Purification|purification]] of recombinant proteins like GST tags is the most common use of affinity chromatography.
[[File:Glutathion.svg|thumb|Glutathione]]

GST are enzymes involving cellular defense against electrophillic compounds. It has hing affinity and specificity to bind with glutathinone. The strength and selectivity of this interaction allow GST tagged proteins to be purified by the glutathione-based protein resins. The glutathione resins selectively bind to GST-tagged proteins effectively, allowing the specific protein of interest be separated from the mixture at high efficiency. 

GST is a 35-KDa protein, it has small peptides. It is this characteristic which allows one to perform GST-protein purification quickly without degradation by proteases and minimize sample loss.GST will lose its ability to bind Glutathione resin when it is denatured, therefore, strong denaturant such as Guanidine-HCl and urea cannot be added in the buffers.

== Lectin Affinity Chromatography ==
Lectin protein, for example concanavalin A which is originally extracted from the jack-bean Canavalia ensiformis, binds specifically to some certain structures in sugars. Lectin affinity chromatography is one kind of affinity chromatography in which the plant protein concanavalin A is purified by passing a crude extract through a column of beads containing covalently attached glucose residues. Since it has affinity to glucose, concanavalin A will bind to this type of column. A concentrated solution of glucose is then added to remove the bound concanavalin A from the column.

== Advantages and disadvantages ==
=== Advantages ===
•  Affinity chromatography is a fairly achievable technique because of the great selectivity of the glucose residues and the target protein, giving purified product with a high yield of recovery.

1•  It can be a one step process in many cases.

2•  The technique can be used for substances of low concentration. 

3•  Rapid separation is achieved while avoiding contamination.

4. Unlike Gel filtration chromatography and ion-exchange chromatography, affinity chromatography would be able to isolate one specific protein at a time, where other techniques will isolate proteins with similar characteristics.

=== Disadvantages ===

•  The interaction of proteins of interest and ligand has to be determined carefully. This process required expensive materials, time, and small amount of protein that can be processed at once.

&lt;b&gt;Protein Purification &lt;/b&gt; is the process of separating proteins for individual analysis. Protein purification is the second step of studying proteins, the first being the process of an assay. An assay is a procedure to measure the activity enzyme activity thus confirming the presence of the protein or proteins in interest. Popular assays include [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Western Blotting|Western Blotting]] and [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Enzyme-Linked Immunoabsorbent Assay (ELISA)|ELISA]](Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). Before the purification process, [[/Cell Disruption|Cell Disruption]] is utilized to homogenize the cell's content.  After the cell has been opened up, the process of purifying proteins from one another and the other [[Structural Biochemistry/Cell Organelles|organelles]] can be approached in several different methods.  Protein mixtures are normally separated multiple times, each based on a different property, such as: 
* Solubility
* Size
* Molecular Weight
* Charge
* Binding affinity 

The intended reason for purifying a specific protein governs the level and degree of protein purification. At times, a sample of protein that is only moderately purified suffices for its intended application; however, other situations require a higher degree of purification, especially if the fundamental ambition is to study the characteristics and tendencies of the specific protein in interest. By considering solubility, size, molecular weight, charge, and binding affinity, the goal of the scientist that conducts protein purification is to find a level of purification necessary and create a protein yield that is ample for further research and application. This means using the fewest amount of steps in order to keep the yield high, as each protein purification step incurs a degree of product loss. Therefore two factors serve as obstacles in protein purification: yield and purification level. The main goal of each protein purification project falls under two categories: analytical (for studying and research purposes) and preparative (for production and creation of commercial products).

&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td width=&quot;20%&quot;&gt;Proteins are separated based on masses or densities by a centrifugal force.  Centrifugation enables the separation of proteins in different cell compartments. &lt;td&gt;Different proteins precipitate at different salt concentration. When the concentration of salt increases, more proteins are able to separate.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Large molecules flow more rapidly to the bottom of the column.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt; Proteins are separated according to its charge. Positively charged proteins bind to negatively charge bead, and negatively charge proteins are released. The negatively charged proteins flow through faster.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Many proteins have high affinity for specific chemical groups.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Proteins separate according to different levels of hydrophobicity.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; Electrophoresis separate protein while the gel enhances the separation. Small proteins move more rapidly through the gel.&lt;/td&gt; &lt;td&gt; Different proteins have different pI (isoelectric point).&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Proteins are separated horizontally based on pI and vertically based on mass&lt;/td&gt;.&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;Proteins are separated through a semi-permeable membrane. Since the dimensions of proteins are generally larger than the pores of the membrane, proteins do not pass through and separate.&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The most popular method to synthesize peptides of more than 50 [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acids]] in length is automated solid-phase peptide synthesis. R. Bruce Merrifield first developed this method, and it can be used for both [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/DNA|DNA]] and [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/RNA|RNA]]. To begin the process, the carboxyl-terminal amino acid of the desired sequence is anchored to polystyrene beads, and the peptide is synthesized backwards from the C-terminal end to the N-terminal end (contrary to the usual sequence from the N-terminal end to the C-terminal end). The t-Boc protected group of this amino acid is then removed by a wash with trifluoroacetic acid (CF3COOH) and methylene chloride (CH2Cl2), which does not break [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Covalent bonds|covalent]] bonds. The next amino acid with t-boc (di-tri-butyl dicarbonate), a protected N-terminal, and a DCC (dicyclohexylcarbodiimide)-activated C-terminal is added to the reaction column. After the formation of the [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Important Organic Reactions in Biochemistry/Peptide Bonding|peptide bond]], the excess reagents and dicyclohexylurea are washed away with an appropriate solvent. For the elongation of the peptides, the next amino acids continue to be added in the same manner. At the end of the synthesis, the peptide is released from the polystyrene beads by adding hydrofluoric acid (HF), which cleaves the ester bond without destroying the peptide bonds. Protected groups on the reactive side chains, such as lysine or histamine, also are removed at this time. The huge advantage of this method, besides the fact it is automated, lies in the purification step. Because the impurities are not bound to the reaction column, they can be washed away without losing the synthesized product. In the laboratories, this technique is used to synthesize drugs, such as insulin.

==Processes==
===Transcription===
It starts in the nucleus. It is very similar to the [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/DNA|DNA]] replication process in which the DNA is &quot;unzipped&quot; by helicase, producing one nucleotide chain ready to be replicated.

Transcription 3 Steps summary –&gt; Producing an RNA message from DNA

(A) Binding and Initiation

DNA transcription unit divided into TATA Box and Enhencer region. TBP is bind to TATA region, other transcription factors (a protein has bound to the region) such as TFIIA and TFIIB are bonded to TATA regions as well. The RNA polymerase cannot bind to the DNA directly unless a transcription factor is bind first. Transcription begins when RNA polymerases bind to the enhancer region( or called the initiation site), separate it into two strands by requiring ATP energy Initiation initiate the location of the DNA strand to begin transcription.

(B) Elongation

RNA polymerase moves along the DNA promoter region by performs two elongate steps:

1)      it untwists (unwind) the double helix DNA about 10 bases at a time at 3.4 A. 

2)      adds nucleotides to the 3’ end of the growing RNA.  

As the RNA polymerase moves along, the growing mRNA molecule was replicated base on base.  Transcription goes about 60 nucleotides per second. DNA’s nucleotides Adenine will be complimentary to RNA’s Uracil base. DNA’s nucleotides Guanine will pair with Cytosine. 

(C) Termination

Transcription proceeds until the RNA polymerase reaches a termination site. No more RNA nucleotides will be added and the mRNA is released. So, mRNA will move out of the nucleus into the cytoplasm for the further use in protein synthesis.

===Translation===
The [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/RNA/Messenger RNA (mRNA)|mRNA]] codons translates to amino acid polypeptide chains in three steps.

3 steps general guidance of translation

Initiation
2.	Small subunits ribosomal attaches to mRNA. Large Subunit of ribosome is bind to small subunit with A site (entry for tRNA.)and P site ( leaving door for tRNA.) first attach to a tRNA. anticodon( nucleotide triplet in tRNA) is attaching to A site (entry site) to paired with 3 nucleotide codons from mRNA. tRNA carries an amino acid. As shown by the graph below, tRNA.  carry an amino acid on the top 

Elongation
3.	Initiator tRNA. then moved to P site and A site is opened for the second triplet coded tRNA. to enter along with another amino acid. After the second tRNA. is bind to A site. The amino acid is then bonded together by peptide bonds. Afterwards the third tRNA comes in right after the second tRNA. move to P site. (Moving along from 3’’ to 5’’) 
4.	ribosomal enzymes link the amino acid into a chain. The process will continue until the stop codon (UAA) is reached. 
 
Termination
 
5.	a stop codon is reached (UAA, UAG, or UGA).  A protein called a release factor binds in the A-site to the termination codon. The ribosomes adds a wtaer molecule to the end of the polypeptide chain.
6.	ribosome dissociates into its component parts

==Advantages==
Good yield and high purity. All reactions are carried out in the single vessel, eliminating losses caused by the repeated transfer of products. This method is good for synthesizing long chain of peptide (50 residues and above).

==Synthetic Peptides==
Peptides can be made synthetically by linking an amino group of one amino acid to the [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Organic Functional Group/Carboxyl|carboxyl]] group of another; this being an example of a condensation reaction. A condensation reaction is the reaction when two molecules come together, releasing water, to form one molecule. 

Peptide synthesis can be specific; meaning specific/desired products can be formed. To make unique products and to prevent side reactions, protecting groups such as tert-butyloxycarbonyl (t-Boc) are used. T-Boc is used in the first step of the formation of simple peptides. This protecting group, in order to block the alpha-amino group, reacts with the alpha-amino group forming a complex [[Image:known as   t-butyloxycarbonyl amino acid. The blocking of the amino group is followed by the activation of the carboxyl group of the same amino acid. The carboxyl group is activated by dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC). 

Now, with the alterations being done to the amino group and the [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Organic Functional Group/Carboxyl|carboxyl]] group of the first amino acid, a second amino acid can be linked to the first amino acid. The second amino acid has a free amino group, meaning not blocked, and it links to the activated carboxyl group of the first; forming a rigid peptide bond and releasing dicyclohexylurea. The carboxyl group of the newly formed dipeptide is activated with DCC and ready to react with a third amino acid which has a free amino group. Again, a new peptide bond is formed and dicyclohexylurea is released. This process can be performed continuously until the desired peptide is synthesized. To end the synthesis, dilute acid, which removes the t-Boc and leaves the peptide undisturbed, is added. 

[[Image:tinoDCC.jpg|thumb|Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC)]]

Solid-phase method is used to form synthetic peptides that contain more than 50 amino acids.  It involves binding the last amino acid's carboxyl group to polystyrene beads. The anchored amino acids t-Boc is removed, and the next amino acid with t-Boc protected amino group and DCC activated carboxyl group is added to the amino acid with polystyrene beads. The peptide bond forms, and the peptide with polystyrene beads is filtered and washed, so the peptide is pure before the synthesis is continued. The following amino acids are linked with the same process until the desired peptide is synthesized. Finally, the finished peptide is removed from the beads by using hydrofluoric acid(HF).

Peptide ligation is used to synthesize peptides with more than 100 amino acids. The long peptide is formed from two or more smaller sized peptides with no protecting groups on them. Native thiol ligation is the most powerful and widely used peptide ligation. The long peptide is formed from peptides with thioester on C-terminal carboxyl group and the other peptides with cysteine on N-terminal. The thioester on C-terminal carboxyl group of one peptide reacts with the cysteine on N-terminal of another peptide to form a thioester-linked intermediate. The intermediate is then rearranged(S-&gt;N acyl shift) to form a peptide bond. The small sized unprotected peptides are linked by this process to synthesize the long peptide.

==Utilization==
Synthetic peptides are made for many purposes.  These peptides can act as antigens, which will stimulate the immune system of the body to produce antibodies that target such peptide.  These antibodies can then be used to isolate a protein.  Peptides can also isolate receptors for hormones. 

Synthetic peptides can also be used as drugs. Such example is the synthetic analog of Vasopressin, also known as 1-Desamino-8-D-arginine vassopressin. This synthetic peptide is used to treat patients with diabetes insipidus who lacks the peptide hormone vasopressin, which cause them to urinate excess liquid from their body. By using the analog of vasopressin to substitute for the natural vasopressin, such patients can be treated.

[[Image:vasopressin.jpg]]

Lastly, synthetic peptides can be used to gain a greater understanding of the 3D structure of proteins. Using synthetic proteins to study the 3D structure of proteins is extremely helpful because such peptides can include many amino acids that are not found in normal proteins; meaning these peptides are not limited to just the 20 standard amino acids. This result in a much greater variety of structures.

== Solid-Phase Peptide Synthesis ==
Polypeptide synthesis can be automated, known as the Merrifield solid-phase peptide synthesis, which uses a solid support of polystyrene to support a peptide chain. Polystyrene is a polymer whose subunits are derived from ethenylbenzene.

[[Image:Polystyrene linear.svg|thumb|Polystyrene]]

The beads of polystyrene are insoluble and rigid when they are dry; however, they swell in certain organic solvents, dichloromethane for example. Therefore, reagents are able to move in and out of the polymer matrix easily. The phenyl groups on polystyrene are functionalized by electrophilic aromatic substitution.

Using a dipeptide as an example, the solid-phase synthesis of peptide on chloromethylated polystyrene proceeds as follows.

1. Attach protected amino acid

2. Deprotect amino terminal

3. Coupling to the second protected amino acid

4. Deprotect amino terminal

5. Disconnect dipeptide from polystyrene

==Purpose of dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC)==
Dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) is used specifically in peptide synthesis in order to activate the electrophilicity of the carboxylate group. This allows the C-terminus to be more favorable as an attachment site for other amino acids. Then the negatively charged oxygen will act as a nucleophile which attacks the center carbon in DCC. This intermediate will eventually be converted into urea, a stable end product that is relatively unreactive throughout the remaining peptide synthesis process. In addition, DCC's activation ability may sometimes racemize peptide bonds if not monitored correctly, therefore sometimes triazoles may be used instead which do not racemize the stereochemistry of peptides.

[[Image:Solid-Phase Synthesis of Peptide.jpg]]

==Advantage of solid-phase synthesis==
The advantage of solid-phase synthesis is that the products can be isolated easily since all the intermediates are immobilized on polystyrene. Thus, the products can be purified by filtration and washing. Repetition of the deprotection-coupling process will be able to synthesize larger peptides. A machine, designed by Merrifield, is able to carry out the series of manipulations automatically.

==Protecting Groups==
Peptide bond can be formed from the carboxyl group and amino group on the main chains of amino acids. It also can be formed from the side chains to synthesize an undesired peptide. In order to synthesize a desired peptide, protecting groups are used to prevent the formation of undesired products. They also prevent the polymerization from the excess amino acids used in the reaction. Protecting groups also aid in ensuring that the stereochemistry of certain amino acids remain unchanged. Configurations of amino acids may have their stereoisomers changed or racemized if not properly protected as well.

==t-butyloxycarbonyl(t-Boc) protecting group==
It is used to protect the N-terminal amino groups as well as the side chains of lysine, arginine, asparagine, and glutamine. Di-t-butyldicarbonate reacts with the NH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of amino acid to form a t-Boc-amino acid. t-Boc group can be removed under acidic condition. Typically, they are treated with strong acid or Trifluoroacetic acid(TFA), CF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH. In the lab, Boc-amino acids are also available to buy since it can be synthesized easily in large quantity. People who synthesize peptides do not have to make Boc-amino acid on their own.  Solid phase synthesis is effective because it allows the protein to remain in a primary structured configuration rather than being complicated by secondary or tertiary intermolecular interactions.

[[Image:TFA.jpg|thumb|Trifluoroacetic acid used to remove t-Boc group]]

==Solution-Phase Peptide Synthesis (Using Benzyloxycarbonyl(Z) as protecting group)==
Benzyloxycarbonyl is used to protect the N-terminal amino groups as well as the side chains of lysine, arginine, asparagine, and glutamine. The synthesis starts at the N-terminus and ends at C-terminus. For example, here are steps to synthesize a simple peptide such as Ala-Val:

First Step: Benzyl choloroformate react with the N-terminus of alanine, forming benzyloxycarbonyl alanine (alanine with the N-ternimus protected by Z-group). Typically, triethylamine is used as catalyst for this reaction. 

Second Step: The protected alanine is treated with ethyl choloroformate. Carboxyl group of the alanine was activated by forming anhydride. It is sensitive to any nucleophilic attack from the N-terminus of Valine.

Third step: Valine is added to the protected, activated alanine. This forms peptide bond, connecting Valine and Alanine. We'll have the product of Z-Ala-Valine. Notice that the N-terminus is still being protected after this step. 

Final Step: The Z-protected group was removed by hydrogenolysis under mild condition with metal such as Pd acting as catalyst. (check the image for detailed reactions in each step)

[[Image:Solution-base-synthesis.jpg|thumb|Synthesis of Ala-Valine, using solution-phase synthesis]]

In order to synthesize a larger protein, we have the repeat the second and third step. Activating the C-terminus and then, coupling the next amino acid. The advantages of this synthesis are it works very fast, and have a good percentage yield of the product. However, it can only be used for  small protein chain. The yields become smaller with larger protein. Therefore, solid-phase is more preferred with large protein. 

 

[[Image:zgroup.jpg|thumb|Z-group protecting group]]

==9Fluoronylmethyoxycarbonyl(Fmoc) protecting group==
It is used to protect the N-terminal amino groups as well as the side chains of lysine, arginine, asparagine, and glutamine. Fmoc can be removed by piperidine/DMF.
[[Image:fmoc.jpg|thumb|220px|Fmoc protecting group]]
[[File:Piperidin.svg|thumb|220px|Piperidine. Used to remove Fmoc group]]

==t-butyl and benzyl protecting groups==
They are used to protect the C-terminal carboxyl groups as well as the side chains of serine, threonine, tyrosine, glutamate, and aspartate. t-butanol or benzenol reacts with the hydroxyl groups or carboxyl groups of amino acids to form t-butyl or benzyl amino acid. t-butyl or benzyl can be removed by strong acid and catalytic hydrogenation.

Mass spectrometry is an analytical technique used for identifying the mass of a compound based on the mass-to-charge ratio of charged particles. The ratio of charge to mass of the particles is determined by passing them through an applied electric field in a mass spectrometer, which has three main modules: an ion source, a mass analyzer, and a detector. In such procedure, a sample of protein for analysis is placed in the MS instrument. A laser beam is applied to allow the sample to become ionized at the ion source. Positively charged ions of different sizes result and move through the electric field through the analyzer. The lighter ions arrive at the detector first, which triggers a clock to record the time of flight (TOF). This is characteristic of MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, which can determine the mass of individual components of large protein complexes. 

Mass spectrometry is used to analyze the ionized forms of molecules in the gas phase. Mass data is obtained by measuring how fast the ion accelerates through an applied electric field and using Newton's third law, F = ma where F is force, m is mass, and a the acceleration, to calculate the mass since the applied force is known and the acceleration is the experimentally measured value. 

Modern techniques for protein analysis include Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization (MALDI) and Electrospray Ionization (ESI). Advances to this technique has now made it possible to determine protein masses with an accuracy of one mass unit or less in most cases.

== Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption-Ionization (MALDI) ==
The protein or peptide is co-precipitated with an organic compound that absorbs laser light in the matrix. The laser light causes the molecules to expel from the surface and capture electrons as it exits the matrix, leaving the molecules as negatively charged ions.  This ionization is very necessary because only ions can be accurately measured.  The ionizing laser pulse triggers a clock that measures the time of flight (TOF) for the ions.  In time of flight (TOF) analysis, the ions are accelerated through the flight tube in an electric field toward the detector.  The lighter ions will arrive first.  One of the biggest benefits in using MALDI, as opposed to molecule ionization methods is that MALDI can give molecular fragments, which accurately represent the molecular mass of a protein or peptide.  In general weights ranging from a few thousand to several hundred thousand Daltons can be measured.&lt;ref&gt;{{citebook | last = Skoog, Holler, Crouch | year = 2007 | title = Principles of Instrumental Analysis | edition = 6th | publisher = Thomson Brooks/Cole | id = 978-0-495-01201-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== '''Electrospray Ionization (ESI)'''  ==

[[Image:Fenn ESI Instrument.jpg|thumb|An ESI machine]]

Electrospray Ionization is an ionization technique used for tiny amounts of large molecules such as polymers and proteins, and peptides. The apparatus usually utilizes a hollow metal tube with a sharply pointed end that faces in front of a plate. During the procedure, a sample solution is sprayed, as if from a syringe, from the metal tube, into a strong electric field with the assistance of warm nitrogen for dissovling. The solutions containing proteins or peptides flow through a fine metallic tip at a nonzero electrical potential which releases the solution as electrically charged droplets containing the protein and solvent that evaporates from the droplet, leaving the protein charged at the plate. A great feature of the ESI spectrum is the ability of the ions to carry multiple charges. This technique is often coupled with mass spectrometry for protein analysis. 

===History of ESI===
The research on mass spectroscopy started long time ago, but it was not until the 20th century when the electospray ionization technique was developed. The ESI was developed by 2002 Chemistry Nobel Prize winner, Dr. John B Fenn. Together with two other scientists, Tanaka Koichi and Kurt Wuthrich, Dr. Fenn focused the research in the field of mass spectrometry. especially on the ESI technique. Dr. Fenn's research discovery was quickly put into practical use. The ESI brought many benefits during the different usages. For instance, it increased the speed with which complex new pharmaceutical compounds could be evaluated. With this usage, it led to the development of AIDS medications in the mid 1990s.

===Properties that make ESI a method of choice for biological applications===
1. The phage conversion process is &quot;soft&quot;--meaning that it can handle very fragile molecules to be ionized. Furthermore, in some cases, even noncovalent interactions can be put through Mass Spectroscopy.&lt;br /&gt;
2. Allows for the analysis of complex mixtures because the eluting fractions can be directly sprayed into the MS&lt;br /&gt;
3. Produces natural ions, allowing for the measurement of high-mass biopolymers

===ESI Instruments===
====Quattro II====
One of the three instruments used for electrospray ionization, Quattro II is the primary instrument used for LR ESI. This instrument is a quadrupole-hexapole-quadrupole mass spectrometer. It has a mass to change rate of 4,000 Da and equipped with an ESI source. During the procedure, samples are inserted into the Quattro II by loop injection or direct infusion through a syringe pump. 

====LCQ====
The LCQ instrument is also known as the LCQ Deca XP. This is also an electrospray ionization or ion trap mass spectrometer. It is equipped with the X calibur software that allows acquisition of photodiode array data and mass spectral data. This equipment has a great advantage compared to the other instruments, and it is the capability to perform multiple stages of mass spectrometry. The ability to do this allows an increase in the amount of structural information obtainable for a given molecule. The injection techniques of the LCQ is similar to that of the Quattro, but in slight variations. The LCQ can also be introduced by flow injection using an LC pump or injection valve. Another way is by the LC fitted with a colume. While the Quattro II is the primary instrument for LR ESI, LCQ is the primary instrument for LC/MS and LC/MSMS in ESI. 

====Q-Tof====
The Q-Tof is a hybrid quadrupole mass spectrometer with MS/MS capability. Compared to the other two instrument, Q-Tof has a very high resolution, sensitivity, and mass accuracy. With these properties, the Q-Tof is able to assist the mass measurement accuracy for peptides. At the mean time, it can also improved the charge state identification of multiply charged ions and greater differentiation of isobaric species. This instrument can also be equipped with different source. For example, when it is equipped with a nanospray source, it can help to analyze small samples and identify the proteins through semi or complete de novo sequencing. Just like Quattro II and LCQ, Q-Tof can be used by injecting samples through an infusion pump, loop injection, or even an HPLC column. Different from the other two instrument, the Q-Tof is the primary instrument for HR ESI.

===New Applications of ESI for Mass Spectrometry===
Mass spectrometry is an analytical technique used to investigate protein complexes. Recent developments of electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) have allows characterization of previously unavailable protein complexes, especially those in the gas phase. ESI-MS allows the study of the kinetics of protein complex assembly. Intermediates can be isolated as well as identified using this method. Furthermore, tandem mass spectrometry is used to determine the building blocks that form the global structure of protein complexes. Moreover, ESI-MS is used to identify equilibrium constants by comparing the relative intensity of the complex to the intensity of the subunits. Finally, ion mobility spectrometry mass spectrometry (IMS-MS) is used to analyze macromolecular assemblies. It gives information on the size, shape, mass-to-charge ratio, and number of subunits. This allows the identification of protein rings and protein complex dissociation.

===Tandem Mass Spectrometry===
[[File:MS MS.png|thumb|MS MS]]
Individual spectrometer elements or a single mass spectrometer are used in multiple stages of mass analysis separation corresponding to MS steps separated in space or time. In tandem mass spectrometry in space, individual spectrometer elements are separated physically, and these elements can be transmission quadrupole, sectors, or time-of-flight. While in tandem mass spectrometer in time, the separation step is done with multiple steps occurring over a range of time and with the ions trapped in the same place, or space. A quadruple ion trap or FTMS instrument can be applied to such analysis, as it performs analysis on a multiple scale. It is often known as MSn. n refers to the number of steps, hence MS3 refers to a separation composed of three steps.

== Approaches for the Analysis of Proteins ==
There are two main ways for the mass spectroscopy analysis of proteins: the bottom-up approach and the top-down approach. In the bottom-up approach, an enzyme, such as trypsin, will be put together with proteins of interest for digestion. The &quot;tryptic peptides&quot; formed as a result of the digestion process are then analyzed by MS and tandem MS. On the other hand with the top-down approach, a protein molecule is analyzed by MS without prior digestion by enzymes. The bottom-up approach is more widely used for several advantages over the top-down approach:

1. Smaller protein ions are more uniform and easy to handle than a whole protein molecule;

2. Masses of smaller protein ions can be determined with higher accuracy;

3. During MS, smaller pieces of proteins are more readily to be reduced into fragments.

However, the one main disadvantage of this approach is the incomplete coverage of the protein molecule. The top-down approach appears to own this advantage while having a lot of other problems, including:

1. The difficulty in handling large protein molecules;

2. Issues about heterogeneity through a whole protein molecule;

3. The complex nature of MS.

Therefore, the top-down analyzes are limited to be applied to only low-throughput single-protein studies. To improve the results of such methods, scientists have come out with an intermediate &quot;middle-down&quot; approach for analyzing proteins that are larger than the smaller protein fragments, such as tryptic pedtides. Although this method is still in development, it is beginning to prove effective, as can be seen in the analysis of modifications on histone tails.&lt;ref&gt;Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2011. 80:239-46 ''The Annual Review of Biochemistry'' is online at biochem.annualreviews.org&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application of MALDI-TOF MS(mass spectrometry)  ==
Usually, the characterization and identification of protein is done by SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide 
gel electrophoresis). However, SDS-PAGE cannot identify small amount of protein samples. MALDI-TOF MS has higher sensitivity
and resolution. MALDI-TOF MS can separate protein samples up to 100 kilo Daltons. Therefore, MALDI-TOF MS is used after 
SDS-PAGE for more accuracy.

First, sample protein is separated by two-dimensional gel. Then, specific cleavage like trypsin cut the proteins. These
separated peptides are identified by MALDI-TOF MS. Heavy peptides will slowly move and lighter peptides will move fast due to
Newton's second law; F = ma. As peptides move along the tube, the peptides of different accelerations or velocities takes 
different the amount of time take to reach end of tube. These separated peptides can be analyzed by matching with the computer
simulated database.

MALDI-TOF MS also can be used of DNA Hybridization, analyzing microorganism and sugars that bonds with proteins like 
glycosaminoglycan.

MALDI has many advantageous properties:&lt;br /&gt;
1. Robustness&lt;br /&gt;
2. High Speed&lt;br /&gt;
3. Immunity to contaminants, biochemical buffers, and common additives&lt;ref&gt;Chait, Brian T. &quot;Mass Spectrometry in the Postgenomic Era.&quot; Laboratory for Mass Spectroscopy and Gaseous Ion Chemistry, The Rockefuller University, New York, NY 10021; email: chait@rockefeller.edu.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications of mass spectrometry to lipids and membranes)  ==
|[[File:CellMembraneDrawing.jpg|128px]]||

Lipidomics is an important part of metabalomics is concerned with he detailed depiction and anaylsis of the structure and function of lipids within a living system. Mass spectrometry has played an extremely crucial and significant role in the determination of the structure of lipids.

'''Introduction'''
The ever increasing number of completely sequenced genomes available have given biologists the challenge of connecting gene structure to gene function. This drive for understanding the function of genes has spurred scientists to analyze expression levels of the components the make up biological systems like mRNA and proteins. Metabolomics is the study of the endogenously synthesized intermediates called the metabolome and is thought to represent the final result of gene expression. Endogenously synthesized intermediates (metabolomes) are primarily composed of lipids and fats. Studying these lipids can provide information in determining the relationship between the role of lipids and various diseases like cancer, atherosclerosis, and chronic inflammation. In addition, many lipids have cellular membranes and studying their interactions with membrane associated proteins/enzymes can give information on the development of drugs to inhibit these interactions that diseases have. 

The first mass spectrometer was constructed by Nobel Laureate Sir J.J Thomson and was used to analyze marsh gas. He observed that the mass to charge rations were 16 to 26, which was identified to be positive ions of methane and acetylene, respectively. Ever since mass spectrometry has been extremely important for the study of proteomics and metabolomics.

'''Lipid Definition and Classification'''
The categorization of lipids can be wide ranged.It can include organic compounds like fats, oils, waxes, sterol, and tryglycerides, and are insoluble in water but soluble in nonpolar organic compounds. They can also be defined as oily to touch. However, there are many lipids that are not always bound by these definitions. This has led to the official  classification of 8 categories of lipids. They are fatty acids, glycerolipids, sphingolipids, sterollipids, prenol lipids, saccharolipids, and polyketides.

&lt;ref&gt;Richard Harkewicz and edward A.Dennis(5 April 2011). [http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-biochem-060409-092612']. &quot;AnnualReview&quot;, p. 2-6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mass Spectrometry in Membrane Protein Analysis==
Analysis of membrane proteins is challenging because of their hydrophobicity, complex post-translational modifications (PTMs) and relatively low abundance, thus they are not accessible by traditional methods such as X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy. However, with the recent advancements in technology and methodology (ie. better liquid chromatographic performance), mass spectrometry (MS) accelerates membrane protein analysis in a large degree; specifically towards the determination and understanding of the complete plasma membrane (PM) proteome, membrane protein topology, membrane protein-protein interactions and signaling networks originating at the membrane.

===MS proteomics to determine the complete membrane proteome===
The hydrophobicity and low abundance of membrane proteins, and the intricate post-translational modifications has made the analysis of complete membrane proteome very difficult, especially when using traditional approaches, because it is technically challenging to isolate hydrophobic and insoluble proteins. However, with mass spectrometry, coupling with compatible detergents, better instrumentation (such as Multidimensional protein identification technology (MudPIT), which helps to facilitate analysis by separating peptides based on their charge and hydrophobicity), and optimized liquid chromatographic performance, the process of identifying thousands of proteins in one single analysis and get a global overview of all the proteins in the membrane can be done easily and more accurately.&lt;br /&gt;


Membrane proteins are generally categorized into three different types:&lt;br /&gt;

1. Integral membrane proteins, which is membrane penetrating, is determined to have a few β-barrels (for example, maltoporin) and a majority in α-helical arrangement (for example, the insulin receptor), which can be further divided into four different types based on terminus of the protein and number of times the protein traverses the membrane. &lt;br /&gt;

2. Peripheral membrane protein is found to be attached to membrane as in-plane α-helix (such as microtubule-affinity-regulating kinase)  or by electrostatic interactions (such as diphtheria toxin).&lt;br /&gt;

3. Lipid- anchored proteins is found to be attached to fatty acid, prenyl group or glycophophatidylinositol anchor by covalent bonding (for example the G proteins).


When dealing with detergent-resistant membrane domains and microdomains, mass spectrometry, coupling with multicomplexed fractionation and 1D and 2D gel-based approaches, can also effectively be used to analyze the protein components of the membrane. Studies have shown that these detergent-resistant membranes contain proteins that account for concentrated function.

===Protein Topology===
Instead of using traditional methods such as X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry can be used to determine the membrane protein structures, folding and topology at submolecular level, in conjunction with one of the following methods:&lt;br /&gt;

'''1. Hydrogen/deuterium (H/D-MS) exchange'''&lt;br /&gt;

This is based on the hydrogen atom exchange between proteins and the surrounding aqueous solution. And the rate of exchange is ruled by the solvent accessibility through the bilayer of the membrane. New findings using this method are that most of the hydrogen bonding interactions in the protein only moderately stabilized the folded state, and that there are several dynamic regions within the β2 adrenergic receptor (G-protein-coupled receptor).


'''2. Oxidative or hydroxyl radical probe mass spectrometry'''&lt;br /&gt;

This has the key advantage, over other approaches, in that hydroxyl radicals can be generated directly in solution and react permanently with minimal modification through the incorporation of a limited number of oxygen atoms at reactive residue side chains. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Protein_footprinting


'''3. Covalent tagging with regents such as carbodiimide diisopropylcarbodiimide (DiPC-MS)'''&lt;br /&gt;

This is also specific in the residues, Asp and Glu. From this method, it was shown that Glu269 serves an important role in substrate binding of the membrane protein lactose permease.

One main advantage of using MS-based topology approaches is that they are not limited by the type and the size of the membrane proteins.

===Membrane protein-protein interactions===
Mass spectrometry is useful to discover exactly which proteins physically and functionally interact, thus further our understanding of the molecular function of the plasma membrane proteins.&lt;br /&gt;

Two approaches are generally used:&lt;br /&gt;

1. Isolate membrane protein complexes by antibody purification: Best for identifying multiprotein complexes&lt;br /&gt;

With this antibody purification approach, more receptors are identified, such as the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptor (AMPAR), γ-aminobutyric acid and kainate receptors, in addition to the previously identified N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT2C) receptors.

2. In vitro binding experiments followed by mass spectrometry: Best for finding direct high-affinity interactions such as ligand and receptor pairs

===Signaling Networks Across Membrane===
Plasma membrane is where all the signaling between cells takes place. Many surface receptors, for example, GPCPs, receptor tyrosine kinases, adhesion signaling molecules and channels, are embedded in the plasma membranes. To further understand membrane signaling, mass spectrometry is used to determine the changes in protein abundance or PTM such as phosphorylation, after treated the cell cultures with growth factor – ligand. 

One example of membrane signaling would be the analysis of brassinosteroid (BR) membrane. Arabidopsis thaliana seedling were first treated with BRs. Then the membrane fractions were analyzed using 2D gel and mass spectrometer. The findings showed that membrane-associated kinases of BR transmembrane receptors are responsible for BR membrane signaling. Another example is that the epidermal growth factor signaling of phosphorylated proteins was investigated using MS with the use of stable isotpe labeling and affinity capture. From these studies, thousands of proteins were successfully identified.

== Quantitative Proteomics ==
Quantitative proteomics is becoming a major part of biological research because it allows scientists to track the dynamic changes of proteins, including post-translational modifications and the formation of protein complexes. This technique often plays a large role in generating new insights and hypothesis for biological processes, which can then be validated by other research approaches. Understanding how proteins change and interact leads to greater understanding in cellular processes and disease progression. For example, it is known that histone regulates gene activation and DNA repair by undergoing methylation, acetylation, and other modifications that changes its interaction with DNA and nuclear proteins. Studying the structural changes of histone during transcription would thus be helpful in learning how to deactivate undesirable genes and amplify beneficial genes. Another heavily targeted area of study is the comparison of protein expression, modifications, and interactions between the diseased state proteins versus that of the normal condition. Understanding these differences can offer valuable insights into the mechanics of disease progression and provide guidance for structure-based drug design. Although tracking protein dynamics is difficult due to the complexity of the biochemical pathways and the drastic changes during different cellular states, the use of mass spectroscopy has greatly reduced these challenges.

===Labelling Techniques===
Before peptide tagging was used to study protein dynamics, quantitative proteomics relied on two-dimensional polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (2D-PAGE). After running 2D-PAGE, the spot intensities from two or more samples were compared and a mass spectroscopic analysis was used to identify and quantify the protein. Modern quantitative proteomics relies on isotope labelling and mass spectrometry. These methods include:

[[Image:Isotope-Coded Affinity Tags (ICAT).jpg|thumb|Procedure for Isotope-Coded Affinity Tags (ICAT)]]

====Isotope-Coded Affinity Tag (ICAT)====
The protein of interest is purified from different cell states and immersed in labelling reagents that has a biotin tag and a linker region with either heavy or light isotopes. These reagents bind to cysteine-containing peptides, creating a labelled peptide. The proteins are then combined and digested, forming labeled and unlabelled peptide fragments. Combining the digestion process reduces variation in the procedure so that experimental error can be minimized. The labeled peptides are first selected through affinity chromatography based on the presence of the biotin marker, then analyzed with mass spectrometer. Proteins labeled with the light isotope show a lower mass to charge ratio. The relative abundance of the proteins can be determined by the ratio of the peak intensities.

====Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino Acids in Cell Culture (SILAC)====
[[File:Silac.gif|thumb|left|Stable Isotope Labeling with Amino Acids in Cell Culture (SILAC)]]
Stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) is a method of ''in vivo'' labeling of proteins for mass spectrometry analysis. The cell culture is grown in a “light” medium and a “heavy” medium. These mediums are given identical conditions except for one particular amino acid that contains a heavy isotope for the “heavy” medium and a light isotope for the “light” medium. Typical isotopes chosen to make the “heavy” medium include &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H, &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C, and &lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt;N. The cells incorporate the heavy or light isotope amino acids naturally during metabolism. After a few generations, every instance of that amino acid will be replaced by the type of amino acid provided in the medium. The proteins grown in both the mediums are then extracted from the cells, purified, and combined together. The proteins are digested with a protease, separated by high performance liquid chromatography, and analyzed by mass spectrometry. As in ICAT, the relative abundance of the proteins can be determined by the ratio of the peak intensities.

====Isobaric Labeling====
Isobaric labeling is a technique that attaches same mass chemical groups to peptides and then using tandem mass spectrometry to determine the relative abundance of the isobaric tag, which represents the abundance of the respectively tagged peptide. Each isobaric tag is composed of a reporter group and a balance group. A peptide-reactive group is attached to the tag to increase peptide affinity to the tag. In each experiment, many isobaric tags can be used to label proteins. All the reporter groups are made to have different masses by varying the amount of 13C, 15N, 18O in the reporter molecule. The balance group is a carbonyl group that is also of varying masses. The overall mass of the reporter group and the balance group are constant for all of the labels. This is useful as an internal standard for mass spectrometry because all labeled proteins should appear in one peak since all the masses are the same. There are two types of isobaric labeling, both utilizing the method as described above:
* iTRAQ (isobaric tag for relative and absolute quantification)
* TMT (Tandem mass tag)

== Hydrogen Exchange Mass Spectrometry ==
Hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry is a contemporary method to study protein dynamics, protein-solvent interactions, and protein complex interactions. This technique takes advantage of the exchanging behavior of amide hydrogen to label the protein with deuterium, which can be detected through mass spectrometry or NMR analysis. This method generates information for protein dynamics by describing the solvent accessibility and level of disorder for the various parts of the protein. 

===Hydrogen-Deuterium Exchange Reaction===
In solution, the hydrogen covalently bonded to the nitrogen of the peptide (called amide hydrogen) exchanges proton with the solvent. By replacing  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O solvent  with D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, the amide hydrogen can be incorporated into the peptide during the hydrogen exchange process. This is usually accomplished by diluting the protein in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O buffer with the analog D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O buffer tenfold, thus surrounding the protein with mostly D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and lessening its contact with H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Hydrogen exchange reaction is significantly affected by temperature and pH. Since the exchange process can be acid or base catalyzed, pH must be monitored carefully during the D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O incubation. To study proteins at the natural state, exchange condition is set at pH 7-8 to mirror the physiological environment of the proteins. At pH 2.6, the exchange reaction occurs the slowest. A standard exchange experiment involves immersing the protein for a set amount of time in the D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O buffer, then rapidly shifting the pH of the solution to 2.6, thus slowing the exchange reaction, a process called quenching. A set of exchanging experiments consist of similar exchanging conditions but each experiment is given varying reaction times, commonly ranging from 10 seconds to 3000 seconds or longer. Exchange reactions occur extremely fast at room temperature. To more accurately characterize the deuteration levels among the proteins samples at each of the time points, exchanges are performed at cold temperatures (around 4&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C) to decrease the rate of exchange.

===Deuterium Detection by Mass Spectrometry===
To analyze the deuterated proteins with mass spectrometry, the proteins are denatured and digested to form peptides. The peptides are separated by HPLC and analyzed by the mass spectrometer. Since the deuterium nucleus is heavier than a hydrogen nucleus because it contains a neutron as well as a proton, the deuterated peptide has a higher mass compared to the non-deuterated peptide. Based on this mass difference, mass spectrometer can accurately distinguish among the peptides with different deuteration levels. The rate of deuteration for each peptide can also be tracked by measuring the masses of identical peptides that are immersed in D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O for different time points.

===Relation to Protein Structure===
Two factors govern exchange behavior for each peptide: solvent accessibility and hydrogen bonding. Peptides buried in the interior of the protein or surrounded by hydrophobic surfaces show less exchange behavior due to the lack of contact with the D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O solvent. Peptides that form the surface of the protein exchange rapidly and completely because they are in constant contact with D&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Hydrogen bonding also determines exchange behavior because the hydrogen participating in bonding cannot spontaneously exchange without breaking the bond. Thus great rates of exchange can be attributed to lack of bonding or disorganization. Flexible parts of the protein that are not structured can be characterized by the incorporation of many deuterons. Hydrogen exchange mass spectrometry is also used to study the dynamics of protein complexes to determine which areas of the protein changes in flexibility or solvent accessibility upon binding. This can help identify the areas of the protein that are pertinent to protein-protein interaction and the areas that are dramatically affected by the interaction.

===Fourier-transform Mass Spectrometry===
Fourier-transform mass spectrometry is a type mass spectrometry that takes advantage of ion-cyclotron resonance to select and detect ions. Fourier-transform MS was invented by Alan G. Marshall and Melvin B. Comisarow at the University of British Columbia in 1974.Fourier-transform MS, also known as Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance MS has high resolution; therefore, it is used as determining the composition of molecules based on accurate mass. It is also capable of studying large macromolecules such as proteins with multiple charges due to its high resolution.

===Ion-trap Mass Spectrometry===
Ion-trap mass spectrometry exists in both linear and 3-D varieties. IT MS was invented by Wolfgang Paul. It uses constant DC and radio frequency  oscillating AC electric fields to trap ions in a small volume. This 3-D trap consists of a ring electrode separating two hemispherical electrodes. A mass spectrum is obtained by changing the electrode voltages to eject the ions from the trap. Such technique gives its compact size and the ability to trap and accumulate ions to increase the signal-to-noise ratio of a measurement.

===Magnetic-Sector Mass Spectrometry===
Magnetic-sector mass spectrometry uses a static electric or magnetic sector to affect the path and/or velocity or the charged particles. There are two main types of magnetic-sector MS, single focusing analyzers and double focusing analyzers.

===Ion Mobility Mass Spectrometry===

Quantum Sniffer(the figure shown on the right) is an ion mobility mass spectrometry developed by Implant Science Corporation. It is a photonic, non radioactive ionization to detect nano particles in an aqueous solution. The molecular weight, shape, and size of the ionized particles would impact the ion mobility as it pass through drift region and reach the detecting point. The detection of the samples are collected by the vortex, ionized photonically, and analyzed via ion mobility spectrometery (IMS). The samples are collected through a vacuum space, then it is pump into the ion source with electrical current in the ion-molecule reaction region. Then, the ion molecule is then further analyzed based on its drift time, the time for it to go from one chamber to another based on its molecular weight. At the end of the result, computer was able to analyzed a resultant graph of detecting particles.

=== Advances in Mass Spectrometry ===

The emergence of advances in studying of structural genomics as well as proteomics can yield more information on soluble proteins and their complexes. 

An example of a new type of mass spectrometry technique is called laser induced liquid bead ion desorption (LILBID). This technique allows can detect membrane proteins by generatingseries of microdroplets of proteins that then get radiated using a laser into an IR range. At lower intensities, complete complexes can be identified whereas at higher intensities, individual subunits can be detected. This new technique can also be thought of as a combination of another type of mass spectrometry often used, MALDI and electrospray. Despite the idea that LILBID could be a combination of these techniques, there are some key similarities and differences between LILBID itself and ES techniques. Both LILBID and Es are able to explain the stoichiometry of intact membrane protein complexes; however ES has the ability to determine small molecule binding that occurs directly within the complexes. In addition, mass spectrometry studies using this ES technique shows that micelles can indeed exist while in the gas phase. Since LILBID has a lower mass resolution compared to ES, it is unable to provide a more precise characterization of the mass differences between the intact complexes.

== Further Improvements Needed for Mass Spectroscopy ==
Although MS technologies have been greatly improved in the last two decades, further improvements are needed for the analysis of protein molecules:

1. Sensitivity of the instrument should be improved in order to analyze smaller number of cells or samples, which allows one to look at corresponding cellular components with their specialized functions;

2. Improved methods are needed to measure low abundance components within protein molecules despite the existence of higher abundance molecules;

3. Higher instrumental speed is needed to allow for deeper and more routine protein analyzes;

4. More robust instruments should be developed to enhance the usage of MS, since some biologists are not quite familiar with these instruments;

5. Improved techniques should be devised to prepare &quot;frozen&quot; samples that are easier to be analyzed.&lt;ref&gt;Annu. Rev. Biochem. 2011. 80:239-46 ''The Annual Review of Biochemistry'' is online at biochem.annualreviews.org&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{IPA notice}}

Most of the sounds of Klingon show similarities to those of English; but notable exceptions do exist.  In many cases, the speaker raises the tongue higher or further back; to produce a Klingon ''Q'', for example, the speaker must pull the tongue as far into the back of the mouth as possible.  New speakers may find some of these sounds difficult to produce, especially complex sounds like ''tlh'' and especially in context.  The next section introduces these sounds in context with some tricky Klingon words; you should master these words before continuing on further with the Klingon language.

Klingon was designed to be a harsh, guttural language, sounding very unfamiliar to English speakers. So you might find the sounds strange and difficult to pronounce; e.g. '''Q'''. In Klingon, capital letters are used differently from English; '''I''' is never written ''i'' and '''t''' is never written ''T''. You might think this is pointless; why not write '''I''' as ''i'' and '''H''' as ''h''? After all, there's only one case when a capital letter and a small letter mean different things - '''Q''' and '''q'''. So? you ask. Why not use ''x'' or something for '''Q'''?

You're right, that would be more logical - but Klingon was not designed to be logical, it was designed to be as different from English as possible. Klingon is a language for aliens. What looks more alien, ''tlhingan hol'' or '''tlhIngan Hol'''?

Here are the sounds. If you can't pronounce them all, [[Klingon/Lesson1/Hard Sounds|here's]] a more detailed page describing the sounds not found in English.

=== Consonants ===
For some consonants, the speaker holds the tongue slightly farther back than in English.  As such, the 'd' sounds somewhat heavier, and the 'S' becomes a cross between an English 's' and 'sh'.

The 'H' in Klingon is a raspy English 'h', or like the end sound of the composer Bach, or the Hebrew word l'chaim.  

The 'q' sounds similar to a 'k' in English, but with the tongue positioned farther back in the throat.  

A 'Q' is a very overdone 'q'.  Like a combination of Klingon 'q' and 'H'.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Sir Isaac Newton, FRS (pronounced /ˈnjuːtən/; 4 January 1643 – 31 March 1727 [OS: 25 December 1642 – 20 March 1726])[1] was an English physicist, mathematician, astronomer, natural philosopher, alchemist and theologian. His Philosophy Naturals Principia Mathematica, published in 1687, is considered to be the most influential book in the history of science. In this work, Newton described universal gravitation and the three laws of motion, laying the groundwork for classical mechanics, which dominated the scientific view of the physical universe for the next three centuries and is the basis for modern engineering. Newton showed that the motions of objects on Earth and of celestial bodies are governed by the same set of natural laws by demonstrating the consistency between Kepler's laws of planetary motion and his theory of gravitation, thus removing the last doubts about heliocentric and advancing the scientific revolution.

In mechanics, Newton enunciated the principles of conservation of momentum and angular momentum. In optics, he invented the reflecting telescope and developed a theory of colour based on the observation that a prism decomposes white light into a visible spectrum. He also formulated an empirical law of cooling and studied the speed of sound.

In mathematics, Newton shares the credit with Gottfried Leibniz for the development of the differential and integral calculus. He also demonstrated the generalised binomial theorem, developed the so-called &quot;Newton's method&quot; for approximating the zeroes of a function, and contributed to the study of power series.

Newton was also highly religious (though unorthodox), producing more work on Biblical hermeneutics than the natural science he is remembered for today.

In a 2005 poll of the Royal Society asking who had the greater effect on the history of science, Newton was deemed much more influential than Albert Einstein.[5]

===Early years===
Main article: Isaac Newton's early life and achievements
 
Newton in a 1702 portrait by Godfrey KnellerIsaac Newton was born on 4 January 1643 [OS: 25 December 1642][1] at Woolsthorpe Manor in Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, a hamlet in the county of Lincoln-shire. At the time of Newton's birth, England had not adopted the latest papal calendar and therefore his date of birth was recorded as Christmas Day, 25 December 1642. Newton was born three months after the death of his father. Born prematurely, he was a small child; his mother Hannah Ayscough reportedly said that he could have fit inside a quart mug. When Newton was three, his mother remarried and went to live with her new husband, the Reverend Barnabas Smith, leaving her son in the care of his maternal grandmother, Margery Ayscough. The young Isaac disliked his stepfather and held some enmity towards his mother for marrying him, as revealed by this entry in a list of sins committed up to the age of 19: Threatening my father and mother Smith to burn them and the house over them.[6]

According to E.T. Bell and H. Eves:

Newton began his schooling in the village schools and was later sent to The King's School, Grantham, where he became the top student in the school. At King's, he lodged with the local apothecary, William Clarke and eventually became engaged to the apothecary's stepdaughter, Anne Storer, before he went off to the University of Cambridge at the age of 19. As Newton became engrossed in his studies, the romance cooled and Miss Storer married someone else. It is said he kept a warm memory of this love, but Newton had no other recorded &quot;sweet-hearts&quot; and never married.[7]

There are rumors that he remained a confirmed celibate.[8] However, Bell and Eves' sources for this claim, William Stukeley and Mrs. Vincent (the former Miss Storer – actually named Katherine, not Anne), merely say that Newton entertained &quot;a passion&quot; for Storer while he lodged at the Clarke house.

From the age of about twelve until he was seventeen, Newton was educated at The King's School, Grantham (where his signature can still be seen upon a library window sill). He was removed from school, and by October 1659, he was to be found at Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth, where his mother, widowed by now for a second time, attempted to make a farmer of him. He was, by later reports of his contemporaries, thoroughly unhappy with the work. It appears to have been Henry Stokes, master at the King's School, who persuaded his mother to send him back to school so that he might complete his education. This he did at the age of eighteen, achieving an admirable final report.

In June 1661, he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge. According to John Stillwell, he entered Trinity as a sizar.[9] At that time, the college's teachings were based on those of Aristotle, but Newton preferred to read the more advanced ideas of modern philosophers such as Descartes and astronomers such as Copernicus, Galileo, and Kepler. In 1665, he discovered the generalised binomial theorem and began to develop a mathematical theory that would later become infinitesimal calculus. Soon after Newton had obtained his degree in August of 1665, the University closed down as a precaution against the Great Plague. Although he had been undistinguished as a Cambridge student,[10] Newton's private studies at his home in Woolsthorpe over the subsequent two years saw the development of his theories on calculus, optics and the law of gravitation.

===Middle years===
 
Isaac Newton (Bolton, Sarah K. Famous Men of Science. NY: Thomas Y. Crowell &amp; Co., 1889)
Mathematics
Most modern historians believe that Newton and Leibniz had developed infinitesimal calculus independently, using their own unique notations. According to Newton's inner circle, Newton had worked out his method years before Leibniz, yet he published almost nothing about it until 1693, and did not give a full account until 1704. Meanwhile, Leibniz began publishing a full account of his methods in 1684. Moreover, Leibniz's notation and &quot;differential Method&quot; were universally adopted on the Continent, and after 1820 or so, in the British Empire. Whereas Leibniz's notebooks show the advancement of the ideas from early stages until maturity, there is only the end product in Newton's known notes. Newton claimed that he had been reluctant to publish his calculus because he feared being mocked for it. Newton had a very close relationship with Swiss mathematician Nicolas Fatio de Duillier, who from the beginning was impressed by Newton's gravitational theory. In 1691 Duillier planned to prepare a new version of Newton's Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica, but never finished it. However, in 1694 the relationship between the two men changed. At the time, Duillier had also exchanged several letters with Leibniz.

Starting in 1699, other members of the Royal Society (of which Newton was a member) accused Leibniz of plagiarism, and the dispute broke out in full force in 1711. Newton's Royal Society proclaimed in a study that it was Newton who was the true discoverer and labeled Leibniz a fraud. This study was cast into doubt when it was later found that Newton himself wrote the study's concluding remarks on Leibniz. Thus began the bitter Newton v. Leibniz calculus controversy, which marred the lives of both Newton and Leibniz until the latter's death in 1716.

Newton is generally credited with the generalised binomial theorem, valid for any exponent. He discovered Newton's identities, Newton's method, classified cubic plane curves (polynomials of degree three in two variables), made substantial contributions to the theory of finite differences, and was the first to use fractional indices and to employ coordinate geometry to derive solutions to Diophantine equations. He approximated partial sums of the harmonic series by logarithms (a precursor to Euler's summation formula), and was the first to use power series with confidence and to revert power series. He also discovered a new formula for calculating pi.

He was elected Lucasian Professor of Mathematics in 1669. In that day, any fellow of Cambridge or Oxford had to be an ordained Anglican priest. However, the terms of the Lucasian professorship required that the holder not be active in the church (presumably so as to have more time for science). Newton argued that this should exempt him from the ordination requirement, and Charles II, whose permission was needed, accepted this argument. Thus a conflict between Newton's religious views and Anglican orthodoxy was averted.

===Optics===
From 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics. During this period he investigated the refraction of light, demonstrating that a prism could decompose white light into a spectrum of colours, and that a lens and a second prism could recompose the multicoloured spectrum into white light.

A replica of Newton's 6-inch (150 mm) reflecting telescope of 1672 for the Royal SocietyHe also showed that the coloured light does not change its properties by separating out a coloured beam and shining it on various objects. Newton noted that regardless of whether it was reflected or scattered or transmitted, it stayed the same colour. Thus, he observed that colour is the result of objects interacting with already-coloured light rather than objects generating the colour themselves. This is known as Newton's theory of colour.

From this work he concluded that any refracting telescope would suffer from the dispersion of light into colours, and invented a reflecting telescope (today known as a Newtonian telescope) to bypass that problem. By grinding his own mirrors, using Newton's rings to judge the quality of the optics for his telescopes, he was able to produce a superior instrument to the refracting telescope, due primarily to the wider diameter of the mirror. In 1671 the Royal Society asked for a demonstration of his reflecting telescope. Their interest encouraged him to publish his notes On Colour, which he later expanded into his Opticks. When Robert Hooke criticised some of Newton's ideas, Newton was so offended that he withdrew from public debate. The two men remained enemies until Hooke's death.

Newton argued that light is composed of particles or corpuscles, which were refracted by accelerating toward the denser medium, but he had to associate them with waves to explain the diffraction of light (Opticks Bk. II, Props. XII-L). Later physicists instead favoured a purely wavelike explanation of light to account for diffraction. Today's quantum mechanics, photons and the idea of wave–particle duality bear only a minor resemblance to Newton's understanding of light.

In his Hypothesis of Light of 1675, Newton posited the existence of the ether to transmit forces between particles. The contact with the theosophist Henry More, revived his interest in alchemy. He replaced the ether with occult forces based on Hermetic ideas of attraction and repulsion between particles. John Maynard Keynes, who acquired many of Newton's writings on alchemy, stated that &quot;Newton was not the first of the age of reason: he was the last of the magicians.&quot;[11] Newton's interest in alchemy cannot be isolated from his contributions to science.[12] (This was at a time when there was no clear distinction between alchemy and science.) Had he not relied on the occult idea of action at a distance, across a vacuum, he might not have developed his theory of gravity. (See also Isaac Newton's occult studies.)

In 1704 Newton published Opticks, in which he expounded his corpuscular theory of light. He considered light to be made up of extremely subtle corpuscles, that ordinary matter was made of grosser corpuscles and speculated that through a kind of alchemical transmutation &quot;Are not gross Bodies and Light convertible into one another, ...and may not Bodies receive much of their Activity from the Particles of Light which enter their Composition?&quot;[13] Newton also constructed a primitive form of a frictional electrostatic generator, using a glass globe (Optics, 8th Query).

===Mechanics and gravitation===
 
Newton's own copy of his Principia, with hand-written corrections for the second editionFurther information: Writing of Principia Mathematica 
In 1677, Newton returned to his work on mechanics, i.e., gravitation and its effect on the orbits of planets, with reference to Kepler's laws of planetary motion, and consulting with Hooke and Flamsteed on the subject. He published his results in De motu corporum in gyrum (1684). This contained the beginnings of the laws of motion that would inform the Principia.

The Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica (now known as the Principia) was published on 5 July 1687 with encouragement and financial help from Edmond Halley. In this work Newton stated the three universal laws of motion that were not to be improved upon for more than two hundred years. He used the Latin word gravitas (weight) for the effect that would become known as gravity, and defined the law of universal gravitation. In the same work he presented the first analytical determination, based on Boyle's law, of the speed of sound in air. Newton's postulate of an invisible force able to act over vast distances led to him being criticised for introducing &quot;occult agencies&quot; into science.[14]

With the Principia, Newton became internationally recognised. He acquired a circle of admirers, including the Swiss-born mathematician Nicolas Fatio de Duillier, with whom he formed an intense relationship that lasted until 1693. The end of this friendship led Newton to a nervous breakdown.[clarify][citation needed]

===Later life===
Main article: Isaac Newton's later life
 
Isaac Newton in old age in 1712. Portrait by Sir James Thornhill.In the 1690s, Newton wrote a number of religious tracts dealing with the literal interpretation of the Bible. Henry More's belief in the universe and rejection of Cartesian dualism may have influenced Newton's religious ideas. A manuscript he sent to John Locke in which he disputed the existence of the Trinity was never published. Later works – The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended (1728) and Observations Upon the Prophecies of Daniel and the Apocalypse of St. John (1733) – were published after his death. He also devoted a great deal of time to alchemy (see above).

Newton was also a member of the Parliament of England from 1689 to 1690 and in 1701, but his only recorded comments were to complain about a cold draft in the chamber and request that the window be closed.

Newton moved to London to take up the post of warden of the Royal Mint in 1696, a position that he had obtained through the patronage of Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax, then Chancellor of the Exchequer. He took charge of England's great recoining, somewhat treading on the toes of Master Lucas (and securing the job of deputy comptroller of the temporary Chester branch for Edmond Halley). Newton became perhaps the best-known Master of the Mint upon Lucas' death in 1699, a position Newton held until his death. These appointments were intended as sinecures, but Newton took them seriously, retiring from his Cambridge duties in 1701, and exercising his power to reform the currency and punish clippers and counterfeiters. As Master of the Mint in 1717 Newton unofficially moved the Pound Sterling from the silver standard to the gold standard by creating a relationship between gold coins and the silver penny in the &quot;Law of Queen Anne&quot;; these were all great reforms at the time, adding considerably to the wealth and stability of England. It was his work at the Mint, rather than his earlier contributions to science, that earned him a knighthood from Queen Anne in 1705.
 
Newton's grave in Westminster AbbeyNewton was made President of the Royal Society in 1703 and an associate of the French Académie des Sciences. In his position at the Royal Society, Newton made an enemy of John Flamsteed, the Astronomer Royal, by prematurely publishing Flamsteed's star catalogue, which Newton had used in his studies.

Newton died in London on 31 March 1727 [OS: 20 March 1726][1], and was buried in Westminster Abbey. His half-niece, Catherine Barton Conduitt,[15] served as his hostess in social affairs at his house on Jermyn Street in London; he was her &quot;very loving Uncle,&quot;[16] according to his letter to her when she was recovering from smallpox. Although Newton, who had no children, had divested much of his estate onto relatives in his last years, he actually died intestate.

After his death, Newton's body was discovered to have had massive amounts of mercury in it, probably resulting from his alchemical pursuits. Mercury poisoning could explain Newton's eccentricity in late life.[17]

==Religious views==
Main article: Isaac Newton's religious views
Historian Stephen D. Snobelen says of Newton, &quot;Isaac Newton was a heretic. But like Nicodemus, the secret disciple of Jesus, he never made a public declaration of his private faith - which the orthodox would have deemed extremely radical. He hid his faith so well that scholars are still unravelling his personal beliefs.&quot;[18] Snobelen concludes that Newton was at least a Socinian sympathiser (he owned and had thoroughly read at least eight Socinian books), possibly an Arian and almost certainly an antitrinitarian.[18] In an age notable for its religious intolerance there are few public expressions of Newton's radical views, most notably his refusal to take holy orders and his refusal, on his death bed, to take the sacrament when it was offered to him.[18]

In a view disputed by Snobelen,[18] T.C. Pfizenmaier argues that Newton held the Eastern Orthodox view of the Trinity rather than the Western one held by Roman Catholics, Anglicans, and most Protestants.[19] In his own day, he was also accused of being a Rosicrucian (as were many in the Royal Society and in the court of Charles II).[20]

Although the laws of motion and universal gravitation became Newton's best-known discoveries, he warned against using them to view the universe as a mere machine, as if akin to a great clock. He said, &quot;Gravity explains the motions of the planets, but it cannot explain who set the planets in motion. God governs all things and knows all that is or can be done.&quot;[21]

His scientific fame notwithstanding, Newton's studies of the Bible and of the early Church Fathers were also noteworthy. Newton wrote works on textual criticism, most notably An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture. He also placed the crucifixion of Jesus Christ at 3 April, AD 33, which agrees with one traditionally accepted date.[22] He also attempted, unsuccessfully, to find hidden messages within the Bible.

In his own lifetime, Newton wrote more on religion than he did on natural science. He believed in a rationally immanent world, but he rejected the hylozoism implicit in Leibniz and Baruch Spinoza. Thus, the ordered and dynamically informed universe could be understood, and must be understood, by an active reason, but this universe, to be perfect and ordained, had to be regular.

===Newton's effect on religious thought===
 
&quot;Newton,&quot; by William Blake; here, Newton is depicted as a &quot;divine geometer&quot;Newton and Robert Boyle’s mechanical philosophy was promoted by rationalist pamphleteers as a viable alternative to the pantheists and enthusiasts, and was accepted hesitantly by orthodox preachers as well as dissident preachers like the latitudinarians.[23] Thus, the clarity and simplicity of science was seen as a way to combat the emotional and metaphysical superlatives of both superstitious enthusiasm and the threat of atheism,[24] and, at the same time, the second wave of English deists used Newton's discoveries to demonstrate the possibility of a &quot;Natural Religion.&quot;

The attacks made against pre-Enlightenment &quot;magical thinking,&quot; and the mystical elements of Christianity, were given their foundation with Boyle’s mechanical conception of the universe. Newton gave Boyle’s ideas their completion through mathematical proofs and, perhaps more importantly, was very successful in popularising them.[25] Newton refashioned the world governed by an interventionist God into a world crafted by a God that designs along rational and universal principles.[26] These principles were available for all people to discover, allowed people to pursue their own aims fruitfully in this life, not the next, and to perfect themselves with their own rational powers.[27]

Newton saw God as the master creator whose existence could not be denied in the face of the grandeur of all creation.[28][29][30] But the unforeseen theological consequence of his conception of God, as Leibniz pointed out, was that God was now entirely removed from the world’s affairs, since the need for intervention would only evidence some imperfection in God’s creation, something impossible for a perfect and omnipotent creator.[31] Leibniz's theodicy cleared God from the responsibility for &quot;l'origine du mal&quot; by making God removed from participation in his creation. The understanding of the world was now brought down to the level of simple human reason, and humans, as Odo Marquard argued, became responsible for the correction and elimination of evil.[32]

On the other hand, latitudinarian and Newtonian ideas taken too far resulted in the millenarians, a religious faction dedicated to the concept of a mechanical universe, but finding in it the same enthusiasm and mysticism that the Enlightenment had fought so hard to extinguish.[33]

===Views of the end of the world===
See also: Isaac Newton's occult studies 
See also: Eschatology 
In a manuscript he wrote in 1704 in which he describes his attempts to extract scientific information from the Bible, he estimated that the world would end no earlier than 2060. In predicting this he said, &quot;This I mention not to assert when the time of the end shall be, but to put a stop to the rash conjectures of fanciful men who are frequently predicting the time of the end, and by doing so bring the sacred prophesies into discredit as often as their predictions fail.&quot;[34]

==Newton and the counterfeiters==
As warden of the Royal Mint, Newton estimated that 20% of the coins taken in during The Great Recoinage were counterfeit. Counterfeiting was high treason, punishable by being hanged, drawn and quartered. Despite this, convictions of the most flagrant criminals could be extremely difficult to achieve; however, Newton proved to be equal to the task.

Disguised as an habitué of bars and taverns, he gathered much of that evidence himself. For all the barriers placed to prosecution, and separating the branches of government, English law still had ancient and formidable customs of authority. Newton was made a justice of the peace and between June 1698 and Christmas 1699 conducted some 200 cross-examinations of witnesses, informers and suspects. Newton won his convictions and in February 1699, he had ten prisoners waiting to be executed.

Possibly Newton's greatest triumph as the king's attorney was against William Chaloner. One of Chaloner's schemes was to set up phony conspiracies of Catholics and then turn in the hapless conspirators whom he entrapped. Chaloner made himself rich enough to posture as a gentleman. Petitioning Parliament, Chaloner accused the Mint of providing tools to counterfeiters (a charge also made by others). He proposed that he be allowed to inspect the Mint's processes in order to improve them. He petitioned Parliament to adopt his plans for a coinage that could not be counterfeited, while at the same time striking false coins. Newton was outraged, and went about the work to uncover anything about Chaloner. During his studies, he found that Chaloner was engaged in counterfeiting. He immediately put Chaloner on trial, but Chaloner had friends in high places and, to Newton's horror, Chaloner walked free. Newton put him on trial a second time with conclusive evidence. Chaloner was convicted of high treason and hanged, drawn and quartered on 23 March 1699 at Tyburn gallows.[35]

==Enlightenment philosophers==
Enlightenment philosophers chose a short history of scientific predecessors—Galileo, Boyle, and Newton principally—as the guides and guarantors of their applications of the singular concept of Nature and Natural Law to every physical and social field of the day. In this respect, the lessons of history and the social structures built upon it could be discarded.[36]

It was Newton’s conception of the universe based upon Natural and rationally understandable laws that became the seed for Enlightenment ideology. Locke and Voltaire applied concepts of Natural Law to political systems advocating intrinsic rights; the physiocrats and Adam Smith applied Natural conceptions of psychology and self-interest to economic systems and the sociologists criticised the current social order for trying to fit history into Natural models of progress. Monboddo and Samuel Clarke resisted elements of Newton's work, but eventually rationalised it to conform with their strong religious views of nature.

==Laws of motion==
Main article: Newton's laws of motion
The famous three laws of motion:

Newton's First Law (also known as the Law of Inertia) states that an object at rest tends to stay at rest and that an object in uniform motion tends to stay in uniform motion unless acted upon by a net external force.

Newton's Second Law states that an applied force, &lt;math&gt;\vec{F}&lt;/math&gt;, on an object equals the rate of change of its momentum, &lt;math&gt;\vec{p}&lt;/math&gt;, with time. Mathematically, this is expressed as
 
Because this relation only holds when the mass is constant, that is, when , the first term vanishes, and the equation can be written in the iconic form

where
 
This equation states that a force  applied to an object of mass m causes it to accelerate at a rate .

This equality requires a consistent set of units for measuring mass, length, and time. One such set is the SI system, where mass is in kilograms, length in metres, and time in seconds. This leads to force being in newtons, named in his honour, and acceleration in metres per second per second. The English analogous system is slugs, feet, and seconds.

Newton's Third Law states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. This means that any force exerted onto an object has a counterpart force that is exerted in the opposite direction back onto the first object. The most common example is of two ice skaters pushing against each other and sliding apart in opposite directions. Another example is the recoil of a firearm, in which the force propelling the bullet is exerted equally back onto the gun and is felt by the shooter. Since the objects in question do not necessarily have the same mass, the resulting acceleration of the two objects can be different (as in the case of firearm recoil).

==Newton's apple==

Reputed descendants of Newton's apple tree, at the Botanic Gardens in Cambridge and the Instituto Balseiro library garden“ When Newton saw an apple fall, he found

In that slight startle from his contemplation –
'Tis said (for I'll not answer above ground
For any sage's creed or calculation) –
A mode of proving that the earth turn'd round
In a most natural whirl, called &quot;gravitation;&quot;
And this is the sole mortal who could grapple,
Since Adam, with a fall or with an apple.[37]
 ” 

A popular story claims that Newton was inspired to formulate his theory of universal gravitation by the fall of an apple from a tree. Cartoons have gone further to suggest the apple actually hit Newton's head, and that its impact somehow made him aware of the force of gravity. John Conduitt, Newton's assistant at the Royal Mint and husband of Newton's niece, described the event when he wrote about Newton's life:

“ In the year 1666 he retired again from Cambridge to his mother in Lincolnshire. Whilst he was pensively meandering in a garden it came into his thought that the power of gravity (which brought an apple from a tree to the ground) was not limited to a certain distance from earth, but that this power must extend much further than was usually thought. Why not as high as the Moon said he to himself &amp; if so, that must influence her motion &amp; perhaps retain her in her orbit, whereupon he fell a calculating what would be the effect of that supposition.[38] ” 

The question was not whether gravity existed, but whether it extended so far from Earth that it could also be the force holding the moon to its orbit. Newton showed that if the force decreased as the inverse square of the distance, one could indeed calculate the Moon's orbital period, and get good agreement. He guessed the same force was responsible for other orbital motions, and hence named it &quot;universal gravitation&quot;.

A contemporary writer, William Stukeley, recorded in his Memoirs of Sir Isaac Newton's Life a conversation with Newton in Kensington on 15 April 1726, in which Newton recalled &quot;when formerly, the notion of gravitation came into his mind. It was occasioned by the fall of an apple, as he sat in contemplative mood. Why should that apple always descend perpendicularly to the ground, thought he to himself. Why should it not go sideways or upwards, but constantly to the earth's centre.&quot; In similar terms, Voltaire wrote in his Essay on Epic Poetry (1727), &quot;Sir Isaac Newton walking in his gardens, had the first thought of his system of gravitation, upon seeing an apple falling from a tree.&quot; These accounts are probably exaggerations of Newton's own tale about sitting by a window in his home (Woolsthorpe Manor) and watching an apple fall from a tree.

Various trees are claimed to be &quot;the&quot; apple tree which Newton describes. The King's School, Grantham, claims that the tree was purchased by the school, uprooted and transported to the headmaster's garden some years later, the staff of the [now] National Trust-owned Woolsthorpe Manor dispute this, and claim that a tree present in their gardens is the one described by Newton. A descendant of the original tree can be seen growing outside the main gate of Trinity College, Cambridge, below the room Newton lived in when he studied there. The National Fruit Collection at Brogdale[39] can supply grafts from their tree (ref 1948-729), which appears identical to Flower of Kent, a coarse-fleshed cooking variety.

There are a lot of tutorials that show how to make text for the Blender Game Engine, for example to use in menus. Most involve editors, graphics programs, TGA files, UV mapping, scripting, higher magic and so on. Here is a different approach that takes but a minute.

#Start Blender.
#Remove the default cube. ('''X''')
#Add text. ('''SPACE''' → ''Add'' → ''Text'')
#You may want to switch to edit mode ('''TAB''') and use the variety of features that Blender provides for editing, formatting and laying out text. They are described in the [http://wiki.blender.org/index.php/Manual/Text Blender Manual Section]. For a start just use '''BACKSPACE''' to delete the letters &quot;Text&quot; and type your own like &quot;This is simple&quot;.
#When finished editing go back to object mode. ('''TAB''')
#Convert your text to a mesh. ('''ALT+C''' → ''Mesh'')
#Press '''P'''

This is as simple as it gets. Of course you can do all kinds of laying out with your text before the conversion in step 6 (check the Blender Manual) as well as modeling, texturing and dynamically manipulating thereafter (as you have a normal mesh). Simply remember that you need to make sure the text is final before you convert it.

This tutorial has been tested with Blender 2.8 RC1.

&quot;However, it should be pointed out that while this is so incredibly simple, it is not poly-count efficient. Remember, there is more to making a game than making it look good--making it run well. If you need a cut-and-dry menu, this is the best way. If you need to worry about performance, then it might be worth it to check out some UV Mapping and external program usage. --[[User:Bullercruz1|Bullercruz1]] ([[User talk:Bullercruz1|talk]]) 23:07, 7 February 2009 (UTC)&quot;

It is also important to note that these fonts can't be dynamic, contrary to bitmap-uvmapped ones...

      <text xml:space="preserve">You may find Learning Klingon difficult due to the alien nature of the language. When Orkand developed tlhIngan Hol, he specifically designed it to violate typical human language rules; Klingon uses a word order rarely found among human languages, and combines sounds in atypical ways. Beginners may have more luck familiarizing themselves with basic words and phrases to get the phonetic pronunciation, than trying to memorize pronunciation rules.

Klingon cursing ranks among the most difficult linguistic activity; the most offensive words and phrases in tlhIngan Hol utilize difficult to produce sounds such as tlh or Q, as well as difficult sequences of phonemes such as toDSaH. Mastering Klingon cursing gives practical experience with pronunciation and sound formation.

==Qapla'==
The Klingon word for success. For many Star Trek fans this is the only word they know. Hopefully, you'll be able to construct whole sentences by the end of this course!

===Q===
The word Qapla' present difficulty at first due to the tlhIngan Hol '''Q''' sound; you pronounce this sound somewhat like the '''q''' but harder and louder, and the difference may not be clear at first. To form the '''Q''' sound, put the back of your tongue as far back into your mouth as you can; then force the air up as if you're trying to cough something up. Pronounce the '''Q''' forcefully. You may find this similar to producing a strong English 'k' sound, but with the back of your tongue pressed to your uvula (the. another way to think of it is a Klingon '''q''' followed by a Klingon '''H'''

==petaQ==
The word '''petaQ''' (pronounced) serves well as an introductory Klingon word; this word functions as an epithet, similar to &quot;bastard&quot; or &quot;asshole&quot; in context. This will undoubtedly provide an enriching addition to your skeletal Klingon vocabulary.

==HIja' or HISlaH==
'''HIja'''' or '''HISlaH''' both mean yes (in answer to a yes/no question)

==ghobe==
And '''ghobe'''' means no (again, in answer to a yes/no question)

==jIyajbe'==
And finally a whole sentence:

What? you ask. How can a whole sentence be encoded in one word?

Next lesson we'll enter the exciting world of Klingon grammar and analyse this sentence. For now, all you need to know is that '''jIyajbe'''' means 'I don't understand' (hopefully, you'll never have to use this phrase!)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Vocabulary==
'''loD'''- man
'''be'''' - woman
'''qIp''' - hit
==Word Order==
One of the most confusing things about Klingon is the word order. In English, we write the subject, then the verb, then the object. In Klingon the object comes first, then the verb and finally the subject.

If you don't know what subjects, objects and verbs are [[Klingon/Grammar/Subject-Object-Verb|click here]].

===Example:===
====Vocabulary====
'''loD''' - man

'''be'''' - woman

'''qIp''' - hit


Look at this Klingon sentence:

'''be' qIp loD'''

From an English point of view it looks like the sentence means 'Woman hits man'

However, that's not right. The object is at the start of the sentence and the subject is at the end in Klingon, so '''be' qIp loD''' actually means 'Man hits woman'

(Note: 'woman hits man' would be '''loD qIp be'''')

==Articles==

There are two articles in English; 'a/an' (indefinite article) and 'the' (definite article). Klingon has no equivalents to these words. So the sentence '''loD qIp be''' could mean any of the following:

''The woman hits the man.''

''A woman hits the man''

''The woman hits a man''

''A woman hits a man''

==Affixes==

An affix is either a prefix or a suffix.
For example, in English the prefix '''dis-''' is used to reverse the meaning of a verb, as in agree and disagree. Suffixes are used to form plurals, as in child and children.

Affixes are central to Klingon grammar and they will be introduced gradually.

===Verb Prefixes===
Only verbs have prefixes. A prefix indicates the pronouns that accompany a verb. As such, they are sometimes called pronomial prefixes. There are almost thirty of them and they will be introduced throughout the course. Here are the first four:

{| border=&quot;1&quot;
|Prefix
|Subject 	
|Object
|-
|'''jI-''' 	
|I 	
|none
|-
|'''bI-''' 	
|you (sing.) 	
|none
|-
|'''Su-''' 	
|you (plural) 	
|none
|-
|'''ma-''' 	
|we 	
|none
|}

Suffixes with an object will be introduced in a later lesson.

A prefix is added to the front of a verb to form a simple sentence:

*'''jIQam'''. 	I stand.
*'''bIQam'''. 	You stand. (referring to one person)
*'''SuQam'''. 	You stand. (referring to more than one person)
*'''maQam'''. 	We stand.


Punctuation: Some writers do not end single sentences of Klingon with the final period (.). This practice is common in The Klingon Dictionary. However it is normal practice when writing several sentences to end each with a period, as in English. I would recommend that all sentences in Klingon end with a period.

Verbs can be used without any prefix. The absence of a prefix can be translated in several ways, but the most common is where the subject is any one of he, she, it or they, and with no object.

So '''yIt''', which is a verb meaning ''walk'', on its own can form a sentence meaning ''He walks'', ''She walks'', or ''They walk'', and so on. Of course, if there is a noun, it is used instead of the pronoun. We will see examples of this later.

===Suffixes===

Klingon also makes extensive use of suffixes, which are added to the end of verbs and nouns.

There are several different suffixes, but this lesson introduces just one, '''-be''''. It is added to the end of a verb to negate it, so is often translated by not or do not.

*'''jIyItbe'.''' 	I do not walk.

===Simple Sentences===

In Klingon, the word order in a sentence is reversed. The subject comes after the verb instead of before it. The subject is the noun carrying out the action of the verb, so in Klingon it appears at the end of the sentence:

*'''Qet loD.''' 	The man runs. 

In this sentence, no prefix is required on the verb.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Writing Technical Instructions''' ==

Many people are used to following written instruction, but most have never written instructions for another person or audience. In potential careers you may have to write instructions. While some may be short and brief, other instructions could be longer and take great thought to complete. For this reason it is important to know how to write a persuasive and useful set of instructions. Writing useful instructions can be difficult because people read and comprehend things differently. There are people who are visual learners and using written instructions may pose many problems. How many can you count? Keeping that in mind, as well as the fact that the readers will have all educational backgrounds and various learning styles, will enable you to write comprehensive instructions for everyone. It is important to convey the facts in a simple, logical manner. The information in this section will give you advice and guide you in your writing process.

== '''Important Points When Writing Instructions''' ==

Being persuasive and ensuring that your instructions are usable are two of the most important qualities of a successful set of instructions. You can use these five guidelines to write the most successful and effective set of instructions.


'''Concise and Clear:''' People cannot use your instructions if they cannot understand what you are trying to convey. It is important to use common terminology whenever it is possible, and if you must use unfamiliar words, be sure to be descriptive and explain thoroughly. Stay away from long and wordy sentences that are hard to decipher. Keep sentences short and understandable. If you make your instructions too lengthy, your reader may deviate or forfeit due to frustration. Also, try to avoid the use of slang or phrase words. These might mean something different to different people or cultures.


'''Know Your Audience''' An effective set of instructions needs to be tailored to its specific and intended audience. This is not to say that an audience cannot be broad or inexperienced, but your set of instructions for example, professionals at the workplace, where common knowledge is quite different from the general public, who can is not familiar with the professional verbiage. Never make assumptions about education level. Be sure to choose your audience before drafting instructions. Always remember to keep your audience in mind when writing a new set of instructions.


'''Add Graphical Elements:''' Pictures speak louder than words. Adding graphics to convey your thoughts may be more effective than the words themselves. Instructions that are well illustrated and accompany your written instructions are usually highly successful. It adds an extra level of understanding and allows the reader to skim or troubleshoot if problems occur. Pictures add an additional dimension that will allow your reader to visualize the end product. Also, when using graphics you should be mindful of those visual learners, and adapt the graphics.

Although pictures are great, you must be cautious not to include photographs or illustrations that are confusing or not associated with the actual written instructions. If you pair a poor picture with your instructions, you might cause the reader stress when trying to decipher what you mean.

Also, when taking pictures, ensure that the area is well lit and the pictures are clear and bright. Dark or fuzzy pictures are often difficult to follow. Take care to photograph the subject in the same orientation each time to avoid confusion and consider using a tripod.

Size is also important when using images in instructions. A picture that is too small to see is just as useless as a blurry image. 
 
''To be powerful and understandable, your text and graphic for each step should clearly correlate to that step of the instructions.''

'''Design Your Page:'''  Remember that the readers will actually be performing the task as they read along with the instructions. So you should not use solid blocks of small, hard to decipher text. Make sure to create a design and layout for your instructions page that will allow easy readability and add aesthetic quality. Keeping the page simple, but with a defined hierarchy, will assist the reader in completing the steps of the instructions.

When designing your page, a solid hierarchy is important for scan-ability. The use of bold headings, italics, and roman numerals will aid the reader in finding their place easily and helps with the overall visual appearance.

'''Create a Flow:''' It is important your instructions be planned out in a logical progression. Make sure to state the problem clearly on the first page. Follow your problems with a set of specific steps detailing how to solve the proposed problem. Technical instructions must flow in a logical pattern. For example, when assembling a table it would not be good if you put the finishing touches on it before you had all the screws in place. As stated before, there should also be clear graphics where necessary to clarify the action. Remember, a picture is worth a thousand words. 

'''Test Your Instructions:''' We all know that instructions are difficult to write and that sometimes it sounds good on paper, but when you actually attempt to put the instructions to use, you might find that your wording makes no sense to others. Remember what might be common or obvious to you might baffle your readers, so know your audience. In addition to testing your instructions on yourself, have someone who knows nothing about your product test it. This is called a usability study. Take notes on what worked and what didn't and then revise your instructions accordingly. In the long run the more people that test your instructions, the more effective the final set will be.

== '''Tailoring Instructions to the Intended Audience''' ==

Tailoring your instructions to the intended audience can be one of the most difficult tasks of your writing process. Before you begin your writing process you need to identify who your audience will be and how you can tailor your instructions to make them as understandable as possible. To help you do this there are several questions you can ask yourself:

* ''What background might your audience members have and what prior knowledge might they possess?'' This will help you to determine what you will need to include or not include in your instructions.
* ''What will their needs/interests be?'' 
* ''How will their demographics affect how you write?'' If the majority of your audience comes from a different demographic than you, you need to take into consideration language issues and make sure graphics are clear.
* ''Is there a variability in your audience?'' If your audiences are composed of people with varied backgrounds, your writing should tailored to the majority of your audience and you may also consider adding additional information in appendices.

Based on your answers to the above questions, there are several ways you can insure that your instructions will be as clear as possible to your readers.

* Add information (such as tips, side notes) the readers will need in order to understand your instructions and make sure no key information is missing.
* Do not add information that is unnecessary; it may confuse or mislead your readers.
* Make sure the document is at the level of your audience. 
* Add examples/graphics. Graphics can be very helpful to a reader.
* Have a clear organization. Lack of organization creates confusion and frustration.

== '''Writing Your Instructions''' ==

The following sections are descriptions of the different parts of the general superstructure of a set of instructions. What sections to include will vary based on the complexity of the instructions. Your document may contain any of the following sections:

* Introduction
* Description of Equipment
* Materials and Equipment Necessary
* The procedures
* Visual aids
* Troubleshooting

=== '''Introduction''' ===

What is included in your introduction will depend on what your instructions are for and who will be using them. In any case, the introduction should be brief, but still informative. The introduction can include any or all of the following sections:

* '''Subject/Aim:''' Here you should indicate the specific task that will be explained and what the outcome of the procedure will be.
* '''Intended Readers:''' You may want to identify who the intended readers of the instructions are and if the reader will need additional knowledge or background in order to complete the task.
* '''Scope:''' This will help the reader to know if the instructions will help them complete the task they want to or not.
* '''Organization:''' Giving the reader an overview of what the rest of the instructions will look like can help them to more easily understand them. This section could also go under scope.
* '''Safety:''' It is your responsibility to inform the readers of any hazards or dangers that could occur while they are completing the task. You need to display warnings in a clear and understandable fashion.

=== '''Description of Equipment''' ===

If there is equipment that the reader will have to use in order to operate or repair a piece of equipment, you may want to include a description of it.

=== '''Materials/Equipment List''' ===

Provide a list of equipment that the reader will need to accomplish the task so they know if they need additional tools or things they may not normally have. A list of supplies is also helpful for a reader to make sure that they have all the parts and pieces they need.

=== '''Procedure''' ===

This section is obviously the most important part of an instructions set since it is the actual steps that the reader will follow to complete the task at hand. There are many ways to format the procedures, but most are done with numbered lists. The following are things you should do to make the steps clear and concise:

* Write each step with concise wording so it is easily understood and completed.
** Techniques: 
*** Give readers enough information to perform the step, avoid redundancy.
*** Put the steps in a list. Numbering often works the best.
*** Highlight key words.

* Make sure the reader can locate steps quickly and easily.
** Techniques:
*** Number steps.
*** Skip lines between steps.

* Make actions stand out from the rest of the text.

* Tell the reader what to do if they make a mistake. Not knowing what to do will cause frustration and the reader may give up on the task.

=== '''Visual Aids''' ===

The use of graphics and pictures to correspond to each step is highly recommended. Each person has different learning habits; some like texts while others are better off with pictures. The presence of graphics also allows the reader to make sure he/she is still on the right track. In most situations it would be beneficial to have a combination of both graphics and words.

=== '''Troubleshooting''' ===

Instructions should include this section to tell the reader what to do if something goes wrong during the building process or if the completed project does not look like the expected outcome. Putting this information into a table format often works the best.

For an example set of instructions visit [https://www.prismnet.com/~hcexres/textbook/models.html#instructions] This webpage contains information from the textbook entitled ''Power Tools for Technical Communication'' by David A. McMurrey.

== '''Usability Testing''' ==

Usability testing is an absolutely crucial step in preparing an effective set of instructions. Once you have completed a draft of your instructions, it is important to test them to see where improvements can be made. A usability test should be performed on multiple testers for each updated draft of your instructions. Here is how you go about performing a usability testing:


1. First, you should choose your testers from a group that is representative of your intended audience. In order to single these specific users out, you may need to ask a few preliminary questions. For example, asking what their experience level with the task is or what their job field is. 


2. Next you need to choose how you will evaluate the tester's performance in completing the task. There are different methods to choose from, but one method is called the &quot;Think Aloud&quot; method. When using this method you ask your tester to complete the task using your instructions while verbalizing everything that is going through their head as they go through the instructions. Do not offer any help to the tester as he or she goes through the test, kindly tell them that you can answer their questions at the end. As the tester says what is confusing or hard you take notes. You can record this information in a chart that has three columns. In the first column you will record the problems your tester had. In the second column you write down what the possible cause of each problem was. In the third try to generate a possible solution to the problem or possible ways you can change your instructions to make them more understandable. Be sure to be descriptive in what you want to find out. Be sure to lay out testing form to collect all pertinent information about your testing so no information is overlooked or misplaced.


3. After the test is done look at your notes and ask the tester to elaborate on the problems that you noted. This is an important step because you are getting direct feedback from your audience. Make sure that you understand exactly what was confusing for them, as this will help you in writing the most successful set of instructions. Ask testers how you could change that step or part of the instructions to make them unambiguous.

 
4. Based on your findings edit and update your instructions. After you do so they should be more understandable and easier to follow for your intended audience. In many cases it is appropriate or even necessary to conduct one or more rounds of usability tests as you perfect your instructions. More testing may prove beneficial in discovering problems that were overlooked the first round of testing or because the problems may have been masked by original complications. If time permits, be sure to run as many rounds of usability testing as needed. 
 

* Note: Pay special attention to your intended audience and ensure that you have the number of testers, and accurate demographics necessary to accurately represent your sample. For example, if you are making instructions for a 'beginner audience' and test an all 'expert' audience your sample will not be representative. In addition, if you are wanting to make instructions for a large audience of several ages, gender and experience level, your sample will need to be large and representative of that population.
* If instructions need tester to use both hands throughout (like tying a tie,) consider making all the instructions visible without turning pages so it is easier for the tester to complete the task.

== '''General Writing Style Tips''' ==

Many people resist reading instructions. They try to figure out for themselves how to operate a product or perform a task and will turn to the instructions only if all their efforts fail. When they do read the instructions, they want to understand everything immediately without having to read anything twice. A simple design, plain wording, and clear instructions will be critical to encouraging readers to pay attention to your instructions or procedures.

When writing technical documents and instructions there are several style tips you should keep in mind:

* Use a lot of imperative, command or direct address, kinds of writing. It is OK to use &quot;you&quot; when writing instructions, because you are addressing the reader directly.
* Use active instead of passive voice.
* Do not leave out articles such as a, an and the.
* Use action verbs.
* Ensure graphics match descriptive text to avoid confusion.
* Label graphics by steps, for example Step 17 &quot;...Put...&quot;, the graphic should be labeled clearly with a number &quot;17&quot; or if multiple graphics exists for a line of text writing in chronological order &quot;17a, 17b, etc.&quot; or if different views &quot;17 front, 17 back, etc.&quot;
* Keep text short but descriptive.
* Avoid complicated jargon, use simple verbiage to ensure understanding by a broad spectrum of users.
* Use concise headings and subheadings to describe and highlight each section.
* Leave plenty of white space around headings.
* Highlight safety information and warnings.
* Keep illustrations as simple as possible.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;Word on scientific theories: All theories are wrong, some are useful.&quot;

Eh?  All theories are wrong?  I've never heard this as a serious position, just something to keep in mind: All theories are ''potentially'' wrong.

Removed this, highly problematic and misleading.

== Editing Talk:General Biology/Getting Started/History and Origin of Life ==

Please, I need help from teachers (language corrections and text organization)

&lt;big&gt;about Origin of life: 3 hypotheses&lt;/big&gt;

I am the author and owner of copyrights specified at my website, and I wish to give it free for Wikibooks adding more one existent hypotheses.

The text should be something like:

.Universal Reproduction - The method of comparative anatomy between Cosmological and Biological evolutions suggests a model of galactic system identical to a horizontal base-pair of nucleotides, the fundamental unit of DNA/RNA and a model of cell system with same configuration. Then, the theoretical models suggests how Nature has inserted all informations of our galaxy inside the building blocks of biological systems (aka &quot;life&quot;)and since the same model's configuration is theoretically found at atoms systems,half-material quantum vortexes, the electric-magnetic spectrum of light waves,and any other natural system,the model should be a natural formula called Matrix/DNA.The final deduction is that has no origins of life inside this Universe because the Universe seems to be a place where is occurring a natural process like genetic reproduction of a natural system, living and conscious, that created it through the Big Bang.The theory is called &quot;The Universal Matrix/DNA of Natural Systems and Life's Cycle&quot;.

Despite we can see this formula merely putting our left hand upon it and understanding why and how Nature did our hands in this way, where the sizes and functions of fingers are the same size and functions of life's cycle circuit that makes the formula working, and despite the author have been for 30 years accumulating thousands of factual natural evidences reinforcing the theory,it needs proof that the original galaxies were built like the theoretical model.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;'''Purpose'''&lt;/big&gt;

The amino acid sequence of a protein is a valuable source of insight into its function, structure, and history.
1. The sequence of a protein can be compared with other known sequences to decide whether significant similarities exist. Using computers, a search for kinship between a new sequenced protein and millions of previous previously sequenced ones only takes seconds. If the newly isolated protein is  a member of an established class of protein, we can infer information about the protein's structure and function.
2. Comparison of sequences of the same protein between different species teaches about evolutionary pathways. Genealogical relationships between species can be inferred based on differences in the sequences between their proteins. Assuming the mutation rate of proteins is constant, the analysis of sequences of different proteins from different species can provide information when these two evolutionary lines diverged. For example, comparison of serum albumins found in primates indicate that humans and African apes diverged 5 million years ago instead of 30 million years ago.
3. Amino acids sequences can be searched for the presence of internal repeats. Such repeats reveal the history of the protein, and many proteins have arisen from duplication of primordial genes followed by diversification. 
4. Many proteins contain amino acid sequences that serve as signals for their destinations or controlling their processes
5. Sequences provide a basis for preparing antibodies specific for a protein of interest. Parts of an amino acid sequence will elicit an antibody when injected into a mouse or rabbit. These specific antibodies are useful for determining the amount of proteins in the blood.
6. Amino acid sequences are valuable for making DNA probes used for encoding its proteins. By knowing the primary structure, it permits the use of reverse genetics. DNA sequences that correspond to part of an amino acid sequence can be constructed on the basis of genetic code. These DNA sequences can be used as probes to isolate the gene encoding the protein so that the entire sequence can be determined. The gene in turn can provide information about the physiological regulation of the protein.




&lt;big&gt;'''Determining the amino acid sequences'''&lt;/big&gt;


'''1. Hydrolysis:''' &lt;br/&gt;
The peptide is heated in 6M hydrochloric acid (HCl) at 110&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; C for 24 hours. This procedure is required in order to hydrolyze peptide chain into its [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acid]]. 

'''2. Separation'''&lt;br/&gt;
Amino acids from the peptide is identified by eluting the mixture with buffers of increasing pH in an ion-exchange chromatography column on a sulfonated polystyrene. The volume of  [[Structural Biochemistry/Buffer|buffer]] used can be correlated to a specific type of amino acid. The most acidic side chain amino acid will emerge first, while the most basic side chain amino acid will emerge last. The amount of each amino acid (one, two, or three residues of a same type)can be determined based on the absorbances.

'''3. Quantitation'''&lt;br/&gt;
Amino acids from a peptide are quantified by reacting them with ninhydrin, which is used to detect a microgram of an amino acid. Most amino acids will give an intense blue color, except proline which gives a yellow color due to the secondary amino group in its structure. Furthermore, to detect a nanogram of amino acid, fluorescamine, which reacts with the alpha-amino group, can be used, yielding a highly fluorescent product. The concentration of amino acid is proportional to either the optical absorbance of the sample treated with ninhydrin or the fluorescence emitted by the sample treated with fluorescamine. 

This method tells you only the composition of the proteins, not the sequence of the amino acids. [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Purification/Edman Sequencing|Edman degradation]] is the one that provides the order of the sequence of amino acids in a protein.

'''''&lt;big&gt;Determination of composition of amino acid is then followed by determination of amino acid sequence. It can be done using 2 complimentary methods:&lt;/big&gt;'''''

'''1.Edman Degradation'''&lt;br/&gt;
[[Image:EDMAN DEGRADATION.jpg‎]]
[[Image:Edman degradation123.png‎‎|thumb|right|250px|The reaction for Edman Degradation occurs through the use of phenylisothiocyanate and in acidic conditions]]

#:This method is done by cleaving the amino acid one by one from the amino terminal. The chemical used for this process is ''Phenyl isothiocyanate''. Amino acids that react with this chemical will form '''phenylthiohydantoin (PTH)-amino acid''' (e.g. PTH-glycine). Under mildly acidic conditions,( PHT)-one termial residue is released. This compound is then identified using chromatographic procedures. Edman degradation is quite simple to perform (the sequencer is automated), but this method is not effective for long peptides (more than 50 residues) because it takes an hour to perform one cycle of degradation.
#:One example of chromatographic procedure is high-pressure liquid chromatography. In this procedure, the PTH-amino acid is separated into its components such that the amino acid's identity can be found by its absorbance and elution time.
#:Edman degradation is the most efficient technique used to sequence proteins without breaking the bonds between residues. Also, the development of automated sequencers has allowed for much quicker and efficient polypeptide sequencing.
'''Controlled cleavage using various chemical and enzyme'''
#:''For listing of special enzyme and chemicals, please see [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Structural_Biochemistry/Proteins/Cutting_Enzymes]
#:Some chemicals and enzymes are known to cleave peptides at certain locations (e.g.: the amino or carboxyl end of certain amino acid). Using these chemicals and enzymes, peptides can be cut into fragments with sizes that can be analyzed using Edman Degradation. By combining 2 or more chemicals and enzymes that cleave peptides at different position, the resulting small fragments (whose amino acid sequence has been identified through Edman Degradation) can be put together in a manner similar to putting together a jigsaw puzzle.

'''Limitations of Edman Degradation'''

Even peptides less than 50 amino acids in length can become problematic when performing Edman degradation. One example of this is when the N-terminal of an amino acid is in an unfavorable position such as the inside of a protein, or when it is sequestered. In addition, Edman degradation may fail due to post-translational modifications of proteins such as glycosidation, acetylation, phosphorylation, and fatty acid addition. For example, the formylation of an amino acid will prevent reaction with phenyl isothiohydantoin. In particular, disulfide bridge between two cysteins (Cys) can complicate the sequencing by sequestering the N-terminus, or sterically hindering the cyclization of the phenyl thiourea intermediate. This could be modified by reducing the disulfides (with beta mercaptoethanol or DDT) and oxidizing the cysteine sidechains to their corresponding sulfonic acids with performic acid to prevent disulfide formation, and then performing the sequence as usual. 

'''2. Mass Spectrometry'''

[[Structural Biochemistry/Protein sequence determination techniques/Mass Spectroscopy|Mass Spectroscopy]] is another technique that can be used to determine protein sequence, but it can only be identified with the parent protein with the fragments cleaved by specific enzymes. The mass of ionized proteins can be obtained by measuring the time of flight of those ions as they are triggered by a laser beam and travel through the flight tube to the detector. The lighter massive ions will travel faster and arrive at the detector first due to Newton's second law (F = ma).  The mass spectrum recorded is then analyzed and compared against a database of sequenced proteins. The sequences of protein fragments, therefore, can be determined in detail if the process is repeated with different enzymes; the fragments become smaller, and the overlapping fragments can thus be used to establish the order.

'''Limitations of Mass Spectrometry'''

One limitation of using Mass Spectrometry as a means to determine protein sequence is in situations in which more than one amino acid has a specific mass. For example, since Leucine and Isoleucine have the same molecular weight (131.17 g/mol), identical mass spectrometry data would be obtained for these two amino acids and in this case render the method ineffective.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''General Information of Buffers
A significant change in [[Structural Biochemistry/pH|pH]] can lead to harmful reaction to molecular structure, biological activity and function. Protein structure can be disrupted and [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzymes]] denatured due to the effects of pH on cellular structure. Fortunately, nature has evolved a solution to this problem; solutions that resist changes in pH are called buffers. If an acid is added to an unbuffered solution, the pH will change suddenly and proportional to the amount of acid added. However, the pH will drop gradually in buffer solution when acid is added. Buffers also mitigate the pH increase caused by adding base.

Buffers are aqueous systems that resist changes in pH as acid or base is added. They are usually composed of a weak acid and its conjugate base. Biological buffers, mixture of weak acids (the proton donors) and their conjugate bases (the proton acceptors), help maintain biomolecules in optimal ionic state of pH 7. Buffering is a result of two reversible reaction equilibrium occurring in a solution of about equal concentration of proton donor and its conjugate proton acceptor; when acid or base is added to a buffer, it results in a change in the ratio of the relative concentrations of the weak acid and its anion, or the pH. However, this change in pH is significantly greater than it would be without a buffering solution to accommodate excess hydronium or hydroxide ions.
'''

== Properties ==
A buffer solution usually contains a weak acid and its conjugate base, but it can also contain a weak base and its conjugate acid. When H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; are added to a buffer, the weak acid's conjugate base will become protonated, thereby &quot;absorbing&quot; the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; before the pH of the solution lowers significantly. Similarly, when OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; is added, the weak acid will become deprotonated to its conjugate base, thereby resisting any increase in pH before shifting to a new equilibrium point. In biological systems, buffers prevent the fluctuation of pH by processes that produce acid or base by-products to maintain an optimal pH.

Each conjugate acid-base pair has a characteristic pH range as an effective buffer. The buffering region is about 1 pH unit on either side of the pKa of the conjugate acid, where it has the most effectiveness for resisting large changes in pH when either acid or base is added.

== Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation ==

The equilibrium constant for the deprotonation of an acid is written as: 

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{K_a = \frac{[A^+][A^-]}{[HA]} }&lt;/math&gt;    (1)

Where [A&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;-&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;] is the concentration of a conjugate base and [HA] is the concentration of an acid

Taking logarithms of both sides, we get

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{\log K_a = \log H^+ - \log \frac{[A^-]}{[HA]} }&lt;/math&gt;     (2)

subtract both sides by log([A&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;-&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]/[HA]), we get

&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{pH = pK_a + \log \frac{[A^-]}{[HA]} }&lt;/math&gt;     (3)

This is the Henderson-Hasselbalch Equation. It describes the dissociation of a weak acid (HA) in the presence of its conjugate base (A&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;-&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;).

The midpoint of the buffering region is when one half of the acid reacts to dissociation and where the concentration of the proton donor (acid) equals that of the proton acceptor (base); the pH of the equimolar solution of acid is equal to the pKa. (When the concentration ratio for conjugated base and weak acid, [A&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;-&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;]/[HA], is 1:1)

== Limitations ==
Buffers usually work well at a pH close to the pKa value of the acidic component. If too much acid is added to the buffer, or if the concentration is too strong, extra protons remain free and the pH will fall sharply. This is reflected in the titration curve and is known as the buffer capacity.

== Titration curve ==
This curve demonstrated the capacity of a buffer. In the middle part of the curve, it is flat because the addition of base or acid does not affect the pH of the solution drastically - this is the '''buffer zone'''. However, once the curve extends out of the buffer region, it will increase tremendously when a small amount of acid or base added to the buffer system. This effect demonstrated the buffer capacity of the solution.

== Physiological Buffers ==

Phosphoric acid system (pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = 7.4) and carbonic acid system (pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = 3.6) are two important buffer systems in human body.  The phosphate buffer system is an effective buffer in the cytoplasm of all cells.  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; acts as the proton donor and HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2–&lt;/sup&gt;- acts as the proton acceptor.

H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;–&lt;/sup&gt; ⇋ H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2–&lt;/sup&gt;

The bicarbonate buffer system is used to buffer blood plasma where the carbonic acid (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) acts as a proton donor and bicarbonate (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; acts as a proton acceptor.

H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  ⇋ HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

In this buffer system, when the pH of the blood plasma is too high, the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; of blood plasma is lowered.  The H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is dissociated to H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.  The CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the lungs is dissolved in the blood plasma resulting in a lower pH.  On the other hand if the pH of the blood plasma is too low, H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is added to the blood increasing the concentration of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.  This results in an increase of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the blood plasma.  The increase in the partial pressure of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the air space of the lungs causes extra CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to be exhaled ultimately resulting in a raise in pH.  Since the concentration of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can be adjusted rapidly through changes in the rate of respiration, a large reservoir of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; can quickly adjust this equilibria to keep blood pH at a nearly constant rate.

Buffers are also important for enzyme activities. There is an optimal pH for each enzyme. For example [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|protein]] cleavage enzyme pepsin works at pH 1-6 (pH=2 max), tripsin at pH 2-9 (ph=6 max) and alkaline phospatase at pH 4-10(pH=8 max). 

In addition to this, some reactions should be carried out at constant pH which is provided by buffer systems.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
[[Image:Hydride.png‎|This is a common form of a covalent bond where the hydrogens both share one electron each|right|thumb]]
'''Covalent bonds''' are chemical bonds that are formed by sharing valence electrons between adjacent atoms.  This type of bonding is mostly seen in interactions of non-metals. Covalent bonds allow elements the ability to form multiple bonds with other molecules and atoms - a fundamental necessity for the creation of macromolecules.
In the covalent bond, as the distance between the nuclei decreases, each nucleus starts to attract the other atom's electron, which lowers the potential energy of the system. Anyway, when the attraction increases, the repulsions between the nuclei and between the electrons increase as well. In covalent bonding, each atom achieves a full outer (valence) level of electrons. Each atom in a covalent bond counts the shared electrons as belonging entirely to itself. Most covalent substances have low electrical conductivity because electrons are localized and ions are absent. Overall, the atoms in a covalent bond vibrate, and the energy of these vibrations can be studied with the IR spectroscopy.

==Octet Rule==
A general rule to follow when looking at covalent bonding is the octet rule, also known as the noble gas configuration.  An atom participating in covalent bonding must (with few exceptions) follow the octet rule, which states that an atom must have eight electrons around it.  These electrons can be shared or unshared.  The two atoms do not need to share their electrons equally; an electron pair can be donated from one atom instead of each atom donating one electron.  A periodic table can be used to determine the number of valence electrons an atom.  The general rule is that all atoms will be stable if they can have eight electrons around them.  Therefore different atoms can share their unpaired electrons with other atoms with unpaired electrons to gain an octet.

There are quite a few exceptions to this rule.  Two very important ones are Hydrogen (H) and Helium (He).  These atoms do not have octets and only need a total of two electrons to be stable.  This is because hydrogen and helium only contain a 1s electron shell, which can only hold two electrons.  Other exceptions occur when the total number of electrons in a molecule or between two molecules is an odd number.  These molecules tend to be very reactive.  Also, atoms past the second row on the periodic table can have more than eight electrons surrounding them. &lt;ref&gt;Organic Chemistry by Vollhardt and Shore&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in phosphorus pentafluoride (PF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) the phosphorus is bonded to 10 electrons, and in sulfur hexafluoride (SF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) the sulfur atom is bonded to 12 electrons. Molecules can also be electron deficient, meaning there are not enough available electrons to complete full octets around all the atoms in the molecule. An example of an electron deficient molecule is boron trichloride (BCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). In this molecule, the boron atom is only bonded to three electron pairs, while the chlorides are surrounded by full octets. &lt;ref&gt;http://chemed.chem.wisc.edu/chempaths/GenChem-Textbook/Exceptions-to-the-Octet-Rule-573.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of Covalent Bonds==
Multiple covalent bonds can be formed between atoms, which are stronger than single bonds and have higher bond energy and shorter bond lengths. The bond order is used to determine the number of pairs of electrons in a covalent bond. When a molecule has double and single covalent bonds, it can have different chemical forms of equal energy as resonance structures, which has more stability and the bond is the average of the double and single covalent bond.  The characteristics of a covalent bond can also be effected by the two atoms it joins.

===Single Bonds===
[[File:Elektronenformel Punkte HCl.svg|An electron dot diagram of a covalent bond between chlorine and hydrogen|thumb|left]]
Single bonds are one of the weaker types of covalent bonds.  Single covalent bonds are also called sigma bonds.  These are made when only two electrons are shared.  This leads to an overlap of the orbitals and a merging of the electron density clouds.  Single bonds tend to be very flexible allowing atoms to rotate around the bond.  An example of a single bond is a carbon-carbon (C-C) covalent bond has a bond length of 1.54 A and bond energy of 356 kJ/mol.

Note that the properties of a single bond depends not only on the two atoms that is bonds but also on the atoms surrounding those atoms.  Sigma bonds have no nodal planes.

Some covalent single bonds will also have double bonds properties, which are shorter, rigid and non-rotated. One example is peptide bond in proteins which connect each amino acid together to form polypeptide. The peptide-bond is 1.32 A which is shorter than 1.54 A (C-C). The energy that needs to break the peptide bond is much higher than the single bond and this non-rotated single bond contributes the planar property in the polypeptide chain, which also makes the peptide bond more stable than the normal single bond. The double bond properties are contributed by the resonance structure of the pepetide bond.

===Double bonds===
[[Image:pi-bond.jpg|frame|Formation of a Pi-Bond from two p-orbitals.|thumb|right]]
Double bonds occur when a covalent bond consists of four shared electrons.  A double covalent bond contains a sigma bond and a pi bond.  Pi-bonds apply to the overlapping p-orbitals. The orbitals can only overlap in a side-by-side arrangement leading to one nodal plane on the internuclear axis. A single covalent bond only contains a sigma bond. Double bonds tend to be shorter than their single bond equivalents and stronger.  Double bonds also create electron density around the bond.  Unlike single bonds, double bonds are not flexible and the two adjoining atoms cannot rotate about the bond.

===Triple Bonds===

[[Image:Acetylene-CRC-IR-dimensions-2D.png‎ |thumb|C2H2.]]

A triple covalent bond contains one sigma bond and two pi bonds where six electrons are being shared.  These bonds are stronger than double bonds and shorter.  They are more rigid than double bonds and have a larger electron density.  The most common triple bonds are on carbons like C2H2.  The skeletal form to draw a triple bond is three straight lines connecting the two atoms.

===Polar Covalent Bonds===
Covalent bonds can be polar or non-polar depending on the electro-negativity value of the atoms bonded together. If there is a very large difference between the two atoms' electro-negativity values, a polar covalent bond is formed. The atoms do not need to posses the same electro-negativity values, or be of the same element, but they need to be relatively close in their values. If the electro-negativity values are closer, the co-valency between the atoms will be stronger. An exception to this rule is when a molecule possesses symmetry. When the overall dipole moment is zero, such as linear molecule of CO2, the molecule is consider non-polar. The more electronegative atom will attract the electrons, making itself have a partial negative charge and giving the other atom a partial positive charge. These partial negative and positive charges are what account for the dipole-dipole, dipole-induce dipole, and induced dipole-induced dipole interaction. This attraction-to-repulsion stability is what gives the covalent bonds stability. In addition to the electro-negativity differences between atoms, covalent bonding also depends on the angles of adjacent atoms relative to each other. &lt;ref&gt;Berg, Jeremy; Tymoczko, John; Stryer, Lubert. Biochemistry, 6th edition. W.H. Freeman and Company. 2007. (7)&lt;/ref&gt;

Typical accepted values for determination of type of bonds:

Difference in electronegativity - X &lt; 0.5 - Non-polar covalent bond

Difference in electronegativity - 0.5 ≤ X ≤ 1.9 - Polar covalent bond

Difference in electronegativity - 1.9 &lt; X - Ionic bond

===Specific Types Of Covalent Bonds===
&lt;big&gt;'''Disulfide Bonds '''&lt;/big&gt;
In Chemical interactions, certain compounds can react to create a '''disulfide bond''', which is a type of covalent bond that is usually derived by the coupling of two thiols (-S-H). These interactions can also be called '''SS-bonds''' or '''disulfide bridges''', with the connectivity of these interactions mainly being R-S-S-R . 

'''Role in Protein Folding'''
Disulfide bonds can play a vital role in the tertiary structure of proteins in the effect they have on protein folding and stability. These disulfide bonds between proteins usually are formed between the thiol groups of cysteine residues. The other amino acid group in which sulfur appears is methionine, which cannot form disulfide bonds.
[[Image:Disulfide-bond.png|thumb|left|alt=Formation of a Disulfide Bond.|Formation of a Disulfide Bond.]]
Disulfide bonds help to stabilize the tertiary structure of a protein molecule in several ways, for example, The disulfide bonds destabilize the unfolded form of a protein by lowering its overall entropy, or state or chaos. Also, when the disulfide bonds  link two segments of the protein chain, this increases the effective local concentration of protein residues and lowers the effects of water in a that specific region. Since water molecules are known to attack amide-amide bonds, lowering the effects of water in these disulfide bond- regions helps to stabilize a protein.

===Covalent Bond: Bond Length and Bond Energy===
The bond energy (BE) is the energy required for the attraction or breakage between the atoms. Since it is the energy needed to break the attraction between the atoms, the bond energy is endothermic and positive. However, the energy required for the formation of the bond is exothermic and a negative value. 
The bond length is the distance between the nuclei of two covalent bonded atoms. It can be calculated based on the total radii of the bonded atoms. As a result, the bond length increases when the covalent radius increases. And the shorter the bond length, the higher bond energy will be needed to break the attraction between the atoms because shorter distance between the atoms means the bond will be stronger and harder to break. On the other hand, the longer the bond length is, the lower bond energy is needed to break a weaker bond. 
One can use bond energy to determine the ΔH&lt;sub&gt;rxn&lt;/sub&gt;. In a reaction, when two atoms react with each other to form the product of different atoms, there are two types of bond energy. One is the energy required for the reactant to be broken and the other one is the energy required for products to be formed. As a result, the difference between the two bond energy is the enthalpy or the work of the reaction. 
ΔH&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;rxn&lt;/sub&gt;= ΔH&lt;sub&gt;reactant bonds broken&lt;/sub&gt; + ΔH&lt;sub&gt;product bonds formed&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Silberberg, Martin S.(2010).

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''hydrogen bond''' is formed by a '''dipole-dipole force''' between an electronegative atom (the hydrogen acceptor) and a hydrogen atom that attaches covalently with another electronegative atom (the hydrogen donor) of the same molecule or of a different molecule.  Only nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine atoms can interact with hydrogen to form hydrogen bond; this is different than a hydrogen covalent bond. In a hydrogen bond, the lone pair electrons on oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine interact with the partial positive hydrogen that is covalently bonded to one of those atoms. The hydrogen atom in a hydrogen bond is shared by two electronegative atoms such as oxygen or nitrogen.) Hydrogen bonds are responsible for specific base-pair formation in the DNA double helix and a major factor to the stability of the DNA double helix structure.  A ''hydrogen-bond donor'' includes the hydrogen atom and the atom to which it is most tightly linked with. The hydrogen-bond also play a very important roles in proteins' structure because it stabulizes the secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure of proteins which formed by alpha helix, beta sheets, turns and loops. The hydrogen-bond connected the amino acides between different polypeptide chains in proteins structure.    The ''hydrogen-bond acceptor'' is the atom that is less tightly linked to the hydrogen atom. 

Hydrogen bonds are fundamentally electrostatic interactions and are much weaker than covalent bonds.  They are, however, the strongest kind of dipole-dipole interaction. The electronegative atom to which the hydrogen atom is bonded with pulls electron density away from the hydrogen atom, developing a partial positive charge.  Therefore, the hydrogen atom can then interact with a partial negatively charged atom through an electrostatic interaction.

== Components ==
Hydrogen bonding is a form of '''electrostatic interaction''' between a hydrogen atom bonded to two electronegative atoms; one of which is the hydrogen-bond donor that has a stronger bond between itself and the hydrogen. These electronegative atoms are nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine; this electronegative atom pulls electron density away from the hydrogen atom, giving it a partially positive charge. This partial positive charge is attracted to the partial negative charge of the hydrogen bond acceptor (an electron density rich atom).  The chemical bond formed between the hydrogen-bond donor, hydrogen atom, and hydrogen-bond acceptor has a straight, linear structure.

== H-bonding ==
'''Hydrogen bonding (H-bond)''' is a non-covalent type of bonding between molecules or within them, intermolecularly or intramolecularly. This type of bonding is much weaker and much longer than the covalent bond and ionic bonds, but it is stronger than a van der waals interaction. It also carries some features of covalent bonding: direct and straight. In other words, H-bond donor and H-bond acceptor lie along the straight line. In order to form an H-bond, an H-bond donor and H-bond acceptor are required. The H-bond donor is the molecule that has a hydrogen atom bonded to a highly electronegative, small atom with available valence (N, F, and O follow the above description the best because they are very electronegative, making H, which is covalently attached to them, very positive). The H-O, H-N, and H-F bonds are extremely polar; as a result, the electron density is easily withdrawn from the hydrogen atom towards the electronegative atom. The partially positive hydrogen in one molecule attracts to partially negative lone pair of the electronegative atom on the other molecule and H-bond forms as a result of such an interaction. All the hydrogen bonds vary in strength

Other important facts about hydrogen bonding are as follows. The small sizes of nitrogen, oxygen, and fluorine are essential to H bonding for two reasons. One is that it makes those atoms electronegative that their covalently bonded H is highly positive. Other reason is that it allows the lone pair on the other oxygen, nitrogen, or fluorine to come close to the H. Also, hydrogen bonding has a profound impact in many systems. Hydrogen bonding is also involves in the action of many enzymes [The Molecular Nature of Matter and Change].

==Properties of Water Due to Hydrogen Bonding==
Ammonia, water, and hydrogen fluoride all have higher boiling points than other similar molecules, which is due to hydrogen bonds. Bonds between hydrogen and these strongly electronegative atoms are very polar, with a partial positive charge on hydrogen. This partially positive hydrogen is strongly attracted to the partially negative oxygen on the adjacent molecule. In general, boiling points rise with the increase molecular weight, both because the additional mass requires higher temperature for rapid movement of the molecules and because heavier molecules have a greater London forces. Water's freezing point is also much higher than other similar molecules. An unusual feature is that it decreases in density when it freezes. The tetrahedral structure around each oxygen atom, with two regular bonds to hydrogen and two to other molecules. This requires a great amount of space between the ice molecules. Clathrates are molecules trapped in holes of solid, like ice, that is theorized to be able to be used as anesthesia.

== Hydrogen bond and physical properties ==
Hydrogen bonding has a significant influence on a molecule's '''boiling points'''. The boiling point usually increases with the increase of the molar mass. However, molecules that are involved in intermolecular H-bonding bonding have much higher boiling points in comparison with the molecules of the same molar mass that are not involved in H-bonding. This is because the unusually strong H-bonding forces allow for stronger interaction between water molecules and therefore creating a stronger bond and higher boiling point. &lt;ref name=&quot;hydrogen bonding&quot;&gt;[http://www.chemguide.co.uk/atoms/bonding/hbond.html hydrogen bonding], October 28, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, H-bonding is responsible for many unusual proprieties of water, such as its high boiling point, melting point, heat of vaporization, high dielectric constant, surface tension, capillary action etc. 

Hydrogen bonding can occur between hydrogen and four other elements. Oxygen(most common), Fluorine, Nitrogen and Carbon. Carbon is the special case in that it only really interacts in hydrogen bonding when it is bound to very electronegative elements such as Fluorine and Chlorine. &lt;ref name=&quot;hydrogen bonding&quot;&gt;[http://www.chemguide.co.uk/atoms/bonding/hbond.html hydrogen bonding], October 28, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydrogen bonding is an important component of the three major macromolecules in biochemistry such as '''proteins''', '''nucleic acids''', and '''carbohydrates'''. The H-bonding is responsible for the structure and properties of proteins(enzymes). Hydrogen bonding is applicable in these biomolecules because of functional groups present. Some such are the carboxylic acid, alcohol or even amine groups. These provide either an hydrogen, oxygen or nitrogen for possible hydrogen bonds.&lt;ref name=&quot;hydrogen bonding&quot;&gt;[http://www.chemguide.co.uk/atoms/bonding/hbond.html hydrogen bonding], October 28, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

== Hydrogen bond in proteins ==
[[File:1RRX pdb slab 4.png|thumbnail|right|Hydrogen bonding within the &quot;green fluorescent protein&quot; 1RRX.]]
As previously mentioned, hydrogen bond can be intermolecular (ex. the bonding of water molecules) as well as intramolecular (ex. the bonding of protein and DNA).  The secondary structure of protein forms as a result of H-bonding between amino acids. For example, an α-helix is a rod-like secondary structure that forms as a result of H-bonding between the carboxyl group of (i) amino acid to the amino group of (i+4) amino acid. The turn (loop family) is a secondary structure which forms as a result of H-bond between carboxyl group of (i) amino acid and amino group of (i+3) amino acid. The β-sheet is a secondary structure which forms as a result of H-bonding between two or more β-strands. An anti-parallel β-strands forms hydrogen bonds that are straight due to the carbonyl group and the amino group being directly aligned, while a parallel β-strand forms hydrogen bonds that are slightly weaker in comparison to the anti-parallel because the carbonyl group and the amino group don't align perfectly, which forms a longer and weaker hydrogen bond.

The solubility of proteins in water is dependent on the ability to form hydrogen bonds with the protein surface. Proteins that have a greater hydrophilic surface content are generally more capable of forming hydrogen bonds with the surrounding water. The alteration of salt concentration of the solution, as is performed in salting out/in, creates a shielding effect that reduces the ability to form an H-bond with the hydrogens in water. The protein precipitation method of salting out utilizes this concept in protein fractionation.

==Hydrogen bonding in water==

[[File:3D model hydrogen bonds in water.jpg||thumb|100pix‎|Hydrogen bonding in water]]

The simplest example of a hydrogen bond can be found in water molecules. A water molecule consists of one oxygen atom attached to two hydrogen atoms. A hydrogen bond can be formed between two molecules of water. In the case of liquid water where there are many water molecules present, each water molecule could potentially hydrogen bond with up to 4 other molecules (2 through its 2 hydrogen atoms with each hydrogen bonding to another oxygen and another 2 through its 2 lone pairs on the oxygen that can hydrogen bond to 2 other hydrogen atoms). 

Although water has a low molecular mass, it has an unusually high boiling point. This property can be attributed to the large amount of hydrogen bonds that exists within water. Since these bonds are difficult to break, water’s melting point, viscosity, and boiling point are relatively high in comparison to other liquids that are similar but lack the hydrogen bonding. Water contains substantially more hydrogen bonds (up to 4) relative to certain other liquids that also have hydrogen bonding. An example would be ammonia in which the nitrogen only has one lone pair but 3 hydrogen atoms and thus only capable of forming up to 2 hydrogen bonds. 

Hydrogen bonding can also explain why the density of ice is less than the density of liquid water. In water's liquid form, the hydrogen bonding that keeps the molecules close together are constantly being broken and remade repeatedly at room temperature. But as the water turns into ice, the hydrogen bonding causes the water molecules to form a rigid, lattice structure, which causes large gaps between the molecules, resulting in it's smaller density yet larger volume.

Hydrogen bonding also accounts for water's high surface tension. The large availability of hydrogen bonding between water molecules (4 hydrogen bonds to one water molecule) proves how well they can stick to each other, forming a strong and stretchy surface. Common examples from which this characteristic can be observed include a cup filled slightly over the top without spilling over, or small organisms that are able to stay on top of water without breaking its surface. 

Water has a different number of hydrogen bonds depending upon the temperature. It is estimated that at 0oC each water molecule has an average of 3.69 hydrogen bonds, while at 25oC it has an average of 3.59 hydrogen bonds, and at 100oC it has an average of 3.24 bonds. The decreasing hydrogen bonds with an increase in temperature can be attributed due to the increase of molecular motion.

==Hydrogen bonding in DNA==
DNA contains four bases:Guanine, Cytosine, Adenine, and Thymine.  The complementary base pairs of guanine with cytosine and adenine with thymine connect to one another using hydrogen bonds. These hydrogen bonds between complementary nucleotides is what keeps the two strands of a DNA helix together. Each base can also form hydrogen bonds with the external environment such as with water. Although these internal and external hydrogen bonds are fairly weak, the consolidated power of all the millions of hydrogen bonds in DNA make it a stable molecule. Also, the hydrogen bonds on the phosphate groups on each nucleotide interact inducing two strands of DNA to conform to a helical structure.

{{BookCat}}

The base pairing in the DNA (one purine and one pyrimidine base) can be explained in more details.  In addition to holding the DNA strands together, the hydrogen bonding between the complementary bases also sequester the bases in the interior of the double helix.  Therefore, the hydrogen bonding between the bases reinforces the hydrophobic effects that stabilize the DNA.  The hydrophobic bases are again kept in the inside of the helix, whereas the polar exterior is touching the solvent water.  The hydrogen bonding is a weak molecular force, but it is an additive effect that stabilizes the DNA molecule.  The bases are precisely held by hydrogen bonding with the energy of 1 to 5 kcal/ mol (4 to 21 kJ/mol).  

The hydrogen bonding in the DNA bases of one purine (guanine and adenine) and one pyrimidine (cytosine and thymine) creates a similar shape. The pairing of guanine and cytosine shape and structure is very similar to that of the pairing of adenine and thymine. Cytosine and Guanine are held together by three hydrogen bonds. The pairing of adenine and thymine share two hydrogen bonds, thus the bond is slightly weaker and slightly longer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Van Der Waals interactions (also known as London Dispersion forces)''' are weak attractions that occur between molecules in close proximity to each other.  The basis of these interactions is that the distribution of electronic charge around an atom fluctuates with time.  As two atoms come closer to each other, this attraction increases until they are separated by the van der Waals ''contact distance''. When two molecules are too close to each other, the potential energy due to repulsion is very high, which means that it is unstable. There is repulsion even though the molecules are neutral, because there is an electron cloud surrounding each molecule. When these molecules get too close to each other, repulsion between the molecules occur. As the molecules move farther apart from each other, the potential energy due to repulsion decreases. This force was named after Johannes Diderik van der Waals, a Dutch physicist who studied them extensively.

[[Image:Argon dimer potential.png|thumb|300px|right|An example of interaction energy-distance relation graph obtained from argon dimer. Because of London dispersion forces, the interaction energy greatly increase when the distance between two atoms smaller han 3.8A]]

== Van der Waals radius ==

[[File:VanderwaalsAttraction.JPG|thumb|Vander Waals attraction]]
Two molecules can interact by Van der Waals forces when they are at a certain distance apart. The molecules are stabilized by Van der Waals interaction at the '''Van der Waals contact distance''' because the potential energy of the system at this distance is at its lowest. In the potential energy diagram shown to the right, the minimum potential energy point corresponds to the Van der Waals contact distance.

As the distance between the molecules increase, the weakly bonded molecules lose their stability and are no longer affected by the Van der Waals forces due to their large distance apart. When the distance between the two molecules decrease, however, the stabilization is decreased as well due to the electrostatic repulsion between the molecules. This level of repulsion is felt more drastically and more intensely in Van der Waals interactions than in [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Ionic interaction|ionic interactions]], where the level of repulsion is felt more gradually.

== Energy in Val der Waals interaction ==
Energies associated with van der Waals interactions are quite small. Usually, they are about 2 to 4 kJ/mol per atom pair. When the surfaces of two large molecules come together, a large number of atoms are in Van der Waals contact, and the net effect, summed over many atoms pairs can be substantial. Macromolecules such as [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|proteins]] and [[Structural Biochemistry/DNA|DNA]] contain numerous sites of potential van der Waals interactions that the cumulative effect of these small binding forces can be enormous; hence the most stable structure for macromolecules is that where weak interactions are maximized.{{BookCat}}

===== Van der waals interaction in proteins structure =====
Other than hydrogen-bond and disulfide bonds, Val der waals interaction is the another important bonding type that helps stabilizing the protein structure. In the coiled-coil protein, there are Heptad repeat which form by the side chain interaction between each alpha helix; hepad-repeat is repeated in every 7th residues. If these repeating residues are hydrophobic, such as leucine, van der waals interaction will be formed to stabilize this protein structure.

The pH of a solution is defined as the negative logarithm of its hydrogen ion (H+) concentration.
For example, If the concentration of H+ ion is 10^(-7), 
             then the pH of the solution = -log (10)^(-7) = 7.
Therefore, as the Hydrogen Ion concentration increases, pH value decreases
          &amp; as the Hydrogen Ion concentration decreases, pH value increases
The pH of a solution is a measure of the hydronium ion (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;) concentration on a logarithmic scale. The pH scale range is 0-14 from acidic to basic, respectively. The pH of a neutral compound, such as pure water at room temperature, is 7. The concentration of hydronium ions is related to the concentration of hydroxide ions by the dissociation of water:

H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &lt;math&gt;\rightleftharpoons&lt;/math&gt; H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

There is some confusion as to the meaning of the &quot;p&quot; in pH. Although many believe it to stand for &quot;power&quot; or &quot;potential,&quot; (i.e. power of hydrogen), that may not actually be the case. According to Jens G Norby's research (Dept of Biophysics, University of Aarhus, DK), &quot;power of hydrogen&quot; is actually a false association made by W.M. Clark. In actuality, Sorensen, the originator of the term, &quot;pH&quot; did not explicitly state a meaning for the &quot;p,&quot; and it appears to be an arbitrary selection of letters &quot;in his initial explanation of the electrometric method.&quot; For more information about this misconception, see, &quot;The origin and the meaning of the little p in pH.&quot;

pH is biologically important because it affects the structure and activity of macromolecules. pH is important in homeostatic processes. For example, most animals breathe not because they lack oxygen, but because CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; buildup in the blood increases the blood acidity beyond normal levels. Enzyme function is especially sensitive to pH: each  has an optimum pH at which they have maximum catalytic ability. Extreme pH levels can denature enzymes, completely disrupting their function. Other proteins are also destabilized by extreme pH levels.

The pH and pOH of a solution are related such that: pH+pOH=14. For example, if the pH of a solution is 5, the pOH of the same solution will be 14-5=9.

The pH of distilled water is 7, this is neutral. Any solution with a pH below 7 (i.e. pH 0 to pH 6.9) is acidic and any solution with a pH above 7 (i.e. pH 7.1 to pH 14) is basic.

Acidic solutions have a pH between 0 and 6.9 (the stomach contains HCl, which has a pH ~2). Alkaline solutions have a pH between 7.1-14 (the small intestine is pH 9). Neutral solutions are neither acidic nor alkaline so their pH is 7.

Hydrogen Chloride dissociates into hydrogen and chloride ions:

HCl(aq)=  	 	H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;  	 	+  	 	Cl&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;  	

Water dissociates to produce Hydrogen and hydroxide ions:

H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(l) 		= 		H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; 		+ 		OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; 	

Sodium Hydroxide dissociates to produce Sodium and hydroxide ions:

NaOH(aq) 		= 		Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; 		+ 		OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

In each case the concentration of Hydrogen ions can be measured or calculated.[H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] represents hydrogen ions and the square brackets represent concentration.

•	pH = -log[H+]

•	pH + pOH = 14

•	DECREASING pH, INCREASING pKa

•	pH = pKa + log ([A-]/[HA])

•	pH = pKa

==Mathematics==

The pH of a solution is calculated by

'''&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;pH = -log [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;'''

By convention H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is used to represent hydronium ions (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). A log system simplifies the notation of the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration in a medium. A pH increase of 1 is indicative of a ten-fold decrease of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; concentration. This negative logarithmic relationship between the hydrogen ion concentration and pH means that a lower pH indicates a higher concentration. Conversely a higher pH indicates a lower concentration of hydrogen ions.

The ionization of water is expressed by equilibrium constant: K&lt;sub&gt;eq&lt;/sub&gt; = [H+][OH-]/[H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O], which is 1.0 * 10&lt;sup&gt;−14&lt;/sup&gt; at 25°C.

The tendency of an acid, HA, to lose a proton and form its conjugate base, A-, is defined by the acid dissociation constant, K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;.  Another quantitative measurement of acidity is the pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, which is calculated from the K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; (pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = -log K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;).  A smaller K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; means a higher value of pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, thus a higher value of pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is equivalent to a weaker acid due to less dissociation of the acid into H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and its conjugate base. Similar to pH, a single integer difference in pKa represents a tenfold difference.

The pH of a solution is determined by relative concentrations of acids and bases. 

Using the reaction of the dissociation of a weak acid, HA:

'''HA''' &lt;math&gt;\rightleftharpoons&lt;/math&gt; '''H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;''' + '''A&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;
'''

The '''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''' can be written as:
 
'''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;''' = [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;][A&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;] / [HA]

and rearranged as:
 
[H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = K*[HA] / [A&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;]

Taking the negative log of each term:

-log[H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = -log(K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;) + log([A&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;]/[HA])

Letting pH = -log[H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] results in:

pH = -logK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; + log([A&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;]/[HA])

Letting pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = -logK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; gives:

'''pH = pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; + log([A&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;]/[HA])'''

This relationship of pH to pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is known as the '''Henderson-Hasselbach equation'''. 

When the concentration of an acid, HA, and its conjugate base, A&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;, are equal:

log([A&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;]/[HA]) = log 1 = 0

Yielding:

'''pH=pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'''

meaning that the pH of the solution is equivalent numerically to the pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; of the acid. This point is also known as the half equivalence point.

This equation is useful for calculating the pH of a buffer solution, or a solution containing a known quantity of weak acid (or base) and its conjugate base (or conjugate acid). From a biochemistry perspective, Hederson-Hasselbach can be applied to amino acids. However, this equation does not account for the ionization of water in a solution and thus is not useful for calculating the pH of solutions strong acids or bases.

See Buffer for more information on weak acid or weak base calculations.

==pH Calculation for Polyprotic Acid==

Polyprotic acid such as sulfuric acid, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; or phosphoric acid, H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, is capable of being deprotonated more than once because of the presence of two or more H atoms within the molecule. However, the pKa of each form of a polyprotic acid determines the contributions of hydrogen atoms, and consequently a change in pH, to a solution.
 
For example, consider the dissociation phosphoric acid:                     

     '''H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;   &lt;math&gt;\rightleftharpoons&lt;/math&gt;    H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;           ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = 7.1 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;'''''    (1)
        '''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'''  =  &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{[H_2PO_4^-][H^+]}{[H_3PO_4]}&lt;/math&gt; 
     '''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\rightleftharpoons&lt;/math&gt;    HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;           ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = 6.3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−8&lt;/sup&gt;'''''    (2)
        '''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'''  =  &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{[HPO_4^{2-}][H^+]}{[H_2PO_4^-]}&lt;/math&gt;
     '''HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;  &lt;math&gt;\rightleftharpoons&lt;/math&gt;    PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;3-&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;            ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = 4.5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−13&lt;/sup&gt;'''''   (3)
        '''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'''  =  &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{[PO_4^{3-}][H^+]}{[HPO_4^{2-}]}&lt;/math&gt;

Supposing we have 0.01 M H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; we could calculate the pH of the solution based on the Ka values. Comparing the three pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values of H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, it is clear that the first deprotonation (1) contributes the most H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; because it is the highest value. At equilibrium, ''x'' can represent the M [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] and this value is the same for [H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;] as well. While [H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;] can be expressed as ''0.01-x'' M. Therefore,
:::'''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'''  =  &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{(x)(x)}{0.01-x}&lt;/math&gt; = 7.1 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt;

After which the quadratic equation can be used: x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 0.0071x - 0.000071 = 0
:To solve this equation, we use &lt;math&gt;x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}&lt;/math&gt;, and then obtain
::: x = 5.59 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; = [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = [H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;]
::: pH = -log[H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = -log 5.59 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; = 2.25

A less time-consuming (but also less accurate) approach can be used to avoid using the quadratic equation. If an acid dissociates less than 5% or if the acid concentration to K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; ratio is greater than 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, the following equation can be used:
       [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{K_a\times C_a}&lt;/math&gt; ; where C&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is the concentration of acid.      (4)
However, in this case we see that 0.01M H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; dissociates more than 5% in the first deprotonation.
::: &lt;math&gt;\frac{0.00559 * 100}{0.01}= 56%&lt;/math&gt;
Therefore, using quadratic equation to solve this problem is the right choice.

Since phosphoric acid has three acidic protons, the second and third deprotonations may also contribute to pH of the solution.

When phosphoric acid was first deprotonated, the [HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;] concentration was approximately 0.00559 (calculated above). The [HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;] to K&lt;sub&gt;a2&lt;/sub&gt; ratio is greater than 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. In this case equation (4) can be used to approximate [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] from the second deprotonation. From calculation, 
[H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{6.3\times10^{-8}\times 5.59\times 10^{-3}} = 1.87\times 10^{-5}&lt;/math&gt;

As shown from calculation, [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] contribution from the second deprotonation is much less than that from the first, and makes an insignificant change in pH. Similarly, calculations from the third deprotonation reveal that even less [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] (approximately 2.9 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; M) is contributed. As shown by the differing pKa values, the majority of [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] comes from the first deprotonation.

Now consider the multiple deprotonations of sulfuric acid:
     '''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;   &lt;math&gt;\rightleftharpoons&lt;/math&gt;    HSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;           ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = large'''''         (5)
        '''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'''  =  &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{[HSO_4^-][H^+]}{[H_2SO_4]}&lt;/math&gt; 
     '''HSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;   &lt;math&gt;\rightleftharpoons&lt;/math&gt;    SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;           ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;'''''    (6)
        '''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;'''  =  &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{[SO_4^{2-}][H^+]}{[HSO_4^-]}&lt;/math&gt;
Equation (5) shows a large value for the first pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, implying that sulfuric acid dissociates completely in the first deprotonation. (See acidic substances) Thus, if we have 0.01 M H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] from the first dissociation would also be 0.01 M. In addition, there would be 0.01 M HSO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; in the solution, and is a source of protons by the second deprotonation (equation 6). Before using equation (4), check to see if the concentration of acid to K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; ratio is greater than 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; or not. Since this simplification cannot be used, the quadratic equation is used to determine [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] from the second dissociation. The equation is as follows:

:::x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 0.012x - 0.00012 = 0
:Again, &lt;math&gt;x=\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}&lt;/math&gt; is used to obtain
:: x = 6.5 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-3&lt;/sup&gt; = [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]
The second deprotonation gives a [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] more than half of which was obtained from the first deprotonation. In contrast to the example with phosphoric acid, the second dissociation of sulfuric acid is contributes greatly to the concentration of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;.
In total, [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.01 + 0.065 = 0.0165 M 

The pH = -log 0.0165 = 1.78

Sulfuric acid is a much stronger acid than phosphoric acid as seen by its H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; contribution in each deprotonation step.

==An Alternative Method to the Quadratic Equation==

The quadratic equation can become messy and time consuming in certain situations. Lets consider the following hypothetical situation:

'''HA   &lt;math&gt;\rightleftharpoons&lt;/math&gt;    A&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

''K&lt;sub&gt;HA&lt;/sub&gt; = 6.3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;'''''

[HA] = 2

[A&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;] = 0

[H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] = 1x10&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;

Our equilibrium equation would therefore be:

&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{[A^-][H^+]}{[HA]}&lt;/math&gt; = 6.3x10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;

Now we take into account the overall shift in equilibrium from the dissociation of HA and include the given concentrations.

&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{[x][0.1 + x]}{[2 - x]}&lt;/math&gt; = 6.3x10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;

Because there is already a large concentration of protons in the solution the overall dissociation of HA, given by the variable x, will be very small. Therefore we are going to ignore the change in x in the denominator to yield an equation that is not quadratic.

&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{[x][0.1]}{[2 + x]}&lt;/math&gt; = 6.3x10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;

Solving for x yields approximately 0.11853 which will call x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; which we will use to successively obtain a more accurate number by plugging this number back into our original equation where we ignored x previously:

&lt;math&gt;\tfrac{[x][0.1 + x_n]}{[2 - x]}&lt;/math&gt; = 6.3x10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;

Solving using x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; yield x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to be 0.05604

In order to simplify the process the following equation is used to solve for x&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt; derived from our original rate expression.

x&lt;sub&gt;n+1&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{0.0126}{x_n + 0.1 + 6.3E-3}&lt;/math&gt;

The following successive approximations are calculated to be:

x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.07761

x&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.06851

x&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.07207

x&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.07063

x&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.07098

x&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.07107

x&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.07103

x&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.07105

When x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; starts repeating itself to a given amount of significant figures, it is safe to assume that the given answer is an accurate approximation and can be used for the final value of x. The overall number of successive approximations that must be calculated varies according to the situation. In some situations it is simpler to use the quadratic equation. An equation that required many successive approximations was used for the purposes of this example. Ingenuity is require to obtain an accurate in a time efficient manner.

==Contribution of Water in Dilute Acidic or Basic Solution==
One more thing we need to consider in case of dilute acid or base is the contribution of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; or OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; from water. As we have already known, at 25 &lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;C water molecule could dissociate and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; as well as OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; would form with the amount of 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; M each. For example, if we have 0.0000001 M acetic acid, we can determine the pH of the solution as follows:

Acetic acid is a monoprotic acid which has pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; 1.8 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;. To determine the H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; of the solution, let's consider
     '''CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COOH   &lt;math&gt;\rightleftharpoons&lt;/math&gt;    CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;COO&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;           ''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = 1.8 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−5&lt;/sup&gt;'''''    
        '''K&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;'''  =  &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{[CH_3COO^-][H^+]}{[CH_3COOH]}&lt;/math&gt;
Regarding the previous section, we need quadratic equation to solve this problem, Thus
:::x&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 0.000018x - 0.0000000000018 = 0
Then, we get x = 1 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; = [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]
the concentration of [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] from 0.0000001 M acetic acid is nearly close to the ones obtained from water. In this case, we have to take into account the [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;] from water. Therefore,
:::: [H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;]&lt;sub&gt;tot&lt;/sub&gt; = 2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;-7&lt;/sup&gt; M
Finally, the pH = -log 2 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−7&lt;/sup&gt; = 6.7

''Remark'' For dilute basic solution, we can evaluate in the similar way.

== pH Scale Diagram ==
[[Image:PH scale 2.png|500px|border|A pH scale]]	

The scale is broken up into two regions: acidic (pH 0-7) and basic (pH 7-14) with a pH of 7 being said to be &quot;neutral.&quot; Some acidic substances are gastric acid (pH ~ 2), vinegar (pH ~ 3) and coffee (pH ~ 5). Some basic substances are hand soap (pH ~ 10), ammonia (pH ~ 13), and lye (pH ~ 14). An example of a &quot;neutral&quot; substance would be pure water (pH ~ 7).  pH values below 0 require measurements using specialized equipment.  The reason is that typical pH measurements are done in an aqueous solution, which means that the measured pH will only be as strong as the weakest acid in solution (in this case H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; which has a pKa of 0).  Therefore, measurements are typically made by calibrating with a strong acid like sulfuric acid.  Similar arguments also apply for extremely strong bases.

==Acidic Substances==

There are three definitions of acids based on Arrhenius, Bronsted-Lowry, and Lewis. By Arrhenius theory, acids are molecules that produce hydronium ions (H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;small&gt;+&lt;/small&gt;) in aqueous solution. The Bronsted-Lowry definition of an acid is a molecule that can donate protons (H&lt;small&gt;+&lt;/small&gt;). A Lewis acid is defined as a molecule that is able to accept electron pairs.

The most common strong acids include hydrochloric acid (HCl), hydrobromic acid (HBr), hydroiodic acid (HI), sulfuric acid (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), perchloric acid (HClO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), and nitric acid (HNO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Where perchloric acid is the strongest with a pKa = -10
In calculations, strong acids are assumed to dissociate completely.
For example: By convention 2.5 M HCl produces 2.5&amp;nbsp;mol of hydronium  ions per liter.

==Basic Substances==
[[Image:Weak.png|right|100px|thumb|Titration of a weak acid and strong acid with a strong base]]

Just as there are three definitions of acids, there are three corresponding definitions of bases. An Arrhenius base is defined as a molecule that produces hydroxide ions (&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;OH) in water. A Bronsted-Lowry base is a molecule able to accept hydrogen ions. Finally, a Lewis base is able to donate electron pairs.

Bases are usually characterized by having a negative charge (surplus of electron pairs), which according the to Lewis theory makes it capable of donating to another molecule. Bases can also have a neutral charge, but contain a lone pair of electrons (such as ammonia) which can be donated to other molecules.

Common strong bases include: Lithium hydroxide (LiOH), Sodium hydroxide (NaOH), Rubidium hydroxide (RbOH), Cesium hydroxide (CsOH), Potassium hydroxide (KOH), Magnesium hydroxide (Mg(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) Calcium hydroxide (Ca(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) Strontium hydroxide (Sr(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) Barium hydroxide (Ba(OH)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).
A strong base, like a strong acid, is defined as a compound that dissociates completely in aqueous solution.

==Application in Biochemistry==

pH range for amino acids have Zwitterionic structure is 2-9. Below pH 2 the carboxyl group is not dissociated.
Above pH 9,  but amino group is not dissociated. 

===Zwitterion===
[[Image:Zwitterion isoleucine.png|left|95px|thumb|This is a isoleucine's zwitterion ion form]]
Since amino acids have both an acidic carboxylic acid group and a basic amine group, they can be either positively charged, negatively charged, or both at the same time depending on the pH. A zwitterion is a molecule that has both a positively charged group and a negatively charged group at the same time, thus carrying a total net charge of 0. The zwitterion is the most commonly found form of amino acids when the pH is in the neutral range, since in the neutral pH, the basic amine group is protonated (carries a positive charge) and the carboxyl group is deprotonated (carries a negative charge).

===Isoelectric Focusing===

Since animo acids, and therefore proteins, have multiple sites that can be either positive or negative, the total overall charge of a protein depends on the pH. Isoelectic Focusing is a technique where proteins are separated based on the pH at which they become neutrally charged overall. This point is called the pI, or isoelectric point. Isoelectric Focusing is done by loading the sample proteins onto a gel with a pH gradient and then applying an electic current. The proteins will then move across the gel because of the electric current and will stop moving once they reach their pI. Isoelectric focusing can be combined with SDS-PAGE to increase the separation of proteins in a sample, a technique called Two-Dimensional Electrophoresis.

===The Bohr Effect===

Christian Bohr, a Danish physiologist, defined the Bohr effect as the change in binding affinity of oxygen to hemoglobin based on hydrogen ion and carbon dioxide concentrations.  Oxygen has higher affinity when the pH of the blood is high.  CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; exist in the following equilibrium in the blood:

CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &lt;math&gt;\rightleftharpoons&lt;/math&gt; H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

Thus, a change in either concentration will alter the pH.  An increase in carbon dioxide will increase the concentration of hydrogen ions, and therefore lower both the pH and oxygen's affinity for hemoglobin.  This benefits the body because areas that are high in carbon dioxide are likely deficient in oxygen.  The low pH in those areas causes oxygen to diassociate from hemoglobin, releasing it into the body tissues that need it most.

[[Image:Effect of Ph on Hemoglobin's Oxygen Affinity.jpg]]

As the pH increases, so does the ability for hemoglobin to bind oxygen. However, as the pH moves to a lower pH (as slight as a drop from 7.4 to 7.2), the ability to bind to oxygen decreases.

'''Carbon Dioxide'''

Carbon dioxide also affects the pH inside a red blood cell (which affects the ability of oxygen to bind to hemoglobin). As carbon dioxide flows into a red blood cell, carbonic anhydrase (an enzyme specific for this reaction) facilitates its interaction with water in forming carbonic acid, which then dissociates into bicarbonate and hydrogen ions. 

CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &lt;math&gt;\rightleftharpoons&lt;/math&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;math&gt;\rightleftharpoons&lt;/math&gt; H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

The increase in H+ decreases the pH, and stabilizes the T-state of hemoglobin, also known as the deoxygenated state.

The transport of carbon dioxide into a red blood cell is carried through via membrane transport. It also directly interacts with hemoglobin, affected the binding and release of oxygen. The carbon dioxide decreases the oxygen binding affinity and stabilizes the T-state of hemoglobin even better than the effects of pH on oxygen binding. 

'''Carbamate Group'''

Carbamate groups are negatively charged groups formed from the interaction of carbon dioxide and the last amine group in an amino acid. The carbamate groups stabilize the decrease in the binding of oxygen by increasing the salt bridge.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Nature of Dipole Bonding==
[[Image:H2O molecule scheme of dipole.png|right|thumb]]
The nature of dipole bonding begins when atoms differ in their [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronegativity electronegativity], which quantifies an individual atom's ability to attract [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron electrons] to itself. A classic example of an electronegative atom is [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluorine fluorine].

When a [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Covalent bonds|covalent bond]] forms between two atoms, the electrons will be distributed between the two atoms unequally; the more electronegative atoms will have the larger electron density. This unequal sharing of electrons creates a charge separation, and the molecule under inspection will develop [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_charge partial charges] where the electronegative atom will develop a partial negative charge and its adjacent atom will develop a partial positive charge. The molecule is then said to be [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polarization_density polarized] due to this charge separation. When molecules exhibit this charge separation, there is a pseudo-electrostatic force between the partial charges of molecules.

The key to dipole bonding is charge separation within a molecule.

==Permanent dipole-dipole interactions==
[[Image:Dipole-dipole-interaction-in-HCl-2D.png|right|thumb]]
; Dipole moment : When the covalent bonds in a molecule are polarized so that one portion of the molecule experiences a positive charge and the other portion of the molecule experiences a negative charge. This separation of opposite charges creates an electric dipole. Depending on the orientation of two dipoles, molecules can be attracted to each other as the partial negative charge is attracted to the partial positive charge.

*Ex. Carbon Monoxide (CO)

The permanent and induced dipole interaction of nonpolar molecules bonded to nonpolar molecules in polar molecules, which forms more stable structure.

Besides, when the polar molecules lie near one another, as in liquids and solids, their partial charges act as tiny electric fields that orient them and give rise to dipole-dipole forces. So, the dipole-dipole forces is the positive pole of one molecule that attracts the negative pole of another. The greater the dipole moment, the greater the dipole-dipole forces between the molecules are.

==Induced dipole interactions==

Induced dipoles occur due to the fact that electrons are in constant motion within a molecule. For nonpolar molecules, the averaged charge distribution within a molecule would suggest that there is no permanent dipole. However, instantaneous charge distributions indicate the presence of a transient dipole. Imagine that if you take a photograph of a molecule, you can see an electron and a nucleus in a fixed arrangement. This fixed arrangement implies that there is a dipole moment, if only for a brief moment. We call this type of instantaneous dipole an induced dipole. Brief partial negative charges will be attracted to brief partial positive charges.

Induced dipoles are typical of nonpolar molecules such as fatty acid chains, aliphatic chains, and aromatic hydrocarbons.

===Hydrophobic interactions===
; Hydrophobic effect : When nonpolar molecules clump together when surrounded by polar molecules.

*The nonpolar molecules are not held together by bonds which is why it is called an induced dipole-dipole interaction. This phenomenon is due to the reduction of the number of water molecules surrounded the hydrophobic portion of molecules.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Osmosis==
The tendency for aqueous solutions [solvents] to migrate across a semi-permeable membrane from a higher water potential to a lower water potential is known as '''diffusion'''. Semi-permeable membranes are selective, allowing only specific particles to flow through and preventing others from invading. Water always flows from lower solute concentration [dilute solution] to higher solute concentration until a balance is produced. Dilute solutions are highly concentrated in water and low in solute. Hence, a low concentration of solute results in a high water potential. The general motion is from more water to less water or from less solute to more solute.

=== Osmotic pressure ===
[[File:Osmotic pressure.PNG|thumb|Physical meaning of osmotic pressure, Π]]
During osmosis, pressure is generated due to the difference in solute potentials of two environments separated by a semi-permeable membrane. This pressure provides the force for the water to move from low solute concentration to high solute concentration. Once the water pressure reaches the osmotic pressure, osmosis stops. The osmotic pressure is measured by the van't Hoff equation: ''Π = icRT'', where &quot;''ic''&quot; represents osmolarity. Osmolarity is a product of the molar concentration of solute and the van't Hoff factor, ''i'', a measurement of the extent of dissociation of the solute. The van't Hoff factor is equal to how many particles the solute dissociates in to. For example, NaCl dissociates into Na+ and Cl-, so the van't Hoff factor is 2. Glucose does not dissociate, so it's van't Hoff factor is 1. If there are multiple solutes, the total osmolarity is equal to the sum of the osmolarities of the individual solutes. &lt;ref name=&quot;Principles of Biochemistry, Lehninger and Nelson, chapter 2&quot; /&gt;

=== Reverse Osmosis ===
Reverse osmosis is the process by which excess pressure is placed on one end of a semipermeable barrier in order to drive a solution from an area of high solute concentration to that of a low solute concentration. Opposite from general osmosis, the solvent does not go down a concentration gradient. In this case, the cell membrane serves as a filter. However, the key difference between osmosis and filtration is that in reverse osmosis, separation is done by diffusive mechanisms rather than size exclusion or staining. Reverse osmosis has been used industrially for water treatment. Salt water collected from the ocean is transformed to pure water by setting an external pressure equal to the air pressure at sea level. Water purification is only one industrial use of reverse osmosis. Metals and chemicals are also recycled through this process.

Example of the environmental use of reverse osmosis:

== Types of Tonicity ==
[[Image:tinoisotonic.jpg|thumb|'''Zero net movement of water in isotonic environment''']]

=== Isotonic ===
*The scenario when the solute concentration inside and outside of a cell (or semi-permeable membrane) is in equilibrium. There is no net movement of water if the cell is in the isotonic environment. Since there is equilibrium between the water inside and outside the cell, no net movement of water occurs.

=== Hypertonic ===
*When the solute concentration outside of a cell is higher than the solute concentration inside of a cell. Hence the cell shrinks since the water from inside of the cell rushes outside of the cell in order to equilibrate the solute concentrations inside and outside of the cell. Fish such as salmon have to excrete salt from their gills to prevent themselves from being in a hypertonic solution.

[[Image:hypertonic.jpg|thumb|'''Water moves from inside the cell to outside of the cell''']]

=== Hypotonic ===
*When the solute concentration outside of a cell is lower than the solute concentration inside of a cell. Hence the cell swells because the water from outside of the cell flows inside of the cell in order to make the solute concentrations equal. This may cause the cell to burst. To prevent bursting, cells have developed mechanisms to cope with its environment. Freshwater protists that inhabit hypotonic environments have organelles such as contractive vacuoles to pump water out from the cell. For bacteria and plants, a plasma membrane is surrounded by a rigid and non-expandable cell wall that has the strength to resist osmotic pressure and prevent osmotic lysis. Lastly, for multi-cellular animals to prevent bursting, blood plasma and interstitial fluid are used to maintain the osmolarity level close to that of cytosol.

[[Image:hypotonic.jpg|thumb|'''Water moves from outside the cell to inside of the cell''']]


== The Role of Osmosis in Living Organisms ==
Living cells may be thought of as microscopically small bags of solutions contained within semi permeable membrane that allows water to flow in or out. In order for the cell to survive, the concentration of solutes within the cell cannot be changed dramatically. Water passes through the membrane in both directions to generate equilibrium between the cell and its surroundings. If the cells are in a highly concentrated solution, the water in the cell would flow out to maintain the equilibrium between the exterior and interior of the cell. This may cause the cell to shrink due to loss of water and die of dehydration. Oppositely, if the cells are in a more diluted solution, water will enter the cell and cause it to burst and be destroyed.
In the molecular level, storage cells maintain osmotic pressures by storing energy in forms of macromolecules, such as polysaccharides, rather than micro molecules, such as glucose. By storing macromolecules, the osmotic pressures are diminished, thus preventing storage cells from bursting. The reason behind this is that osmolarity depends on the amount of solutes in the cell rather than the solute's size and mass. Therefore, the storage of macromolecules prevents a dramatic increase in osmotic pressure.

To survive through harsh conditions in nature, organisms have developed various methods to maintain their solute concentration within safe levels. For example, organisms that live in saltwater have much higher cell solute concentrations than organisms living in fresh water; other animals replace lost water and solutes by drinking and eating, or by removing the excessive water/solutes to decrease the solute concentration through excretion of urine.

Osmosis also plays an important role in plants. It contributes to the movement of water through parts of the plant. As the minerals and other solutions from soil are taken up by root cells to leaf cells, the solute concentrations in the plant cell will increase. It brings the differences of osmotic pressure between the cell and the exterior environment. As a result, water will be drawn upward and spread through the plants cell. When too much water is taken up into the cells, water is evaporated from leaves by regulating the size of the openings in the leaf surfaces to remove the excess water. In addition, osmolarity plays a role in plant rigidity. In a plant cell, the vacuole holds much of the plant volume and solute concentration. Because of this high solute concentration, the osmotic pressure causes water to enter the vacuole. However, because of the immutable cell wall, the cells do not burst from such a hypotonic solution. Instead, the cell stiffens, thus increasing the rigidity of the plant and its tissues.

== The Role of Osmosis in Studying Organelles == 
Within the cell, there are organelles that have semipermeable membranes that allow the intake and output of water. Naturally, these organelles, such as mitochondria, chloroplasts, and lysosomes, exist in the cytoplasm where the solute concentration is higher. Keeping that in mind, in order to study organelles and isolate them from the cell, precautions must be taken in order to create an isotonic solution and prevent the organelles from absorbing too much water and bursting. Processes such as [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Purification/Differential Centrifugation| Differential Centrifugation]] depend on this precaution in order to obtain successful separation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Isoelectric Focusing==
Isoelectric focusing or also called the pI of the protein is the pH at which its net charge is zero. A separation technique which separates peptides according to how acidic and basic their residues are. A gel with a [[Structural Biochemistry/pH|pH]] gradient is used as the medium. The pH gradient is made by adding polyampholytes, which are multi-charged polymers, with different pI into the gel.  Then the sample is put onto the gel and a voltage is applied. The proteins will move along the gel until they reach their isoelectric points. In other words, each protein will move until it reaches a position in the gel at which the pH is equal to the pI of the protein. a protein band that forms at a given pH can then be removed and analyzed further. This process can successfully separate proteins that have a difference in net charge greater than or equal to 1. 

Isoelectric point (pI): The pH at which the net charge on the [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|protein]] is zero. For a protein with many basic [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acid]] pI will be high, while for an acidic protein the pI will be lower.
 
Isoelectric focusing is a type of zone electrophoresis, and it is usually performed in a gel, that takes advantage of the fact that a molecule's charge changes with the pH of its surroundings. A protein that is in a pH region below its isoelectric point (pI) will be positively charged and so will migrate towards the cathode. As it migrates, however, the charge will decrease until the protein reaches the pH region that corresponds to its pI. At this point it has no net charge and so migration ceases. As a result, the proteins become focused into the sharp stationary bands with each protein positioned at a point in the pH gradient corresponding to its pI. This technique is capable of extremely high resolution with proteins differing by a single charge being fractionated into separate bands.


Molecules to be focused are distributed over a medium that has a pH gradient (usually created by aliphatic ampholytes). An electric current is passed through the medium, creating a &quot;positive&quot; anode and &quot;negative&quot; cathode end. The negatively charged molecules migrate through the pH gradient in the medium toward the &quot;positive&quot; end while positively charged molecules move toward the &quot;negative&quot; end. As a particle moves towards the pole opposite of its charge it moves through the changing pH gradient until it reaches a point in which the pH of that molecules isoelectric point is reached. At this point the molecule no longer has a net electric charge (due to the protonation or deprotonation of the associated functional groups) and as such will not proceed any further within the gel. The gradient is initially established before adding the particles of interest by first subjecting a solution of small molecules such as polyampholytes with varying pI values to electrophoresis.

[[Image:Isoelectric_focusing_contribute2.jpg |600px|Isoelectric Focusing]]

The method is applied in the study of proteins, which separate based on their relative content of acidic and basic residues, whose value is represented by the pI. Proteins are introduced into an immobilized pH gradient gel composed of polyacrylamide, starch, or agarose where a pH gradient has been established. Isoelectric focusing can resolve proteins that differ in pI value by as little as 0.01. Isoelectric focusing is the first step in two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, in which proteins are first separated by their pI and then further separated by molecular weight through [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Purification/SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis|SDS PAGE]].

==How to determine pI of amino acid==
We can determine pI of each amino acid when we know its pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;s by titration with NaOH. For example, glycine, the smallest amino acid, has two pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values, which are 2.34 and 9.60, respectively.[http://philomath.exteen.com/images/11-20/18.jpg]

First, add strong acid and let glycine to become complete protonated form. Then gradually add NaOH until pH raises up to 2.34. At this point, we use 0.5 mol of NaOH equivalent to first protonated form of glycine. Also, There would be 0.5 mol of second protonated form generated in the solution. After using 1 mol NaOH equivalent to first pronated form, there would be solely second pronated form. We'll see that second protonated form of glycine is zwitterion, which is zero net charge molecule. Therefore pH at this point is called isoeletric point (pI) and equals 5.97. Continue adding NaOH once pH equals 9.60. At this point, 0.5 mol of third protonated form is present in the solution and total amount of NaOH is 1.5 mol. Back to pI, we see that 
::: &lt;math&gt;pI = \frac{2.34 + 9.60}{2}= 5.97&lt;/math&gt;

Then we can write in the general form: 
                    &lt;math&gt;pI = \frac{pK_{a1} + pK_{a2}}{2}&lt;/math&gt;

''Remark'' To determine pI of amino acid which has more than two pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;, we'll use two pK&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; values covering the range in which zwitterion would present in the solution.[http://faculty.une.edu/com/courses/bionut/distbio/obj-512/Chap6-titration-lysine.gif]</text>

      <comment>/* Ionic bond energy */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:IonicBondingRH11.png|thumb|NaCl forming an Ionic Bond.png]]
An Ionic Bond is a specific type of chemical bond formed between a &quot;metal&quot; and a &quot;nonmetal.&quot; &quot;Metals&quot; involved in ionic bonds are usually the Alkali and Alkaline-Earth metals - also known as the first two columns on the period table - as well as several transition state metals. The non-metals usually involved in the ionic bonds are the halogens. 

The goal of forming chemical bonds is to have an octet. &quot;Octet&quot; means that an element has eight electrons. Another way of putting this phenomenon is to state that each element wants to have the electron configuration of a noble gas. For the non-metals, the goal is to achieve the electron configuration of the noble gas in the same row. For the metals, the goal is to have the electron configuration of the noble gas in the row directly preceding it. For example, chlorine wants the electron configuration of Argon while sodium wants that of Neon. Ionic bonds help achieve the octet because the metal effectively transfers its valence electrons to the nonmetal. In this way, both metal and nonmetal achieve noble-gas electron configurations. 

However, pure ionic bonds do not exist. There is a level of covalent-bond character in each ionic bond. However, as a general rule of thumb, the larger the electronegativity difference between the metal and nonmetal, the more ionic the bond, and therefore, less covalent the bond. Electronegativity is the ability to draw electron density while in the presence of another atom. The more electronegative the atom, the greater its ability to pull electron density towards itself. 

'''Electrostatic interactions''', also known as '''Charge-charge interactions''' and '''Ionic interactions.&quot;&quot;&quot; An '''electrostatic attraction''' exist when there are closely packed ions of opposite charges. An '''electrostatic repulsion''' present between different ions that have the same charge.

[[Image:Magnesium Chloride.jpg‎]]

==Coulomb's Law==

The '''force''' between two-points charges can be calculated by '''Coulomb’s law''',

&lt;big&gt;F&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1on2&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;big&gt;F&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2on1&lt;/sub&gt; = &lt;big&gt;'''k'''q&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;big&gt;q&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;big&gt;/r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

In other words, the bond energy is directly proportional to the charges of the two atoms and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the two atoms. F has the unit '''N''' (Newtons), r is the distance between the center of the two-point charges in meter, q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the charge (in C, Coulombs) of each atom respectively. '''k''' is the constant, approximately equal &lt;math&gt;9.00 x 10^9&lt;/math&gt; N•m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;•C&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. If force is negative ('''F &lt; 0'''), it represents the existence of attraction since the only possible way to have F smaller than zero is the sign of q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are different, or opposite. Meaning the sign of charges for this two atoms are opposite. In other words, if the force is positive ('''F &gt; 0'''), it means the two charged atoms repel each other, for the same sign of charges (both positive or negative charges.)

==Ionic bond energy==

The '''ionic bond energy''' between two-points charges can be calculated using the formula of electrical potential energy,

&lt;big&gt;U&lt;sub&gt;ele&lt;/sub&gt;= Kq&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;big&gt;q&lt;/big&gt;&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;big&gt;/r&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

In other words, the bond energy is directly proportional to the charges of the two atoms and inversely proportional to the distance (bond length in microscopic level) between the two charged atoms. U&lt;sub&gt;ele&lt;/sub&gt; has the unit '''J''' (Joules), r is the distance between the ion centers in nanometers, and q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the numerical ion charges. K is the constant, approximately equal &lt;math&gt;2.31 x 10&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−19&lt;/sup&gt; J•nm. It is also equal to '''k'''Q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; x 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; (Conversion to nanomemter, nm) or Q&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/4'''&lt;math&gt;\pi\epsilon_0&lt;/math&gt;''' x 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; where '''k''' is approximately equal to &lt;math&gt;9.00 x 10^9&lt;/math&gt; Nm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;C&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; and Q is equal to the charge of a proton, &lt;math&gt;1.60 x 10&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−19&lt;/sup&gt;C; '''&lt;math&gt;\epsilon_0&lt;/math&gt;''' approximately equal to &lt;math&gt;8.85 x 10&lt;/math&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; C&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;N&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;•m&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; or F•m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, representing the permittivity of free space.

==Lattice Energy==
&lt;ref&gt;Silberberg, Martin S.(2010). Principles of General Chemistry (2nd Edition).McGraw Hill Publishing Company. ISBN 978-0-07-351108-05&lt;/ref&gt;
Lattice energy (ΔH&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;lattice&lt;/sub&gt;) is the released energy from the interaction between ions. The positive sign of this energy indicates that the energy is needed for ions to form a solid. On the other hand, the negative sign of the energy indicates that the energy is needed for ionic solids to be separated into its gaseous ions. In addition, ionic interactions can be explained based on the lattice energy because the qualitative number of the energy indicates the ions' hardness, solubility, and melting point. Lattice energy can be predicted based on the effect of ionic size and ionic change. As one goes down the periodic table, the ionic radius increases. And as the radius increases, there would be a decrease in the electrostatic energy between the positively charged atom and negatively charged atom. As a result, there would be a decrease in the lattice energy. In addition, ionic charge can also determine the lattice energy. A greater amount of energy will be needed to bring a larger charged ions together than to form the smaller charged ions.</text>

* [[Cookbook:Coconut|Coconut]]  - 1 (medium sized)
* [[Cookbook:Salt|Salt]]  - as per taste
* Water  - enough to moisten the flour

== Procedure == 

#Grate the coconut finely. Take the puttu powder in a wide bowl. Add salt and half of the grated coconut. Rub the mixture with finger tips, sprinkling water. The flour should become moist and should have a coarse texture. Leave the mixture for an hour, if the flour is ready made, as it absorbs more water.
#After an hour, check the consistency of the flour. One should be able to make a ball out of the flour, which can be easily crumbled. Adjust the water content accordingly. Spread a little coconut at the bottom of the puttu vessel (puttu kutti) and fill it with the moist flour. Layer it with coconut. Steam it on the puttu vessel or on the pressure cooker nozzle. In a few minutes, steam will start escaping through the top of the puttu vessel. Puttu will be done in 4 minutes.
#Serve hot with kadala curry or boiled green gram and pappad (payarum pappadavum) or with steamed bananas.

Note: [[Cookbook:Rice|Rice]], [[Cookbook:wheat|wheat]], [[Cookbook:corn|corn]], ragi or [[Cookbook:tapioca|tapioca]] flour can be used for making puttu.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== HTTP Request ==

The HttpServletRequest is probably the most important interface in the whole JEE framework. It is the way the user communicates with the server. Each time the user needs something from the server, he sends a request that is converted into an HttpServletRequest object inside the Web Container.

== Details ==

The first thing to notice is that HttpServletRequest extends another interface, the ServletRequest interface. This happens because the web container wasn't designed to handle only HTTP requests and responses, but all kinds of requests, using many kinds of protocols. Though, as said before, HTTP is the most common protocol used, and probably in 100% of the time you'll see only HTTPRequests in and HTTPResponses out. That is why the JEE API has a specific package named &lt;code&gt;javax.servlet.http&lt;/code&gt; that contains all the specific classes and interfaces for the HTTP protocol.

There are many methods inside HttpServletRequest that are very handy to manipulate the user's request. You can get all kinds of information from the object the web container created for you. Some examples include:

* HTTP headers
* Cookies
* Query String
* User's IP and port
* Form parameters
* etc.

== Parameters ==

The most common use for the HttpServletRequest object is to get the parameters sent by the user in HTML forms. Parameters are strings that the server receives from the client for specific tasks, for example: to process a query or to save or update a database record. 

Parameters are sent in two ways: in HTML forms and in the query string. In both ways parameters are values identified by keys. The same key can have more then one value, meaning that the same parameter can be sent twice with two different values. Some valid examples of parameters are:

* name=John
* fname=John&amp;lname=Doe&amp;email=jdoe@gmail.com
* query=java&amp;lang=en
* name=John&amp;name=Mary&amp;name=Josh

When sent in HTML form using the POST method, data is sent in the body of the request and can be of any size. When using GET data is restricted by the maximum size of a URL that can depend on the browser or the server, so it is not recommended to send large amounts of data using get.

Below you can see a little more detailed explanation about HTML Forms and query strings.

=== HTML Form ===

An HTML form is one of the ways the user can send data to the server. As was explained before HTML form can send data in two different ways: POST and GET. It is recommended to use POST if data is being sent to update something in the server, sometimes because it can be a lot of data and others because there can be confidential data that is not going to be encrypted in the URL.

To send a parameter to the server using an HTML form, just name and identify the form subelement with the name you want and get it by name in the server. A very simple example of that would be a user sending this form:

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;form method=&quot;POST&quot; action=&quot;someUrl.do&quot;&gt;
    What is your name?&lt;br /&gt;
    &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; id=&quot;name&quot; name=&quot;name&quot; /&gt;&lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

That would render something like this:

[[Image:HTMLForm.PNG|Simple HTML form]]

Then a servlet could receive the HttpServletRequest with the parameter and print back a ''hello'' message:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
package org.wikibooks.scwcd;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.PrintWriter;

import javax.servlet.ServletException;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

public class MyServlet extends HttpServlet {

    public void doPost (HttpServletRequest request, 
            HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException, ServletException {
        
        String name = request.getParameter(&quot;name&quot;);
        if (name != null) {
            PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
            out.println(&quot;Hello &quot; + name + &quot;!&quot;);
            out.flush();
        }
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This would result in a page showing the message &quot;Hello [user name]!&quot;.

To see all parameters being received by the server, the following Servlet can be used:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
package org.wikibooks.scwcd;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.PrintWriter;

import javax.servlet.ServletException;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

public class EchoParameters extends HttpServlet {

    public void doPost (HttpServletRequest request, 
            HttpServletResponse response) throws IOException, ServletException {
                PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
		out.println(&quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;All parameters:&lt;ul&gt;&quot;);
		Enumeration params = request.getParameterNames();
		String name;
		while (params.hasMoreElements()) {
			name = (String)params.nextElement();
			out.println(&quot;&lt;li&gt;Key : &quot; + name + &quot;&lt;br /&gt;Values: &lt;ul&gt;&quot;);
			for (String value : request.getParameterValues(name)) {
				out.println(&quot;&lt;li&gt;&quot; + value + &quot;&lt;/li&gt;&quot;);
			}
			out.println(&quot;&lt;/ul&gt;&quot;);
		}
		
		out.println(&quot;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot;);
		out.flush();
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Query String ===

The query string is a string with a specific format appended at the end of the URL. The string can be appended after a question mark sign (&lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt;) and contains key/values separated by ampersand signs (&lt;code&gt;&amp;&lt;/code&gt;). A simple example would be &lt;code&gt;http://www.google.com/search?q=java&lt;/code&gt; where the query string is &lt;code&gt;q=java&lt;/code&gt;. With that, the server receives a parameter &quot;q&quot; with value &quot;java&quot;, meaning that the URL is a '''q'''uery into the &lt;code&gt;search&lt;/code&gt; resource inside the &lt;code&gt;google.com&lt;/code&gt; domain (server).

To send values in the query string just use the method &lt;code&gt;GET&lt;/code&gt; in an HTML form as explained above.

Browsers will automatically encode the URL to correctly be interpreted by the server, because there are special symbols that cannot be sent directly, like &lt;code&gt;@&lt;/code&gt;. Some of these symbols are used for special purposes and must not be used in keys or values in query strings, so they must be encoded, otherwise the URL will be misinterpreted by the server and the query string can be corrupted. [[http://www.blooberry.com/indexdot/html/topics/urlencoding.htm 2]] [[http://www.w3schools.com/TAGS/ref_urlencode.asp 3]].

Query strings are good to save an application state: somewhere the user was or something he did that can be bookmarked for later access. But one thing to remember is that, because they can be saved, confidential data like credit card numbers must not be in the query string.

== HTTP Headers ==

HTTP headers are protocol specific commands that the client (most of the times a browser) and the server uses to check what each other wants and how they are expecting to receive the answer. A very simple way to get access to a header is using the &lt;code&gt;HttpServletRequest.getHeader(String)&lt;/code&gt; method. It will return a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; that represents the value of the header received by the server for a specific header.

The following example shows how a servlet could send back as HTML all the headers received from the client:

&lt;source lang=&quot;java&quot;&gt;
package org.wikibooks.scwcd;

import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.PrintWriter;
import java.util.Enumeration;

import javax.servlet.ServletException;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServlet;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletRequest;
import javax.servlet.http.HttpServletResponse;

public class HttpHeadersExample extends HttpServlet {

	public void doGet(HttpServletRequest request, HttpServletResponse response)
			throws ServletException, IOException {
		
		Enumeration names = request.getHeaderNames();
		String value = null, name = null;
		
		PrintWriter out = response.getWriter();
		
		out.println(&quot;&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&quot;);
		out.println(&quot;&lt;p&gt;All HTTP Headers:&lt;ul&gt;&quot;);
		
		while (names.hasMoreElements()) {
			name = (String) names.nextElement();
			value = request.getHeader(name);
			out.println(&quot;&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot; + name + &quot;&lt;/strong&gt;: &quot; + value + &quot;&lt;/li&gt;&quot;);
		}
		out.println(&quot;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;&quot;);
		out.flush();
	}
}
&lt;/source&gt;

That would result in the following HTML code, for a specific browser:

&lt;source lang=&quot;html4strict&quot;&gt;
&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All HTTP Headers:&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;host&lt;/strong&gt;: localhost:8080&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;user-agent&lt;/strong&gt;: Mozilla/5.0 (Windows; U; Windows NT 5.1; pt-BR; rv:1.9.0.3) Gecko/2008092417 Firefox/3.0.3&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;accept&lt;/strong&gt;: text/html,application/xhtml+xml,application/xml;q=0.9,*/*;q=0.8&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;accept-language&lt;/strong&gt;: en-us&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;accept-encoding&lt;/strong&gt;: gzip,deflate&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;accept-charset&lt;/strong&gt;: ISO-8859-1,utf-8;q=0.7,*;q=0.7&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;keep-alive&lt;/strong&gt;: 300&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;connection&lt;/strong&gt;: keep-alive&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Protein studies involves various step of sample preparation. The main protocols of protein studies are as followed:
# Protein Synthesis
# Purification
# Evaluation of purified protein
# Determination of Amino Acid Sequence
# Calculation of Protein's Mass
# Determination of Protein's 3-D Structure

There are many methods used to study proteins, including its shape and structure. For instance, X-Ray crystallography is used to give scientists the structure of the protein. Such information is used extensively in determining the characteristics of the protein as well as how it functions and under which circumstances. Other methods used includes amino acid sequencing, fluorescence microscopy, mass spectrometry, NMR, etc. 

=Carbohydrate-Binding Proteins=
Carbohydrate-Binding proteins (CBPs) are identified as important mediators for numerous different types of cellular events through interactions between carbohydrates and proteins. There are three main families of CBPs.
# the C-type lectin family (including the Selectins)
# the Siglec family
# the galectin family

==C-type Lectins (including Selectins)==
C-type Lectins and selectins are present in humans and murines (household rats and mice). Roles of these specific CBPs include
*promoting primary immune response
*mediating leukocyte trafficking to sites of inflammation
*mediating lymphocyte recirculation
*mediating platelet binding to neutrophils

===Clinical Use of Lectins===
Pure forms of lectins are used for blood typing. Specifically, lectins are used to identify some glycolipids and glycoproteins on an individual's red blood cells.
In the brain, PHA-L, a lectin from a kidney bean, helps to trace the path of efferent axons through the anterograde labeling method.
[[Image:Phytohemagglutinin L.png|frame|PHA-L]]

==Siglecs==
Siglecs occur mostly in humans, but some are also found in murines.
Some of the primary roles of these CBPs are:
*regulator in B cell activation
*maintenance of myelin
*inhibitor of axonal growth

==Galectins==
Galectins are also found in humans, mice, and rats as well. These CBPs are abundant in most organs such as muscles, hearts, lung, liver, lymph nodes, thymus, and colon, stomach epithelial cells, gastrointestimal, erythroctyes, skin, brain, Hodgkin's lymphoma, kidney, and lens. Roles include:
*acting as a marker for cell recognition
*binding specificity

      <text xml:space="preserve">After each purification steps, the types of [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|protein]] that exist in the in the solution is expected to decrease while its specific activity is expected to increase. These two qualities are desirable because experiment done using a pure protein sample gives a more quantifiable result. One method used to check the purity of the sample is using a form of Gel Electrophoresis, such as [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Purification/SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis|SDS PAGE]] or native PAGE. 

Purification can also be quantitatively evaluated by measuring total protein, total activity, specific activity, yield and purification level. Total protein is the quantity of protein present in a fraction and can be determined by measuring the protein concentration of a part of each fraction and multiplying by the fraction's total volume. Total activity is measured by the enzymatic activity in the volume of fraction used in the assay multiplied by the fraction's total volume.  Specific activity is the total activity divided by total protein.  The yield is the amount of activity retained after each purification step.  The purification level is the increase of purity which can be measured after each purification step by dividing its specific activity by the specific activity of the initial extract.

{{BookCat}}


a good purification takes into account both purification levels of yield. A high amount of purification and a poor yield give little protein to work with. on the other hands, a low purification and a high yield give contaminated protein in the experiment.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== General information ==
'''Gel electrophoresis''' is a technique used to display and assert that the [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Purification|purification]] scheme was effective by measuring the number of different proteins in a mixture. The basis of gel electrophoresis is the fact that molecule with specific net charge will move through an electric field. The speed of protein migration can be quantified as:
&lt;big&gt;

&lt;math&gt;v = Ez/f&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

With ''E'' as magnitude of the electric field, ''z'' as net charge of a protein, and ''f'' as frictional kinetic coefficient. 


Frictional coefficient, for spherical molecule, is determined as:

''&lt;big&gt;f = 6 &amp;pi; &amp;eta; r&lt;/big&gt;''

with &amp;eta; as viscosity.


As its equation implies, the velocity of molecule traveling in the gel matrix depends on its size, shape, and the charge that it has. The smaller the molecule, the faster it will travel. Furthermore, Gels can be made in a variety of wt percents: 6%, 8%, 10%, 12% and 15%. Higher percentages are used primarily for smaller molecules and smaller percentages are used for larger sized samples. Theoretically, larger molecules can still be used with higher percents, but these gels may take a long time to develop. Charge can also be a factor in the speed and distance that a specific sample travels through the gel. Using a higher voltage will send the samples farther and faster. However, caution must be used with higher voltages as the heat it generates may melt the gels.

Gel Electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE; SDS-polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis) is a powerful tool to check the purity of the sample because because it can detect minuscule amount of protein. Different proteins appear as different bands on SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel after gel has been stained with Coomassie blue (visualize ~2pm of protein) or silver stain (visualize 0.02 &amp;micro;g of protein).

== Native Gel Electrophoresis  ==
Native Gel Electrophoresis involves running gels with samples in its native state. In doing so, the charge of the molecule becomes a factor in addition to size. More specifically, more charged molecules will migrate faster and farther than less charged molecules of comparable mass. Likewise, larger molecules will migrate less and at slower speeds than another molecule of comparable charge.  Native Gel Electrophoresis most often involves two types of gels - Agarose and Polyacrylamide. Agarose is a derivative of the cell membranes of red algae composed of polysaccharides agarose and agaropectin, and due to the larger size of the pores, agarose gels are better suited for protein samples larger than 200 kilodaltons. Polyacrylamide (poly 2-propenamide, is a readily-crosslinked polymer of the neurotoxin acrylamide. It's pores are more fine, and while agarose is most commonly used for most cases, polyacrylamide is the gel of choice for smaller sample masses.

== The Use of SDS (sodium dodecyl sulfate) ==
[[Image:Sds.png|right|200px]]
[[image:SDS-PAGE.jpg|200px|thumbnail|SDS Page. The Molecular Marker is located in the left lane.]]

Electrophoresis involves the movement of particles due to electric current on the basis of size, charge of molecules, amount of current, etc. S[[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Purification/SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis|SDS PAGE]] is a technique used to separate proteins based on size, and size alone.  Sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) is a detergent that binds to proteins at every 2 amino acids in its sequence, and as SDS is very negative on its own, it changes the overall charge of the molecule to a negative charge. This negative charge is proportional to the protein's mass on the basis that the amount of SDS bound to the molecule is based on how many doublets of amino acids are present. The negative charge put on the protein is much larger than the charge originally there, which allows for a similar charge-to-mass ratio between different proteins. When SDS binds to proteins, it also changes the conformation of the proteins into similar shapes by denaturing the proteins and changing its bonds. SDS allows gel electrophoresis to separate proteins based on their molecular weights since the mass-to-charge ratio is relatively uniform among the proteins. This is because the SDS gel has sieving properties (offers resistance to particles based on their size)and is a uniform environment. It increases the differential mobility. The mobility of these proteins are then linearly proportional to the logarithm of their mass. Using this information, we can conclude from their mobility the mass of the protein and can even distinguish proteins that have a 2% difference in mass. Thus, the largest molecules, the ones that have more SDS bound to them, will fall down the electric field slower than the ones that have a smaller mass, and less SDS bound to them. This principle is contrary to the one in size-exclusion (gel-filtration) chromatography, which causes heavier molecules to come down first while the lighter ones come out later. 

Certain solvents, such as PEG, glycerol, ethanol, and isopropanol, have an effect of decreasing the hydrodynamic radius of the proteins by decreasing the amount of free water to provide hydration spheres for the proteins. The polar solvents will hydrogen bond with the water, decreasing the disorder around the proteins and as a result, reducing the size of the hydration sphere. In such case, proteins will be eluted at a later stage as if they were of smaller size. 

After the process is complete, the proteins are stained with a dye, forming bands, which represent the layers of mobility of each protein. With each additional purification process, the electrophoresis yields less bands, but a single darker band, which consequently represents the increased presence of the protein being isolated.

== Two-Dimensional Gel Electrophoresis ==
The separation techniques of SDS-PAGE and isoelectric focusing can be utilized in conjunction to allow for 2DGE, which employs higher resolution and sensitivity in the separation of proteins. The first dimension of this powerful technique is isoelectric focusing (IEF) and the second dimension is polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE). In the first dimension, proteins are separated according to their isoelectric point (pI). To do so, the gel is applied to the top of an SDS-polyacrylamide slab. Electrophoresis is then applied horizontally across the top of the gel and the proteins migrate into the second-dimension gel. Electrophoresis will then be applied again, this time vertically across the gel slab, and the proteins will migrate based on their molecular size. Heavier proteins will move shorter distances. Conversely, lighter proteins will move further.

While Two-Dimensional Gel Electrophoresis is a powerful technique that presents a higher resolution of separation, it does have its own limitations. 2DGE is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process, requiring manual gel polymerization, staining, and hours upon hours of separation. Furthermore, the technique is not without risk. Because heating of the gel may cause warping and diffusion of the molecules on the gel surface, 2DGE is difficult to reproduce.

==Gel Electrophoresis in DNA Fingerprinting ==
[[image:Pcr_fingerprint.png|200px|thumbnail| DNA Fingerprint.  Each sample has a different pattern of bands indicating these samples are from three different individuals.]]
DNA fingerprinting is a technique used to differentiate between different organisms based on the differences between each organism’s DNA configuration.  DNA fingerprinting is often used by forensics labs to identify criminals by comparing a suspect’s DNA to the DNA found at a crime scene.  DNA from the suspect is run through a gel electrophoresis and compared  to a sample of DNA that was found at the scene.  If the two samples produce identical  band patterns in the gel, then confirmation that the suspect was at the scene of the crime can be made, since no two people possess identical patterns in their DNA.  

In order to perform a fingerprint, a sample containing DNA must be obtained from each organism under evaluation.  Examples of DNA samples include blood, urine, saliva, skin or hair.  Before the samples can be analyzed, they must first be prepared. Preparation includes using restriction enzymes to separate the DNA into smaller pieces.  Restriction enzymes are enzymes that cut DNA strands at specific nucleotides.  These nucleotides are called restriction sites, and  typically mark the end of a 4-8 unit sequence in nucleotides.  The components and length of each restriction sequence vary from person to person, thus the use of restriction enzymes is an efficient way of separating an organism’s DNA into unique and specific sections. Additionally, certain amount of chemicals are also inserted as dye into the gel which will illuminate under UV light. This causes the bands to be much more visible when analyzing the sample protein.

Regions of DNA that contain  many different short repeated sequences are called microsatellites.  The lengths of these microsatellites vary greatly from person to person, which makes them prime locations for restriction enzymes to fragment the DNA.   After treating the  DNA samples with restriction enzymes, the  DNA is now ready to be analyzed.  The samples are loaded into the wells in a slab of gel, and an electric current is applied.  Smaller fragments of DNA run through the gel faster, and will therefore be closer to the bottom, while larger fractions remain closer to the top.  If two samples of DNA are run at the same time, the locations of the bands can be compared.  If the patterns of bands between the two samples are identical, it means that the restriction enzymes partitioned each sample’s DNA at the same locations, indicating the two DNA samples had  identical nucleotide sequencing.  Identical nucleotide sequencing reveals the two samples are from the same organism.

DNA fingerprinting is also a useful technique to determine whether or not two people are related.  Although no two people share the same DNA patterns, sections of microsatellites are passed down from parent to child.  Not all of these sections are passed down, but offspring do not contain any pattern that their parents did not possess.  A paternity or maternity test can be performed by comparing the DNA fingerprint of the individuals in question. If there are large groups of patterns that repeat in each sample’s fingerprint, it is likely that the individuals are related.  The embedded image contains a three different DNA fingerprints, as indicated by the three different patterns of bands.  Although these patterns represent fingerprints from different people, sample 2 shares similar patterns with both 1 and 3, which indicates that the person whose DNA is represented by sample 2 is likely to be the child of sample 1 and 3.  

Maternal and paternal DNA fingerprinting tests are used to determine the probability of two people being related.  These tests do not give definitive answers, and are not foolproof.

== Visualization of protein in gels ==
As most proteins are not directly visible on gels to the naked eye, a method has to be employed in order to visualize them following electrophoresis. The most commonly used protein stain is the dye Coomassie brilliant blue. After electrophoresis, the gel containing the separated proteins is immersed in an acidic alcoholic solution of the dye. This denatures the proteins, fixes them in the gel so that they do not wash out, and allows the dye to bind to them. After washing away excesse dye, the proteins are visible as discrete blue bands. As little as 0.1-1.0 µg of a protein in a gel can be visualized using Coomassie brilliant blue. A more sensitive general protein stain involves soaking the gel in a silver salt solution. However, this technique is rather more difficult to apply. If the protein sample is radioactive the proteins cna be visualized indirectly by overlaying the gel with a sheet of X-ray film. With time (hours to weeks depending on the radioactivity of the sample proteins), the radiation emitted will cause a darkening of the film. Upon development of the film the resulting autoradiograph will have darkened areas corresponding to the positions of the radiolabeled proteins.
Another way of visualizing the protein of interest is to use an antibody against the protein in an immunoblot (Western blot). For this techinique, the proteins have to be transferred out of the gel on to a sheet of nitrocellular or nylon membrane. This is accomplished by overlaying the gel with the nitrocellulose then has an exact image of the pattern that was in the gel. The excess binding sites on the nitrocellulose are then blocked with a nonspecific protein solution such as milk powder, before placing the nitrocellulose in a solution cantaining the antibody that recognizes the protein of interest (the primary antibody). After removing excess unbound antibody, the primary antibody that is now specifically bound to the protein of interest is detected with either a radiolabeled, fluorescent or enzyme-coupled secondary antibody. Finally, the secondary antibody is detected either by placing the nitrocellulose against a sheet of X-ray film (if a radiolabeled secondary antibody has been used), by using a fluorescence detector or by adding to the nitrocellulose a solution of a substrate that is converted into a colored insoluble product by the enzyme that is coupled to the secondary antibody.

You only get what you ask for (in capitalism at least); thus, you better know how to express your preferences. Sometimes you might even have to give a reason for them. But don't worry, JP and Liliana tell us how. Furthermore, they talk about the many ways of saying good bye. Our keyphrase is '''tengo sueño''' – I'm sleepy.

Making a phone call in Spanish can be somewhat challenging. (I'll never forget my first phone call in Spanish; that's for sure.) Thus, the information provided by Liliana and JP in this lesson is particular useful. The keywords are: '''está''' – he/she is (in), '''no está''' – he/she is not (in).

You never know who is in a bathroom! Thus, better check before you enter. JP and Liliana talk about how to do this and all the other things that can happen in Mexican bathrooms ... The key sentence is: '''está ocupado''' – it's busy/someone's in here.

{{SbcIntroductionSpanishPod}}
Here is a true story: the first time I tried to say “cheers” in Spanish, I said “que aproveche,” which means “enjoy your meal” and is just wrong when everyone is drinking instead of eating. Well, it's from our mistakes that we learn. And from JP and Liliana, of course. The keyword of this lesson is: '''felicidades''' – congratulations.

{{SbcIntroductionSpanishPod}}
Don't panic! Take your time with this lesson! Not only are Liliana and JP talking about a lot of numbers but also about times and hours — including the funny 24-hour system. We learn that JP doesn't like it and even Liliana seems to get it wrong at one point. Anyway, the key phrases are: '''¿Qué hora es?''' – What time is it? and '''¡Apúrate!''' – Hurry up!

{{SbcIntroductionSpanishPod}}
The most important thing about jet-lag: there is good jet-lag (when the local time is behind your time because you were flying westwards) and bad jet-lag (when the local time is ahead of your time because you were flying eastwards). Similarly, our keyword has multiple meanings: '''cambio de horario''' – change of schedule/change of time zone/jet-lag.

      <comment>/* Vaginal Cuff Dehiscence After Hysterectomy */  Overview</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{:Radiation_Oncology:TOC}}


&lt;big&gt;'''Vagina'''&lt;/big&gt;


==Vaginal Cuff Dehiscence After Hysterectomy==
*Rare event, reported at 0.1-0.3% after total hysterectomy
**Total laparoscopic hysterectomy appears to have higher rate (~5%) than total abdominal hysterectomy (~0.1%) or total vaginal hysterectomy (~0.3%)
*Predisposition
**Premenopausal women: Vaginal cuff infections or wound hematomas
**Post-menopausal women: Vaginal surgery for genital prolapse or complicated pelvic operations
**High-grade enterocele, vaginal vault prolapse and severe cuff atrophy contribute to the weakening of the vaginal apex
**Cuff radiation may compromise tissue vascularity and weaken the vaginal apex
*Triggers
**Physical triggers: Intercourse, other sexual practices, ''vaginal brachytherapy''
**Pressure triggers: Valsalva (coughing, straining to pass stool)
**Spontaneous: Even many years after hysterectomy
*Signs and symptoms
**Pelvic pain
**Vaginal bleeding
**Egress of abdominal or pelvic viscera
**A variety of other small-bowel symptoms
**Severity of symptoms related to elapsed time between event and presentation 
*Extruded body parts
**Small bowel (commonly distal/ terminal ileum)
**Omentum
**Appendix 
**Fallopian tube
*Management
**Fluid therapy
**Wrapping the bowel with moist saline pads
**Early antibiotic therapy
**Surgical repair
***Vaginal, transabdominal, or combined approach
***Choice depends on bowel viability, the ability to reduce the prolapsed bowel, and the need for and extent of vaginal repair or reconstruction
***The decision to proceed with the definitive repair primarily or to delay until resolution of inflammation depends on the viability of the tissues


*'''Pittsburgh'''  
**'''2007''' (2000-2006) PMID 17478361 -- &quot;Incidence and patient characteristics of vaginal cuff dehiscence after different modes of hysterectomies.&quot; (Hur HC, J Minim Invasive Gynecol. 2007 May-Jun;14(3):311-7.)
***Retrospective. 7286 hysterectomies (7039 total and 247 supracervical) performed by abdominal (TAH), vaginal (TVH), laparoscopic-assisted vaginal (LAVH), or laparoscopic hysterectomy (TLH)
***Outcome: vaginal cuff dehiscence after total hysterectomy 0.14% (10/7286). However, incidence 4.9% after total laparoscopic hysterectomy, 0.3% after total vaginal hysterectomy, and 0.1% after total abdominal hysterectomy
***Characteristics: median age 39 years, median time-to-dehiscence 11 weeks. 6/10 had both cuff dehiscence and bowel evisceration. 6/10 reported first post-op intercourse as the trigger event. 50% smoked cigarettes
***Conclusion: TLH may be associated with an increased risk of vaginal cuff dehiscence
**'''1996''' PMID 8784315 -- &quot;Vaginal evisceration: presentation and management in postmenopausal women.&quot; (Kowalski LD, J Am Coll Surg. 1996 Sep;183(3):225-9.)
***Retrospective. 3 cases. Literature review further 57 cases.
***Risk factors: postmenopausal 41/60 (68%), previous vaginal surgery (73%), presence of enterocele (63%). Most managed by primary repair, either immediately or delayed
***Conclusion: Vaginal evisceration seen with obstetrical or post-coital trauma, but in postmenopausal women also history of vaginal surgery and pelvic support disorder. Hypoestrogenism, atrophy, and devascularization from prior surgery seem to play a significant role

*'''Bologna; 2006''' (1995-2001) PMID 16154253 -- &quot;Transvaginal evisceration after hysterectomy: is vaginal cuff closure associated with a reduced risk?&quot; (Iaco PD, Eur J Obstet Gynecol Reprod Biol. 2006 Mar 1;125(1):134-8. Epub 2005 Sep 8.)
**Retrospective. 3593 patients, treated with hysterectomy (63% abdominal, 33% vaginal, 4% laparoscopic). Closed cuff 40%, open cuff 60%
**Outcome: vaginal evisceration in 0.3% (10/3593); no difference by route of surgery (abdominal 0.26% vs vaginal 0.25% vs laparoscopic 0.79%), no difference by type of vaginal cuff closure (closed 0.4% vs opened 0.2%)
**Trigger event: intercourse 40%, application of vaginal cylinder 20%, spontaneously 40%. Mean time to evisceration 20 months (2-62 months)
**Conclusion: In young patients, sexual intercourse is the main trigger event; in elderly patients, evisceration is a spontaneous event

**Case report. 2 patients, 2nd patient with endometrial cancer IB, applicator for vaginal brachytherapy inserted through vaginal cuff with resulting small bowel evisceration

*'''1907''' No PMID -- &quot;Rupture of the vaginal wall with protrusion of small intestines in a woman 63 years of age: Replacement, suture, recovery.&quot; (McGregor AN, J Obstet Gynaecol Br Emp 1907;11:252-8.)

First contact! We learn how to say “hello” and how to introduce ourselves. And I think this is also one of the very first podcasts of the SpanishPod team. At least Leo seems to feel a bit uncomfortable in front of the mic. Well, there is always a first time. The keyword is '''llamarse''' – to call oneself.

:''CosaNostra Pizza #3569 is on Vista Road just down from Kings park Mall. Vista Road used to belong to the State of California and now is called Fairlanes, Inc. Rte. CSV-5.  Its main competition used to be a U.S. Highway and is now called Cruiseways, Inc. Rte. Cal-12.  Farther up the Valley, the two competing highways actually cross.  Once there had been bitter disputes, the intersection closed by sporadic sniper fire.  Finally, a big developer bought the entire intersection and turned it into a drive-through mall.  Now the roads feed into a parking system - not  a lot, not a ramp, but a system – and lose their identity. Getting through the intersection involves tracing paths through the parking system, many braided filaments of direction like the Ho Chi Minh trail.  CSV-5 has better throughput, but Cal-12 has better pavement.  That is typical – Fairlanes roads emphasize getting you there, for Type A drivers, and Cruiseways emphasize the enjoyment, for Type B drivers.'' (Stephenson 1992)

==The Ownership of Transportation Networks:  A Rationale==

To explain the patterns of public and private ownership of transportation networks in the United States and elsewhere, one would need to take a longer view of the development of transportation systems.  While such explanations are beyond the scope of the current text, they may be found elsewhere&lt;ref&gt;Garrison, W.L. and Levinson, D.M. (2006), ''The Transportation Experience:  Policy, Planning, and Deployment'', New York, NY:  Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;.  We will focus instead on some of the common economic themes that lead to observed outcomes.

===Market Failure===

Public ownership of transportation networks has been more prevalent in certain locations and at certain times during history.  A common rationale in more modern times given in support of the public ownership of transportation facilities has been that of [[w:market failure|market failure]].  Though the formal concept of market failure is a relatively recent phenomenon, dating to developments in welfare economics during the early 20th century, earlier forms of it were used to justify public ownership of certain transportation facilities in the United States.  In the colonial U.S., a system of post roads was maintained by the federal government (as will be discussed later), as these roads were considered vital to communication.  Most mail and other types of communication moved by road, and hence it was considered critical to government administrative (and perhaps also judicial) functions that such roads be maintained.  A secondary justification was that such roads would facilitate trade and interstate commerce.  This is a type of &lt;i&gt;positive externality&lt;/i&gt; argument.  While it might have been possible for some such roads to be financed and built privately, there was concern that the desired network would not develop quickly enough, with lower-priority roads linking parts of the rural hinterland to established urban centers significantly lagging the completion of other segments, and thus leaving rural areas with poor lines of communication.

Other types of market failure arguments may also apply in the current context.  Some road and rail networks may exhibit economies of scale, leading to more efficient provision by fewer firms with high levels of output.  In an extreme case, strong economies of scale may indicate the presence of a [[w:natural monopoly|natural monopoly]], where it becomes more efficient for a single provider to produce a good.  In addition to monopoly or market power justifications, there are some public good aspects of transportation networks.  The next section discusses the nature of roads as different types of goods, with some local roads having the characteristics of public goods (non-rivalry and non-excludability).  Private firms might undersupply a public good if there is not sufficient motivation (i.e. profit) for them to do so.

===Government Failure===

While the existence of market failures may provide a rationale for public ownership of transportation networks under certain circumstances, there is also a countervailing argument that cautions against public ownership as a response to instances of market failure.  The public sector analogy to market failure is known as [[w:government failure|government failure]], and refers to situations where government intervention causes a more inefficient allocation of resources than would occur in the absence of the intervention.

There are many types of government failure, but the ones most relevant in the context of transportation policy tend to be legislative in nature.  They include issues of [[w:logrolling|logrolling]], [[w:pork barrel spending|pork barrel spending]] and [[w:rent-seeking|rent-seeking]].

&lt;i&gt;Logrolling&lt;/i&gt; is a term applied to political allocation processes to describe the act of vote-trading among members of a political body.  James Buchanan and Gordon Tullock, in their seminal work on political economy entitled [[w:The Calculus of Consent|The Calculus of Consent]]&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, J.M. and Tullock, G. (1962), ''The Calculus of Consent:  Logical Foundations of Constitutional Democracy'', Ann Arbor, MI:  University of Michigan Press.&lt;/ref&gt;, described a formal model of simple majority voting incorporating as an example the maintenance of local roads by a group of rural farmers.  Buchanan and Tullock show how bargaining (vote trading) among the participants allows for agreements that ensure the maintenance of all roads.  However, the cost of this bargaining is shown to be an aggregate overinvestment of resources, since each farmer must pay for the maintenance of all other local roads in order to ensure the maintenance of the road that serves his property.  There is a direct analogy between this process and the process used to allocate resources for transportation by the U.S. Congress.  The rapid growth of federal transportation programs during recent re-authorization cycles, not only in terms of absolute expenditures but also in terms of the number and scope of programs, provides strong evidence of this.

&lt;i&gt;Pork barrel spending&lt;/i&gt; has become one of the more ubiquitous forms of government failure in U.S. transportation policy.  The term refers to the process of elected officials securing spending on projects or programs for the primary benefit of members of their home district&lt;ref&gt;Knight, B. (2004), &quot;Parochial interests and the centralized provision of local public goods:  evidence from congressional voting on transportation projects&quot;, ''Journal of Public Economics'', 88:  845-866.&lt;/ref&gt;.  This practice has become synonymous with the process of [[w:Earmark (politics)|earmarking]], in which provisions are included in bills or committee reports to direct spending to specific projects, often without any form of evaluation to determine the project's social desirability.  The most recent federal transportation bill, authorized in 2005, included more than 6,000 earmarks, totalling more than $24 billion in spending.  The project which came to represent the most egregious example of pork barrel spending in transportation was the proposed $398 million [[w:Gravina Island Bridge|Gravina Island Bridge]] in Alaska, infamously known as the &quot;Bridge to Nowhere&quot;.  Other prominent examples of pork barrel spending include Boston's [[w:Big Dig|Big Dig]], the [[w:John Murtha Johnstown-Cambria County Airport|Johnstown Airport]] and [[w:Interstate 99|Interstate 99]] in Pennsylvania, and the [[w:Don Young#Coconut Road|Coconut Road Interchange]] in Florida.  Pork barrel spending has also influenced the design of federal highway and public transit programs, both of which are structured to spread benefits as widely as possible across congressional districts in order to ensure local support.

&lt;i&gt;Rent-seeking&lt;/i&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Tullock | first=Gordon | year=1967 | month=June | title=The welfare costs of tariffs, monopolies, and theft | journal=Western Economic Journal | volume=5 | issue=3 | pages=224-232 | url=http://www3.interscience.wiley.com/journal/119722738/abstract | issn=00433640 | accessdate=2010-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; involves the manipulation of the economic environment by private individuals or groups in order to extract economic rents.  Governments are a primary target of rent-seekers, since they may offer special priviliges in the form of budget allocations or regulatory treatment, and are susceptible to interest group lobbying.  A classic example in the field transportation is the [[w:Davis-Bacon Act|Davis-Bacon Act]], which applies to all federally-funded public works projects in the United States.  The Act requires the payment of &quot;locally prevailing&quot; wages to workers employed on such projects.  The term &quot;prevailing&quot; is generally understood to refer to local unionized wage rates, including fringe benefits.  Originally passed in 1931, the law has survived numerous attempts to repeal it or weaken its provisions, owing largely to political support from unionized construction labor.  The Davis-Bacon Act, among other provisions (such as the [[w:Surface Transportation Assistance Act#Section 165: &quot;Buy America&quot; Act|Buy America Act]]), is cited as a source of rising construction costs on many federally-funded projects&lt;ref&gt;Winston, C. (2000), &quot;Government Failure in Urban Transportation&quot;, ''Fiscal Studies'', 21(4):  403-425.&lt;/ref&gt;.

In practice, both market failure and government failure have influenced the nature of ownership arrangements in the provision of transportation.  In addition to these considerations, the type of good represented by different transportation assets may influence not only the distinction of public versus private ownership, but also which level of government should be responsible for providing transportation infrastructure and services in the case of public ownership.  As we will also see, there are a range of possible outcomes in terms of the degree of private involvement in the provision of transportation.

==The Nature of Transportation as a Good and Its Ownership==

=== Elements of Vehicle/Highway System ===
The existing vehicle/highway system can be characterized as having a sort of quasi-private form of ownership.  While in many elements are publicly owned:
* Road infrastructure 
* Traffic control
* Public transit services

The system does have several elements that are privately supplied including:

* Private vehicles	
* Time
* Roadside Services (Gas, Food, Lodging)
* Origins
* Destinations
* Parking

===Functional Highway Classification by Type of Good===

There are four types of [[w:Common good (economics)|goods]] that are determined by their technical characteristics concerning excludability and rivalry:

|-
| ||||||
|}

&lt;i&gt;Public goods&lt;/i&gt; are non-excludable and non-rivalrous, 

&lt;i&gt;Private goods&lt;/i&gt; are both excludable and rivalrous.  

&lt;i&gt;Club goods&lt;/i&gt; (for instance a country club membership) are excludable, but non-rivalrous (in the absence of crowding).  

&lt;i&gt;Congesting goods&lt;/i&gt; are rivalrous but not excludable, for instance a crowded street. While an individual cannot be excluded from a city street, that person’s presence may cost you extra time and his occupation of space does prevent you from occupying the same space at a given time. (Note that limited access highways are potentially excludable, unlike city streets.)

==== Excludability ====
Excludability implies that the good’s provider can prevent a user from obtaining it without charge

National defense for instance is non-excludable, America’s nuclear weapons protect anyone in the country, whether or not they want it.  On the other hand the sale of anything in a store is excludable – the owner can prevent a customer from obtaining a good unless the customer pays (assuming enforceable property rights etc.).

==== Rivalry ====
Rivalry implies that one person’s consumption of a particular good prevents another individual from consuming it. 

National defense again is non-rivalrous – one person’s protection does not prevent another’s protection.  Shoes are rivalrous, only one person can wear a pair at a time.

==== Roads ====
[[File:HierarchyOfRoads.png|thumb|right|250px|Hierarchy of roads delineates which roads serve property access and which roads serve movement]]
Roads exist largely to serve two purposes:  movement and access (specifically, access to property).  Different types of roads have characteristics of different types of goods based on their functional classification&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, D.M. (2005), &quot;Paying for the Fixed Costs of Roads&quot;, ''Journal of Transport Economics and Policy'', 39(3):  279-294.&lt;/ref&gt;.  In other words, there is a correspondence between the [[w:Hierarchy of roads|functional classification of a road]] and the type of good it represents.  What types of roads are which type of goods?

Limited access highways (freeways) and some arterials with signalized intersections and few access points, could be considered &lt;i&gt;private goods&lt;/i&gt;, since it is possible to identify and exclude users with appropriate toll technologies.  These roads are also rivalrous since, in the absence of pricing or other measures to limit demand, an additional user can affect the use of the road by others.

Local roads lie on the other end of the spectrum in terms of functional classification, since they exist primarily to provide property access.  Local streets can be excludable if access to them is restricted.  Access restrictions may take many forms, ranging from the simple posting of signs indicating that access is restricted to residents to actual physical restrictions, such as gates.  The latter type of restriction is typically associated with gated communities or other forms of private residential development.  Local streets are also generally non-rivalrous in that their low levels of traffic tend to preclude problems with congestion.  This combination of characteristics (excludability and non-rivalry) indicates that some local streets may be considered &lt;i&gt;club goods&lt;/i&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Buchanan, J.M. (1965), &quot;An Economic Theory of Clubs&quot;, ''Economica'', 32(125):  1-14.&lt;/ref&gt;.  The oldest such example in the United States is that of Benton Place in St. Louis, Missouri, where adjoining property owners were required to join a private association which was responsible for road maintenance, with assessments being levied on each association member &lt;ref&gt;Beito, B.T. and Smith, B. (1990), &quot;The Formation of Urban Infrastructure Through Non-Governmental Planning:  The Private Places of St. Louis&quot;, ''Journal of Urban History'', 16:  263-303.&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Local streets are typically provided by local governments with no restrictions on access.  In the absence of access restrictions local streets may be both non-rivalrous and non-excludable, leading them to take on more of the character of a &lt;i&gt;public good&lt;/i&gt;.  Note the term &quot;public good&quot; in this case is defined by the economic characteristics of the good, and not simply by the fact that it is supplied by the public sector.

Between limited-access highways and local streets are a middle level of road, collectors, that link local streets with limited-access highways.  These “linking collectors” serve both access and mobility functions, since they may also provide access to some adjacent properties.  These roads may be considered “congesting” or [[w:common good (economics)|common]] goods.

The characterization of roads in terms of functional classification may also inform decisions about which level of government should be responsible for providing a given road (assuming the decision is made to provide the road publicly).  Local units of government seem best suited to providing local streets, since they are closest to the problem.  Roads that provide for a higher level of movement, such as limited-access highways, ought to be provided by higher-level jurisdictions, such as states.  Of course, there are tradeoffs involved in each of these decisions.  Smaller jurisdictions may not be able to fully realize [[w:economy of scale|scale economies]], while larger jurisdictions may encounter problems with [[w:span of control|span of control]].  Between these extremes there is some optimal mix of expenditures between different levels of government that minimizes capital and operating costs&lt;ref&gt;Levinson, D.M. and Yerra, B. (2002), “Highway Costs and the Efficient Mix of State and Local Funds”, ''Transportation Research Record:  Journal of the Transportation Research Board'' 1812:  27-36.&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Realms of Public and Private Involvement ==
[[Image:TE-Ownership.png|thumb|600px|right|Spectrum of transportation infrastructure ownership]]

One can think of the degree of public and private involvement in the provision of transportation as falling somewhere along a continuum between fully public and fully private ownership.  Returning to the example of road provision, the figure outlines the various forms of possible public and private ownership structures, along with the types of functional class roads they might apply to.

Under conventional forms of government ownership and provision, responsibility for road provision is divided between federal, state, and local government.  Federal and state governments have primary responsibility for arterial roads (including the Interstate system in the U.S.), with states also operating some more heavily-used collector roads.  Local governments provide some combination of collector and local roads.  In addition, some local roads may be provided by non-governmental organizations, such as homeowners' associations and individual private landowners (as in the case of apartment complexes).

One could also conceive of roads being provided under a public utility framework, where responsibility for maintenance and operation of the roads was transferred to a quasi-public authority.  This might be an acceptable way to provide the network of linking collectors that connect local roads with higher-level arterials (limited-access highways) and serve both access and mobility functions.

Alternately, the private sector can be involved in the provision of roads to varying degrees.  Most public works and transportation departments involve the private sector to at least a minimal degree in such activities as planning, design, construction and maintenance.  

The more limited forms of private involvement in road provision tend to involve the &lt;i&gt;outsourcing&lt;/i&gt; of road design, construction and maintenance activities to private consulting and construction firms.  Private contractors may enter into &lt;i&gt;service contracts&lt;/i&gt; with government agencies to provide certain specified operations and maintenance activities.  These contracts may apply to all classes of publicly-owned roads.  Outsourcing may also apply to more comprehensive &lt;i&gt;management contracts&lt;/i&gt;, in which the contractor may be responsible for the design and construction of a road (often under so-called [[w:design-build|design-build]] project delivery systems), sometimes coupled with provisions for operations and major maintenance activities.  These types of contracts often are applied to the construction of new arterial roads in cases where a public authority is unwilling to give up full control of a project.

Greater private sector involvement in terms of project financing and risk assumption are possible through agreements between public authorities and private contractors for the &lt;i&gt;franchising&lt;/i&gt; of road projects &lt;ref&gt;Fielding, G.J. and Klein, D.B (1993), &quot;How to Franchise Highways&quot;, ''Journal of Transport Economics and Policy'', 27(2):  113-130.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Franchise agreements often leave the ownership of the road in the hands of the public sector, while leasing it out to private operators who agree to operate and maintain the road for over a given period specified in the contract.  This method is often adopted for projects involving the construction of new arterial roads, where the contractor is responsible for some combination of design, construction, finance, operation and maintenance activities.  Many contracts are structured such that the management and operation of the road asset will revert back to the public authority after the expiration of the contract.  Franchise arrangements for highways also typically involve contracts that contain rather detailed provisions regarding pricing, operations, and maintenance requirements. 

The greatest amount of private participation in road provision is made possible via the [[w:divestment|divestiture]] of existing roads by the public sector.  Divestiture involves the outright sale of an existing road to a private firm, who is then free to operate the road and collect charges from users to financing its operation.  Examples of full divestiture of roads are rare in the United States though, as will be discussed later, there has been some renewed interest in the franchising of existing highways in recent years.

=== Public Role in Private Provision of Infrastructure ===
The public sector has generally had three different types of roles that interact with private sector in the provision of transportation infrastructure.

* The public sector may be the ''recipient'' of privately provided infrastructure. Traditionally the public sector owns, operates, and maintains street and road infrastructure. However developers may build local roads and streets and dedicate them to the public sector as part of their role in making land suitable for occupancy. These private in-kind contributions are the most common type of private provision of infrastructure.

* The public sector may play a role as ''facilitator'' in the provision of infrastructure.  Government agencies may provide planning and coordination activities in anticipation of the development of an infrastructure project, possibly including the assembly of land for right-of-way (which in some cases may require the use of [[w:Eminent domain|eminent domain]] powers).  Some public entities will also offer financial inducements to facilitate the provision of infrastructure.  In addition to some of the tax advantages offered to private investors in the financing of infrastructure projects (which will be discussed in the next section), public entities may sometimes provide matching grants to encourage private investment.  A more traditional role of the public sector in facilitating private investment has been for the state to act as a [[w:Broker|broker]] for infrastructure projects, combining its traditional coordination activities with the discretion to select a private developer for an infrastructure project from among multiple competing proposals.

* The third type of role that the public sector might play is to serve as an ''investor'' in infrastructure projects.  Governments may serve as stockholders in some private projects, though this practice has been limited in the US (see the preceding section on the history of state involvement in US road provision for the early precedents to this policy).  In some cases, the public sector may form a transportation corridor development corporation to guide the development of an infrastructure project.  Lastly, the public sector may play a more traditional role as developer in an infrastructure project.

=== Private Role in Public Sector ===
There are also many situations in which the private sector plays a role in the public sector's provision of transportation.  Consider the case of highways.  The private sector is often intimately involved in several aspects of the development of highways.  Private consultants are often hired to provide expertise in the planning and design functions on specific roadway projects.  Private construction contractors are hired to manage the actual construction of transportation projects once the design work has been completed.  Sometimes these functions are more closely integrated into what are termed [[w:Design-build|&quot;design-build&quot;]] contracts.

The private sector may also be invited to participate in the operation of public facilities.  In some cases, existing assets such as toll roads will be put out to bid for the right to operate them for a limited period of time.  Recent examples of this include the [[w:Indiana Toll Road|Indiana Toll Road]] and the [[w:Chicago Skyway|Chicago Skyway]].  Sometimes a public entity will sell an asset to a private investor, then lease it from the investor and continue to operate it, an arrangement referred to as a [[w:Leaseback|leaseback]] scheme.  Under such a scheme, the public entity benefits by being able to raise cash through the sale of the asset, while the investor is able to claim the tax benefits from the [[w:Depreciation|depreciation]] of the asset.  

The private sector may also be encouraged to take on a greater role in the provision of new infrastructure.  Beyond the traditional planning, design and construction functions, public entities may award contracts that require private firms to take on responsibility for the financing and ongoing operation of a road.  These contracts are referred to as [[w:Project delivery method|Design-Build-Operate-Maintain (DBOM)]] or [[w:Project delivery method|Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT)]] contracts, with the latter containing provisions for the transfer of the asset back to public ownership after a given [[w:Concession|concessionary]] period.

== Differences in Transportation Ownership by Country ==

There is a great deal of diversity reflected in the international experience with the ownership and development of transportation networks.  Here we will provide a brief survey of the experiences in a few of the more developed, industrialized countries of the world.
=== United States ===

Article 1, Section 8 of the United States Constitution states that:

''The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States; but all duties, imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States; … To establish post offices and post roads; …''

Amendment IX adds:

''The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.'' 

Also, Amendment X provides that:

''The powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the states, are reserved to the states respectively, or to the people.''

It is not entirely clear what the above provisions prescribe in terms of ownership and operation of transportation infrastructure.  On one hand, Article 1, Section 8 provides for the establishment of [[w:post roads|post roads]], which initially were meant to imply major routes connecting cities, essentially the equivalent of modern highways.  However, as the population grew and mail service became more widespread the designation of post roads became less clear.  Also, a law passed in 1838 extended the designation to all railroads.  The addition of Amendment X indicates that transportation activities not under the purview of the federal government (for example, those identified in Article 1), should be left the states or to private individuals.  States, in turn, could devolve some powers to local units of government.

Early federal road bills were vetoed by Presidents James Madison, James Monroe and Andrew Jackson, primarily on the grounds that they overstepped the bounds of federal authority granted by the Constitution. 

One might interpret the above provisions as prescribing a rather limited federal role for transportation, especially considering the declining importance of having a set of federally-designated post roads and the development of rather robust roadway networks.  In contrast, the federal role in transportation has grown considerably, particularly during the latter half of the 20th century.  While states have taken on increasing roles in constructing and maintaining transportation networks, the federal government still has a large presence in terms of regulatory policy and financing.  These two activities are the primary instruments through which the United States implements its transportation policies.

Currently, governments provide the majority of the system of roads and highways in the U.S.  In turn, they recover part of the cost through the imposition of fuel taxes, vehicle license fees, sales taxes on motor vehicles, weight-distance charge from trucks, and various other fees and penalties (fines).  The federal portion of the [[w:Fuel taxes in the United States|motor fuels tax]], currently at 18.4 cents per gallon, is directed to the federal Highway Trust Fund.  Most of the federal Trust Fund revenues are distributed to the states as aid for highway and bridge construction.  The remaining share is distributed for mass transit grants to cities and for environmental remediation projects related to leaky underground fuel storage tanks.  States add their own motor fuel taxes, which raises the US national average motor fuel tax to 47 cents per gallon.  Some state and local governments also operate toll facilities, mostly roads and bridges, which account for a little over 5 percent of all transportation-related revenues.  Most of the toll facilities in the U.S. are located in older, northeastern states and many of them predate the initiation of the [[w:Interstate Highway System|Interstate Highway System]].  More recently, faster-growing Sunbelt states like California, Florida and Texas have accounted for most of the growth in the mileage of toll roads in the U.S.

The Interstate Highway System (also known as the ''Dwight D. Eisenhower National System of Interstate and Defense Highways'') is a unique feature of the U.S. transportation system.  It is comprised of a national network of over 46,000 miles of grade-separate, limited-access highways.  The network was initially planned during the 1940s, while the U.S. was involved in World War II, and was presented to the public primarily as a critical component of national defense.  The stated goal was to provide the ability to move large amounts of troops and equipment across the country quickly.  A second important goal was to facilitate interstate commerce, coinciding with the growth of commercial truck traffic, though this goal was not as prominently promoted.  Construction on the Interstate system began in 1956, under the Eisenhower administration.  Today, states retain much of the responsibility for maintaining the Interstate system, with the federal government providing grants funded the federal fuel tax.  The Interstate system remains publicly owned, largely on the grounds that national defense is too important to place in private hands.



Most airports in the United States are owned and operated by municipal governments or local authorities.  This remains the case despite a recent attempt to privatize Chicago's [[w:Chicago Midway International Airport|Midway Airport]].  The privatization proposal, initiated in 2008, would have taken the form of a long-term (99-year) lease from the City of Chicago in exchange for a $2.5 billion up-front payment.  The lease arrangement fell through when the consortium that would have operated the airport was unable to put together a full financing package.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) imposes taxes on aviation fuels, passenger tickets and several other aviation-related items in order to fund the [[w:Airport and Airway Trust Fund|Airport and Airway Trust Fund]] (AATF).  The Trust Fund, authorized in 1970 under the [[w:Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970|Airport and Airway Development Act]], finances air traffic control and grants to local authorities for airport improvements.  These funds are supplemented by revenues raised by local airport authorities from sources such as landing fees (based on the maximum landing weight of aircraft), passenger facility charges (PFCs), parking charges, and concessions for retail activities at major airports.  Each airport has its own user charge schedules.  Airport expansion costs are usually raised by airport bonds secured by signatory (major) carriers.  This gives the signatory airlines power to veto any major changes to landing fee structures or airport slot allocation systems.  This veto power has proven to carry weight, for example, when [[w:LaGuardia Airport|LaGuardia Airport's]] incumbent airlines blocked a recent proposal to auction off airport slots during peak traffic periods.

Airport congestion has become a recurrent problem in many locations throughout the U.S., often affecting the on-time performance of carriers.  Only a handful of airports, such as those in the New York City area and Boston's Logan Airport, use landing fees during peak periods in order to mitigate congestion.  The fees are typically designed to get smaller aircraft to move their flights to off-peak periods or to other nearby, less congested airports.  Airport gate and [[w:Landing slot|Landing slots]] are a similar type of mechanism for allocating peak capacity.  Some landing slots are transferable among carriers.  However, the method used by most airports to allocate slots to carriers tends to confer windfall gains on existing carriers.

Expanding capacity at U.S. airports has proven difficult in recent years due to political and environmental considerations.  When physical expansion is undertaken, it is often in the form of adding a runway to an existing airport rather than building an entirely new one.  In the U.S., [[w:Denver International Airport|Denver International Airport]] has been the only new airport built since 1974.

* a push towards further defederalization and privatization of airports.
*  recovers a part of the costs through air transport tax, landing fees, concession and other rentals, general terminal fees, parking fees, etc.

The development of Canadian policies toward transportation have some importance differences from those in the United States.  Like the U.S., Canada has maintained some degree of shared responsibility for transportation between the national government and the country's 10 provinces.  However, unlike the U.S., Canada has devolved responsibility to lower levels of government to a much greater degree.  With the exception of air transportation and marine navigation, most transportation functions are devolved to provincial and lower levels of government&lt;ref&gt;Heaver, T.D. and Waters, W.G. II (2005), &quot;Transportation Policy in Canada&quot; in K.J. Button and D.A. Hensher, eds. ''Handbook of Transport Strategy, Policy and Institutions'', Amsterdam:  Elsevier Science Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Canada has also undertaken more extensive measures to privatize certain types of infrastructure and services, particularly in air transportation (e.g. airports and air traffic control).

Canadian transportation policy, especially toward issues of ownership of transportation infrastructure, has gone through significant change since the mid-1980s, when a wave of [[w:Economic liberalization|economic liberalization]] affected many sectors of the Canadian economy, including transportation.  The roots of regulatory reform in Canada's transportation sector can be traced back to the MacPherson Royal Commission on Transportation (1961-62), which was tasked with studying the issues of the railway industry, which came under financial stress during the 1950s when it started losing commercial traffic to competing modes such as intercity trucking and waterways.  The Commission recommended broader regulatory liberalization across the transportation sector with a more limited role for government subsidy in guiding transportation policy.  Many of the Commission's recommendations toward Canada's railways were adopted with the 1967 National Transportation Act, though the recommendations regarding regulatory liberalization of other modes were not.  Liberalization policies toward other modes were picked up again during the 1980s under a more conservative national government.

Railway companies themselves provide their own infrastructure; roadbeds, tracks, yards and stations;
Ports Canada, a crown corporation, owns and operates major ports in Canada;  each port authority (e.g., Port of Vancouver) enjoys substantial autonomy.

While a department of the Canadian government, [[w:Transport Canada|Transport Canada]], has broad responsibility setting regulations and policies affecting transportation in Canada, decisions about road construction are placed under the jurisdiction of individual Canadian provinces.  The [[w:Trans-Canada Highway|Trans-Canada Highway]], a transcontinental highway link, was built through a federal-provincial partnership that emphasized connecting and upgrading major inter-regional links within provinces.  Apart from this effort, there is little federal involvement in the provision of roads.  Roads costs are partially recovered through a combination of fuel taxes, vehicle license fees, and other fees and penalties.  [[w:Fuel taxes in Canada|Fuel taxes]] in Canada include a combination of federal and provincial excise and sales taxes, a portion of which are directed to a Gas Tax Fund which is used to finance municipal infrastructure.  

Canadian provinces make limited use of [[w:List of toll roads#Canada|toll facilities]] in the road sector.  The primary use of tolls on Canadian roads is to provide a revenue stream to repay bonds issued for road construction.  Some highways that were initially tolled have since seen the tolls decommissioned.  Most recently, the [[w:British Columbia Highway 5|Coquihalla Highway]] had its toll facility decommissioned in 2008.  Originally completed in 1987 at a cost of $848 million, the highway's tolls were removed after the BC government had collected a roughly equal amount of revenue during the toll road's 20 years of operation.  

Private participation in the development of road infrastructure has been limited to a couple of major facilities.  [[w:Highway 407 (Ontario)|Ontario Provincial Highway 407]] was built between the late 1980s and late 1990s under a 35-year lease to a private consortium.  Under the original agreement, the highway was to be transferred back to the provincial government at the end of the lease.  However, in 1999 the Ontario government passed a budget-balancing resolution that included a 99-year lease of the highway to a private consortium.  The 407 facility is one of few in the world to use an all-electronic toll collection system.  The other major privately-developed road infrastructure project in Canada is the [[w:Confederation Bridge|Confederation Bridge]], an 8-mile toll bridge connecting the mainland province of New Brunswick with the island province of Prince Edward Island, off Canada's eastern coast.  The Confederation Bridge was completed in 1997 under a [[w:Build-Operate-Transfer|build-operate-transfer]] agreement between the Canadian government and a private developer, Strait Crossing Development Incorporated.  A subsidiary of the developer, Strait Crossing Bridge Limited (SCBL) will operate the bridge for 35 years and collect tolls, with the operation of the bridge reverting back to the Canadian government at the end of the lease.  SCBL services the debt issued to pay for the bridge's construction with a combination of toll revenue and subsidy payments from the Canadian government for the ferry services it continues to operate at a loss in order to provide transportation for pedestrians, cyclists and other types of vehicles that are prohibited from using the bridge.  It is important to note that the original motivation for building the bridge was to provide a [[w:fixed link|fixed link]] across the Northumberland Strait to better connect Prince Edward Island with mainland Canada, and to partially replace the ferry service that previously carried most traffic to the island.

Transport Canada also retains a large role in Canada's aviation system.  Prior to 1996, it had responsibility for both aviation regulation and provision of air traffic services.  While it retains most of its regulatory functions, Transport Canada's responsibility for provision air traffic service has been greatly reduced.  The adoption of the [[w:National Airports Policy (Canada)|National Airports Policy]] in the early 1990s led to the divestiture of many smaller airports, while Transport Canada retained ownership over the larger airports in the [[w:National Airports System|National Airports System]].  The larger airports are leased to local private operating authorities.  The National Airports Policy resulted in privatization of other aspects of the aviation system as well.  A new private, non-profit company ([[w:Nav Canada|Nav Canada]]) owns and operates Canada's air traffic control and air navigation systems.

=== Japan ===

Japan's major intercity roads are owned and operated by regionally-based public corporations.

Regionally based public corporations own and operate major intercity roads;
* other roads financed by fuel taxes
* many toll roads make profit after paying back the capital costs of construction and expansion.

Local authorities own major airports such as Narita and Kansai International airports;
* Landing fees and passenger fees are high;
* Government subsidize contruction and expansion costs


=== Europe ===

European Commission has proposed to establish a rail infrastructure company to own and maintain railroad tracks and stations, and let rail carriers use it for fees to provide competing services.

== Privatization ==
Gomez-Ibanez and Meyer&lt;ref name=Gomez-Ibanez1993&gt;{{cite book | last1=Gomez-Ibanez | first1=Jose A. | last2=Meyer | first2=John R. | year=1993 | title=Going Private:  The International Experience with Transport Privatization | publisher=Brookings Institution}}&lt;/ref&gt; have identified three types of privatization that may apply to transportation systems.  Privatization may take the form of the sale of existing state-owned businesses, private infrastructure development, or the outsourcing of conventional public sector functions by contracting with private vendors.

=== Sale of existing state owned business ===
The first type of privatization is the sale of former state-owned business (public enterprises).  During the 1980s, many governments in Europe and the developing world (South America in particular) initiated the sale of state-owned enterprises.  Western European countries, led by France and the United Kingdom, were eager to return to the private sector many industries that were nationalized following World War II.  These industries included public utilities, transportation, and some heavy industry (e.g. British Steel in the UK).  Similar developments were taking place in the developing world, led by South American countries such as Chile and Argentina.  The rationale was largely the same:  a belief that the private sector could operate such enterprises more efficiently.  Around the same time, the collapse of the Soviet Union and the dissolution of the former Communist Bloc left many Eastern European countries to make the transition toward a market economy.  This transition affected the transportation sector in a large number of countries, where governments were eager to promote private sector participation in functions such as the provision of urban and intercity bus services.  Reviews of early experiences with such reforms have started to appear for countries such as Poland&lt;ref&gt;Pucher, J. (1995), &quot;The Road to Ruin?  Impacts of Economic Shock Therapy on Urban Transport in Poland&quot;, ''Transport Policy'', 2(1):  5-13.&lt;/ref&gt; and Hungary&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, J.D. and Saleh, W. and Prileszky, I. (1997), &quot;Ownership and Control of the Bus Industry:  The Case of Hungary&quot;, ''Journal of Transport Geography'', 5(2):  137-146.&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Private Infrastructure Development ===

The second type of privatization involves private participation in infrastructure development.  While there has been more experience outside of the United States with private transportation infrastructure development in recent years, there are some limited examples domestically.  These include the privately-developed [[w:91 Express Lanes|SR 91 Express Lanes]] in California, the [[w:Virginia State Route 267#Dulles Greenway|Dulles Greenway]] in the Northern Virginia suburbs of the Washington, D.C. region, and the [[w:Las Vegas Monorail|Las Vegas Monorail]], one of the few examples of privately financed passenger rail systems in the U.S.  In most cases where the private sector is invited to participate in transportation infrastructure development, the primary motive is raising new money for transportation, something that can be more difficult to accomplish under a system that is reliant on tax financing.

=== Outsourcing of conventional public sector functions by contracting with private vendors ===
The third type of privatization is the outsourcing of conventional public sector functions by contracting with private vendors.  This type of privatization has gained wider acceptance in the U.S. and has become fairly standard practice for many transportation and public works departments.  Functions such as road maintenance and highway management are routinely contracted to private firms.  

Many urban public transit agencies in the U.S. also contract with private vendors to provide maintenance services, direct operation of some transit routes, or both.  For example, a number of cities in the northeastern U.S. have contracted with Amtrak or one of several private firms to operate commuter rail services.  The selection of Amtrak as the operator in some cases was due to the fact that Amtrak owns the rail infrastructure on some lines where it also provides intercity passenger service.

In both cases, the primary motive for outsourcing maintenance, management or operations is financial gain on the part of government.  Many governments have been able to realize cost savings in the provision and maintenance of transportation infrastructure through competitive contracting of services&lt;ref&gt;Poole, R.W., Jr. and Fixler, P.E., Jr. (1987), &quot;Privatization of Public-Sector Services in Practice:  Experience and Potential&quot;, ''Journal of Policy Analysis and Management'', 6(4):  612-625.&lt;/ref&gt;.  The savings may then be used to either expand or improve the quality of service, to pay down existing debt levels, or to lower the burden of taxation that is borne by citizens.

=== Disadvantages of Privatization ===
Privatization of transportation infrastructure and services may also have some disadvantages.  These can be categorized in terms of whether they apply to private firms or to society more broadly.

====Disadvantages to private firms====
* Private firms must pay taxes
* Private firms must borrow funds at market interest rates
* Private firms do not have eminent domain powers

====Disadvantage to society====
* Type 1 privatization (sale of state-owned businesses) may upset existing property/equity relationships.  Winners and losers are created.  
* Cost savings may lead to unemployment when firms cut back on unprofitable services.  These workers must find employment elsewhere in the economy, something that may not easy to do during periods of recession.
* Environmental sensitivity may not be in a private firm's objective function.

=== Lessons for Success ===

Privatization is easier when:
* There is competition in input and output markets
* Possible efficiency gains are large
* Few redistributions or transfers are required
* There are few controversies with the environment or opposition to economic growth
* An activity or service covers its cost BUT profits are not TOO high

== Transit Bus Privatization ==
One industry within the transportation sector where privatization has gained momentum in recent decades has been bus transit, particularly urban (intracity) bus services.  The relatively low fixed costs associated with provision of bus services provides the potential for a market with relatively low barriers to entry and intense competition.

=== Regulation Cycle ===
Like many modes of transportation, urban bus transit has gone through many stages of growth, maturity, decline and some degree of rationalization.  Gomez-Ibanez and Meyer&lt;ref name=Gomez-Ibanez1993/&gt; have identified a 10-stage cycle of regulation and privatization that broadly reflects the experience with bus transit in many countries around the world.  The 10 stages are listed below.  

# Entrepreneurial
# Consolidation
# Regulation of Fares and Franchises
# Decline in Profits
# Withdrawal of capital and services
# Public takeover
# Public subsidies
# Declining efficiency
# Vicious cycle of subsidy cuts, fare increases, service cuts, declining riders
# Privatization [Go to 1 or 3]

While most cities begin at the first stage (entrepreneurial) of the cycle, some remain in the stages of public ownership and subsidy (stages 6 and 7), while others have moved on to various degrees of privatization (stage 10).  Where privatization has taken place, the cycle indicates that cities typically revert to either an entrepreneurial phase or to a phase in which services are privately provided, but certain aspects of provision such as fares and franchises are regulated.

=== Types of Privatization ===
Depending on which policy objectives are being pursued, bus transit privatization may either &lt;i&gt;eliminate&lt;/i&gt; or &lt;i&gt;supplement&lt;/i&gt; public ownership.  Where governments are looking to divest themselves of the ownership and operation of buses services and to end or limit the provision of subsidies, they may allow greater entry for private providers and limit regulatory involvement.  Partial forms of privatization can also allow governments to continue to pursue certain social objectives (for example, providing service to low-income users), while maintaining ownership of bus service.  An example of this is the competitive tendering of bus services, which is a more common form of partial privatization in the U.S., where the public sector retains ownership of bus services but enters into a contract with a private provider to operate the service.  Decisions on fares, scheduling and service levels typically remain in the hands of the public organization. 

Conditions on Privatization

Fares

*  Deregulation of fares (Colombo Sri Lanka, Santiago Chile) [Colombo kept the public company with low fares and overcrowding; Santiago had a proliferation of modes, drivers formed route associations and raised fares, service is better but still crowding]
* Regulation of fares (everywhere else)

Routes

* Deregulation of routes ... direct subsidies to specific routes
* Regulation of routes ... must provide service on unprofitable routes -&gt; cross subsidy

=== Britain's Buses ===
The most high-profile experiment with transit bus privatization in recent history has been the privatization and deregulation of [[w:Bus transport in the United Kingdom|local bus services]] in the UK.  Privatization began with the passage of the [[w:Transport Act 1985|Transport Act of 1985]] which privatized and deregulated bus services throughout the UK, though London did not fully deregulate its services, opting instead for a system of franchised routes.  The Transport Act was passed under the conservative [[w:Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] regime, as part of a series of sweeping economic reforms which privatized several former state-owned enterprises.  

The Act requires only that firms register the commencement of, or changes to, a bus service at least 42 days in advance.  Under the law, bus operators are only allowed to offer scheduled services, prohibiting [[w:Share taxi|jitney-type]] services.  Local governments may refuse to allow a service only in the event of serious safety or traffic congestion problems.  They may also supplement privately registered routes by offering unserved routes for competitive tender&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Klein | first1=Daniel B. | last2=Moore | first2=Adrian T. | last3=Reja | first3=Binyam | year=1997 | title=Curb rights:  eliciting competition and entrepreneurship in urban transit | journal=The Independent Review | volume=11 | issue=1 | pages=29-54 | url=http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=473441 | doi=10.2139/ssrn.473441 | accessdate=2010-05-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

New entrants - low cost by lower wages, lower overhead, flexible work rules, do not usually lower prices, passengers are unlikely to wait.  

The privatization and deregulation of bus services in Britain was designed to inject competition into the supply of bus services and thus to exert downward pressure on costs.  This goal was largely achieved, as new entrants with with lower costs entered many markets and exerted pressure on incumbent operators.  The newer firms tended to achieve lower costs through lower wages, more flexible work rules, and lower overhead costs&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gomez-Ibanez | first1=Jose A. | last2=Meyer | first2=John R. | year=1990 | title=Privatizing and deregulating local public services:  lessons from Britain's buses | journal=Journal of the American Planning Association | volume=56 | issue=1 | pages=9-21 | url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a787367194&amp;db=all | doi=10.1080/01944369008975740 | accessdate=2010-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.  Existing firms were forced to respond by cutting their own costs.  Since these firms retained many employees from their pre-deregulation days while simultaneously hiring new workers, a two-tiered wage structure began to emerge reflecting the compensation of these different groups.  Another source of cost savings was the substitution of smaller vehicles (minibuses), operating more frequently and at higher speeds, for larger buses.  Heseltine and Silcock&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Heseltine | first1=P.M. | last2=Silcock | first2=D.T. | year=1990 | month=September | title=The effects of bus deregulation on costs | journal=Journal of Transport Economics and Policy | volume=24 | issue=3 | pages=239-254 | url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/20052926 | accessdate=2010-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; report that just a few years after the initiation of deregulation, former National Bus Company operators claimed to have reduced costs per bus mile by 15 to 20 percent, while former Passenger Transport Executive operators reduced costs by an average of 30 percent.

While significant cost savings were achieved by the deregulated operators, passenger fares increased as broad-based government subsidies were withdrawn.  Examining the experience with the first 10 years of deregulation, Mackie et al.&lt;ref name=Mackie1995&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Mackie | first1=Peter | last2=Preston | first2=John | last3=Nash | first3=Christopher | year=1995 | month=July | title=Bus deregulation:  ten years on | journal=Transport Reviews | volume=15 | issue=3 | pages=229-251 | url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a773221410&amp;db=all | doi=10.1080/01441649508716914 | accessdate=2010-05-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; reported that throughout the UK, passenger fares increased by an average of about 19 percent, while real subsidies declined by an average of 38 percent.  Demand, measured in terms of passenger journeys, declined by an average of 22 percent nationwide, thought the decline was much lower in the London metropolitan region.  Higher fares were an important factor in explaining the decline, as was the instability in the newly deregulated bus markets.  However, the decline could not be accounted for by diminished service levels, as bus-kilometers of service rose in every region examined&lt;ref name=Mackie1995/&gt;.

One of the more interesting developments in the evolution of the deregulated bus industry was the competitive strategy that was employed by the newly-private firms.  There were initially many small operators in most of the larger markets, though the industry became much more concentrated within a few years, either through the exit of unprofitable firms or through acquisition of smaller operators by larger competitors.  There are essentially no economies of scale in providing local bus services, but large firms have been able to successfully drive out competition by engaging in price wars and using profitable routes to subsidize fares on more competitive routes (cross-subsidization).  Maintenance of competitive conditions on routes is made even more difficult by the scheduling practices employed by the deregulated operators.  Since operators may set any schedule they like, subject to the provision of publishing the change six weeks in advance, many competing operators have an incentive to engage in &quot;route jockeying&quot; or &quot;headrunning&quot;, wherein an operator schedules its service to run immediately ahead of its competitors (and thus take its competitors' customers).  This practice works since passengers are often indifferent to which bus they choose to reach a specific destination, provided prices and quality are roughly equal, and is made easier by the fact that operators must publish their schedules.  Such a strategy often invites retaliatory behavior by incumbent operators, who have been observed to respond by running service so frequently as to prevent competitors from attracting sufficient patronage to survive, a practice known as &quot;route swamping&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Dodgson | first1=J.S. | last2=Katsoulacos | first2=Y.S. | year=1991 | title=Competition, contestability, and predation:  the economics of competition in deregulated bus markets | journal=Transportation Planning and Technology | volume=15 | issue=2/4 | pages=263-275 | url=http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a773498960&amp;db=all | doi=10.1080/03081069108717458 | accessdate=2010-05-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

In contrast, transit contracting in United States consists mostly of paratransit services, with only some fixed routes.

=== Curb Rights ===
Drawing on the experience of bus deregulation in the UK, as well as previous experience with private provision of transit the United States and around the world, Klein et al.&lt;ref name=Klein1997&gt;{{cite book | last1=Klein | first1=Daniel B. | last2=Moore | first2=Adrian T. | last3=Reja | first3=Binyam | year=1997 | title=Curb Rights:  A Foundation for Free Enterprise in Urban Transit | publisher=Brookings Institution | isbn=0-8157-4940-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; diagnosed the problems associated with private competition in bus transit as an absence of property rights.  Specifically, they suggest that fixed-route (though not necessarily fixed-schedule) transit services are able to function where operators have a right to pick up &lt;i&gt;congregations&lt;/i&gt; of passengers along a route.

The congregation function in urban transit is considered essential to establishing a market for transit services.  Klein et al. note that the establishment of private jitney services (services operating with smaller vehicles on relatively fixed routes, though not on fixed schedules) is common where there are substantial congregations of passengers at points along a route served by a regular, fixed-schedule service.  Particularly in &quot;thick&quot; transit markets, the fixed-schedule service acts as an &quot;anchor&quot; around which the private jitney operators target their service.  Klein et al. draw on a historical example from the US of jitney operations emerging during the 1910s and picking up passengers along the routes of streetcars, often running ahead of the scheduled streetcar arrivals&lt;ref name=Klein1997/&gt;.  However, problems may arise when there are no rights assigned to pick up passengers at particular locations and during particular time periods.  In the case of the streetcars, the issue was dealt with by the streetcar operators appealing to local governments to enforce their exclusive franchise rights and drive out the jitneys.  While this action may have (temporarily) preserved the streetcars' viability, it also drove out potential market entrants who were willing to provide valued services to customers.

In the case of thick markets, like the streetcar example, the problem of &quot;interloping&quot; (or inter-temporal poaching of passengers) by new market entrants like the jitney operators is not as severe.  If demand levels are sufficiently high, a route can sustain several competing operators.  However, when markets are &quot;thin&quot; (i.e. when demand levels are lower), the problem of interloping becomes more severe.  When a number of competing operators enter a thin market where scheduled service is provided, the anchor of the scheduled service may be &quot;dissolved&quot; by the competing operators.  Operators may be hesitant to invest in providing scheduled service if they cannot appropriate the returns from picking up congregations of passengers and are not protected from interloping competitors.  If interloping continues to occur in this kind of market, the result may be the destruction of the market altogether.  This process has been observed in many of the smaller cities in the UK following deregulation, where intense competition and frequent interloping have become destructive and resulted in a large amount of concentration among a limited number of operators.  

One possible solution to this problem that has been used in the past has been for a local government to offer exclusive rights to operate a particular route.  However, this type of arrangement creates many of the same problems typically associated with monopolies (higher prices, lack of innovation in service provision).  The role envisioned by Klein et al. for government is one of creating and enforcing property rights to serve passengers at particular locations and times (&quot;curb rights&quot;)&lt;ref name=Klein1997/&gt;.  The term &quot;curb right&quot; is used to denote the fact that the operator would have rights over a particular space along a street (a &quot;curb zone&quot;), including a bus stop area and the adjoining sidewalk, which would serve as a location for passengers to congregate.  These curb spaces could then be auctioned to private operators who wished to use them to pick up congregations of passengers.  The provision of rights over these congregations of passengers would ensure a minimal market to establish regular, scheduled service and protect this market from interlopers.  Klein et al also suggest the possibility of local governments protecting against monopoly abuse by reserving some curb zones as &quot;commons&quot; areas for jitney services when a single firm seeks to buy up all of the curb zones along a particular route, giving it a &lt;i&gt;de facto&lt;/i&gt; monopoly.  Where markets are sufficiently thick, the establishment of curb rights can also improve the quality of services by ensuring a market for both scheduled services and unscheduled, jitney operations.

== Road Privatization ==

Unlike buses, roads are not easily [[w:contestable market|contestable]].  Buses tend to have low fixed costs and higher variable costs, which implies few barriers to entry.  The roads most likely to be private (limited-access roads) under the framework discussed previously also tend to be more costly to provide and entail high fixed costs.  In this case, market power is a serious consideration.  Many limited-access highways function essentially as local monopolies, making the introduction of direct competition difficult.

Issues of competition can also be problematic in urban settings.  Where new private toll roads or road capacity are built in urban areas, the toll road must often compete with one or more free alternatives, making it difficult to attract sufficient traffic.  In the case of the privately-built [[w:91 Express Lanes|91 Express Lanes]] in Orange County, CA, the local topography made the provision of parallel routes difficult.  The primary competitor to the toll lanes was the parallel free lanes on the SR-91 freeway, which tend to become badly congested during the peak period.  After several years of operation, the worsening peak-period conditions on the free lanes led to growing public demands for additional capacity.  While the significant peak-period congestion ensured a market for the toll road, it also imposed a heavy economic cost on the users of the free lanes in the form of delays.  Since the lease agreement with the private operator prohibited the addition of untolled capacity, the Orange County Transportation Authority had no choice but to purchase the toll road and take over its operation. 

Other aspects of road networks can also make privatization difficult.  For example, on low volume roads, tolls often cannot recover costs.  This typically leads to other forms of financing.  One possibility is to finance such roads through general revenue sources, essentially treating them as local public goods.  Another is to adopt [[w:shadow toll|shadow tolls]] or other forms of availability payments.

Roads are also a long term investment, implying a need for guarantees of stability.  Long-term traffic forecasting is difficult and often involves large margins of error.  Uncertainty about future traffic demand translates into uncertainty regarding future revenue streams from road tolls.  Under private financing arrangements, risks associated with revenue uncertainty often get capitalized into interest rates, leading to higher borrowing costs.  Problems of uncertain traffic demand can be particularly acute when a private road is being built in a growing area, where future development is anticipated to form a significant part of the base of demand for the road.  An illustration of this problem is provided by the experience of the [[w:Virginia State Route 267#Dulles Greenway|Dulles Greenway]] in Loudoun County, Virginia, where the Greenway's original owners defaulted on their loan due to lower-than-projected demand and revenue.  


&lt;!--in Europe, many private roads have been nationalized--&gt;


=== Reluctance ===
Since the establishment of the publicly-owned National Highway System in the U.S. there has been continued reluctance to build new private roads or privatize existing roads.  There have been a handful of exceptions, however.  During the 1990s there were two notable projects that involved private ownership and financing:  [[w:91_Express_Lanes|California's SR91 Express Lanes]] and the [[w:Virginia State Route 267#Dulles Greenway|The Dulles Greenway]]).  More recently, the privately financed and developed [[w:California State Route 125|South Bay Expressway]] was completed in 2007 in the eastern suburbs of the San Diego region.  In addition, there have been a couple of cases where existing toll roads have been leased to private entities under long-term lease agreements (an example of the &quot;franchise&quot; framework discussed previously).  These types of arrangements have been agreed to for operation of the [[w:Chicago Skyway|Chicago Skyway]] and the [[w:Indiana Toll Road|Indiana Toll Road]].

There are several possible explanations for the reluctance to move toward greater privatization of roads in the U.S.:

* The reluctance may reflect apprehension toward privatization in general, due to some high-profile and problematic experiences with privatization and deregulation in other industries such as California's electricity deregulation and Britain’s experience with Railtrack.

* Private roads must offer a significant and apparent advantage over public control.  
* The burden of proof is on those who want to change the status quo.  They must prove why privatization would be beneficial to all interested parties. 
* The case for privatization must be compelling, and for most places to try it, it must have been done somewhere else first.
* Not just net gains, but also distributional effects must be considered.  Privatization may create winners and losers, and the losers are likely to be the most vocal opponents, complicating matters politically.

== Thought Question ==
&lt;div style=&quot;background: ##aaaaaa; border: 4px solid #ffCC99; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;

The 2000 [[w:Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] Platform asserts &quot;Government interference in transportation is characterized by monopolistic restriction, corruption and gross inefficiency. We therefore call for the dissolution of all government agencies concerned with transportation, … We call for the privatization of …, public roads, and the national highway system. …&quot;

Is Government Ownership Characterized By:
* Monopolistic Restriction
* Corruption
* Gross Inefficiency

Would Private Ownership Be Characterized by:
* Monopolies
* Corruption
* Gross Inefficiency ?
&lt;/div&gt;

== Public Policy Questions ==

Should the freight railways continue to provide their own infrastructure ?  If yes, should they be subsidized to the extent that truckers are being subsidized indirectly ?   

What are the advantanges and disadvantages of creating a common rail infrastructure corporation ?

Should the governments (i.e., tax payers) subsidize a part of infrastructure costs ?

Should the extent of subsidy be equalized across all modes of transportation ?

If so, should we subsidize an equal amount per passenger-km or an equal proportion of the total modal costs ?

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to demonstrate a typical business application such as the creation of an Invoice.  The invoice must have date and Boolean data types and use a bind rule to automatically calculate invoice totals.  The invoice should have multiple line items, each with an amount.

== Method ==
We will use many of the standard XForms controls and a standard XForms style sheet to style the form.

== Screen Image ==

[[Image:XForms-invoice-screen-image.jpg]]

== Sample Application ==

[http://xforms-examples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/10-full-examples/88-invoice/invoice.xhtml Load Sample XForms Application]

== Sample Invoice Instance==

The following is a sample of an invoice document.  This document is typically sent by a supplier to a consumer of a product or service after confirmation that the products or services were delivered.

The top portion has items such as an invoice number, the date the invoice was sent to the customer and the from and to information.  It is then followed by a set of line items that specify the items delivered and their price.  At the end the line items are totaled and an indication made to see if the invoice was paid or not.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;Invoice&gt;
   &lt;InvoiceID&gt;123&lt;/InvoiceID&gt;
   &lt;InvoiceDate&gt;2008-10-10&lt;/InvoiceDate&gt;
   &lt;From&gt;
      &lt;OrganizationName&gt;Acme Services&lt;/OrganizationName&gt;
      &lt;OrganizationAddress&gt;123 Main St.
                  Anytown, MN 12345&lt;/OrganizationAddress&gt;
   &lt;/From&gt;
   &lt;To&gt;
      &lt;OrganizationName&gt;Acme Consumer&lt;/OrganizationName&gt;
      &lt;OrganizationAddress&gt;123 Main St.
                  Anytown, MN 12345&lt;/OrganizationAddress&gt;
   &lt;/To&gt;
   &lt;LineItems&gt;
      &lt;Item&gt;
         &lt;Description&gt;Widget 123&lt;/Description&gt;
         &lt;Amount&gt;100.00&lt;/Amount&gt;
      &lt;/Item&gt;
      &lt;Item&gt;
         &lt;Description&gt;Widget 456&lt;/Description&gt;
         &lt;Amount&gt;200.00&lt;/Amount&gt;
      &lt;/Item&gt;
      &lt;Item&gt;
         &lt;Description&gt;Widget 789&lt;/Description&gt;
         &lt;Amount&gt;300.00&lt;/Amount&gt;
      &lt;/Item&gt;
   &lt;/LineItems&gt;
   &lt;TotalAmount&gt;&lt;/TotalAmount&gt;
   &lt;InvoiceTermsCode&gt;net-30&lt;/InvoiceTermsCode&gt;
   &lt;PaidIndicator&gt;false&lt;/PaidIndicator&gt;
&lt;/Invoice&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== XForms User Interface ==
The interface to the Invoice uses input, textarea and select1 controls.  In addition, data types are assigned to the InvoiceDate and InvoicePaid indicator elements.



== XForms Application Source ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;html xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml&quot; xmlns:ev=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/xml-events&quot; xmlns:xs=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema&quot; xmlns:xf=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot;&gt;

            &lt;xf:label&gt;Paid:&lt;/xf:label&gt;
         &lt;/xf:input&gt;
         
   &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Sample CSS File ==
The following CSS file required the input XForms application to add the newline class attribute for each control that appears on a new line.  This allows the repeat input items to not automatically flow to a new line.

&lt;source lang=&quot;CSS&quot;&gt;
@namespace xf url(&quot;http://www.w3.org/2002/xforms&quot;);
body {font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;}
textarea {font-family:Helvetica, sans-serif;}

.newline {display:block; margin:5px 0;}

xf|input &gt; xf|label, xf|select &gt; xf|label, xf|select1 &gt; xf|label, xf|textarea &gt; xf|label 
{text-align:right; padding-right:10px; width:20ex; float:left; text-align:right;}

xf|group {border: solid black 1px; margin:15px 5px; padding:5px; background-color:lavender;}
.group-label {text-align:left; font-weight:bold; font-size:12pt;}

/* put each item on a new row */
.xf-repeat-item {padding: 3px; display:block;}

.Description, .Description .xf-value {text-align: left;}
.Description {width: 50ex; text-align: left;}
.Description .xf-value {width: 65ex; text-align: left;}

.Amount,  .Amount .xf-value{text-align: right;}
.Amount {width: 12ex;}
.Amount .xf-value {width: 16ex;}

/* add to remove spaces between table cells
table {border-collapse: collapse;} */
thead tr {background-color: silver;}
thead tr th {padding: 2px 5px;}
&lt;/source&gt;

My interests are numerous and varied; I have expertise in matters of Mathematics, certain Sciences, and Linguistics.  Obviously, I speak English.  I fare pretty well in Spanish as well.  I'm not too fond of profiles, but I suppose they are necessary.  I certainly will not make mine elaborate or ostentatious- that's just not me.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== How Build Your First XRX Application ==
Although there are many different ways you can build an XRX application, there are two vital ingredients to get you started.  First you will need a way to create XQueries with [[w:REST|RESTFul]] interfaces.  The OpenSource native XML database [http://www.exist-db.org eXist] seems to be the favorite of most people although the [[w:Mark Logic#MarkLogic Server|MarkLogic]] server has a community version that is free as long as your data sets are under 10GB which seems to be enough for most pilot and learning projects.

The second component you will need is some client that will take an XForms data stream intended for a browser and build applications with it.  Because the XSLTForms client is now bundled with both eXist and MarkLogic and runs on all browsers many people are using this client.

If you need forms that need to load quickly without the overhead of loading the large XSLT transforms and JavaScript libraries, the FireFox XForms addon is also a very mature product, but does not run on FireFox versions higher than 3.0.12.

The Picoforms XForms client for IE and Chiba forms will also work very well.  If you are looking for a pure server-side transform you may want to look into Orbeon Forms or the IBM Workplace Forms tools.

There are five architectural tasks that you will need to master.  They go by phrase CRUDS: Create, Read, Update, Delete and Search.  Having a tool to quickly import XML data from spreadsheets is also very useful as you migrate more data into your XRX application server.  The oXygen XML editor is a favorite because is has strong support for the eXist database.

Once you have understood the basic concepts in the CRUDS cycle, you can then explore ways to optimize reports using XQuery and XQuery functions and modules.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An [[Structural Biochemistry/Protein function/Antibodies|antibody]] (also known as immunoglobulin or Ig) is one of an animal's defense mechanisms. One type of antibody, Immunoglobulin G or IgG, has a Y-like structure consisting of two heavy chains and two light chains. The structures of antibodies are partially maintained by disulfide bonds, which link the heavy chains to heavy chains or heavy chains to light chains. The heavy chains always have the same sequence of [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acids]] while the light chains have varied sequences of amino acids. This variation is important to ensure that the antibody will be able to respond to various antigens, foreign substances that enter animal bodies (e.g.: foreign [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|protein]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Carbohydrates/Polysaccharides|polysaccharides]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid|nucleic acids]], etc.). Antibodies are produced by the B cell, which is a type of white blood cell. B cells will allow the immune system to remember and react faster for future exposures. There are various types of antibodies, which are categorized based on the isotopes that the chains possess. Approximately five different types are discovered in mammals which each carry a special function and response based on the different types of bacteria that they encounter throughout the body. Each of the classes has identical light chains which is matched with a different heavy chain. Each of these classes of immunoglobulin has a specific function. Immunoglobulin M (IgM) is the first class of antibody to appear after exposure to an antigen. IgM has ten combining sites which enables it to bind extra well with antigens containing multiple identical epitopes. An example of avidity, which is the strength of an interaction that contains multiple independent binding interactions between matching antibody-antigen complex. Immunoglobulin A (IgA) is the antibody that is involved in external secretions - tears and saliva - meaning it is the body's first line of defense against bacteria and viruses. The role of Immunoglobulin D (IgD) is still unknown. Immunoglobulin E (IgE) helps to protect against parasites. However, it also participates in allergic reactions.  The release of granules containing pharmacologically active molecules is triggered when the IgE - antigen complex forms cross-links with receptors on the surface of mast cells.  These antibodies are generated randomly using different gene segments which give a specific bind site for the antibody. They are also randomized by the mutations in the genes, making them even more complex and diverse. This relates to the humoral immune system (see below) that helps humans protect against the wide range of diversity in bacterias and viruses. There are two forms of antibodies: one that is soluble in the blood and fluids of the body and the other one that is attached to the B cell in general. The structure of the antibody includes a heavy chain and a light chain. The heavy chain has a constant region and a variable region and it is about 110 amino acids long. Antibodies first bind to the pathogens to prevent them from damaging cells. Second, they will try to remove pathogens using macrophages. Finally, they will stimulate other immune responses to further destroy the pathogens. The cells and proteins connected with this process are discussed below.

'''Immune Cell Response- Cells and Proteins Involved'''

The immune response system is composed of two corresponding systems, the ''humoral'' and ''cellular'' immune systems. The humoral immune system occurs primarily in body fluids, targeting bacterial infections and extracellular viruses. The humoral system can also react to individual foreign proteins. The cellular immune system attacks host cells infected by viruses as well as some parasite and foreign tissues. Both of these systems are prompted by a category of white blood cells called ''leukocytes,'' of which include macrophages (cells that ingest by phagocytosis) and lymphocytes (cells that release antibodies). In the cellular immune system, a class of T cells, called ''cytotoxic T cells'', are the main cells involved with reception of foreign cells or parasites. These cells have ''T cell receptors'' that are on the surface of cells and extend through the plasma membrane. When an antigen is deteected, either a T cell receptor or antibody will bind to a specific molecular structure in the antigen. This structure is referred to as antigenic determinant or an ''epitope'' (see ''Epitopes'' under ''Protein Function''). Helper T cells are also a part of the cellular immune system, generating ''cytokines'', a type of soluble signaling proteins. In ''clonal selection'', helper T cells are involved only indirectly, prompting the selective reproduction of the cytotoxic T cells and B cells that can bind to the certain antigen. 

In performing this response, antibodies can either be: 
*'''Monoclonal'''
*:One type of antibody responding to one type of antigen by recognizing one antigenic determinant.

[[Image:Monoclonal antibody.jpg|200px|frame|center|monoclonal antibody]]
*'''Polyclonal'''
*:Several type of antibody responding to one type of antigen by cooperatively recognizing various antigenic determinants on the antigen.
[[Image:Biochem-polyclonal.jpg|200px|frame|center|polyclonal antibody]]

'''Epitopes'''

Epitopes are the sites on a antigen that the immune system recognizes. It is also called an antigenic determinant. Both the host and foreign protein can produce epitopes that can bind to the paratopes of the B and T lymphocytes. An epitope can be either linear or conformational epitope. Linear epitotes are recognized by long chain of amino acids, or their primary structure: the sequence of the animo acids. Conformational epitopes are recognized by the antibodies by the 3-D structures of the epitopes. 

'''Antibody Folding'''

Recent studies have shown how antibodies fold. Foldings occur in the [[Cell Biology/Endoplasmic Reticulum|endoplasmic reticulum]] even before chains complete translation. Most of these studies are made by dissecting the antibody and letting it denaturalize and refold. IgGs are mostly used for these experiments. IgGs mostly form through adding a light chain to a heavy chain dimer between the CL and CH1 region. Dissection of IgGs light chain shows that there are three pathways of folding caused and limited to [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proline proline] cis-trans isomerization. In general, most antibodies are formed through these three pathways after the C2-C3 sulfide bridge formed.

In equilibrium, most proteins have the accessible conformations, such as the native state, unfolded state, and non specific aggregates. However, At low pH (pH&lt;3), Antibodies have tendency to adopt specific additional conformation, called “alternating folded state”( though most other proteins are unfolded in this environment). Through spectroscopic, the structure is different from the nature state. However, it exhibits characteristic of the folded state ( e.g. stability against unfolding). The concern about this process is significant in biotechnology because antibody manufacturing process often include low pH steps, which can easily perform the “alternatively folded state”.
For some antibodies, another accessible state is the fibrillar amyloid structure, that  can lead to some protein-folding diseases. Fibrillar amyloid structure is a cross-beta structure in which fibrils are formed by beta-strand exchange of the individual subunits. Isolated LCs and truncated HCs form fibrils and are deposited in organs such as kidneys. The large quantity deposit can cause some fatal diseases when it interferes with physiological functions. E.g. A large deposit of monoclonal LCs prone to misfolding and the formation of amyloid  deposit can cause a fatal disease [light chain amyloidosis (AL)].The fibrilization mechanism is still under study . However, the mechanism in production of variable domains might generate less stable domain, therefore, can pass ER quality control but have a propensity to misfold outside the cell.  
B cell: a stage in which heavy and light chains are synthesized and expressed at cell surface via a transmembrance .
Heavy/light chain: constituent polypeptide chains of antibody molecules. Light chains are made up of two Ig domains. Heavy chains are made up of minimum of 3 Ig domains.
Ig domain: 100 amino acid-folding unit conserves twisted barrel-like-beta-sheet structure. It is stabilized by a buried intrachain disulfide bond.

'''Clonal Expansion'''

When the antibodies recognizes a specific antigen, the B cells clone itself and turn into 2 types of cells: the plasma cells and the memory cells. 
The plasma cells are effector cells that produce a large amount of a specific soluble antibody that attacks the target antigen.
Memory Cells are long lived cells that can be quickly activated to produce antibodies when the specific antigen is observed.

During the primary Immune response, that is the first time antibody attacks an antigen, it takes a long time for the antibody to make a large amount of plasma cells and memory cells when compared to the secondary response. During the secondary immune response, there is only a short time lag and the rate of Antibody produced is a lot greater. This is due to the memory cells activating the production of antibodies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">hmmmm

&quot;Although reversed phase chromatography and hydrophobic interaction chromatography are very similar, the ligands in reversed phase chromatography are much more hydrophobic than the ligands in hydrophobic interaction chromatography. This enables hydrophobic interaction chromatography to the use of more moderate elution conditions, which do not disrupt the sample nearly as much.&quot;

so this is really just HPLC but for less-polar proteins?  you still use the same apparatus?  I think this should be merged with the previous page, although I'm no expert.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Information==
'''Enzyme-linked Immunoabsorbent Assay (ELISA)''' is an analytical method utilizing various 
[[Structural_Biochemistry/Protein_function/Antibodies|antibodies]] to detect the presence of a compound in a wet or liquid sample. [[Structural_Biochemistry/Enzyme|Enzyme]] linked to the antibodies react with substrates to produce a color change, signifying the presence of desired substance, usually antigen.  The intensity of the color can be used to determine the concentration of substance of interest in a sample.  Antibodies are assayed to form a pure line of monoclonal antibodies that only detect the desired antigen or protein.

If the antibody-labeled enzyme is specific to another antibody, the indirect ELISA method is used whereas if the antibody-labeled enzyme can directly react with the antigen, sandwich method is preferred. 

==Indirect ELISA ==
[[Image:Indirect_ELISA_chem114a.jpg|thumbnail|right|Procedure of indirect ELISA]]
*'''Purpose''': Detect the presence of a type of antigen.
*'''Procedure'''
**Coat sample well with antigen.
**Add sample to coated well. If antibody of interest (Antibody A) is present in the sample, it will bind to the antigen. Wash out the remaining sample.
**Add a second antibody (Antibody B) to the sample. Antibody B is an antibody that will specifically bind to antibody A and is linked to a special enzyme. Wash out the remaining antibody B.
**Substrate is added to the mixture. This substrate will trigger a reaction with enzyme attached to antibody B to produce colored substance. 
**The rate at which the color changes is proportional to the amount of antigen in the solution. 
*'''Usage''': HIV Infection Test

== Sandwich ELISA ==
[[Image:Sandwich_ELISA_chem114a.jpg|thumbnail|right|Procedure of Sandwich ELISA]]
In the Sandwich ElISA, or two site capture assay, two different antibodies are used. The wells are coated with an antibody specific for one region of the antigen, then the test solution containing antigen is added. Following washing, the second antibody, which recognizes a different epitope of the antigen, will be added. This antibody will have the enzyme attach. 

*'''Purpose''': Detect the presence of a type of antigen.
*'''Procedure'''
**Coat sample well with monoclonal antibody (Antibody Z) that responds specifically to one type of antigen. 
**Add sample that might contain the antigen of interest (Antigen C) to the coated sample well. If sample contains Antigen C, it will bind to antibody Z. Wash out the remaining sample. 
**Add a second monoclonal antibody (Antibody Y), which also binds to Antigen C, to the well. This antibody is linked to a special enzyme. 
**Substrate, which reacts with enzymes on Antibody Y, is added. Reaction occurs and color change is observed.
**Presence of colored product confirms the presence of Antigen C. The intensity of the colored product can be used to determine the concentration of Antigen C. Also the rate of color change of the solution is proportional to the amount of antigen present.
*'''Application of sandwich ELISA''': Pregnancy tests

In the pregnancy test, the reaction zone will contain the primary antibody (usually a monoclonal mouse antibody IgG) that recognizes a portion of a unique beta chain of the pregnancy hormone called Human Chorionic Gonadotropin (HCG). The secondary antibody conjugated with enzyme in the test zone recognizes the alpha chain. This chain can be found in luteinizing hormone (LH) which also present in non-pregnant women. It will display a color change in this test zone if the antigen was bound to both antibodies forming a sandwich. At last, a control zone contains antibody that binds to primary antibody (anti-IgG). A color change in this zone will show that our test was correctly preformed.

== Competitive ELISA ==
[[File:Immunometric Assay.jpg|thumbnail|Example of homogenous competitive immunoassay]][[File:Comp_B.jpg|thumbnail|Example of heterogeneous competitive immunometric assay]]
Competitive ELISA is another method of ELISA that involves competitive binding process. 
*'''Procedure'''
**Incubate unlabeled antibody within presence of its antigen.
**Bound antibody/antigens are added to a antigen coated well.
** Wash and remove unbound antibodies.
**Competition results from the fact that the more antigens are present in the sample, the less antibody will be able to bind.
**A secondary antibody that is coupled to a enzyme is added.
**Substrate added for signal
**The weaker colored or fluorescent signal that is released shows that that the original antigen concentration was high.

==Reverse ELISA==
Reverse ELISA is a relatively new technique specifically created to investigate the West Nile virus envelope protein and how it is able to detect virus-specific antibodies. This newer technique uses an solid phase made up of an immunosorbent polystyrene rod with ogives. The entire device is immersed in a test tube containing the collected sample and the following usual steps such as washing, incubation in conjugate and incubation in chromogenous are performed through dipping the micro-wells with the prepared sample concentration.

The advantage of Reverse ELISA over other ELISA techniques is how sensitive the test can detect different reagents, which is beneficial for detecting different kinds of antibodies with their respective antigens with large target assays. The sample volume can be increased to improve the test sensitivity in clinical (saliva, urine), food (bulk milk, pooled eggs) and environmental (water) samples. One ogive is left unsensitized to measure the non-specific reactions of the sample. The use of laboratory supplies for dispensing sample aliquots, washing solution and reagents in microwells is not required, facilitating ready-to-use lab-kits and on-site kits. Based on the platform of ELISA, this method uses an antibody microarray to capture native antigens. Autoantibody reactivity is then evaluated by differentially labeling patient IgG and incubating these antibodies with the native antigens that are immobilized on the antibody microarray.

*'''Procedure'''
**Preparation: Prepare autoantibodies (IgG) separated and purified from serum. Label them either through radioactive tagging or a fluorescent dye.
**Extraction: Label autoantibodies with native protein on array. Native antigens bound to antibodies on array are extracted from microarray with unique monoclonal antibodies. Array should be incubated with native protein extracts such as cells, tissue, or body fluid, etc.
**Analysis: Analyze concentration based on intensity of dye appearing in the assay. When the process is complete, the assay is then evaluated by its intensity of color which is determined for each well. The amount of color produced correalates to the amount of primary antibody bound to the proteins on the bottom of the microwells</text>

      <comment>/* Structural Biochemistry */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Structural Biochemistry is the field of biochemistry that focuses mainly on the components, functions, and structures of molecules of cells within living organisms. It helps us understand cells through the theories of  [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemistry|Chemistry]] and the laws of  [[Structural Biochemistry/Physics|Physics]]. Structural biochemistry concentrates on the study of  [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Types of Macromolecules|macromolecules]] (such as [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Carbohydrates|carbohydrates]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Proteins|proteins]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Carbohydrates/Polysaccharides|polysaccharides]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids|lipids]]), their monomeric units ([[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acids]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid|nucleic acids]], nucleotides) and important reactions involving them.

Biochemistry is interlinked between Biology and [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemistry|Chemistry]]. Biology is the study of the cell’s interaction within its environment. [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemistry|Chemistry]] takes these interactions and breaks it down to the molecular level and provides information on how these events occur. Structure is defined by how a system is composed. It is the way in which parts are arranged or put together to form the whole. As a result, when these two subjects are fused, Biochemistry and Structure, the subject known as Structural Biochemistry comes into being. Structural Biochemistry forms the basis of the molecular parts via interactions such  [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Hydrogen bonds|hydrogen]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Ionic interaction|ionic]], and [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Covalent bonds|covalent bonding]] that form the cellular structure.

==Structural Biochemistry==

'''Structural biochemistry''' is a study of various macromolecules and how their structure is appropriate to their functions. [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Types of Macromolecules|Macromolecules]] studied in structural biochemistry courses that consists of [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|proteins]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Carbohydrates|carbohydrates]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids|lipids]], and nucleotides. They cover everything from the multitude of functions that proteins participate in (such as transport of molecules, cytoskeleton formation, and cell growth) to the building blocks of [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/DNA|DNA]], and even to the catalytic mechanism of different [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzyme]]. All [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Types of Macromolecules|macromolecules]] in general contribute to the survival of humans, as well as to the composition of inanimate objects. 

Another way to define structural biochemistry is by stating that it is the scientific study of the biochemical systems of life and living organisms; it is about biological molecules that construct chemical forms, and the close correlation between structure and function. Furthermore, biochemistry applies chemistry to biological studies at the cellular and molecular level. It surfaces as a distinct category at the turn of the 20th century, as scientists combined chemistry, physiology, and biology to explore the chemistry of living environments and systems. Using this field, biochemical scientists have been attempting to understand and explain the many chemical mechanisms and biological structures shared by living organisms, and to formulate some basic organizing principles shared by all forms of life as well.

Today, biochemistry is considered as the study of life in its chemical processes; the study of both a life science and a chemical science. It investigates the chemistry of living organisms and the molecular basis for the alteration happening in the living cells. It uses the schemes of [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemistry|Chemistry]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Physics|Physics]], molecular biology and [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Immunology; Another Approach toward Protein Investigation|immunology]] to study the structure and behavior of the complex molecules found in biological material such as [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acids]] in a protein, a large organic compound.  Along those lines, it also explores the ways these molecules interact to form cells, tissues, and whole organisms. The biochemist seeks to determine how specific molecules such as [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme Catalytic Mechanism/Protein Function|protein]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid|nucleic acids]]
, [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids|lipids]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemistry of important organic molecules in Biochemistry/Vitamins and Cofactors|vitamins]], and hormones function in such processes. Particular emphasis is placed on regulation of the chemical reactions in the living cells. 

Biochemistry has become the foundation for understanding all biological processes. It has presented explanations for the sources of many diseases in humans, animals, and plants alike through laboratory techniques such as [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Purification/High Pressure Liquid chromatography|chromatography]], and [[Structural Biochemistry/Protein sequence determination techniques/Mass Spectroscopy|spectroscopy]]. It can frequently propose ways by which such diseases may be treated or cured. Because biochemistry community is interested in unraveling the complex chemical reactions that occur in a wide variety of life forms, it offers the basis for practical advances in [[Structural Biochemistry/Medicine &amp; Drug Design|medicine]], veterinary medicine, agriculture, and biotechnology. It also includes such exciting new fields as molecular genetics and bioengineering. The knowledge and methods developed by biochemists are applied to in all fields of medicine, for example, in agriculture and in many chemical and health related industries. The structural biochemistry helped to fight the AIDS epidemic because the structure of HIV protease, which should be blocked in order to prevent virus spreading, could be used as a reference to determine the types of molecules that might block the enzyme. Also, it helped patients with arthritis through the study of painkillers such as ibuprofen at the molecular level and by creating a new painkiller to shut down COX-2 so that ulcers would not form, and therefore prevent the side effects.

Biochemistry is also unique in providing education and research in protein structure or function and genetic engineering, the two basic components of the rapidly expanding field of biotechnology.  As the broadest of the basic sciences, biochemistry includes many subspecialties such as neurochemistry, bioorganic chemistry, clinical biochemistry, physical biochemistry, molecular genetics, biochemical pharmacology, and immunochemistry.

== Distinguishing Features of Living Organisms ==

** &lt;b&gt;Complex Internal Structures, there is a high degree of chemical complexity and microscopic organization.&lt;/b&gt; Thousands of molecules allow cells to maintain a very intricate internal structure, which include long polymers, each with characteristic sequences of subunits, its unique 3D structure and specific selection of binding sites.
**&lt;b&gt;Systems are able to maintain equilibrium by extracting, transforming and using energy from the environment.&lt;/b&gt; This enables organisms to do mechanical, chemical and osmotic work.
**&lt;b&gt;Reproduction, with defined function of organism's components, organisms are interacting with one another&lt;/b&gt; The interplay between organism have allowed changed in components that cause coordination and compensation to necessary adaptation to environment.
**&lt;b&gt;Mechanisms for sensing and responding to alterations in organism environments&lt;/b&gt; A constant adjusting of internal chemistry in order to adapt to change in their local environment for better survival.
**&lt;b&gt;Ability for precise self-replication and self-assembly&lt;/b&gt;Construction of entirely complete genetic material in each and every individual cell unique to the organism.
**&lt;b&gt;A capability to evolve over time &lt;/b&gt; This fundamental unity of the living organism is reflected at the molecular level in similarities of gene sequences and protein structures.

This template is used to show a table of questions with answers in the print version of the [[Spanish by Choice]] wikibook. It is used like this:

&lt;pre&gt;{{SbcQuestionPrint
| &lt;question1&gt; | &lt;answer1&gt;
| &lt;question2&gt; | &lt;answer2&gt;
...
| &lt;question20&gt; | &lt;answer20&gt;
}}&lt;/pre&gt;

While you can specify less than 20 question answer pairs, it is not possible to specify more than 20 pairs. This template is usually used together with [[Template:SbcQuestion]] for the normal version.

      <text xml:space="preserve">For a long time, up until about the 1960s, those who were deaf were taught to [[w:speechread|speechread]], often being banned from using visual language in residential schools. Signed languages were not seen as proper languages; it was thought they were highly [[w:Iconicity|iconic]] systems of [[w:Gesture|gesture]] or [[w:Mime artist|mime]].

However, that is not the case. Beginning with the work of [[w:William Stokoe|William Stokoe]] in the 1960s, it was discovered that signed languages (in this case, American Sign Language) has properties corresponding to those of spoken language. Both spoken and signed languages have
;[[w:Phonology|Phonology]]:In spoken languages, this refers to the smallest units of meaningful sound, and their characteristics. In signed languages, it refers to the smallest units of meaningful sign, and their characteristics.
;[[w:Morphology (linguistics)|Morphology]]:The smallest units of meaning. The word &quot;dog&quot; is one morpheme (it cannot be subdivided into smaller units of meaning) but three phonemes (&lt;code&gt;/d/&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/ɑ/&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;/ɡ/&lt;/code&gt;).
;[[w:Semantics|Semantics]]:The meaning imparted by the arbitrary symbols of language.
;[[w:Syntax|Syntax]]:The rules for combining morphemes into correctly-formed sentences.
;[[w:Pragmatics|Pragmatics]]:The social rules for using language. For example, it is often considered taboo to curse in the presence of females.

Recent research has revealed more of ASL's complexity, confirming time and again that it is a natural language.

So, American Sign Language is a true language, just like any of the spoken languages you are familiar with. However, contrary to popular belief, sign language is not international. Wherever communities of deaf people exist, sign languages develop. Before ASL was recognized as a real language, deaf students were often sent to residential schools where they were banned from using signed languages. Nevertheless, children would create their own sign languages with arbitrary symbols, rich grammar. Similarly, there are many examples of families creating their own sign language to communicate with deaf children. Finally, the case of [[w:Martha's Vineyard Sign Language|Martha's Vineyard Sign Language]] is a well known example of a signed language spontaneously developing out of need.

As with spoken languages, signed languages vary from country to country, and are not based on the spoken language in the country of origin. Like spoken languages, they developed over long periods of time, and are constantly changing. They continue to do so today.

American Sign Language is the dominant sign language in the United States, Canada and parts of Mexico, as well as smaller populations throughout the rest of the world - however it is ''not'' universal. Even in other English-speaking countries like Britain, ASL is not used. In Britain, BSL ([[w:British Sign Language|British Sign Language]]) is used, and is unintelligible to ASL signers and vice versa. ASL is more closely related to LSF ([[w:French Sign Language|Langue des Signes Française]]) for historical reasons.

American Sign Language is usually abbreviated ASL (it is rarely referred to as Ameslan as well). As with other sign languages, its grammar and syntax are separate and distinct from the spoken language(s) spoken in its area of influence. Its origins have been traced to the turn of the 19th Century and include French Sign Language and the sign language of the residents of Martha's Vineyard. Since there is no commonly-used written form of ASL, there may be other underdocumented influences on the language.

Although it often seems as though the signs are meaningful of themselves, in fact they are as arbitrary as words in spoken language. For example, hearing children often make the mistake of using &quot;you&quot; to refer to themselves, since others refer to them as &quot;you.&quot; Children who acquire the sign &lt;code&gt;YOU&lt;/code&gt; (pointing at one's interlocutor) make similar mistakes - they will point at others to mean themselves, indicating that even something as seemingly explicit as pointing is an arbitrary sign in ASL, like words in a spoken language.

This template can be used to graphically show how to make words using the manual alphabet:

&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{Manual_letters|L|I|K|E| |T|H|I|S}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Which generates:
{{Manual_letters|L|I|K|E| |T|H|I|S}}
The letters must be in all caps, and the template can handle up to 15 letters.  If you need more letters, you should use a new line anyhow - just use the template again on the next line.

      <comment>/* XForms */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Standing on the Shoulders of Giants ==
The XRX architecture did not appear overnight.  It was only made possible by the diligent work of many standards organizations over many years.  Clearly the XML standard is one that enabled most of the key technologies.  But the role of HTML, HTTP, CSS, XPath, XML Schema, XSLT, XForms, REST, Schematron and XQuery and other standards created by the W3C really must be appreciated to understand the true scope of the standardization efforts.  Here is a brief overview of these technologies and a rough order that they were created and could be learned.

== XML Syntax ==
The syntax of using &quot;less than&quot; and &quot;greater than&quot; characters to bracket data elements embedded in a text document goes back to early markup languages such as SGML.  SGML was the language that the HTML standard was modeled on.  SGML was a complex standard that required the user to be familiar with many technologies, so in 1997 an effort was made to simplify the standard and the XML standard was first published by the W3C.

== XPath ==
The XPath language is a smaller data-selection language that is used extensively within other XML standards.  Both our client technology (XForms) and our server technology (XQuery) heavily depend on using XPath to surgically remove the elements we want from much larger XML tree structures.  If you are familiar with UNIX or web file system paths you may already have a good mental model for how XPath expressions work.  For the purposes of this book we will be using mostly very simple XPath expressions that merely narrow XML data sets using &quot;child&quot; paths and &quot;where&quot; paths called predicates.

== XForms ==
Although this wikibook is not intended to be a book on XForms, the use of XForms makes client application development very consistent with the rest of the material in this book.  We will cover just enough background to help you understand the key architectural features of XForms and how it leverages REST interfaces to get and submit data to the server.  Technically you can still benefit from the XRX architecture without using any XForms applications on the client but you may find that you duplicate most of the components that are already in XForms when you do this.  Central to the concepts in XForms are the MVC architecture, Binding, the dependency graph and declarative submission elements.  If you are a fan of JavaScript and AJAX, you can implement much of the functionality of XForms using these tools.  But this topic is not covered in this wikibook.  In fact many people use XRX architecture specifically to avoid having to learn JavaScript and the myriad of JavaScript frameworks that are popular today.

== XQuery ==
Anyone who is familiar with the SQL language understands the role of the SELECT statement in selecting the appropriate tables, columns and rows from a relational database.  XQuery on the surface may seem only like a version of SQL for XML databases.  Because XQuery can be easily extended, however, it has taken on a much larger role then just a reporting language for XML databases. XQuery may be the only server language that a developer will ever need.  Because it can be easily extended, it has already been extended in hundreds of useful ways.

The first major extension has been the ability of XQuery to update XML data.  This was considered important to the original XQuery authors, but they decided to focus on data selection first and data updating second.

== CSS ==
One of the most elegant aspects of the XForms model is that it was designed from the ground up to work with the W3C's Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) standard.  Thus, almost every aspect of how web application controls are arranged on the screen can be managed by a single site-wide CSS file.  The consequence is that if you decide to make a site-wide change, only a single file needs to be altered.  The downside is that the level of CSS support varies dramatically in many browsers.  Since XForms is implemented as a separate namespace and CSS is designed to be namespace aware, most modern style sheets for XForms leverage this basic feature.  The challenge is that not all browsers have implemented the CSS namespace functionality.  This issue is complex and any XRX architecture that is building applications to support older browsers must take these caveats into consideration.

&lt;center&gt;&lt;h3&gt;Welcome to the book on Audacity!&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;/center&gt;

Audacity is a free and open-source audio editing and recording program. It allows you to record live audio, convert tapes and records into digital recordings, edit Ogg Vorbis, MP3, WAV or AIFF files, edit or mix sounds together, change the speed of recording, add effects and many other things.

Audacity's initial release was in May of 2000. Since then, it has won the SourceForge.net 2007 Community Choice Award for Best Project for Multimedia, and as of 3 May 2009 is 6th most downloaded application there.

=== Feature Overview ===
Since the first release of Audacity, the list of features is growing. Here is a list of some of them:

* Importing and exporting of Ogg Vorbis, WAV, AIFF, MP3 (via LAME), all formats supported by libsndfile and since 1.3.2 also FLAC
* Sound recording and playing
* Editing using cut, copy, paste with unlimited undo history
* Multi-track mixing
* A large array of digital effects and plug-ins, with possibility of writing you own using [[w:Nyquist (programming language)|Nyquist]]
* Amplitude envelope editing and noise removal
* Support for multi-channel modes with sampling rates up to 96 kHz with 24 bits per sample

This just looks like advertising for commercial software, not a book. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 11:56, 24 August 2008 (UTC)
*{{keep}}. Although this isn't firm. We can have pages and books here about proprietary software, think about Microsoft Office. If the tool is genuinely useful for the purposes at hand, and if it's both common and popular, we likely should have a book describing it's use. If this is not the case, maybe it should be deleted. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:58, 24 August 2008 (UTC)
*[[Image:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment'''. I think we will have difficulty in assessing how useful or popular the software itself really is, as few of us here will have used the tool(s). I am only basing my view on the material in the wikibook, which at present seems little different from a publicity brochure. I would be more persuaded that the book had potential to grow into something useful if the authors gave a plan for the contents showing the educational material they intend to provide. As it is a new book perhaps we could give it more time to develop, while at the same time steering the authors in the right direction. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 21:11, 24 August 2008 (UTC)
* [[Image:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' This isn't a book, rather a page within a book about &quot;Computer Aided Translation&quot; tools. Some other pages also read like brochures right now and others have a bit more to offer. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 22:06, 24 August 2008 (UTC)
*[[Image:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' - The current content is little more than talking points off a brochure. However, there is no reason we can't have a book on this topic. Like RR, I'd be happier to keep this if there were some plan for the book's scope and organization. I've emailed the author; perhaps they can provide information to help us decide what action to take here, if any. &amp;nbsp;'''&amp;mdash;&amp;nbsp;[[User:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;b style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;Mike.lifeguard&lt;/b&gt;]]'''&amp;nbsp;&amp;#124;&amp;nbsp;&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Mike.lifeguard|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#309;&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:55, 2 September 2008 (UTC)
*{{keep}}. When dealing with commercial (or other for profit subjects) the only requirement that I think we should have is that in respect to projects, that they don't serve as simple advertisements. In subpages (like this one), links or references, if in context to the book, I see no reason to discriminate and prevent people from adding useful information.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 16:32, 2 September 2008 (UTC)
*{{keep}}. The page do not seems to contain many promotional information and in fact we have to be fair on this issue. I.E. if we consider this page of no use, we should delete other similar product pages such as SDL Trados, which obviously contained typical promotional style of texts like &quot;is the world's most popular.... It provides industry standard technology to accelerate the translation process, ...is of the highest standard.&quot;. Or, if we really don't want this style of page to exist, we should give clear instruction to the composers of all similar pages what kind of information we prefer them to offer on such pages. Again, we just have to be fair. --[[User:john_zhu|John]] ([[User talk:john_zhu|talk]]) 01:44, 4 September 2008 (UTC)
*:[[Image:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''' Things like &quot;the world's most popular&quot; and &quot;is of the highest standard&quot; probably should be removed from all pages as being promotional, violating NPOV, factually inaccurate, and/or as not being educationally usefully, but those are things that can be easily fixed and does not require a solution as extreme as deletion. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:25, 4 September 2008 (UTC)
*{{comment}} I think John Zhu puts forward some reasonable arguments for his book/pages. Now he is part of this discussion, it would be nice to hear some more about his plans for the educational content. Also, I don't know if he is connected with this Singaporean company who make the software, but if somebody were so connected would that have any implications for the licensing of the material? For example if a person employed by the company provides material, wouldn't that require the company to formally waive their rights over the work of their employee? (Others might like to comment.) [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 16:59, 6 September 2008 (UTC)
*{{comment}} I find it rather strange that John Zhu has not come forward with any further justification of his book/pages. This leads me to the conclusion that he probably is closely connected with or employed by the company who sell the software and has no intention to develop the material any further than its present incarnation as a piece of commercial advertising. However, I am quite willing to be proved wrong in this, if any evidence to the contrary were to be produced. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|talk]]) 21:31, 13 September 2008 (UTC)
*{{comment}} John Zhu is an employee of the tool maker. He works for Heartsome Technologies Ltd.

      <comment>clean up, typos fixed: imperceptable → imperceptible using [[Project:AWB|AWB]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This howto is sort of a combination of two very helpful posts, both by SA regarding finding where an engine is generally happy.

[http://forum.aempower.com/forum/index.php?topic=10624.30 (injector phasing)]
[http://forum.aempower.com/forum/index.php?topic=6143.60 (optimum AFR)]

Ideally this test should be run on a dyno under a constant load but you can still get pretty good results without one.

Steps (all performed at closed throttle):

# Disable Idle FB
# Use the idle tables to force the idle speed up to ~1000 RPM
# Log parameters Engine Speed, Engine Load, Fuel Inj #01 Open, and optionally AFR at the fastest rate.
# Open injector phasing, set the 3 RPM breakpoints nearest 1000 RPM to 0 degrees in the advance table (typically 500, 1000, and 1500) for all loads
# View the parameter Fuel Inj #01 Open so you see roughly how it corresponds to Injector Phase
# Set the injector phase below what your basemap indicates by a few teeth
# Start logging data
# Increase the Injector Phase teeth step by step (I started with .25 increments) until you're well above the basemap's phase setting (I went from 5 to 9 teeth on my 24 tooth, base was 7).  Remember to hit &lt;enter&gt; after specifying the next increment.
# While you change the phase, the engine RPM should first start to increase.  It will hit a peak then it will start to fall off again.  It may be very slight and almost imperceptible, but the logs should make it obvious.
# Stop logging.

Look at the data.  Now there's a lot of assumptions that have to made here...there's nothing wrong with the engine, the ignition system is functioning correctly, etc., etc.

In general, with no influence from the IAC system, your engine RPM should peak and your manifold pressure (Engine Load) should drop at the best Injector Phase.  In order to see the fine detail you'll probably have to set your logging view to a smaller scale -- like 900 min / 1200 max for RPM, and -11psi min / -9psi max for engine load for example.  The two should peak and dip (respectively) near the same place.  Note the Fuel Inj #01 Open setting at this spot and set the injector phase to achieve this same number.

You can repeat this process with a smaller tooth window for finer detail.  I did from 8-9 teeth at .1 increments and then 8.8 to 9.2 in .05 increments.

This will give you a baseline injector phase for 1000RPM at 0 degrees and give you room in both directions for injector advance and retard, although you'll probably just be retarding only for 500 rpm and advancing from here up the RPM range.

Next do the same process at ~2000 RPM and instead of adjusting the Injector Phase teeth, adjust the injector phase table values for 2000 RPM (along with the nearest RPM breakpoints -- usually 1500 and 2500).  You'll also need to change your logging parameters to watch Inj Advance rather than Fuel Inj #01 Open.  You don't need to test more than 0-100 degrees of advance for the 2000RPM mark.

Once these two points are adequate you can extrapolate up and down from the 1000 and 2000 RPM breakpoints to get a good advance map according to what the engine has told you it wants.  Keep in mind, phasing makes little difference in high RPMs because of increased duty cycle.  But I mostly did this to help with low RPM throttle response. It's additional side effects include easier starting and smoother
idle. 

I did cheat a little on additionally sloping advance upward as engine load increases (to compensate for longer injector pulsewidth) by using some math and a spreadsheet because I don't have an easy way of loading the engine at those test speeds standing still (besides turning on my A/C)  tongue  Most of that stuff can be found in the Injector Phasing sticky at the top of this forum.

[[File:Endergonic.jpg|right|350px|endergonic reaction]] 

An '''endergonic reaction''' refers to a chemical reaction in which energy is being used in the overall reaction, making the reaction non-spontaneous and thermodynamiacally unfavorable. Energy is being absorbed as the reaction proceeds, and there is a net loss of energy in the surrounding system. Due to this consumption of energy, standard change in [[Structural Biochemistry/Free energy|Gibbs free energy]]''' (ΔG)''' is a positive value under constant pressure and temperature: '''ΔG° &gt; 0'''.

The magnitude of ΔG also represents the quantity of energy required to drive the reaction. If a chemical process is  [[Structural Biochemistry/Exergonic reaction|exergonic]] in one direction, then the reverse process must be endergonic. Plants get the required energy to make sugar from the environment by capturing light and converting it into chemical energy that can be used for other processes.


Some examples of endergonic reactions are muscle contractions and protein synthesis.

The equilibrium constant of endergonic reaction where ΔG° &gt; 0 is less than 1: '''K &lt; 1'''.

Endergonic reactions require an input of energy, usually larger than those of non spontaneous [[Structural Biochemistry/Exergonic reaction|exergonic reactions]], from an outside source to disturb the chemical equilibrium to cause changes, such as bond formation. This input of energy is called the '''activation energy'''. In certain reactions, a '''catalyst''' is available to speed up endergonic reactions. A catalyst can lower the activation energy barrier for the reaction. Thus, it speeds up the reaction process. The energy for an endergonic reaction is obtained by coupling the reaction with an exergonic reaction.

A familiar example of coupling exergonic reactions to endergonic reactions to promote spontaneity comes from ATP. ATP powers cellular work by coupling exergonic reactions to endergonic reactions. It is responsible for mediating most energy coupling in cells, and in most cases, acts as the immediate source of energy that powers cellular work. The synthesis of the amino acid glutamine from glutamic acid and ammonia is naturally endergonic and non spontaneous with a ΔG value of +3.4 kcal/mol but coupling this reaction with the exergonic process of ATP hydrolysis, -7.3 kcal/mol, will drive the reaction forward, making it spontaneous. In the same sense, a exergonic reaction must be coupled with the formation of ATP from ADP in order to make the reaction spontaneous and in most cases, cellular respiration provides the energy for the endergonic process of making ATP and plants use light energy, instead, to produce ATP. 


An endergonic reaction can simply be understood by studying the following situation.
In a chemical reaction, the reactants make products and an equilibrium is reached. An endergonic reaction is one where more products are made from the equilibrium amount by disturbing the equilibrium with a form of energy. For example, heat will be absorbed into the system and the equilibrium will shift to the right (towards product side). Consequently, more products will be formed.

==Summary==

An endergonic reaction:
*The free energy of initial state &lt; free energy of final state
*Energy needs to be put into the system in order to go from the initial start to the final state
*+G

[[File:Exergonic.jpg|right|350px|exergonic reaction]]

An '''exergonic reaction''' refers to a reaction where energy is released. Because the reactants lose energy (G decreases), Gibbs free energy (ΔG) is negative under constant temperature and pressure. These reactions usually do not require energy to proceed, and therefore occur spontaneously. In a chemical reaction, breaking and forming bonds between atoms is a form of energy. Since chemical reactions mainly consist of forming and/or breaking chemical bonds, exergonic reactions release energy by breaking less stable chemical bonds and forming more stable bonds.
The example of exergonic reactions occur in our body is cellular respiration: C6H12O6 (glucose) + 6 O2 -&gt; 6 CO2 + 6 H2O this reaction release energy which is used for cell activities. 


However, some exergonic reactions do not occur spontaneously and require a small input of energy to start the reaction. This input of energy is called '''activation energy'''. Once the activation energy requirement is fulfilled by an outside source, the reaction proceeds to break bonds and release more energy than was needed to start the reaction. This results in a net gain in energy in the surrounding system, and a net loss in energy from the reaction system; hence, the change in '''Gibbs free energy (ΔG)]''' is '''negative (ΔG &lt; 0)'''. A negative ΔG denotes that the reaction is '''spontaneous''' and '''thermodynamically favorable'''.
{{wikipedia|Gibbs free energy}}

Here is an endergonic reactions of ATP give energy.
First Breaking down the ATP formed ADP and Pi is an ecergonic reaction, wheat Delta G is less than 0. However, by combining the reaction glucose+Pi ---&gt; glucose 6-phosphate, a thermodynamically unfavorable reaction. The cell can drive an endergonic reaction.

==Conclusion==

[[File:Exergonic.png|thumbnail]]

Exergonic reaction is &lt;br /&gt;
*Free energy of final state &lt; free energy of initial state &lt;br /&gt;
*Free energy is free during the reaction&lt;br /&gt;
*The energy can be used to do biological work&lt;br /&gt;
*Able to work in spontaneous reaction&lt;br /&gt;
*doesn’t have to occur in great rate which is where the enzyme comes in&lt;br /&gt;
*-G (negative number) &lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Background and Definition==
Depth-first search is an algorithm used to find information represented in a graphical format. The first version of depth-first search, originally called Tremaux’s algorithm, was designed as a means of solving mazes in the nineteenth century (Stewart, 1999).  [The] “theoretical properties of  Tremaux’s maze solving method,” however, where not discovered in the field of computer science until 1970 when John Hopcroft and Robert Tarjan collaborated, using depth-first search to “obtain linear time algorithms” (Tarjan, 1972, p.  146).

An algorithm, a word originally coined by mathematician Mohammed ibn-Musa al-Khwarizmi in the late 700s CE, is a procedure or formula used to find a solution to a problem (Berardi, Kroon, McDermott &amp; Newton, 2006). Algorithms work with various inputs; these inputs often vary in the amount of information they contain. A good algorithm must be able to efficiently organize input of any length into basic functional steps that can be stored in the memory of the program (“PC”, 2008).
Hopcroft and Trajan’s linear time algorithms equalized the size of the input to the amount of resources and time spent by the program to solve a particular problem (Tarjan, 1972). 

The depth-first search algorithm is used to vertically traverse nodes of information of a graph formatted in a tree structure.  Beginning with a single node at the top of the graph, the search moves to each subsequent node, vertically, starting with the left-most side of the tree structure until the search reaches the bottom-most node of the tree structure. The search does not move horizontally from left to right until the search of each node on one segment of the tree structure is complete (Siek &amp; Lee, 2000).

One of the most important features for a depth-first search is the ability to keep track of the nodes that have already been visited. The following pseudocode allows for this feature.

&lt;pre&gt;
DFS(u):

visit(u);
time = time + 1;
d[u] = time;
color[u] = grey;

for all nodes v adjacent to u do
   if color[v] == white then
      p[v] = u;
       DFS(u);


time = time + 1;
f[u] = time;
color[u] = black;
&lt;/pre&gt;

Created by Kravitz, David and Lafferty (1997) this pseudocode shows how a depth first search algorithm works by efficiently keeping track of the nodes already visited and the nodes still left to explore. Kravitz et al. made each node to be explored white, each node being explored grey, and each node that had been explored black. The color coding of the nodes allows the user the track the progress of the search algorithm as well as keeping an accurate data map of which nodes have already been stored.
The first line in the code initializes the depth first search, starting with the left most tree segment on the graph.

 DFS(u):

This block of code allows the search engine to visit every node on the left most tree segment of the tree structure, turning the nodes from white to grey as they are searched one time.

&lt;pre&gt;
visit(u);
time = time + 1;
d[u] = time;
color[u] = grey;
&lt;/pre&gt;

This block of code moves the search across the tree structure horizontally, from left to right once every node on the left side of the tree structure has been searched once. In other words, the algorithm moves toward the white nodes. When the algorithm is done searching a node, the node is turned black, and the algorithm cannot re-search that node again.

&lt;pre&gt;
for all nodes v adjacent to u do
   if color[v] == white then
      p[v] = u;
       DFS(u);


time = time + 1;
f[u] = time;
color[u] = black;
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Practical Application==
One practical application for depth-first search is “an algorithm to determine whether a graph is planar”  (“Graph,” 2008). Basically a planar graph can be drawn in a plane without graph edges crossing (Weisstein, 2008). Depth-first search enables the user to organize the information represented in the graph “by post-order traversal of the tree [structure]” (“Planar,” 2008). In other words, depth-first search gives the user the ability to decide the order they want to “embed back edges from” the first node to each following node. If, during this process, the user decides that a certain grouping of nodes have potential  connections to other nodes not presently represented on the tree structure graph, then the user will know that that particular tree segment must  “be kept on the external face” of the planar graph (“Planar,” 2008).

===Problem===
In depth-first search “each node has two times associated with it: the discovery time and the finish time” (Kravitz, David &amp; Lafferty, 1997). If the search parameter is large (i.e., a large amount of nodes) then “the storage required for all of these times becomes” quickly unmanageable (Kravitz, David &amp; Lafferty, 1997).

= Question 1 =

Find the names of experiments performed by Prof. Pain after Jan 1, 2004.

== Answer ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT name
FROM Experiments
WHERE whoperformed = 'Prof. Pain'
AND date &gt; '2004-01-01';
&lt;/source&gt;


= Question 2 =

Find the names of genes that were either positively expressed twofold or more with a significance of at least 1.0, in some experiment, or negatively expressed twofold or less with a significance of at least 1.0, in some experiment. List them alongside their organisms in a two-column format.

== Answer ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT Genes.gid, name, level, significance
FROM Expression, Genes
WHERE Expression.gid = Genes.gid
AND significance &gt;= 1.0
AND (level &gt;= 2.0 OR level &lt;= 2.0);
&lt;/source&gt;

= Question 3 =

What is the grandparent category of 'glycine binding'?

== Answer ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT Parents.parent_category
FROM GOTree as Children, GOTree as Parents
WHERE Children.category = 'glycine binding'
AND Children.parent_category = Parents.category;
&lt;/source&gt;

= Question 4 =

Find the names of experiments that were performed before some Gasch experiment.

== Straightforward Answer ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT E1.name
FROM Experiments AS E1, Experiments AS E2
WHERE E1.date &lt; E2.date
AND E2.whoperformed = 'Gasch';
&lt;/source&gt;

== Subquery Answer ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT name
FROM Experiments
WHERE Experiments.date &lt; (
    SELECT MAX(date)
    FROM Experiments
    WHERE whoperformed = 'Gasch'
);
&lt;/source&gt;

= Question 5 =

Find the names of pine genes that were positively expressed more than 0.5-fold (with a significance of 1.0 or more) in at least two experiments. 

== Straightforward Answer ==

First, we must find the experiments where genes are upreglated and significant.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE VIEW Upregulated AS
SELECT gid, experimentid
FROM Expression
WHERE significance &gt;= 1.0
AND level &gt;= 0.5;
&lt;/source&gt;

Next, we must determine the genes which were upregulated in at least two experiments. We do this by taking the product of the upregulated genes and selecting rows where the gene ID is the same but the experiment ID is different.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE VIEW UpInTwoOrMore AS
SELECT DISTINCT U1.gid AS gid
FROM Upregulated AS U1, Upregulated AS U2
WHERE U1.gid = U2.gid
AND U1.experimentid &lt;&gt; U2.experimentid;
&lt;/source&gt;

Finally, we determine which of these genes come from pine, and project their names.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT name
FROM Genes, UpInTwoOrMore
WHERE Genes.gid = UpInTwoOrMore.gid
AND organism = 'pine';
&lt;/source&gt;

We can alternatively do these steps all in one single query:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT DISTINCT name
FROM Genes, Expression as E1, Expression as E2
WHERE Genes.gid = E1.gid
AND E1.gid = E2.gid
AND E1.level &gt;= 0.5
AND E2.level &gt;= 0.5
AND E1.significance &gt;= 1.0
AND E2.significance &gt;= 1.0
AND E1.experimentid &lt;&gt; E2.experimentid
AND organism = 'pine';
&lt;/source&gt;

== Subquery Answer ==

As another approach, we can make use of subqueries to find the answer. The key to this is to make a '''correlated subquery''' where the subquery depends on some property (in this case the gene ID) of the parent query. Note that we'll still need to make use of the &lt;tt&gt;Upregulated&lt;/tt&gt; view created above to reduce code redundancy.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT DISTINCT name
FROM Genes, Upregulated as U1
WHERE Genes.gid = U1.gid
AND organism = 'pine'
AND U1.gid = (
    SELECT DISTINCT U1.gid
    FROM Upregulated as U2
    WHERE U1.gid = U2.gid
    AND U1.experimentid &lt;&gt; U2.experimentid
);
&lt;/source&gt;

== GROUP BY Answer ==

We can make use of advanced features for certain database systems such as PostgreSQL and MySQL to make these queries in slightly more convenient ways via the &lt;tt&gt;GROUP BY&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;COUNT&lt;/tt&gt;.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE VIEW UpInTwoOrMore AS
SELECT gid
FROM Expression
WHERE level &gt;= 0.5
AND significance &gt;= 1.0
GROUP BY gid
HAVING COUNT(*) &gt; 1;

SELECT name
FROM Genes, UpInTwoOrMore
WHERE Genes.gid = UpInTwoOrMore.gid
AND organism = 'pine';
&lt;/source&gt;

= Question 6 =

Find the names of pine genes that were up-regulated 0.5-fold or more (with a significance of 1.0 or more) in at least three experiments.

== Straightforward Answer ==

Similar to the answer for question 5. The caveat here is that while the equality evaluations are transitive, while inequality evaluations are not, and so every case must be covered.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE VIEW UpInThreeOrMore AS
SELECT DISTINCT U1.gid AS gid
FROM Upregulated AS U1, Upregulated AS U2, Upregulated as U3
WHERE U1.gid = U2.gid
AND U1.gid = U3.gid
AND U1.experimentid &lt;&gt; U2.experimentid
AND U1.experimentid &lt;&gt; U3.experimentid
AND U2.experimentid &lt;&gt; U3.experimentid;

SELECT name
FROM Genes, UpInThreeOrMore
WHERE Genes.gid = UpInThreeOrMore.gid
AND organism = 'pine';
&lt;/source&gt;

Alternatively:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT DISTINCT name
FROM Genes, Expression as E1, Expression as E2, Expression as E3
WHERE Genes.gid = E1.gid
AND E1.gid = E2.gid
AND E1.gid = E3.gid
AND E1.level &gt;= 0.5
AND E2.level &gt;= 0.5
AND E3.level &gt;= 0.5
AND E1.significance &gt;= 1.0
AND E2.significance &gt;= 1.0
AND E3.significance &gt;= 1.0
AND E1.experimentid &lt;&gt; E2.experimentid
AND E1.experimentid &lt;&gt; E3.experimentid
AND E2.experimentid &lt;&gt; E3.experimentid
AND organism = 'pine';
&lt;/source&gt;

== Subquery Answer ==

We need to build in another correlated subquery for our original correlated subquery to make this work.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT DISTINCT name
FROM Genes, Upregulated AS U1
WHERE Genes.gid = U1.gid
AND organism = 'pine'
AND U1.gid = (
    SELECT DISTINCT U1.gid
    FROM Upregulated AS U2
    WHERE U1.gid = U2.gid
    AND U1.gid = (
        SELECT DISTINCT U1.gid
        FROM Upregulated AS U3
        WHERE U1.gid = U2.gid
        AND U1.gid = U3.gid
        AND U1.experimentid &lt;&gt; U2.experimentid
        AND U1.experimentid &lt;&gt; U3.experimentid
        AND U2.experimentid &lt;&gt; U3.experimentid
    )
);
&lt;/source&gt;

== GROUP BY Answer ==

Simply adjust the count evaluation.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE VIEW UpInThreeOrMore AS
SELECT gid
FROM Expression
WHERE level &gt;= 0.5
AND significance &gt;= 1.0
GROUP BY gid
HAVING COUNT(*) &gt; 2;

SELECT name
FROM Genes, UpInThreeOrMore
WHERE Genes.gid = UpInThreeOrMore.gid
AND organism = 'pine';
&lt;/source&gt;

= Question 7 =

Find the names of pine genes that were up-regulated 0.5-fold or more (with a significance of 1.0 or more) in at exactly two experiments.

== Straightforward Answer ==

The key here is identifying that taking the set of genes upregulated in two or more experiments and subtracting the set of genes upregulated in three or mor experiments gives the set of genes upregulated in precisely two experiments. Thus, our answer is the answer to question 5 subtracted by the answer to question 6.

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE VIEW UpInTwo AS
SELECT *
FROM UpInTwoOrMore
EXCEPT
SELECT *
FROM UpInThreeOrMore;

SELECT name
FROM Genes, UpInTwo
WHERE Genes.gid = UpInTwo.gid
AND organism = 'pine';
&lt;/source&gt;

Or alternatively:

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT DISTINCT name
FROM Genes, Expression as E1, Expression as E2
WHERE Genes.gid = E1.gid
AND E1.gid = E2.gid
AND E1.level &gt;= 0.5
AND E2.level &gt;= 0.5
AND E1.significance &gt;= 1.0
AND E2.significance &gt;= 1.0
AND E1.experimentid &lt;&gt; E2.experimentid
AND organism = 'pine'
EXCEPT
SELECT DISTINCT name
FROM Genes, Expression as E1, Expression as E2, Expression as E3
WHERE Genes.gid = E1.gid
AND E1.gid = E2.gid
AND E1.gid = E3.gid
AND E1.level &gt;= 0.5
AND E2.level &gt;= 0.5
AND E3.level &gt;= 0.5
AND E1.significance &gt;= 1.0
AND E2.significance &gt;= 1.0
AND E3.significance &gt;= 1.0
AND E1.experimentid &lt;&gt; E2.experimentid
AND E1.experimentid &lt;&gt; E3.experimentid
AND E2.experimentid &lt;&gt; E3.experimentid
AND organism = 'pine';
&lt;/source&gt;

== Subquery Answer ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
SELECT DISTINCT name
FROM Genes, Upregulated as U1
WHERE Genes.gid = U1.gid
AND organism = 'pine'
AND U1.gid = (
    SELECT DISTINCT U1.gid
    FROM Upregulated as U2
    WHERE U1.gid = U2.gid
    AND U1.experimentid &lt;&gt; U2.experimentid
)
EXCEPT
SELECT DISTINCT name
FROM Genes, Upregulated AS U1
WHERE Genes.gid = U1.gid
AND organism = 'pine'
AND U1.gid = (
    SELECT DISTINCT U1.gid
    FROM Upregulated AS U2
    WHERE U1.gid = U2.gid
    AND U1.gid = (
        SELECT DISTINCT U1.gid
        FROM Upregulated AS U3
        WHERE U1.gid = U2.gid
        AND U1.gid = U3.gid
        AND U1.experimentid &lt;&gt; U2.experimentid
        AND U1.experimentid &lt;&gt; U3.experimentid
        AND U2.experimentid &lt;&gt; U3.experimentid
    )
);
&lt;/source&gt;

== GROUP BY Answer ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;sql&quot;&gt;
CREATE VIEW UpInTwo AS
SELECT *
FROM UpInTwoOrMore
EXCEPT
SELECT *
FROM UpInThreeOrMore;

SELECT name
FROM Genes, UpInTwo
WHERE Genes.gid = UpInTwo.gid
AND organism = 'pine';
&lt;/source&gt;

= Question 8 =

Find the genes that showed positive expression in every experiment recorded for it.

  SELECT Expression.gid, level from Expression WHERE level&gt;1.0;

= Question 9 =

What is the name of the gene that was most positively expressed in experiment exp23? Assume a minimum significance of 1.0.

= Question 10 =

This question builds on question 8; what is the name of the gene that was &quot;second most positively expressed&quot;? Assume again a minimum significance of 1.0.

= Question 11 =

Which gene(s) were positively expressed in ALL the experiments listed in the Experiments table? No constraints on significance level.

= Question 12 =

Prepare a table of genes, their annotation, and any experiment in which they were either the highest or lowest expressed (of any significance level). Include a fourth column to say if they were the highest or lowest.

We welcome and appreciate [[Special:Contributions/82.198.250.68|your contributions]], but your recent edits to [[:GCSE Science/Rates of reaction coursework]] had to be undone.

If this was a mistake, don't worry; the text has been restored, as you can see from the page history.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I read this somewhere and I am trying to confirm it.   For example, assuming we are in Canada and own two STB's but only need one, can we pull the hard drive out of one and insert into the other as a second hard drive, to double the disk space?</text>

== !STL ==
Thanks for contributing to the C++ Programming book, in regards with [[C++ Programming/Operators/Pointers/Smart Pointers|Smart Pointers]] I have moved it out of the specific STL page into it's own. I saw the post from James and agree with it, Smart Pointers came after and are not part of the STL, a quick check pointed me to October 2001 as the date that smart pointers were first considered for adoption into the standard.&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Old Dominion University Art Department Origins'''

This book has the purpose of recording the history of the Old Dominion University Art Program.
This is an ODU Art Education student research project. ODU Art Education students are working with Richard Nickel, the Art Education Program Director, to identify and interview all current and previous faculty to discover the true origins of the ODU Art program. Students are now posting current faculty and working backwards to research and create biographies of each previous faculty in each program. As the new biographies are researched and written, they will be added to the WIKI book. 

Any current or former faculty and students may contribute to this growing wiki book.

:Hi Richard,
:[[History of the ODU Art Department]] seems to be shaping up nicely.  It looks like you have moved all the pages and fixed all the links.  Would you mind if I deleted the orphaned redirects (that is, the old copies) now that they have been properly located?  I would leave [[Oduart]] alone for a little while though, since it may have been bookmarked by your students.  The ones I propose deleting are the ones that were listed on the [[WB:VfD|Vote for Deletion]] page:
:* [[Photography at ODU]]
:* [[Art History at ODU]]
:* [[Ceramics]]
:* [[Painting]]
:* [[Printmaking]]

‎No hurry on these though.  Lemme know what you think. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 01:59, 31 October 2008 (UTC)

*0 edits, and

Since you are inactive at Wikibooks, we are considering giving your username to someone else who uses that username on other wikis. To do this, we will change your username to Fano (usurped). If you return to Wikibooks you are of course welcome to change your username again to just about anything you like. We do this to allow active users to have the same username on all the wikis we operate.

      <comment>[[Transportation Economics/Types of Goods]] moved to [[Transportation Economics/Goods]]</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Types of Goods ==

There are four types of goods that are determined by their technical characteristics concerning excludability and rivalry:

{| {{table}}
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#f0f0f0;&quot;|''''''
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#f0f0f0;&quot;|''''''
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#f0f0f0;&quot;|'''Excludability'''
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#f0f0f0;&quot;|''''''
|-
| ||||Yes||No
|-
| Rivalry||Yes||Private||“Congesting”
|-
| ||No||Club||Public
|-
| ||||||
|}

Public goods are non-excludable and non-rivalrous, 

Private goods are both excludable and rivalrous.  

Club goods (for instance a country club membership) are excludable, but non-rivalrous (in the absence of crowding).  

Congesting goods are rivalrous but not excludable, for instance a crowded street. While an individual cannot be excluded from a city street that person’s presence may cost you extra time and his occupation of space does prevent you from occupying the same space at a given time. (Note that limited access highways are potentially excludable, unlike city streets.)


=== Excludability ===
Excludability implies that the good’s provider can prevent a user from obtaining it without charge

National defense for instance is non-excludable, America’s nuclear weapons protect anyone in the country, whether or not they want it.  On the other hand the sale of anything in a store is excludable – the owner can prevent a customer from obtaining a good unless the customer pays (assuming enforceable property rights etc.).

=== Rivalry ===
Rivalry implies that one person’s consumption of a particular good prevents another individual from consuming it. 

National defense again is non-rivalrous – one person’s protection does not prevent another’s protection.  Shoes are rivalrous, only one person can wear a pair at a time.

==Creating the Scene==
*Open ''css-lr300-idle.exp''.
*Go to File&gt;Save As. Save it as ''css-lr300-reload.exp''.
*Match the scene's FPS with the QC's reload fps. (You should already know how to do this from the idle animation page.) The fps for the sg552 reload animation is 37.
*Match the scene's end frame with the SMD's end frame minus one. (103 - 1 = 102). The end frame is 102 for the sg552 reload animation.
*Find the null ''Frame''. Below the ''Parent'' button, there is a ''CnsComp'' button. Press it.
*Click the word ''Constrain'' above the ''Parent'' button, and click ''Pose''.
*Click the left hand null. Now whenever you rotate or move the hand, the gun will follow it.
*Now constrain the right arm to the left hand.
*A popup will appear. Click the green square next to the word ''Active''.

==Constraints==
You will be using more constraints in the reload animation. First think about what should be constrained. If you give up, take a look:
*Magazine constrained to support hand, while pulling the magazine in and out.
*Bolt constrained to support hand, while pulling the bolt.
*In a more general sense, constraints could be used when a hand interacts with an object.

==Setting Up Constraints==
Because these constraints will be deactivated and activated at certain times in the animation, it not feasible to leave a null without a constraint. To resolve this we will add a new null that matches the place of the original null and constrain the original null to the new null.
*Add the following nulls in the following hierarchy:
**''constraints''
***''arm_constraint''
***''magazine_constraint''
***''bolt_constraint''
*Make ValveBiped.ValveBiped the parent of ''constraints''.
{{NOTE|Press 9 to bring out the schematic view. You will need it.}}
*Select ''arm_constraint''. On the right hand panel click ''Transform'', and click ''Match All Transforms''.
*Click the supporting arm's null.
*Repeat for the magazine and bolt constraints.
*Click ''constraints'' and its children. On the right hand panel click ''Transform'', and click ''Set Neutral Pose''.
*Take some time to think. Use the analogy of couples to rationalize the constraint process. The nulls must always have a couple for these constraints to function properly.
**Right_Arm is going out with Left_Hand. It will break this bond as it leaves the gun and becomes constrained to arm_constraint. Eventually it will meet the magazine and become a couple with the magazine.
**Magazine is not going out yet. magazine_constraint will go out with it. Constrain magazine_constraint to Magazine.
**Bolt is not going out yet. bolt_constraint will go out with it. Constrain bolt_constraint to magazine.
{{Important|A popup will appear after setting a constraint. Click the green square next to the word ''Active''. This sets a key for the constraint's status.}}
*Make sure the constraints are working by rotating the trigger hand around and seeing if it makes a smooth movement.

==Animation Layers==
*Select all nulls.
*Make two animation layers -
**movement - this covers the movement that makes the animation look less robotic.
**base - this covers everything else.

==Storyboard==
*Make sure the base layer is the activate animation layer.
*Set a key for all nulls at frame 0.
*Think about the major poses in the animation. They are:
**Idle pose (already done)
**Holding the magazine
**Magazine fully taken out (do not make this pose yet, it requires a constraint)
**Hand on bolt
**Bolt pulled by hand (do not make this pose yet, it requires a constraint)
*We can store these poses in random frames of the animation and move them using the Dopesheet Editor. Later we will move the positions around and fix the interpolation using the FCurve Editor.
{{NOTE|The supporting arm is constrained already. In this case you will have to set a key for the deactivation of its constraint to the trigger hand. Click the supporting hand null. On the right hand panel click the ''Selection'' button. Expand constraints and click double click Pose Cns. Uncheck its activity and press the green square to set a key. Now constrain the supporting arm to arm_constraint.}}

== [[Clojure_Programming/Examples/REPL_Socket|Simple REPL on a Socket]] ==
Accessing a REPL over network is a very useful feature for many situations, from designing a web site to debugging a satellite in space.  [[Clojure_Programming/Examples/REPL_Socket|Here]] is an example how.

== [[Clojure_Programming/Examples/Temperature_Converter_GUI|Simple GUI : Temperature Converter]] ==

Simple example GUI application (from discussion group, updated for 20080329 release).  It is based on Swing, and you can find it [[Clojure_Programming/Examples/Temperature_Converter_GUI|here]]

== [[Clojure_Programming/Examples/Lazy_Fibonacci|Lazy Fibonacci]] ==
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number Fibonacci numbers] are a classic example of an [http://mathworld.wolfram.com/RecursiveSequence.html infinite recursive sequence].  Clojure's Lazy functions are an excellent way to implement this mathematical construct.  You can see a detailed example [[Clojure_Programming/Examples/Lazy_Fibonacci|here]].

== [[Clojure_Programming/Examples/Talking_to_Excel|Talking to Excel]] ==

Interfacing to other programs via [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Component_Object_Model COM] can be easily done in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(programming_language) Java] using the [http://sf.net/projects/jacob-project JACOB] library. However coping with all the low-level interface when talking to an application is quite tedious. Especially since the interface is designed for C not for Java, not to mention Clojure. So we will try to improve the situation a little bit using the power of Clojure.

A detailed explanation is [[Clojure_Programming/Examples/Talking_to_Excel|here]].

== [[Clojure_Programming/Examples/Creating_an_Applet|Creating an Applet]] ==

[[Clojure_Programming/Examples/Creating_an_Applet|This tutorial]] explains how to create a simple &quot;Hello World!&quot;-applet. The article also explains how you can sign your applet (if Reflection is needed).

== genclass and finalize ==

The &lt;code&gt;[http://clojure.org/api#gen-class gen-class]&lt;/code&gt;
functions provide the most general and powerful mechanism in Clojure
for defining new Java classes. If you need to implement an existing
interface you can probably use the simpler
&lt;code&gt;[http://clojure.org/api#proxy proxy]&lt;/code&gt; function
instead, but if you need to define new Java instance methods you may
need to use &lt;code&gt;[http://clojure.org/api#gen-and-load-class gen-and-load-class]&lt;/code&gt; or
&lt;code&gt;[http://clojure.org/api#gen-and-save-class gen-and-save-class]&lt;/code&gt;.

By way of a quick introduction, here is an example of a new class
named &lt;code&gt;MyClass&lt;/code&gt; in a package named &lt;code&gt;foo&lt;/code&gt;.  This
class has two methods: &lt;code&gt;mymethod&lt;/code&gt;, a standard Java
&lt;code&gt;finalize&lt;/code&gt;:

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(gen-and-load-class 'foo.MyClass
   :methods [['mymethod [String] String]
             ['finalize [] Void/TYPE]])
&lt;/source&gt;

At this point the class exists and is loaded into the JVM, but isn't
useful yet as the methods do not have definitions.  Define them like
this:

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(clojure/ns foo)

(defn MyClass-mymethod [this m]
  (str &quot;Your arg was: &quot; m))

(defn MyClass-finalize [this]
  (println &quot;Finalizing &quot; this))
&lt;/source&gt;

This class can now be used like any Java class in Clojure:

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(println (.mymethod (new foo.MyClass) &quot;foo&quot;))
&lt;/source&gt;

That example creates a new instance, calls &lt;code&gt;mymethod&lt;/code&gt;, and
prints the return value.  The &lt;code&gt;finalize&lt;/code&gt; method will
probably not be called yet, but an explicit call to the garbage
collector &lt;i&gt;may&lt;/i&gt; trigger it:

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(System/gc)
&lt;/source&gt;


== Invoking Java method through method name as a String ==
See [http://groups.google.com/group/clojure/browse_thread/thread/dad12217f7a8842d Google Groups original thread] for a more conversational approach.

Credit goes to Timothy Pratley, pmf, and  Michael Wood for helping figure this out.

&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
user=&gt; (defn str-invoke [instance method-str &amp; args]
            (clojure.lang.Reflector/invokeInstanceMethod 
                instance 
                method-str 
                (to-array args)))
#'user/str-invoke
user=&gt; (def i &quot;sampleString&quot;)(def m &quot;substring&quot;)(def args [2,3])
#'user/i
#'user/m
#'user/args
user=&gt; (apply str-invoke i m args)                              
&quot;m&quot;
user=&gt; 
&lt;/source&gt;


== Setting a Java property through property name as a String ==
&lt;source lang=lisp&gt;
(defn str-set [instance field-str arg]
    (clojure.lang.Reflector/setInstanceField
        instance 
        field-str 
        arg))
&lt;/source&gt;

Many users decide to buy Question Writer after experimenting with a free trial version.  The downloaded trial version is exactly the same as the full version, but will expire after 30 days if a license isn’t purchased. When the license is purchased you can continue using the same downloaded software – assuming that the license is for the same version that you have been trialling (Standard or Professional).  You do not need a license for the Basic Version.


When you purchase Question Writer your license will be emailed to you, usually within 1 working day of your purchase.  If your license has not arrived within a reasonable period, first check your spam.  Many email servers will not recognise the email containing the license as valid mail. If you are sure that you have not received your License get in touch with Question Writer by emailing support@questionwriter.com.

The next steps that you take will depend on which version of Question Writer you are using.

If you are using Question Writer 3 please click on this link: [[Question Writer Manual/Frequently Asked Questions/Load License/QW3|Question Writer 3 License]]

==Question Writer 4 License==

When you purchase Question Writer 4 we will send you an email with your licence file attached.  You should save this in your Question Writer 4 Program Folder.  The exact steps that you follow will depend on your operating system.

'''1. Finding your Question Writer 4 Program Folder'''&lt;br&gt;
The Question Writer Folder will have a name like

&quot;C:\Program Files\Question Writer 4&quot;

or

&quot;C:\Program Files (x86)\Question Writer 4&quot;

You can find it by opening Windows Explorer or “Documents” and looking on your C drive for &quot;Program Files&quot;, then looking down the list for &quot;Question Writer 4&quot;.  Alternatively you can search your computer for &quot;Question Writer 4&quot;.


[[File:QW4 Search.jpg|center]]


'''2. Download the license file from your email'''&lt;br&gt;
You will not be able to open this file – you need to save it instead.  

Depending on your Operating System you may be given a choice to '''Open or Save''' in which case choose '''Save''' and save the license file to your Question Writer 4 Program Folder.  

The file my be downloaded automatically to your default location – your Downloads Folder.  Again you cannot '''Open''' the file but can choose to '''Show in Folder'''. From there you can drag and drop it to your Question Writer 4 Program Folder.

[[File:QW4 Show_in_folder.png|center]]


'''3. Check that the license file is in the Program Folder'''&lt;br&gt;
You should then be able to see the license file in the Question Writer 4 Program Folder – it will have your name (or the name in which you bought your license) as part of the file name.  The full file name is: 

“Your Name – Organization Name – Question Writer 4 – Version.license”

The version will be eg Professional Academic or Standard Commercial depending on the version purchased


[[File:QW4 Program file.jpg|center]]


'''4. Select your Version'''&lt;br&gt;
When you first open Question Writer, before you open any quizzes, you will see on the menu bar the options '''File''', '''Import''', '''Language''', '''Version''' and '''Help'''.


[[File:QW Version.jpg|center]]


Click on version and select the version for which you are licensed.  Question Writer will then close. You should then restart it.  This time it will recognise your license and open the version that you have purchased.  

If you are still given the message about a the number of days left in the trial then it is most likely that either the license file is not in the Program Folder or that you have selected the wrong version eg you have selected the Professional version but only have a standard license.


Occasionally the license file sent to you will get corrupted in the mail system and you might see an error message.  If this happens get in touch with us and we will send your license again, usually in a zipped file.  See [[../License|Why do I get an error message when I try to activate my License?]]

      <text xml:space="preserve"> '''The Invention of the Steam Engine'''
The invention of the steam engine took place in 1825. The first steam engine was the &quot;Penny Darren&quot; built at Coalbrookdale, although George Stephenson created the first recognised locomotive and named it &quot;Rocket&quot;. The development of &quot;Rocket&quot; led to the recognition of the potential of railways and to the development of further steam engines, heralding the age of railway transport.

      <text xml:space="preserve">windows programming/ read from monitor memory vs write into monitor memory

Context Switching on ''processes'' not on ''programs''. State is of ''process'', context is of ''process'', the ''process'' is not a ''program''.
I think it is necessary to give a mean of a ''process'' here on page.

== &quot;Context Switching&quot; should have more detail ==

After reading the &quot;Context Switching&quot; section, I was left with a couple questions:
# How do programs allow the operating system to run?  Do compilers automatically throw in system calls to do this?
# If the processor is in user mode running a process, how does it know the thread quantum has been exceeded, and how does it tell the kernel to run context switching?
I'll research and answer them.
--[[User:Snydergd|Snydergd]] ([[User talk:Snydergd|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Snydergd|contribs]]) 13:58, 22 November 2013 (UTC)

== &quot;Context Switching&quot; - only processes but no progams? What about a program triggering a special process? ==

I agree, Snydergd. So context switching cannot concern programs, only processes? Is that so, or could it be more difficult via something like API`s. 
Admittedly the scenario sounded vaguely familiar, although, yes, that may happen to many nitwits like me.

What about this scenario, witnessing serial errors in the Windows system event logs, with Kernel issue prominently surfacing,  I had the quite possible stupid idea,
to run the most deep possible scan with the Windows Memory Diagnostic Tool. Can't remember if I ever did this before. There wasn't much about these specific error ID's on the web. Nothing vaguely helpful in the linked Windows database. I simply thought that maybe Windows could help.

Incidentally this was a Windows 7 dual boot system: Windows and Macrium Reflect. ... At one point, the scan &quot;process&quot; seemed to almost have stalled/frozen before, I suddenly found myself in Macrium Reflect, which I had mostly ignored at that point. ...expect for allowing me to safely inspect an earlier event first and deal with it mirrored back later, or so I thought. Anyway curiously enough &quot;the Program&quot;  Macrium offered me to mend a boot issue.

I hesitated for quite a while.  But when I was about to get out of the program again, I thought, well, WHY NOT. That was the end. I don't want a new installation, I am tired of that. Too easy. ...First I would like a forensic copy to learn and understand what really happened, to the extend one still can. Steep learning curve, indeed. But also a test case. ;) LeaNder22, no idea why Wikibooks does not recognize my IP. CQ Whois easily does.

== Application sees - but in Reality ==
to visualize matters is always quite helpful. Considered from this perspective, it shouldn't have offered me to do anything in that context? No? 

Yes this would lead me to two equally possible different scenarios. Maybe there are others. LeaNder</text>

= Foreword =
This first part of the wikibook Spanish by Choice (http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Spanish_by_Choice) accompanies a set of SpanishPod audio lessons for beginners without prior knowledge of Spanish (“newbies”). These audio lessons are included in the online version of this wikibook in the Ogg Vorbis format. MP3 files are available at http://spanishpod.com

This print version of the wikibook includes transcripts of the lesson dialogues with translations, vocabulary lists, lists of grammatically related words, and translation exercises based on the dialogues. Apart from the audio lessons, the online version of this wikibook also offers additional links to related Wikipedia articles and an index of all lines of the lesson dialogues.

The lessons can be studied in any order; thus, readers are free to choose lessons according to their preferences. It is not necessary to study all lessons; however, it is very recommendable to review the lessons as often as possible. Also, it is necessary to have fun while studying these lessons. Seriously!

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are a variety of types of transportation data used in analysis. Some are listed below:

* Infrastructure Status
* Traffic Counts
* Travel Behavior Inventory
* Land Use Inventory
* Truck/Freight Demand
* External/Internal Demand (by Vehicle Type)
* Special Generators

==  Revealed Preference ==


Household travel surveys which ask people what they actually did are a type of ''Revealed Preference'' survey data that have been obtained by direct observation of the choice that individuals make with respect to travel behavior. ''Travel Cost Analysis'' uses the prices of market goods to evaluate the value of goods that are not traded in the market.

''Hedonic Pricing'' uses the market price of a traded good and measures of its component attributes to calculate value. There are other methods to attain Revealed Preference information, but surveys are the most common in travel behavior.

=== Travel Behavior Inventory ===

While the Cleveland Regional Area Traffic Study in 1927 was the first metropolitan planning attempt sponsored by the US federal government, the lack of comprehensive survey methods and standards at that time precluded the systematic collection of information such as travel time, origin and destination, and traffic counts. The first US travel surveys appeared in urban areas after the Federal-Aid Highway Act of 1944 permitted the spending of federal funds on urban highways &lt;ref&gt;Weiner, Edward, (1997) http://tmip.fhwa.dot.gov/resources/clearinghouse/158 Urban Transportation Planning in the United States: An Historical Overview]. U.S. Department of Transportation. Fifth Edition. &lt;/ref&gt;. A new home- interview origin-destination survey method was developed in which households were asked about the number of trips, purpose, mode choice, origin and destination of the trips conducted on a daily basis. In 1944, the US Bureau of Public Roads printed the Manual of Procedures for Home Interview Traffic Studies. &lt;ref&gt;US Department of Commerce (1944) Manual of Procedures for Home Interview Traffic Studies. US Bureau of Public Roads. Washington, DC&lt;/ref&gt;. This new procedure was first implemented in several small to mid-size areas. Highway engineers and urban planners made use of the new data collected after the 1944 Highway Act extended federally sponsored planning to travel surveys as well as traffic counts, highway capacity studies, pavement condition studies and cost-benefit analysis.

Attributes of a household travel survey, or travel behavior inventory include:

* Travel Diary of ~ 1% sample of population (all trips made on one day) every 10 years
* Socioeconomic/demographic data of survey respondents
* Collection methodology: 
** Phone, 
** Mail, 
** In-Person at Home, 
** In-Person at Work, 
** Roadside

Many such surveys are available online at: [http://surveyarchive.org Metropolitan Travel Survey Archive]



=== Thought Question ===

What are the  advantages and disadvantages of Revealed Preference surveys?

== Stated Preference ==
In contrast with revealed preference, ''Stated preference'' is a group of techniques used to calculate the utility functions of transport options based on the response of an individual decision-maker to certain given options.  The options generally are based on descriptions of the transport scenario or are constructed by the researcher

* ''Contingent valuation'' is based on the assumption that the best way to find out the value that an individual places on something is known by asking.
* ''Compensating variation'' is the compensating payment that leaves an individual as well off as before the economic change.
* ''Equivalent variation'' for a benefit is the minimum amount of money one would have to be compensated to leave the person as well as they would be after the change.
* ''Conjoint analysis'' refers to the application of the design of experiments to obtain the preferences of the individual, breaking the task into a list of choices or ratings that enable us to compute the relative importance of each of the attributes studied

== Pavement conditions ==
''adapted from Xie, Feng and David Levinson (2008) The Use of Road Infrastructure Data for Urban Transportation Planning: Issues and Opportunities. Published in Infrastructure Reporting and Asset Management Edited by Adjo Amekudzi and Sue McNeil. pp- 93-98. Publisher: American Society of Civil Engineers, Reston, Virginia.''&lt;ref&gt;Xie, Feng and David Levinson (2008) The Use of Road Infrastructure Data for Urban Transportation Planning: Issues and Opportunities. Published in Infrastructure Reporting and Asset Management Edited by Adjo Amekudzi and Sue McNeil. pp- 93-98. Publisher: American Society of Civil Engineers, Reston, Virginia&lt;/ref&gt;

Road infrastructure represents the supply side of an urban transportation system. Pavement condition is a critical indicator to the quality of road infrastructure in terms of providing a smooth and reliable driving environment on roads. A series of indices have been developed to evaluate the pavement conditions of road segments in their respective jurisdictions: Pavement Condition Index (PCI) is scored as a perfect roadway (100 points) minus point deductions for “distresses” that are observed; Present Serviceability Rating (PSR) is measured as vertical movement per unit horizontal movement (e.g. millimeters of vertical displacement per meter of horizontal displacement) as one drives along the road; (SR) Surface Rating  is calculated by reviewing images of the roadway based on the frequency and severity of defects; Pavement Quality Index (PQI) is calculated using the PSR and SR to evaluate the general condition of the road. A high PQI (up to 4.5) means a road will most likely not need maintenance soon, whereas a low PQI means it can be selected for maintenance &lt;ref&gt;Hammerand, J. (2006). “Rating Minnesota’s Roads.” The Minnesota Local Technical Assistance Program (LTAP): Technology Exchange, vol.24, No.1, 3&lt;/ref&gt;.

These indices of pavement quality are basic measures for road maintenance and preservation, for which each county develops its own performance standards to evaluate pavement conditions and make decisions on maintenance and preservation projects. Typically, pavement preservation projects are prioritized based on PCI of road segments: the lower the PCI, the higher the likelihood of selection. Taking Washington County, Minnesota as an example &lt;ref&gt;Washington County Transportation Division (2004). “Washington County Annual Performance Report for 2004.” &lt;http://www.co.washington.mn.us/client_files/documents/adm/PerfMeas-2004//ADM- PM-04-Transportation.pdf&gt; (May 20, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;, the county has determined that a reasonable standard to maintain is an average PCI of 72. Thus any road segment with its PCI below 72 has a chance to be selected for preservation. Dakota County, Minnesota on the other hand, scores its preservation projects according to the measure of PQI: a road segment will be allocated 17 points (out of a possible 100) if its PQI falls lower than 3.1.

The pavement data structure is incompatible with the link-node structure of the planning road network used by the Metropolitan Council and other planning agencies. Typically, the measures of PCI, PSR, and PQI are stored in records indexed by “highway segment numbers” along each highway route. Highway sections with the same highway segment number are differentiated by their starting and ending stations. There is no exact match between highway segments in the actual road network and links in the planning network, as stationing is a position along the curved centerline of a highway while a planning network is a simplified structure consisting of only straight lines intersecting at points. Historic pavement data is generally unavailable in electronic format, although the information on pavement history such as pavement life and the duration since last repaving are important to estimate the cost of a preservation project, also affecting the decision whether a specific project will get selected and how much funding will be allocated.


== Traffic flow ==

Traffic conditions reflect the travel demand loaded on a given road infrastructure. Traffic flows on roads, together with road capacity, can be used to calculate the volume/capacity (V/C) ratio, which is an approximate indicator for the level of service of road infrastructure, and is commonly adopted by the jurisdictions in their respective decision making processes. The traffic flows on the planning road network are predicted by the transportation planning model, but the results have to be calibrated with actual traffic data.

Loop detectors are the primary technology currently employed in many US metropolitan areas to collect actual traffic data. E.g. In the Twin Cities of Minneapolis-St. Paul, about one thousand detector stations have been buried on major highways, through which Mn/DOT’s Traffic Management Center collects, stores, and makes public traffic data every 30 seconds, including measured volume (flow) and occupancy, and calculated speed data for each detector station. Although the estimates of Annual Average Daily Traffic (AADT) for the planning road network are readily available, loop detectors provide more accurate measures of traffic volume, since they are collecting real-time data on a continuous basis. It also allows for calibrating models to hourly rather than daily conditions.

Due to the limited ability to convert raw data collected by loop detectors, however, most forecasting models rely on AADT data. The raw data are stored in a 30- second interval in binary codes. For planning uses they have to be converted and aggregated into desired measures, such as peak hour average, average for a particular month or a particular season, etc, in a systematic way. 

Another issue in integrating loop detector data into a planning road network is to match the detector stations with the links in planning networks. Similar to the problem encountered in translating pavement data, detectors are located along major highways and mapped on the actual geometry of the network, while the planning road network is a simplified structure with only straight lines.

''Adapted from Levinson, D. and Zofka, Ewa. (2006) [http://nexus.umn.edu/Papers/SurveyArchive.pdf “The Metropolitan Travel Survey Archive: A Case Study in Archiving”] in ''Travel Survey Methods: Quality and Future Directions, Proceedings of 5th International Conference on Travel Survey Methods'' (Peter Stopher and Cheryl Stecher, editors)''&lt;ref&gt; Levinson, D. and Zofka, Ewa. (2006) [http://nexus.umn.edu/Papers/SurveyArchive.pdf “The Metropolitan Travel Survey Archive: A Case Study in Archiving”] in ''Travel Survey Methods: Quality and Future Directions, Proceedings of 5th International Conference on Travel Survey Methods'' (Peter Stopher and Cheryl Stecher, editors)&lt;/ref&gt;

Metadata allows data to function together. Simply put, metadata is information about information – labeling, cataloging and descriptive information structured to permit data to be processed. Ryssevik and Musgrave (1999)&lt;ref&gt;Ryssevik J, Musgrave S. (1999) The Social Science Dream Machine: Resource discovery, analysis and delivery on the Web. Paper given at the IASSIST Conference. Toronto, May. &lt;/ref&gt; argue that high quality metadata standards are essential as metadata is the launch pad for any resource discovery, maps complex data, bridges the gap between data producers and consumers, and links data with its resultant reports and scientific studies produced about it. To meet the increasing needs for the proper data formats and encoding standards, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has developed the generic Resource Description Framework (RDF) (W3C 2002). RDF treats metadata more generally, providing a standard way to use Extended Markup Language (XML) to “represent metadata in the form of statements about properties and relationships of items”
(W3C 2002) &lt;ref&gt;World Wide Web Consortium (2002) Metadata Activity Statement&lt;/ref&gt;. Resources can be almost any type of file, including of course, travel surveys. RDF delivers detailed and unified data description vocabulary.

Applying these tools specifically to databases, the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) for Document Type Definitions (DTD) applies metadata standards used for documenting datasets. DDI was first developed by European and North American data archives, libraries and official statistics agencies. “The Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) is an effort to establish an international XML-based standard for the content, presentation, transport, and preservation of documentation for datasets in the social and behavioral sciences” (Data Documentation Initiative 2004). As this international standardization effort gathers momentum it is expected more and more datasets to be documented using DDI as the primary metadata format. With DDI, searching data archives on the Internet no longer depends on an archivist's skill at capturing the information that is important to researchers. The standard of data description provides sufficient detail sorted in a user-friendly manner.

=== Discussion ===

What does this all mean?

System Rational vs. User Rational

Tit for Tat vs. Myopic Selfishness

See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatol_Rapoport#Game_theory Anatol Rapoport], who developed the successful Tit-for-Tat strategy for a similar, computer based strategy.

== Game Theory ==

Game theory is concerned with general analysis of strategic interaction of economic agents whose decisions affect each other. 

Problems that can be analyzed with Game Theory:

* Congestion
* Financing
* Merging
* Bus vs. Car
*  … 

who are the agents in each game?

=== Strategies ===

In game theory, ''dominance'' (also called strategic dominance) occurs when one strategy is better than another strategy for one player, no matter how that player's opponents may play. Many simple games can be solved using dominance. The opposite, intransitivity, occurs in games where one strategy may be better or worse than another strategy for one player, depending on how the player's opponents may play. (ref: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominant_strategy Dominant strategy])

''Nash Equilibrium'' (NE): a pair of strategies is defined as a NE if A's choice is optimal given B's and B's choice is optimal given A's choice.  A NE can be interpreted as a pair of expectations about each person's choice such that once one person makes their choice neither individual wants to change their behavior. 

If a strictly dominant strategy exists for one player in a game, that player will play that strategy in each of the game's Nash equilibria. If both players have a strictly dominant strategy, the game has only one unique Nash equilibrium. However, that Nash equilibrium is not necessarily Pareto optimal, meaning that there may be non-equilibrium outcomes of the game that would be better for both players. The classic game used to illustrate this is the Prisoner's Dilemma.  (ref: [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominant_strategy Dominant strategy])

Payoffs for player A are represented is the first number in a cell, the payoffs for player B are given as the second number in that cell.  Thus strategy pair [i,i] implies a payoff of 3 for player A and also a payoff of 3 for player B.  The NE is asterisked in the above illustrations. This represents a situation in which each firm or person is making an optimal choice given the other firm or persons choice.  Here both A and B clearly prefer choice i to choice j.  Thus [i,i] is a NE.

=== Prisoner's Dilemma ===

Earlier, we played both a finite one-time game and an indefinitely  repeated game.  The game was formulated as what is referred to as a ‘prisoner’s dilemma’.  

The term prisoner’s dilemma comes from the situation where two partners in crime are both arrested and interviewed separately. If they both ‘hang tough’, they get light sentences for lack of evidence (say 1 year each).  If they both crumble in interrogation and confess, they both split the time for the crime (say 10 years).   But if one confesses and the other doesn’t, the one who confesses turns state’s evidence (and gets parole) and helps convict the other (who does 20 years time in prison) 

In the one-time or finitely repeated Prisoners' Dilemma game, to confess (toll, defect, evens) is a dominant strategy, and when both prisoners confess (states toll, defect, evens), that is a dominant strategy equilibrium.


== Applications of Game Theory to Transportation ==
=== Tolling at a Frontier ===
' (based on Levinson, David (1999)  [http://nexus.umn.edu/Papers/Frontier.pdf Tolling at a Frontier: A Game Theoretic Analysis]. Proceedings of the 14th International Symposium on Transportation and Traffic Theory 173-187.)''

Two states (Delaware and New Jersey) are separated by a body of water.  They are connected by a bridge over that body.  How should they finance that bridge and the rest of their roads?

Should they toll or tax?

Let &lt;math&gt;r_{I}&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;r_{J}&lt;/math&gt; be tolls of the two jurisdictions.  Demand is a negative exponential function.  
(Objective is to maximize local welfare (utility of residents plus toll revenue from non-residents (toll revenue from residents is considered a transfer)).

{| {{table}}
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#f0f0f0;&quot;|''''''
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#f0f0f0;&quot;|''''''
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#f0f0f0;&quot;|'''Jurisdiction J (New Jersey)'''
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#f0f0f0;&quot;|''''''
|-
| ||||i||j
|-
| Jurisdiction I (Delaware) ||i||[1153, 1153]*||[2322,883]
|-
| ||j||[883, 2322]||[1777,1777]
|}

The table is read like this: Each jurisdiction chooses one of the two strategies (Toll or Tax). In effect, Jurisdiction 1 (Delaware) chooses a row and jurisdiction 2 (New Jersey) chooses a column. The two numbers in each cell tell the outcomes for the two states when the corresponding pair of strategies is chosen. The number to the left of the comma tells the payoff to the jurisdiction who chooses the rows (Delaware) while the number to the right of the column tells the payoff to the state who chooses the columns (New Jersey). Thus (reading down the first column) if they both toll, each gets $1153/hour in welfare , but if New Jersey Tolls and Delaware Taxes, New Jersey gets $2322 and Delaware only $883. 

So: how to solve this game? What strategies are &quot;rational&quot; if both states want to maximize welfare? New Jersey might reason as follows: &quot;Two things can happen: Delaware can toll or Delaware can keep tax. Suppose Delaware tolls. Then I get only $883 if I don't toll, $1153 if I do, so in that case it's best to toll. On the other hand, if Delaware taxes  and I toll, I get $2322, and if I tax we both get $1777. Either way, it's best if I toll. Therefore, I'll toll.&quot;

But Delaware reasons similarly.  Thus they both toll, and lost $624/hour. Yet, if they had acted &quot;irrationally,&quot; and taxed, they each could have gotten $1777/hour.

=== Coordination Game ===

In Britain, Japan, Australia, and some other island nations people drive on the left side of the road; in the US and the European continent they drive on the right.  But everywhere, everyone drives on the same side as everywhere else, even if that side changes from place to place.  

How is this arrangement achieved?

There are two strategies: drive on the left side and drive on the right side. There are two possible outcomes: the two cars pass one another without incident or they crash. We arbitrarily assign a value of one each to passing without problems and of -10 each to a crash. Here is the payoff table:

{| {{table}}
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#f0f0f0;&quot;|''''''
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#f0f0f0;&quot;|''''''
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#f0f0f0;&quot;|'''Mercedes'''
| align=&quot;center&quot; style=&quot;background:#f0f0f0;&quot;|''''''
|-
| ||||Left||Right
|-
| Buick||Left||[1,1]||[-10,-10]
|-
| ||Right||[-10,-10]||[1,1]
|}

(Objective: Maximize payoff) 

Verify that LL and RR are both Nash equilibria. 

But, if we do not know which side to choose, there is some danger that we will choose LR or RL at random and crash. How can we know which side to choose? The answer is, of course, that for this coordination game we rely on social convention. Conversely, we know that in this game, social convention is very powerful and persistent, and no less so in the country where the solution is LL than in the country where it is RR.

== Issues in Game Theory ==

* What is “rationality” ?
* What happens when the rational strategy depends on strategies of others?
* What happens if information is incomplete?
* What happens if there is uncertainty or risk?
* Under what circumstances is cooperation better than selfishness?  Under what circumstances is cooperation selfish?
* How do continuing interactions differ from one-time events?
* Can morality be derived from rational selfishness?
* How does reality compare with game theory?

== Thought Question ==

How does an infinitely or indefinitely repeated Prisoner’s Dilemma game differ from a finitely repeated or one-time  game?
Why?

== Problem ==

&lt;div style=&quot;background: ##aaaaaa; border: 4px solid #ffCC99; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;
Two airlines (United, American) each offer 1 flight from New York to Los Angeles. 

Price = $/pax, Payoff = $/flight.  

Each plane carries 500 passengers.  

Fixed cost is $50000 per flight, total demand at $200 is 500 passengers. 

At $400, total demand is 250 passengers.

Passengers choose cheapest flight. 

Payoff = Revenue - Cost

Work in pairs (4 minutes): 

1. Formulate the Payoff Matrix for the Game.

2. What is equilibrium ?
&lt;/div&gt;
=== Solution ===
&lt;div style=&quot;background: ##aaaaaa; border: 4px solid #02D4EE; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

== Zero-Sum ==
''Zero-Sum game'': If we add up the wins and losses in a game, treating losses as negatives, and we find that the sum is zero for each set of strategies chosen, then the game is a “zero-sum game.&quot;

== Problem Extension ==
&lt;div style=&quot;background: ##aaaaaa; border: 4px solid #ffCC99; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;
3. What happens if there is a third price $300, for which demand is 375 passengers.

Reformulate the problem. 
&lt;/div&gt;
=== Solution ===

== Mixed Strategies ==

''Mixed strategy'': If a player in a game chooses among two or more strategies at random according to specific probabilities, this choice is called a &quot;mixed strategy.&quot;

Equilibrium is [$200,$200]

SOLUTION: Maximin criterion 

For a two-person, zero sum game it is rational for each player to choose the strategy that maximizes the minimum payoff, and the pair of strategies and payoffs such that each player maximizes her minimum payoff is the “solution to the game.&quot;

While incorporating theory, there is a very applied bent to the course, as all the ideas covered are intended to help inform the real decisions that are made (or should be made) in practice.

This book uses two core ideas:

#Individuals (firms, agencies, agents, actors) behave according to incentives provided by their environment.
#The environment is shaped by the collective behavior of individuals.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{mergeto|Nuclear Physics}}
Natural uranium consists of three isotopes. These are uranium234, uranium235 and Uranium238.
Hereby is uranium234 a decay product of uranium238, whose concentration is in a
fix relation to uranium238. The concentration of uranium235 is independent of the content of 
uranium238.
As uranium238 and uranium235 decay with different speed, the isotope composition of natural uranium changes by time.

This has drastical consequences: 

2 billion years ago in Oklo in today's Gabun, there was a natural reactor moderated by normal water. At
those days natural uranium consisted of 3% uranium 235, this is the same concentration as in nuclear fuel for
boiling water reactors in power plants.

Today natural uranium has only a uranium 235 concentration of 0.72 %. A chain reaction in normal water is impossible. Usage of heavy water or enrichment of uranium 235 is required.

Should there exist in a few billion years, before the sun gets a red giant, intelligent life in our solar system, it will have great problems
to exploit nuclear fission, as concentration of uranium235 will be very low.

The development of isotope composition can be calculated as described below:

Lot of uranium235 in dependence of time t

&lt;math&gt;p(Uranium235)*0.5^\frac{t}{HalfLifeTimeU235}&lt;/math&gt;

Lot of uranium238 in dependence of time t

&lt;math&gt;p(Uranium238)*0.5^\frac{t}{HalfLifeTimeU238}&lt;/math&gt;

Lot of uranium234 in dependence of time t

&lt;math&gt;p(Uranium238)*\frac{HalfLifeTimeU234}{HalfLifeTimeU238}*(0.5^\frac{t}{HalfLifeTimeU238})&lt;/math&gt;

== Rationales for Pricing ==

Roadway congestion, air pollution from cars, and the lack of resources to finance new surface transportation options present challenges.  Road pricing, charging users a monetary toll in addition to the amount of time spent traveling, has been suggested as a solution to these problems.  While tolls are common for certain expensive facilities such as tunnels and bridges, they are less common on streets and highways.  A  new generation of private toll roads are being deployed in the United States and elsewhere.  There have been a few trials of areawide pricing schemes, such as in Singapore, London, and Stockholm, and many others proposed but not implemented.  

In short pricing can accomplish several objectives

* [[Transportation Economics/Revenue|Revenue]]
* Congestion management - Traffic congestion is very common in large cities and on major highways. It is time consuming and imposes a significant amount of uncertainty and aggravation on passengers and freight transportation. Most of the cost of traffic congestion caused by travelers' selfish behaviors (see discussion of [[Fundamentals of  Transportation/Route Choice|Route Choice]]), because they impose delays on others and do not pay the full marginal cost of their trips. In economic terms, a negative externality is created. In order to solve this problem some economist proposed that there should be a tax on congestion.  In the first edition of his textbook, ''The Economics of Welfare'', Pigou (1920) argued for a tax on congestion and thereby launched the literature on congestion pricing. Most economists support congestion pricing as a good way to relieve the dilemma, while many have been concerned about the details of implementation. Congestion charges allocate scarce road capacity in congested areas and peak times. Electronic Toll Collection (ETC) and Automated Vehicle Identification (AVI) technologies allow this to be done without delaying travelers.
* Pavement management - Pavement damage depends on vehicle weight per axle, not total vehicle weight - the damage power rises exponentially to the third power with the load per axle (e.g., a rear axle of a typical 13-ton van causes over 1000 times as much damages that of a car).  In order to reflect the pavement damage costs more accurately, Small and Winston (1989) propose a &quot;graduated per-mile tax based on axle weight&quot;.  This would give truckers (truck manufactuers) an incentive to reduce axle weights by shifting to trucks with more axles, extending pavement life and reducing highway maintenance.  The fuel tax currently in place provides truckers with the opposite incentives: the tax rises with a vehicle's axles, since trucks with more axles require larger engines and get lower fuel economy. They pointed out that the pavement thickness guidelines of the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) fails to incorporate economic optimization into the design procedure.  For example, by increasing rigid concrete pavement thickness only by 2.6 inches from currently 11.2 inches to 13.8 inches would more than double the life of the pavement.
* Off-loading costs or reallocating costs (changing who bears burden) - Highway cost allocation studies periodically attempt to update the amount of burden for roads borne by cars and various classes of trucks, but they only have two policy tools (gasoline and diesel fuel taxes) to do the job. A more robust pricing strategy could make charges far more directly proportional to source.
* Changing energy supply indicates declining gas tax revenue
* Encourage alternatives to driving

There are reasons that road pricing is not more widespread.  Until recently, technical issues were dominant, toll collection added considerable delay and greatly reduced net revenue with the need for humans sitting in toll booths.   However, advances in automatic vehicle identification and tolling have enabled toll collection, without human operators, at full speed.    Other issues are fundamentally political: concerns over privacy, equity, and the perception of double taxation.  Privacy concerns, though political, may have a technical solution, with the use of electronic money, which is not identified with its owner, rather than credit or debit cards or automatic identification and billing of vehicles.   Equity issues, the belief that there will be winners and losers from the new system, may not be entirely resolvable.  Though it can be shown that under certain circumstances road pricing has a net benefit for society as a whole, unless a mechanism exists for making a sufficient majority of road users and voters benefit, or perceive benefit,  this concern is a roadblock to implementation.  Similarly, people may believe that they have paid for roads already through gas taxes and general revenue, and that charging for them is akin to double taxation.  Unless users can be convinced that the revenue raised is for maintenance and expansion, or another  convincing public purpose, the political sell will be difficult.  Widespread road pricing may require changes in the general transportation financing structure and a clear accounting of the benefits will need to be provided.

== Theory of Congestion Pricing ==
[[Image:TE-Pricing-EquilibriumCongestion.png |right|thumb|400px||Caption: Congestion Pricing Brings About Efficient Equilibrium.]]

Whenever a scarce and valued good such as road use is free or under priced, demand will outstrip supply.  An illustration pertaining to road use is evident by the queues and traffic jams that occur when the number of motorists attempting to use a section of roadway at the same time exceeds the road’s capacity.  Expanding capacity to meet peak demand results in wasteful excess capacity during non-peak periods unless the peak users are charged the full cost of the expansion.  If we look at long-distance telephone service, allocation is determined with a market mechanism by charging a premium for a call during peak periods and by offering a discount during off peak periods.  Consumers appear to accept a market-based system for allocating demand in long-distance telephone service and the system suggests this policy works.

In the case of roads, demand is allocated by congestion.  The excess demand for road use during peak periods causes congestion.  Economists believe that travel behavior is directed by the out-of-pocket expense of a trip plus the value of time that is required.  Some motorists do shift their time of travel when congestion gets bad enough, but not enough motorists shift to entirely alleviate the congestion.  The number of motorists that do shift their time of travel will never be sufficient to reduce congestion because -without some sort of pricing or rationing of road use- motorists using the road during peak periods do not have to pay for the delays they cause each other.

Making motorists pay for the delays they caused others by making their trips rather than just their personal costs would lead some to make other choices.  Motorists may decide to change their time of travel, carpool, or use public transportation.  Congestion pricing would allow motorists to make peak-period trips under less congested conditions, but only if they are willing to pay for the delays they impose on each other.  The price would be set at a level that reduces congestion to its most efficient level, which can be shown to be the full monetary and time cost for using a segment of road capacity during the peak period.

Decisions made by road users about where and when to use their vehicles are made by comparing the benefits they will receive from using the road with the costs to themselves.  These costs do not include the costs they impose on other travelers or on society as a whole, such as congestion and environmental damage.  The results from this type of behavior are trips being made in which benefits to the motorist are less than the costs to society.  There is more traffic than can be justified and is not efficiently located in time and capacity.  If people are charged for the costs they impose on others because of their travel decisions, then that pattern of travel which results in optimal efficiently will occur.

==Alternative Revenue Mechanisms ==
Road user charging may be more or less direct.  Generally, indirect methods of road charges are related to vehicle ownership and usage.  Examples would be fixed charges for owning a car -purchase tax for buying a new vehicle and annual licensing renewals- and variable charges on car usage -taxes on tires oil and fuel.

Indirect methods of road charging, such as fuel taxes, are the most commonly used in today’s society because of the high volume of usage and ease of collection.  However, revenue methods like fuel taxes rarely channel funds directly into a road or transportation fund that is specifically for highway maintenance or development.  Where there is congestion caused by multiple road users, drivers impose a marginal social cost in terms of delay and higher operating costs on other uses, for which they are not being charged.

Direct charging involves monitoring the actual time or distance of vehicle travel and charging appropriately.  There are many ways in which to carry out direct charging.  With the development of electronic technology, both off-vehicle and now in-vehicle charging mechanisms can be implemented.  Off-vehicle mechanisms are devices like manual toll collection booths, coin operated machines, and road side auto-scanners.  In-vehicle mechanisms are magnetic cards, smart cards, and transponders.

Congestion pricing could take several forms.  The most straightforward example would be to add an extra fee to an existing toll, or to add a peak fee on an untolled route or bridge.  The charge could be a simple peak premium price or off-peak discount received, or the charge could vary according to the demand imposed on a facility at a specific time.  

In practice, congestion pricing could take six forms:
*	Point pricing, In which a highway user passing a point at a  specific time is charged a fee for passing that point regardless of the distance traveled on a specified route;
*	Cordon pricing, in which users wishing to enter a congested area are charged fees at each entry point;
*	Zone pricing, in which users traveling within a cordoned area also pay a fee;
*	Higher charges for parking in congested areas, with particular emphasis on parking during the most congested period;
*	Congestion-specific charges, in which users would be charged for both the amount of time spent and distance traveled.

The policies have different implications for demand.  General taxes cannot be expected to reduce demand for travel in particular.  Transportation specific taxes should reduce demand to a limited extent, but will not reduce demand on targeted road links, such as congested facilities.  A cordon toll will reduce demand crossing the cordon, but by its nature is less targeted than “perfect tolls”.  While different finance mechanisms have different implications for how they affect demand, they also have different costs of collection.  It has historically been true that the more targeted the mechanism, the more costly.  However, with the advent of wider use of electronic toll collection, those historical truisms may be altered.
Varying the level of jurisdiction administering the policy changes the perception of welfare.  Local governments are responsible to local citizens - their constituents, and tend not to concern themselves with the welfare of non-local residents.  Therefore the incentive structure facing different layers of government needs to be distinguished.  The welfare resulting from implementation when roads are owned and operated by a state may differ from the welfare if the same financing mechanism were implemented by a regional metropolitan planning organization that owned and operated the roads and could retain toll revenue.  Similarly, the metropolitan planning organization differs from the county.  The key reasons for these differences relate to who pays the tolls, and whether or not the (or to what extent) toll-payers reside within the boundaries of the local governmental agency.  A county’s concern for the economic welfare of non-county residents is minimal, as is a metropolitan regions concern for residents of other areas.  Decentralization of decision making can thus influence the chosen policy.

== Effects of Congestion Pricing ==
The evidence from past changes in bridge and turnpike tolls demonstrates that motorists do respond to changes in price.  In referring to the price elasticity of individual demand for transportation, analyses suggest an elasticity of approximately -0.10 to -0.15 as a lower limit and -0.3 to -0.4 as an upper limit depending on the charge, the current costs of travel, and the capacity of alternative roads and transit systems. There will be a decline in demand following a price increase, but consumer demand for road use is strong enough that the percentage decline in demand will not be as large as the percentage increase in price.  

There are many possible changes in travel choice, including: 
*	 Route, changing from tolled to untolled routes or to faster tolled routes.
*	 Time, changing to earlier or later departures to avoid tolls or tolled periods.
*	 Mode, changing to or away from carpools, transit, or other modes.
*	 Destination, changing to a closer location for non-work activities.
*	 Location, moving home or workplace to reduce the commute.
*	 Sequence, linking trips by combining multiple errands on a single trip.  
*	 Frequency, reducing the number of less important trips 
*	 Presence, conducting activities by telecommuting to decrease work related trips.  
*	 Ownership, Motorists may also forgo ownership of automobiles to bypass toll charges.

Congestion pricing on highways would have broad effects on the entire transportation system by shifting the demand for transportation services away from peak period highway use by solo drivers.  A reduction in the incentives to drive during peak periods would shift some traffic to the off-peak, which would increase the efficiency of the road system - therefore, reduce the demand for additional capacity.  Some motorists would continue to drive during the peak but would elect to share rides with others or change the destinations of their trips.  Sharing rides with others would also increase the efficiency in which the system is used by increasing the number of people per vehicle during peak periods.

Some motorists would shift to transit.  The improvement in traffic flows that would result from congestion pricing would improve service reliability and speed, therefore, making transit more attractive than the automobile.  The increase in use of transit would increase revenues.  These revenues could be put towards increasing service frequency or route coverage.  Congestion pricing would also reduce demand for new highway development.  This would decrease the demand for capital expenditure on road development in response to growing population and travel demand.

== Unpacking ==
[[Image:TE-Pricing-EquilbriumUnpacked.png|right|thumb|400px]]

The top part of Figure 2 shows schematically the travel time to a driver (short run average cost) at a bottleneck or on a capacitated link resulting from various levels of approach flow.  The travel time function relates travel time (or delay) and approach traffic flow.  The greater the approach flow, the higher the travel time.  At flows below capacity (level of service A (SA) or B (SB)), traffic flows smoothly, while at high approach flows, those above capacity, traffic is stop and start and is classified as level of service E (SE) or F (SF).


The bottom part of Figure 2 shows schematically the implicit demand for travel on a link as a function of the travel time.  All else equal (for instance the price charged to users), demand to travel on a link at level of service A (DA) is higher than demand at level of service F (DF).   However the demand and the travel time on a link are not independent, as shown in Figure 2(A).  

So the implicit demand and revealed demand are not identical, rather the revealed demand is formed by projecting the travel time at a given flow onto the implicit demand curves.  So for instance, when the price charged users is high, the revealed demand coincides with the implicit demand at level of service A (DA). As the prices are lowered, the revealed demand crosses the implicit demand curve at level of service B (DB), then DC, DD, DE and finally at a zero money price it crosses DF.  While the actual prices that  generate specific demand levels vary from  place to place with local circumstances, demand preferences, and market conditions, the general trend (higher prices gives lower approach flow gives better level of service) is simply an application of the law of demand from economics along with traffic flow theory.

In other words, the change in welfare with congestion pricing depends not only on both the change in price and quantity, but also on the change in reservation price.  The reservation price is the amount travelers would be willing to pay at a given level of service.  And at better levels of service, travelers (and potential travelers) have a higher reservation price.

== Welfare Analysis ==

[[Image:TE-Pricing-WelfareAnalysis.png| right|thumb|400px]]

The movement along the revealed demand curve follows the shape of the curve shown above because of the relationship between traffic flow (quantity demanded) and travel time. Assume for instance that each level of service category represents a one-minute increase in travel time from the immediately better travel time.  So in the graph, let the level of service for a one minute trip be denoted SA , and for a six minute trip, SF.  The amount of traffic necessary to move from 1 minute to 2 minutes exceeds the amount to move from 2 to 3 minutes. In other words, there is a rising average (and thus marginal) cost in terms of time.

The concepts in Figure 2 can be used to develop the welfare analysis shown in Figure 3.  There are several areas of interest in Figure 3.  The first is defined by the lower left triangle (the blue + green) (triangle VOZ) which is the consumer surplus when the road is unpriced.  The second is the producer surplus (profit) to the road authority when the road is priced, illustrated by the rectangle formed in the lower left (yellow + green) (rectangle OVWY).  The third is the consumer surplus when the road is priced, shown in gray (triangle UVW).  This consumer surplus represents a higher reservation price than the other because the level of service is better when flow is lower.  

That first area needs to be compared to the sum of the second and third areas.  If the sum of the second and third areas (OUWY) is larger than the first (OVZ), then pricing has higher welfare than remaining unpriced.  Similarly, two price levels can be compared.  In other words, the welfare gain from pricing is equal to the yellow + gray area (VUWX) minus the blue area (XYZ).  In this particular figure, consumer’s surplus is maximized when the good is free, but overall welfare (including producer’s surplus) is not.  Whether consumer’s surplus is in fact higher in a given situation depends on the slopes of the various demand curves.

The greatest welfare is achieved by maximizing the sum of the producer’s surplus rectangle and the consumer’s surplus “triangle” (it may not be a true triangle).  This must recognize that the consumers surplus triangle’s hypotenuse must follow an underlying demand curve, not the revealed demand curve.  Differentiating the level of service (for instance, providing two different levels of service at two different prices) may result in higher overall welfare (though not necessarily higher welfare for each individual).

== Use of the Revenue ==

How welfare is measured and how it is perceived are two different things.   If the producer’s surplus is not returned to the users of the system somehow the users will perceive an overall welfare gain as a personal loss because it would be acting as an additional tax.  The money can be returned through rebates of other taxes or reinvestment in transportation.    It should be noted that the entire argument can be made in reverse, where consumer and producers surplus are measured in time rather than money, and the level of service is the monetary cost of travel.  This however has less practical application.

== Pricing and Cost Recovery ==

In low volume situations, those that are uncongested, it is unlikely that the revenue from marginal cost congestion pricing will recover long term fixed costs.   This is because the marginal impacts of an additional car when volume is low is almost zero, so that additional revenue which can be raised with marginal cost pricing is also zero.  Imagine a road with one car - the car’s marginal impact is zero, a marginal cost price would also be zero, its revenue would thus be zero, which is less than the fixed costs.  

Add a second car, and marginal impacts are still nearly zero - a phenomenon which remains true until capacity is approached.

== Vickery’s Types of Congestion ==

* Simple interaction - light traffic, one car blocked by another, delay is proportional to Q^2
* Multiple interaction - 0.5 &lt; V/C &lt; 0.9 

&lt;math&gt;Z = t - t_{o} = 1/s - 1/s_{o} = ax^k&lt;/math&gt;

t actual time, to freeflow time, K ~ 3-5

* Bottleneck see below
* Triggerneck - overflow affects other traffic
* Network and Control - Traffic control devices transfer delay
* General Density - high traffic level in general


== Marginal Cost Pricing ==

Transportation is a broad field, attracting individuals with backgrounds in engineering, economics, and planning, among others who don’t share a common model or worldview about traffic congestion.  Economists look for received technological functions that can be analyzed, but risk misinterpreting them.  Engineers seek basic economic concepts to manage traffic, which they view as their own purview.  These two fields intersect in the domain of congestion pricing.  However many engineers view pricing with suspicion, believing that many economists are overstating its efficacy, while the economists are frustrated with engineering intransigence, and consider engineers as lacking understanding of basic market principles.

This section applies the microscopic model of traffic congestion that to congestion pricing, and allows us to critique the plausibility of several economic models of congestion that have appeared in the literature.

This section uses the idea of queueing and bottlenecks to explain congestion.  If there were no bottlenecks (which can be physical and permanent such as lane drops or steep grades, or variable such as a traffic control device, or temporary due to a crash), there would be very little congestion.  Vehicles interacting on an uncongested road lead to relatively minimal delays and are not further considered (Vickery 1969, Daganzo 1995) . We define congestion, or the congested period, to be the time when there is queueing.  This exceeds the time when arrivals exceed departures, as every vehicle has to wait for all previous vehicles to depart the front of the queue before it can.

A [[Fundamentals of Transportation/Queueing and Traffic Flow|previous section]] developed the queueing model of congestion.  

[[Image:CongestionPricingA.png|right|thumb|400px|Input output diagram at level of individual vehicle]]
[[Image:CongestionPricingB.png|right|thumb|400px|Marginal delay at level of individual vehicle]]

What is the implication of our queueing models for marginal cost pricing?

First, the use of hourly average time vs. flow functions such as the Bureau of Public Roads function, (which we introduced in the discussion of [[Fundamentals of Transportation/Route Choice|route choice]] (which approximates the hourly average delay from a queueing model) ignores that different vehicles within that hour have different travel times. They are at best useful for coarse macroscopic analyses, but should never be applied to the level of individual vehicles.

Second, travel time for a vehicle through a bottleneck depends on the number of vehicles that have come before, but not on the number of vehicles coming after.  Similarly, the marginal delay that a vehicle imposes is only imposed on vehicles that come after.  This implies that the first vehicle in the queue imposes the highest marginal delay, and the last vehicles in the queue have the lowest marginal delay.  A marginal delay function that looks like figure on the right (bottom) is generated from the typical input-output diagram shown on the figure on the right (top). If marginal cost were equal to the marginal delay, then our pricing function would be unusual, and perhaps unstable.  The instability might be tempered by making demand respond to price, rather than assuming it fixed (Rafferty and Levinson 2003), and by recognizing the stochastic nature of arrival and departure patterns, which would flatten the arrival curve to more closely resemble the departure curve, and thereby flatten the marginal delay curve. 

However, the idea that the first vehicle &quot;causes&quot; the delay is a controversial point.  Economists will sometimes argue Coase’s position (1992) – that it takes two to have a negative externality, that there would be no congestion externality but for the arrival of the following vehicles.  Coase is, of course, correct.  Moreover, they would note that charging a toll to the following vehicle will discourage that vehicle from coming and might also eliminate the congestion externality.  This may also be true.  This would however be charging the sufferer of congestion twice (once in terms of time, a second in terms of toll), while the person with the faster trip (earlier in the queue) wouldn’t pay at all.  Further, it is the followers who have already internalized the congestion externality in their decision making, so tolling them is charging them twice, in contrast to charging the leaders.  Given that charging either party could eliminate the externality, it would be more reasonable to charge the delayer than the delayed, which is much like the “polluter pays principle” advocated by environmentalists.  It would also be more equitable, in that total costs (congestion delay + toll) would now be equalized across travelers. The disadvantage of this is that the amount of the delay caused is unknown at the time that the first traveler passes; at best it can be approximated.

Implicitly, this privileges the “right to uncongested travel” over the “right to unpriced travel”.  That is a philosophical question, but given that there is to be some mechanism to finance highways, we can eliminate the notion of unpriced travel altogether, the remaining issue is how to implement financing: with insensitive prices like gas taxes or flat tolls or with time-dependent (or flow-dependent) congestion prices.

The marginal cost equals marginal delay formulation does ignore the question of schedule delay.  There are practical reasons for not including schedule delay in a marginal cost price.  Unlike delay, schedule delay is not easily measured.  While a road administrator can tell you from traffic counts how much delay a traveler caused, the administrator has no clue as to how much schedule delay was caused.  Second, if the late (early) penalty is large, then it dominates scheduling.  Travelers can decide whether they would rather endure arriving early (without delay) or arriving on time, with some delay (or some combination of the two), presumably minimizing their associated costs. If they choose the delay, it is the lower cost alternative.  That lower cost is the one they suffer, and thus that serves as a lower bound on the marginal cost to attribute to other travelers.  If they choose schedule delay (which then becomes the cost they face) and avoid the delay, they are affected as well by other travelers, but in a way that is unknown to pricing authorities. They are “priced out of the market”, which happens all the time. In short, endogenizing schedule delay would be nice, but requires more information than is actually available.

== Profit Maximizing Pricing ==

A realistic network of highway links is not, in the economists' terminology, perfectly competitive.  Because a link uniquely occupies space, it attains some semblance of monopoly power. While in most cases users can switch to alternative links and routes, those alternatives will be more costly to the user in terms of travel time. Theory suggests that excess profits will attract new entrants into a market, but the cost of building a new link is high, indicating barriers to entry not easily overcome.

Although roads are generally treated as public goods, they are both rivalrous when congested and in many cases excludable.  This indicates that it is feasible to consider them for privatization.  The advantages often associated with privatization are several: increasing the efficiency of the transportation system through road pricing, providing incentives for the facility operator to improve service through innovation and entrepreneurship, and reducing the time and cost of building and expanding infrastructure.


An issue little addressed is implementation. Most trials of road pricing suppose either tolls on a single facility, or area-wide control.  Theoretical studies often assume marginal cost pricing on links, and don't discuss ownership structure.  However, in other sectors of the economy, central control of pricing either through government ownership or regulation has proven itself less effective than decentralized control for serving customer demands in rapidly changing environments.  Single prices system-wide don’t provide as much information as link-specific prices.  Links which are priced only at marginal cost, the optimal solution in a first-best, perfectly competitive environment, constrain profit.  While in the short-term, excess profit is not socially optimal, over the longer term, it attracts capital and entrepreneurs to that sector of the economy.  New capital will both invest more in existing technology to further deploy it and enter the sector as competitors trying to gain from a spatial monopoly or oligopoly.  Furthermore, new capitalists may also innovate, and thereby change the supply (and demand) curves in the industry.

By examining road pricing and privatization from a decentralized point of view, the issues associated with a marketplace of roads can be more fully explored, including short and long term distributional consequences and overall social welfare.  The main contribution of this research will be to approach the problem from a theoretical and conceptual level and through the conduct of simulation experiments.   This analysis will identify salient empirical factors and critical parameters that determine system performance.  To the extent that available data from recent road pricing experiments becomes available, it may be used to compare with the results of the model.


=== Case 1. Simple Monopoly ===

	The simplest example is that of a monopoly link, &lt;math&gt;I-J &lt;/math&gt;

The link has elastic demand &lt;math&gt;Q_d&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;
Q_d =f (P)	
&lt;/math&gt;	
						
here given by a linear equation:

&lt;math&gt;
	Q_d = \beta_0 - \beta_1 P	 &lt;/math&gt; for all  &lt;math&gt;\beta_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \beta_1 &gt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;  		


The objective of the link is to maximize profit &lt;math&gt;\pi= P Q_d(P)&lt;/math&gt;.  Here we assume no congestion effects.  Profit is maximized when the first derivative is set to zero and the second derivative is negative.
&lt;math&gt;
	\pi= P Q_d(P) = P (\beta_0 - \beta_1P) = \beta_0P - \beta_1P^2
&lt;/math&gt;
Giving the following first order conditions (f.o.c.):
&lt;math&gt;
	\delta\pi/dP = \beta_0 - 2 \beta_1P = 0 
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
	P = \beta_0 / 2 \beta_1	
&lt;/math&gt;

Checking second order conditions (s.o.c.), we find them to be less than zero, as required for a maximum.

&lt;math&gt;
	\delta^2 \pi / \delta P^2 = - 2 \beta_1  &lt; 0	
&lt;/math&gt;

	For this example, if &lt;math&gt;\beta_0 = 1000&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta_1 = 1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P = 500&lt;/math&gt; gives &lt;math&gt;Q_d(P)=500&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;profit = 250,000&lt;/math&gt;.  This situation clearly does not maximize social welfare, defined as the sum of profit and consumer surplus.  Consumer surplus at &lt;math&gt;P=500&lt;/math&gt; for this demand curve is 125,000, giving a social welfare (SW) of 375,000.  Potential social welfare, maximized at &lt;math&gt;P=0&lt;/math&gt; (when links are costless), would be &lt;math&gt;500,000 &gt; 375,000&lt;/math&gt;, all of which comes from consumer surplus.

=== Case 2. Monopolistic Perfect Complements ===

	In a second simple example, we imagine two autonomous links, &lt;math&gt;I-J&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;J-K&lt;/math&gt;, which are pure monopolies and perfect complements, one cannot be consumed without consuming (driving on) the other. The links are in series.

	In this case, demand depends on the price of both links, so we can illustrate by using the following general expression, and a linear example :
&lt;math&gt;
	Q_d = f(P_{ij} , P_{kl})
&lt;/math&gt;
		
&lt;math&gt;Q_d = \beta_0 - \beta_1 (P_{ij}+P_{jk})&lt;/math&gt;

Again we assume no congestion costs.  When we profit maximize, we attain a system which produces a Nash equilibrium that is both worse off for the owners of the links, who face lower profits, and for the users of the links, who face higher collective profits, than a monopoly.  Simply put, the links do not suffer the full extent of their own pricing policy as they would in the case of a monopoly, where the pricing externality is internalized.

&lt;math&gt;
	\pi_{ij} = P_{ij} Q_d(P) = P_{ij} (\beta_0 - \beta_1P_{ij} - \beta_1P_{jk}) = \beta_0P_{ij} - \beta_1P_{ij}^2 - \beta_1 P_{ij} P_{jk}
&lt;/math&gt;
	
&lt;math&gt;	
	\pi_{jk} = P_{jk} Q_d(P) = P_{jk} (\beta_0 - \beta_1P_{ij} - \beta_1P_{jk}) = \beta_0P_{jk} - \beta_1P_{jk}^2 - \beta_1 P_{ij} P_{jk}
&lt;/math&gt;
	
f.o.c.
&lt;math&gt;
	\delta \pi / dP_{ij} = \beta_0 - 2 \beta_1P_{ij} - \beta_1P_{jk} = 0 
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;	
	P_{ij} = (\beta_0- \beta_1P_{jk}) / 2 \beta_1
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;	
	\delta \pi / \delta P_{jk} = \beta_0 - 2 \beta_1P_{jk} - \beta_1P_{ij} = 0 
&lt;/math&gt;
	
&lt;math&gt;	
	P_{jk} = (\beta_0- \beta_1P_{ij}) / 2 \beta_1
&lt;/math&gt;

solving the f.o.c. simultaneously yields:

&lt;math&gt;
	P_{ij} = P_{jk} = \beta_0 (2 \beta_1-1) / ( 4 \beta_1^2 - \beta_1)
&lt;/math&gt;

checking the s.o.c.:
&lt;math&gt;
	\delta^2 \pi / \delta P_{ij}^2 = - 2 \beta_1 &lt; 0	
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;	
	\delta^2 \pi / \delta P_{jk}^2 = - 2 \beta_1 &lt; 0
&lt;/math&gt;

	At &lt;math&gt;\beta_0 = 1000&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta_1 = 1&lt;/math&gt;, the solution is &lt;math&gt;P_{ij} = P_{jk} = 333.33&lt;/math&gt;, which gives &lt;math&gt;Q_d(P) = 333.33&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\pi_{ij}=\pi_{jk}=111,111&lt;/math&gt;, which is less total profit than the case of the simple monopoly. This situation results in total profit to both firms of 222,222, and a consumer surplus of 55,555, or total social welfare of 277,000, which is less than the results from the case of a simple monopoly.
	Similar arguments apply to three (or more) perfect complements, which are more and more dysfunctional if operated autonomously.  The general formula for N autonomous perfectly complementary links, with linear demand and  &lt;math&gt;\beta_1=1&lt;/math&gt;, is given by:

&lt;math&gt;	
	P = Q_d(P)= \beta_0/(N+1).
&lt;/math&gt;

=== Case 3. Duopoly of Perfect Substitutes ===

	In a third example, we imagine two parallel autonomous links, &lt;math&gt;I-J&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K-L&lt;/math&gt;, which serve the same, homogenous market.   They are perfect substitutes (operate in parallel).



	The optimal pricing for this case depends upon assumptions about how users distribute themselves across suppliers and the relationships between the links.  First, assume there are no congestion costs and time costs are otherwise equal and not a factor in the decision.  Do users simply and deterministically choose the lowest cost link, or are there other factors which shape this choice, so that a minor reduction in price will not attract all users from the other link?  For this example, we assume deterministic route choice, so demand chooses the lowest cost link, or splits between the links if they post the same price.  Here, demand is defined as below:
	
&lt;math&gt;	
	Q_d = f(P_{ij},P_{kl})
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;	
	Q_d = \beta_0 - \beta_1 min(P_{ij},P_{kl}).
&lt;/math&gt;
	
As before, let &lt;math&gt;\beta_0=1000&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta_1=1&lt;/math&gt;.  Also assume that competitive links can respond instantaneously.  Assume each link can serve the entire market, so that there are no capacity restrictions.
	Clearly there is a (welfare maximizing) stable equilibrium at &lt;math&gt;P=0&lt;/math&gt; (assuming equal and zero costs for the links), the result for a competitive system.  Demonstration: Suppose each link sets price 500, and had 250 users.  If link IJ lowers its prices by one unit to 499, it attains all 501 users, and profits on link IJ increase to 249,999 from 125,000.  However profits on link KL drop to 0.  The most profitable decision for KL is to lower its price to 498, attain 502 users, and profits of 249,996.  This price war can continue until profits are eliminated.  At any point in the process raising prices by one link alone loses all demand.
	
	However it seems unlikely in the case of only two links.  Therefore, if the links could coordinate their actions they would want to.  Even in the absence of formal cartels, strategic gaming and various price signaling methods are possible.   For instance, a far sighted link KL, seeing that a price war will ultimately hurt both firms, may only match the price cut rather than undercut in retaliation.  If IJ did not follow with a price cut, a price will be maintained.  It has been argued (Chamberlin 1933), that the duopoly would act as a monopoly, and both links would charge the monopoly price and split the demand evenly, because that is the best result for each since lowering prices will lead to a price war, with one link either matching or undercutting the other, in both cases resulting in smaller profits.

=== Case 4. Monopoly and Congestion ===

	The previous three cases did not exploit any special features of transportation systems.  In this case travel time is introduced on the network used in Case 1.  Here demand is a function of both Price (&lt;math&gt;P&lt;/math&gt;) and Time (&lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;):
	
&lt;math&gt;	
	Q_d = f(P,T)
&lt;/math&gt;

For this example is given by linear form:

&lt;math&gt;
	Q_d = \beta_0 - \beta_1P - \beta_2T
&lt;/math&gt;

where travel time is evaluated with the following expression incorporating both distance effects and congestion (queuing at a bottleneck over a fixed period with steady demand):

if &lt;math&gt;  (Q_d/Q_o) &lt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T = T_{f} &lt;/math&gt;

if &lt;math&gt;(Q_d/Q_o) \ge 1 &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T=T_f + (C/2)((Q_d/Q_o) - 1)&lt;/math&gt;
	
where:	&lt;math&gt;T_f&lt;/math&gt; = freeflow travel time, 
	&lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt; = length of congested period, 
	&lt;math&gt;Q_o&lt;/math&gt; = maximum flow through bottleneck.

	Because &lt;math&gt;T_f&lt;/math&gt; is a constant, and we are dealing with only a single link, it can be combined with &lt;math&gt;\beta_0&lt;/math&gt; for the analysis and won’t be considered further.  By inspection, if &lt;math&gt;Q_o&lt;/math&gt; is large, it too does not figure into the analysis.  From Case 1, with the &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; as given, &lt;math&gt;Q_o&lt;/math&gt; is only important if it is less than &lt;math&gt;Q_d = 500&lt;/math&gt;.  For this example then, we will set &lt;math&gt;Q_o&lt;/math&gt; at a value less than 500, in this case assume &lt;math&gt;Q_o = 250&lt;/math&gt;.
	
	As before, the objective of the link is to maximize profit &lt;math&gt;\pi= P Q_d(P)&lt;/math&gt;. Profit is maximized when the first derivative is set to zero and the second derivative is negative.
	
&lt;math&gt;\pi=PQ_d(P)=P(\beta_0-\beta_1P-\beta_2T)=\beta_0P-\beta_1P^2-\beta_2P(C/2)((Q_d/Q_o)-1)&lt;/math&gt;

Giving the following first order conditions (f.o.c.):

&lt;math&gt;\delta\pi/dP=\beta_0-2\beta_1P-\beta_2(C/2)((Q_d/Q_o)-1)=0&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;P = (\beta_0-\beta_2(C/2)((Q_d/Q_o)-1))/(2\beta_1)&lt;/math&gt;
	
Solving equations (4.2) and (4.6) simultaneously, at values: &lt;math&gt;\beta_0= 1000&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\beta_1= \beta_2 =1&lt;/math&gt;, reflecting that the value of time for all homogenous travelers is 1 in the chosen unit set,  &lt;math&gt;C=1800&lt;/math&gt;, representing 1800 time units (such as seconds) of congestion, we get the following answer: &lt;math&gt;P = Q_d = 339.3, T = 320.4&lt;/math&gt;.   It is thus to the advantage of the monopoly in the short term, with capacity fixed, to allow congestion (delay) to continue, rather than raising prices high enough to eliminate it entirely.  In the longer term, capacity expansion (which reduces delay), will allow the monopoly to charge a higher price.  In this case,&lt;math&gt; \pi=115,600&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;consumer surplus = 57,800&lt;/math&gt;.  There is a large deadweight loss to congestion, as can be seen by comparing with Case 1.

=== Simulation ===

More complex networks are not easily analyzed in the above fashion.  Links serve as complements and substitutes at the same time.  Simulation models address the same questions posed in the analytic model on more complex networks, that is, what are the performance measures and market organization under different model parameters and scenarios.  Second, we can consider market organization within the model framework, so that the question becomes: What market organization emerges under alternative assumptions, and what are the social welfare consequences of the organization?

Competing links restrict the price that an autonomous link can charge and still maximize profits.  Furthermore, it is likely that government regulations will ultimately constrain prices, though the level of regulation may provide great latitude to the owners.  It is anticipated that each link will have an objective function for profit maximization.   However, depending upon assumptions of whether the firm perfectly knows market demand, and how the firm treats the actions of competitors, the Nash equilibrium solution to the problem may not be unique, or even exist. 

Because the demand on a link depends on the price of both upstream and downstream links, its complements, revenue sharing between complementary links, and the concomitant coordination of prices, may better serve all links, increasing their profits as well as increasing social welfare. Vertical integration among highly complementary links is Pareto efficient. 

It is widely recognized that the roadway network is subject to economies of density, at least up to a point.  This means that as the flow of traffic on a link increases, all else equal, the average cost of operating the link declines.   It is less clear if links are subject to economies of scale, that it is cheaper per unit of output (for instance per  passenger kilometer traveled) to build and manage two links, a longer link, or a wider link than it is to build and manage a single link, a shorter link, or a narrower link.   If there are such economies of scale, then link cost functions should reflect this. 

Different classes of users (rich or poor; or cars, buses, or trucks) have different values of time.  The amount of time spent on a link depends upon flow on that link, which in turn depends on price.  It may thus be a viable strategy for some links to price high and serve fewer customers with a high value of time, and others to price low and serve more customers with a lower value of time.  It is hypothesized that in a sufficiently complex network, such distinct pricing strategies should emerge from simple profit maximizing rules and limited amounts of coordination.



There are a number of parameters and rules to be considered in such simulation model, some are listed below.  


==== Parameters ====

''Network Size and Shape''.  The first issue that must be considered is the size of network in terms of  the number of links and nodes and how those links connect, determined by the shape of the network  (symmetric: grid, radial;  asymmetric).  While the research will begin with a small network, it is possible that the equilibrium conditions found on limited networks may not emerge on more complex networks, giving cause for considering a more realistic system.

''Demand Size and Shape''.  A second issue is the number of origin-destination markets served by the network, the level of demand, and the number of user classes (each with a different value of time).  Again, while the research will begin with very simple assumptions, the results under simple conditions may be very different from those under slightly more complex circumstances.

==== Rules ====

''Profit Seeking''.  How do autonomous links determine the profit maximizing price in a dynamic situation?   Underlying the decision of each autonomous link is an objective function, profit maximization given certain amounts of information, and a behavioral rule which dictates the amount and direction of price changes depending on certain factors.  Once a link has found a toll which it can neither raise nor lower without losing profit, it will be tempted to stick with it. However, a more intelligent link may realize that while it may have found a local maxima, because of the non-linearities comprising a complex network, it may not be at a global maxima.  Furthermore other links may not be so firmly attached to their decision, and a periodic probing of the market landscape by testing alternative prices is in order.  This too requires rules.

''Revenue Sharing''.  It may be advantageous for complementary links to form coalitions to coordinate their action to maximize their profit.  How do these coalition form?  By the inclusion of a share of the profits of other links in one link’s objective function, that link can price more appropriately. What level of revenue sharing, between 0 and 100 percent is best?  These questions need to be tested with the model.  An interlink negotiation process will need to be developed.

''Cost Sharing''. Similar to revenue sharing is the sharing of certain expenses that each link faces.  Links face large expenses periodically, such as resurfacing or snow clearance in winter, that have economies of scale.  These economies of scale may be realized either through single ownership of a great many links or through the formation of economic networks.  Just as revenue sharing between links is a variable which can be negotiated, so is cost sharing.

''Rule Evaluation and Propagation''.  A final set of considerations is the possibility of competition between rules.  If we consider the rules to be identified with the firms which own links or shares of links, and set pricing policy, the rules can compete.  Accumulated profits can be used by more successful rules to buy shares from less successful rules.  The decision to sell will compare future expected profits under current management with the lump sum payment by a competing firm.  An open market in the shares of links will need to be modeled to test these issues.  Similarly, it may be possible to model rules which learn, and obtain greater intelligence iteration to iteration.

== Discussion ==

Just as airline networks seem to have evolved a hub and spoke hierarchy, a specific geometry may be optimal in a private highway network.  Initial analysis indicates that there are advantages to both the private and social welfare to vertical integration of highly complementary links.  However the degree of complementarity for which integration serves both public and private interests remains to be determined.  Other issues that are to be examined include the influence of substitutes and degree of competition on pricing policies through cross-elasticity of demand, economies of scale in the provision of infrastructure, multiple classes of users with different values of time, “free” roads competing with toll roads, and the consequences of regulatory constraints.  Using the principles developed under the analytic approach, a repeated game of road pricing by autonomous links learning the behavior of the system through adaptive expectation will be developed.

No. Thanks. Really?  It's all madness. Seriously.

== Welcome back ==

Hi Lwan98,

Welcome back to Wikibooks - it's nice to have you back again.  I hope you had a good summer! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 15:51, 31 August 2007 (UTC)

== Volcanoes ==

Hi Lwan,

I notice you removed all the content from the Volcanoes page in your sandbox.  I'm guessing Google found it because I changed the honor_header template to do automatic categorization (that's how I found the page anyhow).  Of course, removing the content does not get rid of the old page - it's all still there under the history tab.  If you want, I can delete it for you, but I would urge you to not do that.

Rather, I think we should move it into the regular name space and add &lt;nowiki&gt;[[Category:Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Proposed Honors]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; to the page.  Once the honor is approved, we can make any necessary edits and then add it to the Nature page. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 13:40, 18 October 2007 (UTC)

* Hey Jim, I knew that wikibooks kept a copy/history of it. I wanted to throw off Google although I think Google is smarter than me. I'd simply edited the page, copied all the contents, and created a new page (because I need the info) still in my Sandbox prefixed by the intials of United States and the postal abbreviation for the state. I'm not sure what's best for the Florida honors and if this is the forum for it (seems logical, but then we might get into hierarchal(sp?) issues). I'm keeping it in my sandbox for the present. Might process other Florida honors. ~Lester 14:53, 21 October 2007 (UTC)

*'''Ha!''' I see you've been hard at work [Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/'''Florida Conference''']. Guess that's where I'll put it. ~Lester 14:53, 21 October 2007 (UTC)

: Chuckle - believe it or not, that category was created semi-autonomously.  I changed the honor_header template to create categories.  I did edit your header, to separate the &quot;Nature&quot; and &quot;Florida Conference&quot; into two fields.  The fourth field automatically becomes a category.  I wouldn't mind at all if we added more FL conf honors.  It needn't mess with the hierarchy either - just file Volcanoes under Nature, and we can slap together an icon for all FL honors.  It will automatically go into the FL category.  I've even been thinking about deleting the [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book/Division]] page all together.  It just doesn't make sense to me to divide them out like that, especially since we have categories now. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 15:38, 21 October 2007 (UTC)

:: Okay, you can delete &quot;User:Lwan98/Sandbox/Volcanoes‎&quot; now, since I've moved the ''real one'' under Nature. ~lester 13:36, 22 October 2007 (UTC)

== Currency template ==
Good exclusion. I should have thought of that and the appearance if it, but that just flew past me ;&lt; ~lester 15:13, 1 November 2007 (UTC)
: The image had been deleted from the Commons.  I didn't mind so much that it was in the gallery, but at the same time felt no burden to find a replacement image. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 15:26, 1 November 2007 (UTC)

== Commons Upload ==

Hi Lester,

I fixed the problem you were having with the water knot image.  The original image was uploaded to Wikipedia rather than to the Commons.  To fix that, you hafta download a full resolution image to your own computer, then upload it to the commons.  If you select the &quot;It is from another Wikimedia project&quot; option, the next page will have a link at the top to the [http://tools.wikimedia.de/~magnus/commonshelper.php CommonsHelper tool] which is very nice.  Go there, paste in the image name, and submit.  Then copy the junk they give you in that window into the edit window at the commons.  Voila, all the info from Wikipedia is retained. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] 18:40, 5 November 2007 (UTC)
* Ya! Commons was having a problem this mornin' and gave me an error, so I was jest waitin' out the server/error. Thanks. ~Lester 18:43, 5 November 2007 (UTC)
* Grr! My locale must be stoppin' my uploads. Will have to get to it later. ~Lester 19:00, 5 November 2007 (UTC)

== Stages ==

Hi Lwan,

The stage and stage_short templates only accept No_work, 00%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% as the progress parameter.  I have been interpreting 75% to mean &quot;at least 75%, but less than 100%&quot;, so I changed your 90 to 75 for Lighthouses - Advanced.  I have also been going by whether or not x% of the requirements have been completely answered, and counting half-answered requirements as contributing nothing.  In a nutshell:

* No_work means the requirements are there, but no answers are.
* 00%  means some answers are there, but less than 25% of the requirements have complete answers.
* 25%  means at least 25% of the requirements have complete answers, but fewer than 50% do.
* etc.
* 100% means all requirements have enough answers so that the honor can be earned with what's there.

An example would be the chemistry honor, which we declared complete before all the experiments were explained.  The requirement was to do 5 of the ten that were listed, so we could mark it as complete as soon as 5 were ready.  We did go on to add the other five, and we did use the TODO template to indicate that more work was needed on that honor.

Hope that clears a few things up.  Thanks for your work! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 18:03, 22 January 2008 (UTC)

:* sorry - jumped the gun - had just one more item to research/add. done now. Lester, 18:14, 22 January 2008 (UTC)


==Question?==
The following look complete to me:
* http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Adventist_Youth_Honors_Answer_Book/Nature/Cats_-_Advanced
* http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Adventist_Youth_Honors_Answer_Book/Nature/Maple_Sugar_-_Advanced
and since I did no work on them, I don't want to inadvertently get credit for marking it complete.
----
: I have never interpreted marking them as complete as taking credit for them.  

: I did the work on Cats - Advanced, but didn't do anything for requirement 3.  It's been almost 30 years since I had a cat, which disqualifies me as an expert dispenser of cat care information.  At a minimum, the subquestions in requirement three should be answered first (such as &quot;Why should your cat not be allowed to roam the neighborhood free?&quot; and &quot;explain the relationship of house cats on the environment and why it is best they not be allowed to become feral.&quot;  Also, some tips for contacting a local humane society (check the yellow pages?) should be added.

: For Maple Sugar, we need: 
:* Detailed instruction for tapping a tree.  
:* Where can the equipment be found? 
:* How do you boil it down (this is normally done outside with a fire which must be fed for several ''hours'').
:* A picture of the bark and a leaf.
:* How do I find a sugaring operation?
:* Three recipes

: That's why I have not marked them as complete. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 16:25, 28 January 2008 (UTC)

== &lt;big&gt;Using the sequencer to compile frames into an animation&lt;/big&gt; ==

== Preamble ==

When you render an animation, often it's a good idea to render the individual frames and then compile them into the animation. This has several benefits over rendering directly to a movie file. Some of them are these:
**If you discover a mistake in the render, you can modify sections of the animation and rerender those frames without having to rerender the whole animation.
**If the render crashes because the power went out or, (psst), blender crashed, you can pick up the render at the last rendered frame without having to rerender the whole animation

== Tutorial ==
*Open your animation in blender
Begin by opening blender to an animation that is ready to be rendered. 

*Set the render output to targa format.
press F10 to go the scene buttons and set the output format to Targa. Though you can use any image format you want, I use Targa because it has no compression and is at 100% quality.

[[Image:1 SetOutputFormat.jpg]]


*Set the file output location.
Set the location on your file system where you want all the frames to be saved to. 

'''IMPORTANT: Make sure that there is a slash at the end or else you are setting a filename not a filepath'''

[[Image:2_SetSaveLocation.jpg]]


*Set Endframe to match the animation
If you animated 500 frames, set the end frame to that same number.
the default is 250.

[[Image:3_SetEndFrame.jpg]]


*Render the animation!
Simply press the &quot;Anim&quot; button.

[[Image:4_RenderAnimButton.jpg]]

----

== Use the Sequencer to compile the images into a movie file ==

*Open a new blender and delete everything except the camera.

*Change the 3d window into the sequencer window.
(See image for explanation)

[[Image:5_Change3D_WinToSeqWin.jpg]]


*Add the images to the sequencer.
On the bottom of the sequencer window click Add&gt;&gt;Images then browse to the location where you saved the images, Press Cntrl-A (on linux enter &quot;*.tga&quot; or &quot;*.jpg&quot; in the field for filename) to select all the images and finally press “Select Image&quot; on the top-right. Attached to your mouse curser will be a long horizontal bar which represents all the images. Move it all the way to the left till the little number underneath it shows &quot;1&quot; and then Left-mouseclick to place it.

[[Image:6_SeqWinAddImages.jpg]]
[[Image:7_SeqImagesPlacement.jpg]]

*Set final movie format.
Note that you can also set the location that the movie is saved to by changing the path we set earlier.
[[Image:8_SetMovieFormat.jpg]]

*Enable Sequence render and animate!
Depress the Do Sequence button and press the Animate button and wait a few seconds till it's done. Browse to the location you saved your movie and enjoy the animation.

I hope you found this tutorial useful. If there are any errors in the tutorial, ''Please'' let me know, and I will fix them as soon as possible.

Blend happy and save often, --[[User:Radialronnie|Radialronnie]] ([[User talk:Radialronnie|talk]]) 22:47, 3 November 2008 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">The lifetimes of stars are determined by their mass, or the total amount of matter they contain. If an object is not sufficiently massive (at least about one tenth the mass of our Sun), it will not have enough gravity to squeeze itself tightly enough to heat itself up to stellar levels. Such an object will become either a planet-like body or an intermediate object called a &quot;brown dwarf.&quot; A &quot;brown dwarf&quot; simply never initiates stable hydrogen fusion and by definition never becomes a full-fledged star. Some brown dwarfs go through a phase of limited &quot;deuterium fusion&quot;, but this does not qualify to make them a full star. They eventually -- after very long periods of time -- simply go out and cool to the ambient temperature of the Universe.

Gas clouds (or just localized areas of larger gas clouds) that have at least one tenth the mass of the Sun, can get hot enough as they contract to start fusing hydrogen into helium. This is known a &quot;stable hydrogen fusion&quot; and it marks the birth of a true star. This requires temperatures in the millions of degrees. However, stars of such relatively low mass can sustain only very low levels of fusion, which is to say that they use their nuclear fuel slowly. So they do not grow very bright, and form small dim stars called red dwarfs. 

Generally, red dwarfs go through their lifetimes uneventfully, just slowly &quot;burning&quot; their nuclear fuel in a stable fashion. Eventually, they will run out of nuclear fuel, cool, and slowly become a burned out cinder known as a &quot;black dwarf.&quot;

Do not confuse the terms brown dwarf, red dwarf and black dwarf. A brown dwarf has a mass too low to ever become a star. It produces energy, perhaps even by a limited type of fusion, but never enough for &quot;stable hydrogen fusion. A red dwarf has low mass, but high enough to start stable hydrogen fusion, which qualifies it as a &quot;real&quot; star. However, it burns that fuel so slowly that it has a very long lifetime. It is likely that any red dwarf ever born since the Big Bang is still around, and has not yet turned into its final version, the &quot;black dwarf.&quot; Considering the extremely long lifetimes of red dwarfs, it is likely that no black dwarfs have yet formed in the Universe.

Do not confuse the term &quot;black dwarf&quot; with &quot;black hole&quot;, which is an utterly different object with a different origin.

      <comment>&quot;Bullwhip&quot; explanation. Various wordings, sentence structures.</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A supply chain can be better thought of as a web—an interconnected chain of &quot;nodes,&quot; in this case, suppliers. In short, a supply chain is a network of distributors (of materials or finished products) and transporters (again, of materials or finished products). A supply chain may be simple or complex, depending on the situation and the industry.

Now for a general question about networks: what is the difference between economic analysis of networks and network analysis of the economy? Economic analysis of networks is required to understand and predict the deployment of advanced technologies, such as road pricing, and how those technologies interact and depend on each other. The central idea of a network is links that reinforce each other. These links can be physical (threads, wires, beams, highways, rails, pipes) or socioeconomic (kinship, social, or exchange  relationships). The market, on the other hand, is a place where exchange of goods takes place. An economic network may be comprised of multiple markets. A market may sell the right to use, or the ownership of, physical networks.

== Network Model of the Economy ==
''Levinson, David and Kevin Krizek (2008) [http://nexus.umn.edu/Books/PNP.html  Planning for Place and Plexus: Metropolitan Land Use and Transport]. Routledge''

=== Nomenclature ===
[[Image:TE-SupplyChains-NetworkModelOfEconomy.png]]

Legend:
* Agent: stage s, market m, firm number n
* Open or hatched circles indicate production/consumption agent nodes
* Filled circles indicate market or exchange nodes
* Lines indicate links connection markets and agents 

There are three main elements: 
* the site of production/consumption (material transformation), 
* the site of exchange (ownership transformation), 
* and the connection between the two (spatio-temporal transformation).


While each of these elements is modeled as a link or node, it should be remembered that each can be expanded to form a subnetwork of itself if there is a desire to increase the detail or resolution of the analysis.   A production/consumption agent in an economic network has both suppliers and customers, and can be modeled as an “agent node” on a network. Because production and consumption are two sides of the same coin, they are referred to together, any process consumes inputs to produce outputs. The “exchange nodes” are defined by the convergence of “connection links,” and are analogous to markets.   

=== Linking Economy with Transportation ===

Clearly this situation is idealized.  Some firms may have different degrees of vertical integration, that is they may internalize what is represented here as an input market or the output market.  However, this figure does reflect that a production process may have economies of scope, so that a single firm produces for more than one output market, as is shown in Figure 1 between Stage 2 and Stage 3.  In the illustration, there are three stages (1,2,3 from left to right) several markets in each stage (for instance a market for capital and a market for labor) and multiple firms in each market.  Extending the chain far enough to the left and to the right, and incorporating enough of the economy, the markets connect with each other again, as the ultimate final consuming agent is the individual consuming goods and an ultimate input agent is an individual producing labor.

To compare with a conventional transportation network, a roadway link is a composite of the “agent node” and the “connection link”.  For each link on a highway, there is only one input market and one output market, each identified with a single node (an intersection), which makes the graphic representation and analysis simpler as the agent nodes are unnecessary  because the transformation is only spatial, not material.  While there is “conservation of flow” in the network, flows can be one way, the link moves traffic in one direction with nothing in return.  As part of a larger system, the link (more precisely, an agent: Department of Transportation, Turnpike Authority, private firm acting on behalf of the link) receives revenue from government or users, which is used to maintain the link.  

=== Payment ===
In one sense, the link is selling the right to be traveled on and is paid by users or government for this right.  
If it is not paid, it deteriorates over time (the payment comes from the link’s own capital stock which is dissipated). 
The more generalized version of a graphed economy subsumes the transportation network as a special case.  The use of this framework serves to incorporate, at least conceptually, financing in the standard highway network analysis, and thereby allows us to identify some pertinent issues.  

In particular if we identify links with firms, the issue of payment becomes clear. In order to operate, the link must be subsidized by government, be paid for directly by users, or allow its capital stock to deteriorate.  Direct payment from users equal to the marginal cost is clearly more efficient, it does not entail the social loss described in section 2 due to overuse and subsidy, and does not impose deadweight losses inherent in certain taxing structures.  Imposing road pricing is a natural conclusion to these problems.

=== Snapshot ===

Figure 1 is a snapshot, it describes the processes and relationships at a given point or window of time.  Over a long period of time, links and nodes are added and deleted as the economy grows and contracts, markets change, and innovation occurs in response to entrepreneurship and invention.  The purpose of this analysis is to provide a tool to examine how networks and relationships in general do happen.  We might extend the standard network flow idea of the least cost path to the process.  Then “final” customers on the right side purchase a bundle of goods which provides the highest utility or lowest cost, profit seeking production/consumption agents in the middle will act as efficient customers for the initial producers on the left, and efficient producers/transformers in their own right.  The network will generate welfare maximizing flows under the usual strong assumptions from microeconomics:  well defined property rights and the absence of externalities (or when there is internalization of externalities), the presence of competitive links throughout, convex cost functions, etc.  The interesting cases are in the absence of one or more of those conditions.  Furthermore, the degree to which the network itself is efficient is another, much more complex (and important) question.

== Supply Chains ==
''Ram Ganeshan, Terry P. Harrison,'' ''[http://lcm.csa.iisc.ernet.in/scm/supply_chain_intro.html An Introduction to Supply Chain Management]''

&quot;A supply chain is a network of facilities and distribution options that performs the functions of procurement of materials, transformation of these materials into intermediate and finished products, and the distribution of these finished products to customers.&quot;

&quot;Supply chains exist in both service and manufacturing organizations, although the complexity of the chain may vary greatly from industry to industry and firm to firm.&quot;

=== Single-Product Chain ===
[[Image:TE-SupplyChains-SingleProduct.png|thumb|right | Single product supply chain based on Ram Ganeshan and Terry P. Harrison]]

&quot;To the right is an example of a very simple supply chain for a single product, where raw material is procured from vendors, transformed into finished goods in a single step, and then transported to distribution centers, and ultimately, customers. Realistic supply chains have multiple end products with shared components, facilities and capacities. The flow of materials is not always along an arborescent network, various modes of transportation may be considered, and the bill of materials for the end items may be both deep and large.&quot;

=== Supply Chain Decisions ===
&quot;We classify the decisions for supply chain management into two broad categories -- strategic and operational.&quot; 

* Location Decisions 
* Production Decisions 
* Inventory Decisions 
* Transportation Decisions

== Modeling Approaches ==

Network Design methods, for the most part, provide normative models for the more strategic decisions. Optimization of system.
Inventory Control methods, on the other hand, give guiding policies for the operational decisions. These models typically assume a &quot;single site&quot; (i.e., ignore the network) and add supply chain characteristics to it, such as explicitly considering the site's relation to the others in the network.  These derive from Inventory Control optimization Simulation methods are used to evaluate the effectiveness of a pre-specified policy rather than develop new ones. It is the traditional question of &quot;What If?&quot; versus &quot;What's Best?&quot;.

== Bullwhip effect ==
{{see also|w:Bullwhip_effect|l1=Bullwhip effect}}

Because customer demand is rarely perfectly stable, businesses must forecast demand to properly position inventory and other resources. Forecasts are based on statistics, and they are rarely perfectly accurate. Because forecast errors are a given, companies often carry extra goods (an inventory buffer) called &quot;safety stock&quot; to account for and take advantage of possible unpredicted increases in demand. Moving up the supply chain from end-consumer to raw materials supplier, each supply chain participant has greater observed variation in demand and thus greater need for safety stock. In periods of rising demand, down-stream participants increase orders. In periods of falling demand, orders fall or stop to reduce inventory. The effect is that variations are amplified as one moves &quot;upstream&quot; in the supply chain (further from the customer).

The [[w:Beer distribution game|Beer Distribution Game]], developed by the MIT Sloan School of Management in the 1960s, is an excellent simulation of the sequence of events. In the game, several teams of at least four players are in competition to meet demand for beer casings, however, only one player has knowledge of actual customer demand. Verbal communication between team members is prohibited, resulting in both massive backlogs and massive inventory buildups—the bullwhip effect, as well as frantic players.

== Freight Logistics ==

Freight Logistics is the process of planning, implementing and controlling the efficient, effective flow and storage of raw materials, in-process inventory, finished goods, services and related information from point of origin to point of consumption to meet customer demands.

This management is increasingly important as producers move from a inventory based system (push) to a just-in-time system (pull). This is enabled by (and demands) reliable transportation and information technology. The process is multi-modal or inter-modal, that is, it uses multiple modes of transportation. Most products are loaded and unloaded multiple times at various stages within the logistics cycle.

Freight tons per capita has been increasing slowly (about 0.1% per year), but freight ton-miles has been increasing at more than 1% per year. In other words, freight being shipped farther and farther.

=== Railroads===
Railroads move low value commodities long distances slowly (e.g. coals, chemicals, farm products), as well as large items that can't be easily or efficiently moved by truck (e.g. cars and large machinery).

Class I—major railroads 
* Western (east west) Burlington Northern/Santa Fe, Union Pacific, 
* Eastern (east west) CSX, Norfolk Southern,
* Central (north south) Chicago and Northwestern, Illinois Central, Kansas City Southern, Grand Trunk Western (Canadian National), and Soo Line (Canadian Pacific).

Class II—regional and short line railroads

=== Trucks===
Trucks  move higher value products short distances rapidly.

Truckload—one shipment, one truck

Less than Truckload (LTL)—multiple shippers use same truck.

Some owned by manufacturers, some by private trucking firms, some by publicly held (stock market) trucking firms.

Small trucks are often used as private vehicles, so truck statistics need to be considered with care. Almost 60,000,000 trucks in United States.

=== Low Cost Envelope ===

Which mode is selected depends on which mode has the lowest cost, typically this can be illustrated with the low cost envelope:

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Smart Pointers ==
Using raw pointers to store allocated data and then cleaning them up in the destructor can generally be considered a very bad idea since it is error-prone.  Even temporarily storing allocated data in a raw pointer and then deleting it when done with it should be avoided for this reason.  For example, if your code throws an exception, it can be cumbersome to properly catch the exception and delete all allocated objects.  

Smart pointers can alleviate this headache by using the compiler and language semantics to ensure the pointer content is automatically released when the pointer itself goes out of scope.

&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;memory&gt;
class A
{
public:
        virtual ~A() {}
	virtual char val() = 0;
};

class B : public A
{
public:
	virtual char val() { return 'B'; }
};

A* get_a_new_b()
{
	return new B();
}

bool some_func()
{
	bool rval = true;
	std::auto_ptr&lt;A&gt; a( get_a_new_b() );
	try {
		std::cout &lt;&lt; a-&gt;val();
	} catch(...) {
		if( !a.get() ) {
			throw &quot;Memory allocation failure!&quot;;
		}
		rval = false;
	}
	return rval;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

{{TODO|Could note that the '''rebind''' pattern used by allocators is an alternative to using a template template parameter.  Historically the STL was largely developed before C++ compilers offered support for template template parameters.  Interestingly, modern template metaprogramming style has promoted a rebind-like approach instead of using template template parameters.|C++ Programming}}

==Semantics==
&lt;!-- Section content copied from http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Auto_ptr&amp;oldid=267300087 --&gt; 
The auto_ptr has semantics of strict ownership, meaning that the auto_ptr instance is the sole entity responsible for the object's lifetime. If an auto_ptr is copied, the source loses the reference. For example:
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;memory&gt;
using namespace std;
 
int main(int argc, char **arv)
{
    int *i = new int;
    auto_ptr&lt;int&gt; x(i);
    auto_ptr&lt;int&gt; y;
    
    y = x;
    
    cout &lt;&lt; x.get() &lt;&lt; endl;
    cout &lt;&lt; y.get() &lt;&lt; endl;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This code will print a NULL address for the first auto_ptr object and some non-NULL address for the second, showing that the source object lost the reference during the assignment (''=''). The raw pointer &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; in the example should not be deleted, as it will be deleted by the auto_ptr that owns the reference.  In fact, &lt;code&gt;new int&lt;/code&gt; could be passed directly into x, eliminating the need for &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;.

Notice that the object pointed by an auto_ptr is destructed using &lt;code&gt;operator delete&lt;/code&gt;; this means that you should only use auto_ptr for pointers obtained with &lt;code&gt;operator new&lt;/code&gt;. This excludes pointers returned by &lt;code&gt;malloc(), calloc() or realloc()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;operator new[]&lt;/code&gt;.

      <comment>/* Far-Western Blotting */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Western Blotting is another technique that utilizes [[Structural Biochemistry/Protein function/Antibodies|antibodies]] to detect the presence of a specific [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|protein]] in a sample. It is capable of detecting small amounts of protein within a cell or body fluid. Western blotting grants the ability to find proteins in a mixture.

Western blotting, which originated from the laboratory of George Stark at Stanford, is the technique for detecting a particular protein by staining with specific antibody. Its analysis can give us the information about the size of the protein or how much protein accumulated in cells. It does not mean that it can do for any protein since in the case the protein is degraded quickly; it is hard to detect it well. 
The important thing in this technique is antibody since Western blotting is based on the use of a “quality” antibody as a probe to detect specific protein. In this technique, first we separate the protein by using SDS-poly-acryl-amide gel electrophoresis, which base on the protein’s size. Later, those proteins on the gel are transferred to the surface of a polymer sheet by blotting.  As soon as we add antibody that is specific for the desired protein to the sheet, it will bind to this protein since they have nothing else to bind to. Later, we wash unbound primary antibody, and this protein-primary antibody can be detected by secondary antibody. Those secondary antibody can only recognize the primary antibody and many of them bind to one primary antibody and give out the signal, which is a radioactive label on the secondary antibody produces a dark band on X-ray film.

==Techniques==
[[Image:Western Blot.png‎|thumb|The results of a Western Blot]]

#Sample undergoes [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Purification/SDS-Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis|SDS PAGE]] (Sodium Dodecyl Sulfate - Polyacrylamide Gel Electrophoresis) in which SDS detergent is attached to proteins, giving them negative charge relative to size so that proteins migrate to positive charged cathode. Larger proteins move slower through the acrylamide gel matrix whereas smaller proteins can move faster resulting in a distinct gradient of bands separated based on speed of travel through the matrix and subsequently size.
#The resulting bands of proteins are transferred onto a polymer sheet (nitrocellulose filter or polyvinylidene difluoride, PVDF) that binds proteins. This allows the proteins to bind to antibodies.
#Since the polymer sheet binds all proteins, the remaining empty space on the sheet must be blocked so it does not react with the antibody. This is done by washing the polymer sheet in non-fat dry milk, which contains casein (a protein), which will cover the rest of the sheet.
#The sheet is then incubated with the primary antibody specific for the target protein. After washed and diluted, the sheet is again incubated with the secondary antibody, which binds to the primary antibody. Usually, this secondary antibody is fuorescent or radioactive labeled. The sheet is again washed and diluted.
#The sheet is incubated with the enzyme substrate that would make the secondary antibody to emit light. Photographic films will detect this light as dark bands. The radioactive labeled antibodies are detected with X-ray films.

'''Factors Influencing Transfer'''

''The buffer''

A buffer that is commonly used for transfer is Tris-glycine which has pH 8.3 with a low concentration of SDS and 20% methanol. Glycine is used instead of Cl because it has a lower charge density and less current means less heat production. At this pH, many proteins will have a slightly negative charge which will make proteins transfer our easier since they will tend to move towards the positive charged electrode. SDS favors elution from the gel because it covers protein with negative charge. But if the protein is too negatively charged the hydrophobic membrane will repel the protein hence the protein will be less likely to transfer onto the membrane. To prevent that, methanol will be use to remove SDS from proteins which covers hydrophobic sites on the protein which can then bind to the membrane. If there is no methanol, elution from the gel is favored but binding to the membrane is poor. If there is too much methanol then the SDS could all come off before proteins leave the gel and the exposed hydrophobic regions could aggregate forming large protein aggregates that would be trapped in gel hence cannot transfer out.

''The Membrane''

There are different kinds of membrane with different pore sizes. The most commonly used membrane has pore sizes around 0.45 micrometer but smaller pore sizes are necessary to efficiently trap proteins that has size less than 20kDa.

''Voltage during transfer''

The current is more critical than the voltage. One of the factors here is the heating. The second factor is that if the current is too high, proteins with low molecular weight will move through the membrane so fast that they do not have a chance to bind with the membrane.

''Time to transfer'' 

The migration of the proteins will depend on the sizes. The larger the size of protein the longer time it will take to migrate. Sometimes two layers of membrane are placed next to the gel to trap smaller proteins that might pass through the first membrane. 

''Protein charge''

If a protein has positively charged after SDS removed then they will be difficult to transfer. Since their isoelectric points can be similar to the pH of the buffer system. Hence, the protein will not migrate toward the positive electrode and not transfer onto the membrane. We can solve this problem by raising the buffer system to higher pH.

==Advantages of Western Blotting==

•Western blotting is effective and useful method to detect and characterize proteins in small amounts, such as clock proteins. Moreover, clock proteins’ other properties like half-life, molar amounts can also be found using western blotting.

•Immunogenic responses from infectious agents (ex. viruses, bacteria) are hard to find since they are difficult to isolate from patient sample. But Western blotting can detect this.

•Western Blotting utilizes not only antigens, but also antisera as a diagnostic tool. Antisera is widely used in the test for HIV presence.

•Compared to ELISA, Western blotting has higher specificity; the higher specificity, the more the method is independent of the specificity of antibodies.

•Polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF), or Nylon, is often used as membrane in Western blotting, since it has a high protein-binding capacity and chemical stability. Even, some protein groups only bind to Nylon or favor strongly to it.  

•Among three common enzyme substrates, Fluorescent and Chemiluminescent create light detectable through X-ray or scanners. This ability enables high levels of sensitivity and quicker processing time.

==Disadvantages of Western Blotting==

•A non-intended protein has a slight chance of reacting with the secondary anti-body, resulting in the labeling of an incorrect protein.

•Incidental phosphorylation or oxidation of proteins may result in multiple bands appearing after sample is processed.

•The appearance of bubbles may occur when transferring the sample from the gel/membrane sandwich and may also occur when incubating the sample with antibodies, resulting in a skewed band reading.

•If the transfer time is not sufficient when transferring proteins to the membrane, the larger proteins of higher molecular weight will not transfer properly, resulting in an incorrect or no band reading at all.

•Too much methanol in the transfer buffer decreases the transfer efficiency of proteins from the gel to the membrane; however methanol aids in protein binding to several different membranes, so a correct balance is required.

•Western Blotting is a very delicate process requiring the correct amounts of each component in order for successful identification of the presence of proteins.  An imbalance in any step of the procedure may skew the entire process.

== Far-Western Blotting ==

Far- western blotting is  based on the Western blotting technique. The major difference is that  far-western  uses  non-antibody  proteins which  can  bind to the desired protein.  Far-western is used  to detect protein protein interactions.

== Eastern Blotting==

Eastern blotting is an extension of western blotting and is used in the detection of protein post-translational modifications. Eastern blotting is used to detect lipoylated, glycosylated or phosphorylated proteins or proteins with other post translational modifications. Blotting is mostly  done from a SDS-PAGE gel on to a PVDF or nitrocellulose membrane. Post translational protein modifications including phosphorylation,  lipoylation, glycosylation  or any other protein modifications  are detected  by specific probes.

== Far-Eastern Blotting ==

Analyses lines  separated by  high-performance thin layer chromatography (HPTLC).  Further analysis is prepared by  being transferred form the HPTLC plate to a PVDF then   by either performing enzymatic or ligand assays or mass spectrometry. A disadvantage to this procedure is the amount of downtime present in being able to prepare both a chromatography and a western blotting continuously since both require post experimental readings which have to be prepared separately.

Far-eastern blotting allows for the following techniques:
	■	Purification of glycosphingolipids and phospholipids.
	■	Structural analysis of lipids in conjunction with direct mass spectrometry.
	■	Binding study using various ligands such as antibodies, lectins, bacterium, viruses, and toxins, and
	■	Enzyme reaction on membranes.

==Additional information==

• In addition, it is important to know that in most cases, the blot is a nitrocellulose or polyvinylidene membrane, which is mobile when submersed in gel and electrical current is applied. In order for the proteins to move along the gel, the proteins must be soluble. A lysis buffer is needed to accomplish this. (Reference: www.abcam.com/ps/pdf/protocols/WB-beginner.pdf).

• Western Blotting is used in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) test.  A blot is used to detect anti-HIV antibody in a human blood sample.  The cells that have been infected by HIV have their proteins separated and blotted on the membrane.  The human blood sample is then applied in the antibody incubation step and the free antibody is washed away, followed by a secondary anti-human antibody is added.  After x-ray analysis, the bands that are stained show which proteins the person's blood contains antibodies to.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

The First Law of Thermodynamics is an expression of the principle of the conservation of energy. It states that the total energy of a system and its surroundings is constant, and energy can be transformed, but may not be created or destroyed. 

The First Law can be applied to living organisms by thinking of them as a system. A system cannot output more energy than it contains without an external source of more energy. Once the potential energy locked in carbohydrates and other energy sources are converted into kinetic energy (energy in use or motion) by the organism, the organism will not obtain more  until energy is imputed again. This is important to understand since the variety of tasks that are performed by cells, ribosomes, proteins, etc. are only possible through the intake and transformation of pre-assembled molecules into energy. 

The general equation that describes this theory is:


&lt;math&gt;dU=\delta Q-\delta W\,&lt;/math&gt;        


where &lt;b&gt;dU&lt;/b&gt; is the change in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_energy internal energy], &lt;b&gt;dq&lt;/b&gt; is the infinitesimal heat exchanged, and &lt;b&gt;dw&lt;/b&gt; is the infinitesimal work performed. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(thermodynamics) Work] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat heat] are not [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/State_variable state variables] where as internal energy is. In this equation, it is demonstrated that only heat and work can lead to a change in the internal energy of a system, which is defined as the total of all kinetic and potential energy of everything within a closed system. This equation may also be described in words as: although energy assumes many forms, the total quantity of energy is constant; and when energy disappears in one form, it appears simultaneously in other forms.

In addition to work and external potential and kinetic energy, the generalization of the law of conservation of mechanical energy was made possible by the recognition of heat and internal energy as forms of energy. As a matter of fact, examples such as surface energy, electrical energy, and magnetic energy can all serve as extensions to the generalization stated above. The validity of this generalization was supported by overwhelming amount of evidence, which has raised its stature to a law of science, known as the First Law of Thermodynamics.

It is important to look at how the internal energy of system changes under constant pressure and temperature conditions because many chemical reactions take place under these specified conditions. Using the definition of the internal energy and assuming that only expansion work is done, one may write:


&lt;math&gt;dU=\delta Q-P*\delta V\, &lt;/math&gt;


Expansion of the terms gives:


'''ΔU = U&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - U&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = Q&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; + W = Q&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; - P*ΔV = Q&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; - P*(V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)'''


Finally, rearrangement for Q&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; gives:


'''Q = (U&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; -P*V&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) - (U&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - P*V&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Curry &amp; Webster | year = 1999 | title = Thermodynamics of Atmospheres and Oceans | edition = 1st | publisher = ACADEMIC PRESS | id = 0-12-199570-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;


Since U, P, and V are all state variables, we may define Q&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;, the heat transferred at constant pressure, as a new state function called the enthalpy, H.  We can represent this new state function as:


'''H = U + PV'''


Where H, U, and V are molar or unit-mass values. U denotes the internal energy of a system, P denotes pressure, and V denotes volume.

When heat is added to a system, the internal energy of the system will increase, which, in turn, increases [[Structural Biochemistry/Enthalpy|enthalpy]]. Work done by the surroundings on that system will produce similar (positive work) results. Conversely, heat lost to the surroundings or work done by the system are given a negative sign for enthalpy and work.  In other words, any change in the energy of a system must result in a corresponding change in the surroundings. Therefore, energy is transferred from the system to the surroundings (reset of the universe), or from the surroundings to the system. And thus, energy can neither be created nor destroyed.

The sphere of influence of the process is divided into two parts when the First Law of Thermodynamics is applied to a given process. The region in which the process occurs is set apart as the system; everything with which the system interacts is its surroundings. A system may be of any size; its boundaries may be real or imaginary, rigid or flexible. A system usually consists of a single substance; however, complex systems consist multiple substances may also be found in scientific and engineering applications. In any event, the equations of thermodynamics are written with reference to a well-defined system. Attention is often focused on the particular process of interest and on the equipment and material involved in the process directly. However, the First Law of Thermodynamics applies to the system and its surroundings; not to the system alone.

==Conclusion==
The first law of thermodynamics is that energy can neither be created or destroyed.

General Form
*accumulation = input - output 
*input = rate of energy (potential, kinetic, internal) is inputted into the system + rate of heat entering the system
*output = rate of heat leaving the system + rate at which it leaves as work 
*accumulation = rate of energy in the system

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==

The first law of thermodynamics states that energy is conserved, however, it only describes the transformations observed, and it doesn’t impose any restriction on the process direction. Nevertheless, such a restriction has been observed and proved to be exited in all thermodynamic applications. The need of a law describing this phenomenon gives rise to the second law of thermodynamics.

The &lt;b&gt;Second Law of Thermodynamics&lt;/b&gt; states that the entropy of a closed system is constantly increasing with respect to time. 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Levine| first = Ira N. | year = 2005 | title = Physical Chemistry| edition = 6th Ed. | publisher = McGraw Hill Publishing Company| id = ISBN0-0-07-049508-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
It is often said jokingly that the first law states that one cannot win and that the second law states that one cannot even break even. 

The second law of thermodynamics may be expressed in two related statements as follows:

Statement 1: It is impossible to operate a system in such a way that heat absorbed by the system is completely converted into work done by the system.

Statement 2: It is impossible for a process to consist solely in the transfer of heat from one temperature level to a higher one.

Statement 1 is not contradictory to the first law of thermodynamics. Statement 1 does not imply that heat cannot be converted to work done by the system; it only implies that either the system or the surroundings have to be changed or modified when such a process takes place. As a corollary, any continuous production of work from heat is proved to be impossible. To compress the gas back to its initial state, energy must be drawn from the surroundings in the form of work; heat is transferred to the surroundings to maintain constant temperature at the same time. The amount of work gained from expansion is required by the reverse process described above, thus the production of net work is impossible.

[[File:Heat Conversion to Work.png|thumb|Heat Conversion to Work]]

A thermodynamic theorem, the Carnot’s theorem is generated based on statement 2. The Carnot’s theorem states that no engine can have a higher thermal efficiency than that of a Carnot engine. Since a Carnot engine is reversible, it is able to transfer heat form one temperature level to a higher one. Although such an engine does not exist in the real world, it is the most efficient engine based on the laws of thermodynamics.

The study of heat engines, devices that are able to convert heat to work in a cyclical fashion, often serves as the classical approach to the second law. This macroscopic viewpoint of properties was able to be conducted without any knowledge of either the structure or the behavior of molecules. Any heat engines consist the following cycles: absorption of heat into the system at a relatively high temperature, rejection of heat to the surroundings at a relatively low temperature, and production of work. The two temperature levels are often referred to as heat reservoirs; the higher temperature level as the hot reservoir, and the lower temperature level as the cold reservoir. In thermodynamic applications, the working fluid, a liquid or a gas, connects the hot and the cold reservoirs in the sense that it absorbs heat from the hot reservoir, produces work, discards heat to the cold reservoir, and returns to its initial state to get ready for a new cycle.

== '''Spontaneous Processes and Entropy''' ==


Some processes proceed spontaneously in one direction, but not in the other. This process is similar to a gas diffusing to fill its container, but never really collecting at one end. These processes are said to be ''spontaneous''; in other words, they ''occur without outside intervention''.

[[Structural Biochemistry/Entropy|'''Entropy''']], denoted by the symbol '''S''', is the thermodynamic property that describes the spontaneity of a process. It is a macroscopic property of randomness or disorder, and is also a function that describes the number of arrangements (positions and/or energy levels) that are available to a system existing in a given state.

The Second Law of Thermodynamics can be explained with a simple example. Consider throwing a deck of ordered playing cards into the air and picking them all up at random. It is very improbable to pick up the cards in their original order because the probability for this to happen is so minute that we never really observe it. Entropy can be closely associated with &lt;b&gt;probability&lt;/b&gt;. The more ways a particular state can be achieved, the greater the likelihood (probability) of finding that state. However, this does &lt;b&gt;not&lt;/b&gt; mean that it is &lt;b&gt;impossible&lt;/b&gt; for the cards to be put back in their original order or for the gas to be only at one end of the container. It merely is &lt;b&gt;improbable&lt;/b&gt;. 

There is a natural &lt;b&gt;tendency&lt;/b&gt; toward disorder in closed systems because the state that has the highest probability of existing is where the system will be at equilibrium. The equilibrium state, such as within a container of gas, is referred to as the disordered state (where gas molecules are equally dispersed). The equilibrium state is the same as the disordered state because the gas molecules will occupy the largest volume possible, meaning they are all equally spaced out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Levine| first = Ira N. | year = 2005 | title = Physical Chemistry| edition = 6th Ed. | publisher = McGraw Hill Publishing Company| id = ISBN0-0-07-049508-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;



The change in entropy of the universe can be represented as

&lt;font size ='4'&gt;&lt;b&gt;ΔS&lt;sub&gt;univ&lt;/sub&gt;=ΔS&lt;sub&gt;sys&lt;/sub&gt;+ΔS&lt;sub&gt;surr&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/b&gt;

where ΔS&lt;sub&gt;sys&lt;/sub&gt; and  ΔS&lt;sub&gt;surr&lt;/sub&gt; represents the changes in entropy that occur in the system and the surrounding respectively.

If ΔS&lt;sub&gt;univ&lt;/sub&gt; is &lt;B&gt;positive&lt;/b&gt;, the entropy of the system &lt;b&gt;increases&lt;/b&gt;, and the process is spontaneous in the direction written. A &lt;b&gt;negative&lt;/b&gt; value for ΔS&lt;sub&gt;univ&lt;/sub&gt; indicates that the process is spontaneous in the &lt;b&gt;opposite&lt;/b&gt; direction. The system is at equilibrium, and the process has no tendency to occur if ΔS&lt;sub&gt;univ&lt;/ser ub&gt; is equal to zero.

&lt;big&gt;In some cases, particularly biological systems, it is hard to see how the entropy of universe is increasing. For example, when a leaf use carbon dioxide and nutrients to produce cellulose, the randomness and consequently entropy is decreasing. However, this process does not have any contradiction with second law of thermodynamic because it accompanies with increasing heat in the environment which increases the entropy.&lt;/big&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Berg| first = Jeremy M. | year = 2010 | title = Biochemistry| edition = 7th Ed. | publisher = W. H. Freeman and Company| id = ISBN0-1-42-922936-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Entropy has to do with the freedom of particle motion. As a result, when entropy increases in the system, it can cause a phase change from solid state to liquid state, and even to the gas state. In the solid state, the particles' movements are restricted and they have less freedom to move around in a fixed area. However, in a liquid state, particles have more freedom to move around. Therefore, in a gas state, the particles have so much greater freedom to move around. Consequently, entropy increases as one goes solid to liquid and to gas state. 

When such disorder occurs, the energy of motion becomes more dispersed. For instance,when a salt is dissolved in liquid water, there would be more ions and solvent molecules interacting with each other. As a result, the solution's energy of motion is more dispersed. The greater the freedom the particles have, the more energy of motion they would dispersed. 
                                 solid ---&gt; liquid ----&gt; gas
 less freedom for particles interaction --------&gt; much greater freedom for particles interaction
                 fixed energy of motion --------&gt; dispersed energy of motion
Therefore, the change in phase states and the freedom of motion of particles can help to determine whether a reaction is spontaneous or not.

&lt;ref&gt;Silberberg, Martin S.(2010). Principles of General Chemistry (2nd Edition).McGraw Hill Publishing Company. ISBN978-0-07-351108-05&lt;/ref&gt;==='''The number of Microstates and Entropy''' ===

As stated in the previous section about the freedom of motion and the dispersed energy of motion, they are the two factors that can determine the direction of the spontaneous reaction. Silberberg defines microstates as &quot;the quantized states of the whole system of a gas molecules&quot;. Microstates is about a gas molecules' state when it reacts with other molecules in the system. Consequently, there would be an increase in the energy of motion because the molecules vibrate and rotate around one another. In addition, there are different microstates for different conditions in the system. In thermodynamic terms, microstates can be related to entropy, the state of disorder, because the number of microstates is the number of ways that the thermal energy can be dispersed in the system. The equation is
                                        S= k ln W
      k (the Boltzmann constant)= R (gas constant)/ Avogadro's number= 1.38 x 10^ -23 J/K
      W= the number of microstates
      S is entropy
Therefore, entropy depends on the number of microstates.
            small number of microstates -----&gt; much greater number of microstates
                            low entropy -----&gt; high entropy

==='''The Effect of Temperature on Spontaneity''' ===


[[Structural Biochemistry/Entropy|Entropy]] changes in the surroundings ΔS&lt;sub&gt;surr&lt;/sub&gt; are primarily determined by heat flow. 

''The sign of ΔS&lt;sub&gt;surr&lt;/sub&gt; depends on the direction of the heat flow.''
In an exothermic process, the resulting energy flow increases the random motions in the surroundings, increasing the [[Structural Biochemistry/Entropy|entropy]] of the surroundings (ΔS&lt;sub&gt;surr&lt;/sub&gt; is positive). Similarly, the tendency for systems to undergo changes that lower its energy can be explained by the fact that when a system at constant temperature moves to a lower energy state, the energy it gives up is transferred to the surroundings, leading to an increase in entropy there. 

''The magnitude of ΔS&lt;sub&gt;surr&lt;/sub&gt; depends on the temperature.''
At high temperatures, atoms in the surroundings are in rapid motion. A given quantity of energy transferred to the surroundings do not make a large percent change in their motions. Thus, the impact of the transfer of a given quantity of energy as heat to or from the surroundings is greater at lower temperatures, where the randomness of the surroundings experience a greater percent change. 
In other words, ΔS&lt;sub&gt;surr&lt;/sub&gt; depends directly on the quantity of heat transferred and inversely on temperature.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Entropy (S) is the thermodynamic measure of randomness throughout a system (also simplified as “disorder”). Entropy can also be described as thermal energy not able to do work since energy becomes more evenly distributed as the system becomes more disordered. Entropy is particularly important when describing how energy is used and transferred within a system. As an exact value of entropy is impossible to measure; however, through relationships derived by both Josiah Willard Gibbs and James Clerk Maxwell the change in energy between one state and another can be calculated based on measurable functions, like temperature and pressure. That value in turn gives insight into how chemical reactions are favored and, most importantly, allows for the calculation of Gibbs Free Energy (ΔG = ΔH-TΔS). 

Using statistical mechanics of the gas phase, entropy can be estimated by
using Boltzmann’s formula. According to the formula, S = k ln W where k, the Boltzmann's constant, equals 1.381 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−23&lt;/sup&gt; (in J/K). The Boltzman's constant was calculated by relating to the gas constant R = kNA. W stands for the number of ways that the atoms or molecules in the sample can be arranged while still containing the same total energy.

It is important to note that the change in entropy, like temperature and volume, is a state function: the value is independent of the path used to get from the original state to the final state.  Additionally the overall change in entropy of the universe is positive, meaning that the universe is continuously moving to a state of higher disorder.

A simple example where entropy is increased is when ice melts to water. The structure of ice is a well-ordered, crystalline system. When energy is put into the system in the form of heat, molecules begin to move more rapidly and no longer have the neatly ordered structure of ice. Thus, there distribution throughout space is more “random”. Another example where entropy is increased is when a reaction produces more moles of products than the reactants in the same phase.

The favorability of intramolecular reactions over intermolecular reactions is explained entropically.  In an intermolecular coupling, two molecules come together to form one thus increasing the order in the system and decreasing the entropy.  In an intramolecular reaction there is one molecule to start and one at the end which does not change the entropy of the system in an unfavorable way as is seen in intermolecular reactions.

Entropy can further be divided into thermal disorder, in which the entropy increases as heat is added to the system, and positional disorder, which related to the increase in entropy as the volume of the system is increased.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, Chemical Principles The Quest for insight, Fourth Edition&lt;/ref&gt; 

Entropy is also of particular interest in biochemistry as one of the unofficial definitions of life is an aggregate of molecules that work to decrease entropy in a certain localized area or volume. Additionally, it helps describe many phenomenons found in biochemical systems, which are described next. 

==Entropy in Biochemical Interactions==
Entropy is a measure of the unavailable energy in a closed thermodynamic system that is also usually considered to be a measure of the system's disorder, that is a property of the system's state. It is varies directly with any reversible change in heat in the system and inverserly with the temperature of the system. 

Entropy can be a strong driving force in nature. For example, it plays a very large part in the behavior of [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Hydrophobic interaction|hydrophobic]] substances in water. A very common example of entropy at work would be lipids in solution. The lack of polarity in longer hydrocarbon chains tends to &quot;force&quot; water molecules to align themselves in an orderly pattern around the saturated part of the molecule. This orderly pattern decreases entropy as it prevents water from freely associating itself with other water molecules via [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Hydrogen bonds|hydrogen bonding]]. An increase in entropy would lead to a more negative [[Structural Biochemistry/Free energy|Gibbs Free Energy]], and a spontaneous reaction. The saturating effect of decreasing the change in entropy serves as the driving force for lipids to associate with one another instead of with water. Lipids coalesce to reduce the amount of water surrounding its molecules, and thereby increasing entropy. This phenomenon results in the formation of essential evolutionary components of life, such as lipid bilayer structures such as the  [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids/Lipid Bilayer|lipid bilayer membrane]]in eukaryotic cells. 

Another place that the entropic favoring of [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Hydrophobic interaction|hydrophobic]] molecules to dissociate with water can be found is in the active sites of [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzymes]]. Many enzymes have a high concentration of hydrophobic residues in their active sites. The binding of an enzyme to its substrate alleviates the lack of entropy by driving water molecules out of the active site.

The value of understanding entropy’s role in chemistry can be utilized in the lab.  For example, ammonium sulfate can be added in high concentrations to an aqueous solution containing at least one or more [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|proteins]].  Proteins are much larger than ammonium sulfate ions. Thus the condensed charge of the newly dissolved salt attracts the water molecules in solution to form hydrate shells around them.  In order to form these shells around ammonium sulfate, water molecules from the hydration shells around proteins must be used.  The hydration shells of proteins are generally more ordered since not all of the protein surface is charged nor are the charges as condensed. Thus, the decrease in water molecules around proteins reaches a limit where the proteins become insoluble in water and are precipitated out for isolation and further study.  .&lt;ref&gt;Whitford, Proteins: Structure and function, Chapter 9&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, entropy can also play a negative role in biochemistry.&lt;br&gt;
For example, denatured protein by heating is an example where entropy plays a role in denaturation.
In a folded protein, entropy is high due to its packed structure. As the protein becomes unfolded(denatured), the hydrophobic regions in a protein are surrounded by water.
Overall there is no change in entropy but the protein becomes denatured.

Oil spill in sea also follows the same argument.
&lt;ref&gt;ACS (http://learningcenter.nsta.org/products/symposia_seminars/ACS/webseminar3.aspx)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entropy during phase changes==
[[File:Entropy.png|thumb|An entropy diagram for phase changes of water]]

As mentioned earlier, entropy is the measure of disorder, and this is also the case when it comes to phase changes. 

This could be thought of a more simplified manner. For example, in the solid form of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, they are in a very rigid and ordered crystal structure. As the temperature is raised, the rigid crystal structures begin to loosen up from its tight grasp of one another(via hydrogen bonds), and eventually, melting occurs. The ice turns into liquid. There was an increase in the disorder of this system, it went from a solid rigid crystal structure, to a bunch of freely moving molecules. This amount of disorder for this phase change to occur is entropy, specifically in the case of melting, the entropy of fusion.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==History of Development==
The enthalpy of reaction at specific values of T and P is defined as the heat exchanged between the system and the surroundings as the reactants are transformed into products at conditions of constant T and P. The heat flowing into the system is given a positive sign. Also, the standard enthalpy of formation refers to one mole of the specified reaction at a presssure of 1 bar. 
The term &quot;enthalpy&quot; and its accurate definition did not come about until the late 1840s. Before then, scientists and engineers knew from experience that a fluid called heat transfers from a hotter object to a cooler object when they are brought into contact. The result is that the cold object becomes warmer, and the hot object becomes cooler as heat transfers between them. 
Enthalpy is also the heat energy that absorbed or released as the reactants and they become the products at a constant pressure. When enthalpy is negative, the heat energy is released. However, when enthalpy is positive, the reactants absorb the heat from their surroundings. 

A reasonable view is that there is something transferred from the hot object to the cold one. This “something” was referred as heat. Thus, it was convenient to say that heat always flows from higher temperature to lower one. This conclusion established the concept of temperature gradient, which may be viewed as the driving force for the transfer of energy as heat. Later, through conducting more precise measurements and experiments, scientists concluded that the rate of heat transfer from one object to another is proportional to the temperature difference between the two objects. Thus, the heat transfer is negligible when the temperature differences between the two objects are negligible.

==A Thermodynamic View of Heat==

Heat, or energy transferred between a hot and a cold object, is never regarded as being stored with an object from the thermodynamic point of view. Form this view point, heat is defined to exist only as energy is in transit from one object to another; or in the thermodynamic terminology, from the system to the surroundings. When heat is added or subtracted from a system or its surroundings, it is thought that energy is not stored in or being pulled away from the point of contact. Rather, heat is thought to act as kinetic and potential energy. The addition and subtraction processes are considered to be the transfer from potential energy to kinetic energy, and vice versa.

==Relationship between Heat and Enthalpy==

In spite of the transient nature of heat, the definition of heat is always viewed as a unique property of the object that is being measured. As mentioned above, temperature changes were used as the primary units to measure heat until the late 1840s. In fact, the definition of the unit of heat was based on the temperature change of a unit mass of water, as seen in the British thermal unit. The British thermal unit is commonly known as the Btu. 

The British thermal unit is defined as 1/180th quantity of heat which when transferred to one kilogram mass of water raised its temperature from 0 to 100 degree Celsius at standard atmospheric pressure. This primitive definition of heat failed to provide an accurate measurement. The main reason accounts for this inaccuracy lie in the reference object, which in this case is water. The measure temperature change is partially determined by the purity of the water. The purer the water is, the more amount of heat is need for the temperature to increase by one unit. 

In the twentieth century, more and more scientists realized that heat is just another form of energy that is being transferred by making contact of two objects. Thus it is convenient and practical to measure heat by using an energy unit. 

==The Modern Concept of Enthalpy==

The modern concept of enthalpy or heat was developed largely based on the series of experiments carried out by James P. Joule (1818–1889). Joule’s experiment involves carefully measured amounts of water, oil, and mercury in an insulated container. He placed known amounts of these afore mentioned substances in the container, and agitated the fluids with a rotating stirrer. The mechanical work needed to carry out the rotation was carefully calculated, and the temperature changes of the fluid temperatures were accurately measured. In his result, Joule stated that for each fluid that a fixed amount of work was required per unit mass for every degree of temperature rise caused by the mechanical work provided. Furthermore, the original temperature of the fluids could be restored by the transfer of heat through contact as simple as to cooler objects. The quantitative relationship between heat and work was thus firmly established by Joule’s experiment, which proved definitively that heat is a form of energy.

In order to give heat a more concrete definition and moreover, to recognize a common basis for all energy units, international steam table calorie is defined in relation to joule, the SI unit of energy. Joule is the mechanical work done when a force of one Newton acts through a distance of one meter. Upon the establishment of the SI unit, the international steam table calorie was defined as equivalent to 4.1868 Joule (exact, by definition) and thermochemical calorie is equivalent to 4.184 Joule (exact, by definition). As a reference, one international steam table Btu is equivalent to 1055.056 Joule, and one thermochemical Btu is equivalent to 1054.35 Joule. 

==Mathematical Expression of Enthalpy==

Enthalpy(H) is a measure of the heat energy of a reaction. The Enthalpy H of a thermodynamic system whose internal energy, pressure, and volume are U, P, and V is defined as H =U+PV Since U, P, and V are state functions, H is a state function. note from dw=-PdV that the product of P and V has the dimensions of work and hence of energy. Therefore it is legitimate to add U and PV. Naturally, H has units of energy. 

For example, a reaction that is [[Structural Biochemistry/Exergonic reaction|exothermic]] with have a negative change in enthalpy. This is because the enthalpy of the products is less that that of the reactants.

[[Image:Water enthalpy formation.JPG|right|231px|The enthalpy of water formation.]]

In mathematical terms enthalpy of a reaction can be known as the following: 

ΔH = (sums of bonds broken) - (sums of bonds formed)
 
ΔH = ΣnH&lt;sub&gt;products&lt;/sub&gt; - ΣnH&lt;sub&gt;reactants&lt;/sub&gt;

When ΔH is negative then the reaction is [[Structural Biochemistry/Exergonic reaction|exothermic]] and more bonds are formed than broken. 

If ΔH is positive then the reaction is [[Structural Biochemistry/Endergonic reaction|endothermic]]. Chemical bonds tend to form spontaneously that the negative value of ΔH represents exothermic reaction.

The enthalpy for the reverse reaction is equal in magnitude, but opposite in mathematical sign.

Enthalpy is a state function and thus according to Hess's Law, the overall enthalpy of the reaction is equal to the sum of the enthalpies of the individual reactions or steps for which the overall reaction can be divided.

Since enthalpy is a function defined for the sake of calculations, it is difficult to measure the actual enthalpy of a substance. The change in enthalpy however, is easily measured and is an important quantity in many calculations.

When enthalpy changes, it signifies there is a change of state happening in the system. But enthalpies are reversible in the sense that the physical state changes are usually reversible. Therefore, since the enthalpy for formation of everything is always given, then at any given change, the new enthalpy can be calculated.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Bioenergetics''' refers to the transformation of energy that occurs within living organisms.   In order to fuel the chemical mechanisms within cells, organisms require an input of energy.  This energy is used to drive chemical reactions and help store and process information, which is essential in propagating life.  Energy may be obtained from sunlight, in which the organisms are referred to as '''phototrophs''', or it may be extracted from chemicals, in which the organisms are referred to as '''chemotrophs'''.  Because energy may not be available at all times to fuel these life processes, organisms have adapted mechanisms to couple chemical reactions  so that exergonic reactions can provide energy for those that are endorgernic.

The chemical reactions performed by an organism make up its '''metabolism'''.  '''Catabolic reactions''' involve the break down of chemical molecules, while '''anabolic reactions''' involve the synthesis of compounds.

== The Laws of Thermodynamics ==

The energy processes in living organisms are defined by the basic laws of [[Structural Biochemistry/Thermodynamics|thermodynamics]].  The [[Structural Biochemistry/First law|first law]] dictates that the total energy present in the universe always remains constant (Note: though the energy total is static, it often changes forms such as when an animal converts the chemical energy of food to mechanical energy as it moves).  Meanwhile, the [[Structural Biochemistry/Second law|second law]] asserts that the total [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Structural_Biochemistry/Entropy entropy] present in the universe is ever increasing.

== The Energy Process ==

For phototrophs, sunlight takes the form of potential energy, while complex molecules serve as potential energy for chemotrophs. In living organisms, energy is commonly used in the form of work. This work energy is acquired by breaking weak bonds and forming stronger bonds. Work may take the form of synthetic chemical reactions, maintaining chemical and ionic gradients (homeostasis), and transferring genetic information.  This most important form of work is the polymerization of information-containing macromolecules, such as [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|protein]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/DNA|DNA]], and [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/RNA|RNA]].  These macromolecules form the basis of life and are what ultimately drive life’s processes.  Though mechanisms have been adapted to make the most efficient use of the acquired energy, some of it is inevitably released in the form of heat or metabolic waste products.  These waste products can be eliminated from the body of an organism and consumed by bacteria or other organisms that are able to extract energy from them.  Often, materials and compounds useless to one organism are energy sources for another and by this exchange energy is constantly recycled.

== Energy Coupling ==

In order to increase energetic efficiency, cells often couple reactions together.  [[Structural Biochemistry/Endergonic reaction|'''Endergonic''' reactions]] are those that require an input of energy.  [[Structural Biochemistry/Exergonic reaction|'''Exergonic''' reactions]] are those that release energy.  By coupling these two reactions together, the overall chemical process is made exergonic so it can occur spontaneously due to a negative free-energy change.  Using this process, unfavorable chemical reactions can be made to proceed.

The basis of reaction coupling is a shared chemical intermediate.  After one reaction produces one product, another can use it as a reactant to drive the production of an essential compound.

=== Gibbs Free Energy ===

Named after Josiah Willard Gibbs who developed the concept in 1878, the Gibbs [[Structural Biochemistry/Free energy|free energy]] describes the overall favorability of a reaction to proceed.  It is characterized by the following equation: ΔG = ΔH - TΔS where ΔG is the Gibbs free energy change, ΔH is the change in [[Structural Biochemistry/Enthalpy|enthalpy]] (heat), T is temperature (measured in Kelvins), and ΔS is the change in [[Structural Biochemistry/Entropy|entropy]].  A reaction, or process, will occur spontaneously if and only if ΔG &lt; 0 for that reaction.  If ΔG &gt; 0 then that reaction must be coupled (see Energy Coupling) with a reaction which has ΔG &lt; 0 such that the overall ΔG of the 2 reactions is &lt;0.  ATP hydrolysis is a commonly used reaction for such situations (see ATP).  As the equation shows, a reaction is more favorable, the more ΔH &lt; 0 (i.e. the more heat is given off by the reaction) and the more ΔS &gt; 0 (i.e. the more disorder is increased) and the effect of entropy gained or lost is magnified by the temperature surrounding the reaction.

=== ATP ===
[[Image:Adenosintriphosphat.svg‎|thumbnail|Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP)]]

Most coupling reactions use the break down of '''adenosine triphosphate (ATP)''' as the intermediate process to drive chemical synthesis.  ATP is used as an energy-storing compound.  The phosphoanhydride bond between phosphate groups found in ATP stores a significant amount of energy due to the negative charges carried by the phosphate groups. This bond stored energy that is not currently use, but available later for running reactions is called Potential energy. This energy is required to keep the negatively charged groups close to each other in the ATP molecule because they, as do all like-charged groups, repel each other.  This energy can be released (Exothermic reaction) for use in the cell to do work, move things and build things by hydrolysis and breakage of the bond. 

'''ATP -&gt; ADP + P + Energy'''

When carbohydrates and other foods are consumed, they are broken down by enzymes to release the energy within them. The exothermic energy released is used to reattach a phosphate to ADP through Endothermic reactions which will regenerate ATP formation.

'''ADP + P + Energy -&gt; ATP'''

Then, the process of bond breaking and bond forming will repeat over and over within human cells to provide energy for all the chemical reactions.

=== GTP ===
[[Image:GTP chemical structure.png‎|thumbnail|Guanosine Triphosphate (GTP)]]

'''GTP''' (guanosine-5’-triphosphate) can be used as a source of energy, just like ATP but not in any type of organisms.  However GTP is only used in specific areas of the cell, namely protein synthesis.  ATP and GTP are similar in structure; both have a purine base, and 3 phosphate groups, but ATP has adenine attached to the purine, whereas GTP has a guanine.  The energy stored in GTP is released in the same way as ATP.

==Feedback==

In order for the body to maintain homeostasis, '''feedback''' loops are often used. '''Negative feedback''' maintains homeostasis by slowing down or stopping a mechanism once it approaches the appropriate range. For instance, the hydrolysis of ATP is an [[Structural Biochemistry/Exergonic reaction|exergonic reaction]], meaning it gives off energy in the form of heat. If the temperature in a cell becomes too high, the cell will die, so negative feedback will stop the reaction to maintain homeostasis in terms of temperature. In '''positive feedback''', a process will speed up once a receptor detects the occurrence of a certain reaction. A positive feedback mechanism is used in the stomach during digestion: for example, HCl secreted by parietal cells in the stomach convert pepsinogen to pepsin, and this reaction causes the pepsin to convert all the pepsinogen to pepsin to aid in the enzymatic breakdown of proteins. Another example of a positive feedback mechanism is childbirth, once the contractions start, they begin to occur with increasing frequency and pressure.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:H-R diagram.svg|thumb|270px|A Hertzsprung-Russell diagram plots the actual brightness (or [[absolute magnitude]]) of a star against its [[color index]] (represented as B-V). The main sequence is visible as a prominent diagonal band that runs from the upper left to the lower right.]]

The '''main sequence''' is the name for a continuous and distinctive band of stars that appear on a plot of stellar [[Color index|color]] versus brightness. These color-[[absolute magnitude|magnitude]] plots are known as [[Hertzsprung-Russell diagram]]s after their co-developers, [[Ejnar Hertzsprung]] and [[Henry Norris Russell]]. Stars on this band are known as '''main-sequence stars''' or '''dwarf stars'''.

After a star has formed, it generates energy at the hot, dense core region through the [[nuclear fusion]] of [[hydrogen]] atoms into [[helium]]. During this stage of the star's lifetime, it is located along the main sequence at a position determined primarily by its mass, but also based upon its chemical composition and other factors. In general, the more massive the star the shorter its lifespan on the main sequence. After the hydrogen fuel at the core has been consumed, the star evolves away from the main sequence.

The main sequence is sometimes divided into upper and lower parts, based on the processes that stars use to generate energy. Stars below about 1.5 times the [[Solar mass|mass of the Sun]] (or 1.5 solar masses) fuse hydrogen atoms together in a series of stages to form helium; a sequence called the [[proton-proton chain]]. Above this mass, in the upper main sequence, the nuclear fusion process can instead use atoms of [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]] as intermediaries in the production of helium from hydrogen atoms.

Because there is a temperature gradient between the core of a star and its surface, energy is steadily transported upward through the intervening layers until it is radiated away at the [[photosphere]]. The two mechanisms used to carry this energy through the star are [[radiation]] and [[convection]], with the type used depending on the local conditions. Convection tends to occur in regions with steeper temperature gradients, higher opacity or both. When convection occurs in the core region it acts to stir up the helium ashes, thus maintaining the proportion of fuel needed for fusion to occur.

== History ==

In the early part of the twentieth century, information about the types and distances of [[star]]s became more readily available. The [[spectra]] of stars were shown to have distinctive features, which allowed them to be categorized. [[Annie Jump Cannon]] and [[Edward C. Pickering]] at [[Harvard College Observatory]] had developed a method of categorization that became known as the Harvard classification scheme. This scheme was published in the ''Harvard Annals'' in 1901.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In [[Potsdam]] in 1906, the Danish astronomer [[Ejnar Hertzsprung]] noticed that the reddest stars—classified as K and M in the Harvard scheme—could be divided into two distinct groups. These stars are either much brighter than the Sun, or much fainter. To distinguish these groups, he called them &quot;giant&quot; and &quot;dwarf&quot; stars. The following year he began studying [[star cluster]]s; large groupings of stars that are co-located at approximately the same distance. He published the first plots of color versus luminosity for these stars. These plots showed a prominent and continuous sequence of stars, which he named the main sequence.&lt;ref name=brown&gt;{{cite book

At [[Princeton University]], [[Henry Norris Russell]] was following a similar course of research. He was studying the relationship between the spectral classification of stars and their actual brightness as corrected for distance—their [[absolute magnitude]]. For this purpose he used a set of stars that had reliable parallaxes and many of which had been categorized at Harvard. When he plotted the spectral types of these stars against their absolute magnitude, he found that dwarf stars followed a distinct relationship. This allowed the real brightness of a dwarf star to be predicted with reasonable accuracy.&lt;ref name=obs36&gt;{{cite journal

 | accessdate=2007-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of the red stars observed by Hertzsprung, the dwarf stars also followed the spectra-luminosity relationship discovered by Russell. However, the giant stars are much brighter than dwarfs and so do not follow the same relationship. Russell proposed that the &quot;giant stars must have low density or great surface-brightness, and the reverse is true of dwarf stars&quot;. The same curve also showed that there were very few faint white stars.&lt;ref name=obs36/&gt;

In 1933, [[Bengt Strömgren]] introduced the term Hertzsprung-Russell diagram to denote a luminosity-spectral class diagram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

 | accessdate=2008-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This name reflected the parallel development of this technique by both Hertzsprung and Russell earlier in the century.&lt;ref name=brown/&gt;

As evolutionary models of stars were developed during the 1930s, it was shown that, for stars of a uniform chemical composition, a relationship exists between a star's mass, composition, luminosity and radius. That is, the radius and luminosity of a star can be calculated given its mass and composition. This became known as the [[Vogt-Russell theorem]]; named after Heinrich Vogt and Henry Norris Russell. By this theorem, once a star's chemical composition and its position on the main sequence is known, so too is the star's mass and radius. (However, it was subsequently discovered that the theorem breaks down somewhat for stars of non-uniform composition.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A refined scheme for [[stellar classification]] was published in 1943 by W. W. Morgan and P. C. Keenan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

For historical reasons, the [[spectral type]]s of stars followed, in order of decreasing temperature with colors ranging from blue to red, the sequence O, B, A, F, G, K and M. (A popular [[mnemonic]] for memorizing this sequence of stellar classes is &quot;Oh Be A Fine Girl/Guy, Kiss Me&quot;.) The luminosity class ranged from I to V, in order of decreasing luminosity. Stars of luminosity class V belonged to the main sequence.&lt;ref name=tnc&gt;{{cite book

== Characteristics ==
Main sequence stars have been extensively studied through stellar models, allowing their formation and evolutionary history to be relatively well understood. The position of the star on the main sequence provides information about its physical properties.

The [[temperature]] of a star can be approximately determined by treating it as an idealized energy radiator known as a [[black body]]. In this case, the luminosity ''L'' and radius ''R'' are related to the temperature ''T'' by the [[Stefan-Boltzmann Law]]:

:&lt;math&gt;L = 4\pi \sigma R^2 T^4&lt;/math&gt;

where ''σ'' is the [[Stefan–Boltzmann constant]]. The temperature and composition of a star's [[photosphere]] determines the energy emission at different wavelengths. The [[color index]], or ''B''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''V'', measures the difference in this energy emission by means of filters that capture the star's [[apparent magnitude|magnitude]] in blue (''B'') and green-yellow (''V'') light. (By measuring the difference between these values, this eliminates the need to correct the magnitudes for distance.) Thus the position of a star on the HR diagram can be used to estimate its radius and temperature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; By modifying the physical properties of the [[plasma]] in the photosphere, the temperature of a star also determines its [[spectral type]].

=== Formation ===
When a [[protostar]] is formed from the collapse of a [[giant molecular cloud]] of gas and dust in the local [[interstellar medium]], the initial composition is homogeneous throughout, consisting of about 70% hydrogen, 28% helium and trace amounts of other elements, by mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the initial collapse, this [[pre-main sequence star]] generates energy through gravitational contraction. Upon reaching a suitable density, energy generation is begun at the core using an exothermic [[nuclear fusion]] process that converts hydrogen into helium.&lt;ref name=tnc/&gt;

A star remains near its initial position on the main sequence until a significant amount of hydrogen in the core has been consumed, then begins to evolve into a more luminous star. (On the HR diagram, the evolving star moves up and to the right of the main sequence.) Thus the main sequence represents the primary hydrogen-burning stage of a star's lifetime.&lt;ref name=tnc/&gt;

The majority of stars on a typical HR diagram lie along the main sequence curve. This line is so pronounced because both the [[stellar classification|spectral type]] and the [[luminosity]] depend only on a star's mass, at least to [[zeroth order approximation]], as long as it is fusing hydrogen at its core—and that is what almost all stars spend most of their &quot;active&quot; life doing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

=== Energy generation ===

At the Sun's core temperature, the PP process is more efficient.]]
All main sequence stars have a core region where energy is generated by nuclear fusion. The temperature and density of this core are at the levels necessary to sustain the energy production that will support the remainder of the star. A reduction of energy production would cause the overlaying mass to compress the core, resulting in an increase in the fusion rate because of higher temperature and pressure. Likewise an increase in energy production would cause the star to expand, lowering the pressure at the core. Thus the star forms a self-regulating system in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] that is stable over the course of its main sequence lifetime.&lt;ref name=brainerd&gt;{{cite web

Astronomers divide the main sequence into upper and lower parts, based on the dominant type of fusion process at the core. Stars in the upper main sequence have sufficient mass to use the [[CNO cycle]] to fuse hydrogen into helium. This process uses atoms of [[carbon]], [[nitrogen]] and [[oxygen]] as intermediaries in the fusion process. In the lower main sequence, energy is generated as the result of the [[proton-proton chain]], which directly fuses hydrogen together in a series of stages to produce helium.&lt;ref name=hannu&gt;{{cite book

At a stellar core temperature of 18 million [[kelvin]]s, both fusion processes are equally efficient. This is the core temperature of a star with 1.5 solar masses. Hence the upper main sequence consists of stars above this mass. The apparent upper limit for a main sequence star is 120-200 solar masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Structure ===

[[Image:Solar internal structure.svg|right|280px|thumb|This diagram shows a cross-section of a Sun-like star, showing the internal structure.]]
 
Because there is a temperature difference between the core and the surface, or [[photosphere]], energy is transported outward. The two modes for transporting this energy are [[radiation]] and [[convection]]. A [[radiation zone]], where energy is transported by [[radiation]], is stable against convection and there is very little mixing of the plasma. By contrast, in a [[convection zone]] the energy is transported by bulk movement of plasma, with hotter material rising and cooler material descending. Convection is a more efficient mode for carrying energy than radiation, but it will only occur under conditions that create a steep temperature gradient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In massive stars, the rate of energy generation by the CNO cycle is very sensitive to temperature, so the fusion is highly concentrated at the core. Consequently, there is a high temperature gradient in the core region, which results in a convection zone for more efficient energy transport.&lt;ref name=hannu/&gt; This mixing of material around the core removes the helium ash from the hydrogen burning region, allowing more of the hydrogen in the star to be consumed during the main sequence lifetime. The outer regions of a massive star transport energy by radiation, with little or no convection.&lt;ref name=brainerd/&gt;

Intermediate mass, class A stars such as [[Sirius]] may transport energy entirely by radiation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

This produces mixing of the outer layers, but results in a less efficient consumption of the hydrogen in the star. This causes a steady buildup of a helium-rich core, surrounded by a hydrogen-rich outer region. By contrast, cool, low-mass stars are convective throughout. Thus the helium produced at the core is distributed across the star, producing a relatively uniform atmosphere and a proportionately longer main sequence lifespan.&lt;ref name=brainerd/&gt;

=== Luminosity-color variation ===

As non-fusing helium ash accumulates in the core, the reduction in the abundance of hydrogen per unit mass results in a gradual lowering of the fusion rate within that mass. To compensate, the core temperature and pressure slowly increase, which actually causes a net increase in the overall fusion rate (to support the greater density of the inner star). This produces a steady increase in the luminosity and radius of the star over time.&lt;ref name=Clayton/&gt; Thus, for example, the luminosity of the early Sun was only about 70% of its current value.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Other factors that broaden the main sequence band on the HR diagram include uncertainty in the distance to the stars, and the presence of unresolved [[binary star]]s that can alter the observed stellar parameters. However, even perfect observation would show a fuzzy main sequence, because mass is not the only parameter that affects a star's color and luminosity.

A nearly vertical region of the HR diagram, known as the [[instability strip]], is occupied by pulsating [[variable star]]s. These stars vary in magnitude at regular intervals, giving them a pulsating appearance. The strip intersects the upper part of the main sequence in the region of class A and F stars; which are between one and two solar masses. However, main sequence stars in this region experience only small variations in magnitude and so are hard to detect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

=== Lifetime ===

The lifespan that a star spends on the main sequence is governed by two factors. The total amount of energy that can be generated through nuclear fusion of hydrogen is limited by the amount of available hydrogen fuel that can be consumed at the core. For a star in equilibrium, the energy generated at the core must be at least equal to the energy radiated at the surface. Since the luminosity gives the amount of energy radiated per unit time, the total life span can be estimated, to first approximation, as the total energy produced divided by the star's luminosity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Our [[Sun]] has been a main sequence star for about 4.5 billion years and will continue to be one for another 5.5 billion years, for a total main sequence lifetime of 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; years. After the hydrogen supply in the core is exhausted, it will expand to become a [[red giant]] and fuse [[helium]] atoms to form [[carbon]]. As the energy output of the helium fusion process per unit mass is only about a tenth the energy output of the hydrogen process, this stage will only last for about 10% of a star's total active lifetime. Thus, on average, about 90% of the observed stars will be on the main sequence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{smallmatrix}L\ \propto\ M^{3.5}\end{smallmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The amount of fuel available for nuclear fusion is proportional to the mass of the star. Thus, the lifetime of a star on the main sequence can be estimated by comparing it to the Sun:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

where ''M'' and ''L'' are the mass and luminosity of the star, respectively, &lt;math&gt;\begin{smallmatrix}M_{\bigodot}\end{smallmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; is a solar mass, &lt;math&gt;\begin{smallmatrix}L_{\bigodot}\end{smallmatrix}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[solar luminosity]] and &lt;math&gt;\tau_{ms}&lt;/math&gt; is the star's estimated main sequence lifetime.

The mass-luminosity relationship depends on how efficiently energy can be transported from the core to the surface. A higher [[Opacity (optics)|opacity]] has an insulating effect that retains more energy at the core, so the star does not need to produce as much energy to remain in [[hydrostatic equilibrium]]. By contrast, a lower opacity means energy escapes more rapidly and the star must burn more fuel to remain in equilibrium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Below about 0.5 solar masses, the luminosity of the star varies as the mass to the power of 2.3, producing a flattening of the slope on a graph of mass versus luminosity. Even these refinements are only an approximation, however, and the mass-luminosity relation can vary depending on a star's composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

=== Evolutionary tracks ===
Once a main sequence star consumes the hydrogen at its core, the loss of energy generation causes gravitational collapse to resume. The hydrogen surrounding the core reaches sufficient temperature and pressure to undergo fusion, forming a hydrogen-burning shell surrounding a helium core. In consequence of this change, the outer envelope of the star expands and decreases in temperature, turning it into a [[red giant]]. At this point the star is evolving off the main sequence and entering the giant branch. (The path the star now follows across the HR diagram is called an evolutionary track.) The helium core of the star continues to collapse until it is entirely supported by [[electron degeneracy pressure]]—a [[quantum mechanics|quantum mechanical]] effect that restricts how closely matter can be compacted.

When a [[star cluster|cluster of stars]] is formed at about the same time, the life span of these stars will depend on their individual masses. The most massive stars will leave the main sequence first, followed steadily in sequence by stars of ever lower masses. Thus the stars will evolve in order of their position on the main sequence, proceeding from the most massive at the left toward the right of the HR diagram. The current position where stars in this cluster are leaving the main sequence is known as the turn-off point. By knowing the main sequence lifespan of stars at this point, it becomes possible to estimate the age of the cluster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

[[Image:Free energy.JPG‎‎|thumb|The total ∆G is negative because of the coupling of reactions. In this diagram, ∆G(1) stands for the change in G resulting from the reaction of glucose + Pi --&gt; Glucose 6-phosphate, ∆G(2) is the free energy resulting from the reaction of ATP --&gt; ADP + Pi, and ∆G3 is the total change in free energy by coupling these two reactions together.]]

Many chemicals' reactions are not spontaneous and require energy to occur. The spontaneity of a chemical reaction is determined by its [[Structural Biochemistry/Free energy|Gibbs free energy]] value. If negative, the reaction will proceed spontaneously; if positive, the reaction will not be spontaneous. Note that this is not equivalent to kinetics, or the speed of a reaction; Gibbs free energy only determines the spontaneity of a given reaction. How quickly the reaction proceeds is determined by other factors, such as the presence of enzymes, the amount of heat (energy) that the system has available, and the physical properties of the reacting molecules. 

Spontaneous reactions occur without the need for extra energy, but they may happen slowly. In order to catalyze non-spontaneous reactions, such as the synthesis of macromolecules, enzymes and coupling are used by the cell. Almost all reactions that take place in a cell are catalyzed by [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzymes]] that decrease the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Activation energy|activation energy]] of the reaction. Essentially, this means that the enzyme opens up a more favorable &quot;pathway&quot; for the reaction, allowing it to initiate more easily than before, and with less energy. In addition, an unfavorable reaction can be coupled together with a favorable one to make the overall reaction favorable. For example, Glucose + P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; -&gt; Glucose-6-phosphate has a positive &lt;math&gt;delta&lt;/math&gt; G and is therefore unfavorable. But it can be coupled with ATP -&gt; ADP + P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; (which has a negative &lt;math&gt;delta&lt;/math&gt; G) to make the reaction favorable. The overall reaction thus becomes ATP + Glucose -&gt; ADP + Glucose-6-phosphate and has a negative &lt;math&gt;delta&lt;/math&gt; G. Therefore, ATP is considered the energy currency of the cell. However, it should be noted that other energy carrying molecules, such as GTP, do exist and are used for certain processes.

[[Structural Biochemistry/Anabolism|Anabolic]] and  [[Structural Biochemistry/Catabolism|catabolic]] processes are examples of how the cell couples reactions together to create efficient energy exchange cycles. These processes are explained in more detail in their respective sections; however, it is appropriate to mention them here as they provide a relevant example of reaction coupling. Basically, [[Structural Biochemistry/Catabolism|catabolic]] reactions are those that convert chemical fuels to molecules that the cell can use for energy, such as ATP and other high-energy compounds. [[Structural Biochemistry/Anabolism|Anabolic]] reactions are those that require some amount of energy to occur. Thus, the cell can conveniently couple anabolic reactions with catabolic ones - the products of catabolic reactions can be used to drive anabolic reactions to completion. This allows the cell to link different types of reactions together efficiently; it's almost a type of &quot;cellular recycling&quot;, as the products of one reaction (i.e. a catabolic one) can be re-used to help another reaction reach completion (i.e. an anabolic one).

== Organisms are Energy Transducers ==
Organisms are transducers of energy, since in the transfer of energy they are less than 100% efficient. Organisms employ the energy harnessed to grow, repair, and maintain their bodies. The energy is also use to compete with other organisms, and to produce new organisms (offspring). In the process of doing these things, organisms generate waste, chemicals and heat. Organisms create local regions of order at the expense of using up some fraction of the total supply of useful energy found in the universe.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello World!

It's nice to be joining you. I have no immediate prospects for editing or authoring but am enticed by the possibility. I am retired now for six years and have a continual guilt regarding my lack of a contribution to the world at large. It seems improper to have worked for only 40 or so years and then sit back and collect social security and pensions for the next 40 (my mother turns 101 this December.) I play golf 3 times a week, work in the community garden for 4-5 hours a week, spend untold hours on the internet researching genealogy (8,000+ direct ancestors) or working my stamp collection. I'm hoping that Wikibooks may be the outlet that gives me some additional pride in my existence.</text>

=OpenBSD as a Desktop=

This is a guide on using OpenBSD as a desktop/workstation. This guide was made using OpenBSD 4.3 and 4.4. The concept should be the same in future releases.

==If you are new to unix==
Download the OpenBSD iso file and burn it using an iso burning program.

The download location is:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/&lt;the version you want&gt;/&lt;your processor&gt;/install44.iso&lt;/nowiki&gt;

In my case it is:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/4.3/i386/install44.iso&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Now put the cd into the computer you want to install it on. Once it boots up quickly push F2 (this is called the BIOS). Find the boot sequence option (or similar) and select boot to cdrom. I recommend learning at least the basic commands and some vi beforehand.

==Installation modifications==
Follow the offical OpenBSD install instructions found [http://www.openbsd.org/faq/faq4.html here]. Until you come to &quot;Configure the network?&quot;. Enter: yes [default], fxp0 [default], system-hostname [default], no [default], '''dhcp''', '''rtsol''', home [default], 192.168.1.1 [default], yes [default], dhcp [default], no [default], no [default]. Continue until you come to the &quot;lets install the sets&quot;. Enter: cdrom, cd0, 4.3/i386 [default], all, done [default], yes [default]... done [default], yes [default], none [default], '''yes''', no [default], ?, &lt;where you are located&gt;, ?, &lt;your sub-timezone&gt;. Enter in &quot;reboot&quot; and your done!

==Configuring Xorg==
Xorg normally &quot;just work&quot;. If you have a weird screen resolution (or things look weird with xorg), then you need to do more configurations. 

===Method 1===
The configuration file is located at /etc/X11/xorg.conf. However first we need to create the file. Run:
 Xorg -configure

This created a configuration file in your home file. To test the Xorg setting in the configuration file, run:
 Xorg -config /&lt;your home directory&gt;/xorg.conf.new

In my case it is (running as root)
 Xorg -config /root/xorg.conf.new

It could be (running as puffy)
 Xorg -config /home/puffy/xorg.conf.new

To exit out of the test (assuming it worked), press (control)+(alt)+(backspace). If things work, you are lucky. Copy the new configuration file to the /etc/X11/xorg.conf
 cp /&lt;location of your home directory&gt;/xorg.conf.new /etc/X11/xorg.conf

====Extra configurations====
If you were not fortunate enough to have the configurations just work then...

''I am working on it:'' '''I am currently figuring this one out myself. The xorg works however everything is out of proportion.'''

===Method 2===
This method will require knowledge of your graphics card, screen resolution, and monitor. Run the command:
 Xorgconfig

Fill out all of the information. If you would like to skip over something then just press enter. In some cases you can not skip steps without messing up your configuration file. At the end of the questionare say &quot;yes&quot; to writing to the xorg.conf file.

==Get a desktop enviroment working==
OpenBSD has a great package management system (even if it is sometimes outdated). If you get the packages from the ftp site the pkg_add will find the dependencies for you. Export your PKG_PATH to your favorite ftp site. The ftp format is: 

 &lt;nowiki&gt;ftp://&lt;your mirror&gt;/pub/OpenBSD/&lt;your version&gt;/packages/&lt;your processor&gt;/&lt;/nowiki&gt;

In my case it is:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;# export PKG_PATH=ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/4.3/packages/i386/&lt;/nowiki&gt;

You may even want to put this into your .profile. 

&lt;font size=0&gt;
The packages are found through http [http://www.openbsd.org/4.3_packages/ here] (for 4.3 packages).
&lt;br&gt;
The packages are also found through ftp [ftp://ftp.openbsd.org/pub/OpenBSD/4.3/packages/i386/ here] (for 4.3 i386 packages).
&lt;/font&gt;

===KDE (3.5)===
Here are the main packages the pkg_add should resolve the dependencies.

:kdebase
:kdelibs
:kdeaddons
:kdeadmin
:kdeartwork
:kdeedu
:kdegames
:kdegraphics
:kdemultimedia
:kdenetwork
:kdepim
:kdesdk
:kdetoys
:kdeutils
:kdeaccessibility

I personally prefer to install them all at once. You may also want to add the -v option, if you want to see the details of the installation.

 pkg_add kdebase;pkg_add kdelibs;pkg_add kdeaddons;pkg_add kdeadmin;pkg_add kdeartwork;pkg_add kdeedu;pkg_add kdegames;pkg_add kdegraphics &lt;br&gt;;pkg_add kdemultimedia;pkg_add kdenetwork;pkg_add kdepim;pkg_add kdesdk;pkg_add kdetoys;pkg_add kdeutils;pkg_add &lt;/br&gt; kdeaccessibility

To run kde do

 Startkde

===Xfce (4.4)===
[[Image:Xfce-openbsd.png|250px|thumb|Xfce on OpenBSD]]

Here are the main packages the pkg_add should resolve the dependencies. (Xfce likes to keep their applications in separate packages)
:gtk-xfce-engine
:libxfce4mcs
:libxfcegui4
:xfce-mcs-manager
:xfce-mcs-plugins
:xfce-utils
:xfce4-appfinder
:xfce4-battery
:xfce4-clipman
:xfce4-datetime
:xfce4-dict
:xfce4-diskperf
:xfce4-fsguard
:xfce4-icon-theme
:xfce4-genmon
:xfce4-mailwatch
:xfce4-mixer
:xfce4-mpc
:xfce4-netload
:xfce4-notes
:xfce4-panel
:xfce4-places-plugin
:xfce4-session
:xfce4-systemload
:xfce4-time-out
:xfce4-verve
:xfce4-wavelan
:xfce4-weather
:xfce4-wmdock
:xfce4-xkb
:xfdesktop
:xfwm4
:xfwm4-themes

To run xfce do

 startxfce4

==Using ports==
Although the binaries are sometime out of date the ports are amazingly up to date, new software is ported to OpenBSD after hours of release. 

First get the ports from the install cdrom. 
First we have to make a directory to mount the drive to. Enter in the command:
 cd /mnt
 mkdir cdrom

Mount the cdrom by entering in the command:
 mount /dev/cd0a /mnt/cdrom

Now copy ports.tar.gz to /usr:
 cp /mnt/cdrom/ports.tar.gz /usr

Now untar the ports:
 tar xvf ports.tar.gz

To update the port tree, cd into the file that you want to update and enter in the command:
 cd &lt;what you want to update&gt;
 make checksum REFETCH=true

This may take a while...

To install a ports, cd into the CVS that you want to compile and do:
 cd &lt;what you want to install&gt;
 make install clean

The port system should compile the dependencies for you. Warning: compiling may take several days. Most notibily the port system includes: e17 and KDE 4.1.

&lt;font size=0&gt;
All of the ports are found: [http://openports.se/ here]
&lt;/font&gt;

==Get a display manager working==
===GDM (recomended)===
Only one main package:
 pkg_add gdm

Now vi the configuration file &quot;rc&quot;. Scroll down to the bottom of the configuration file. (it is a long configuration file):

 vi /etc/rc

Scroll down until you see:
 #Alternatively, on some architectures, xdm may be started in /etc/ttys
 if [ X&quot;${xdm_flags}&quot; != X&quot;NO&quot; ]; then 
 echo 'starting xdm...';        /usr/X11R6/bin/xdm ${xdm_flags}
 fi

Edit it so that it will start gdm as opposed to xdm. Replace it with: 
 #Alternatively, on some architectures, xdm may be started in /etc/ttys
 if [ X&quot;${xdm_flags}&quot; != X&quot;NO&quot; ]; then 
 echo 'starting gdm...';        /usr/local/sbin/gdm ${xdm_flags}
 fi

Now change the xdm flags in /etc/rc.conf. Scroll down until you see:
 # For some architectures, you must also disable console getty in /etc/ttys
 xdm_flags=NO        # for normal use:&quot;&quot;

Change the xdm flags by replacing the NO with &quot;YES&quot;
 # For some architectures, you must also disable console getty in /etc/ttys
 xdm_flags=&quot;YES&quot;        # for normal use:&quot;&quot;

Once you start up gdm change the session to whatever GUI you installed.

'''Warning: GDM does not automatically recognize the KDE session.'''

===KDM (not recomended)===
The reason that this is not recomended, even if you are using KDE, is that someone made an error while porting KDM to OpenBSD. KDM searches for startkdeconfig in the wrong directory and you are thus locked out.

==1. State the role each of the following played in the development of flying balloons.==
===a. Joseph Michel Montgolfier and Jacques-Etienne Montgolfier===
&lt;gallery&gt;
Image:Josephmontgolfier.jpg|Joseph Michel Montgolfier
Image:Jacques Étienne Montgolfier.jpg|Jacques-Etienne Montgolfier
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Joseph-Michel Montgolfier (26 August 1740 – 26 June 1810) and Jacques-Étienne Montgolfier (6 January 1745 – 2 August 1799) were the inventors of the montgolfière, or airship. The brothers succeeded in launching the first manned ascent, carrying a young physician and an audacious army officer into the sky.

Of the two brothers, it was Joseph who first contemplated building &quot;machines&quot;. Joseph observed laundry drying over a fire incidentally form pockets that billowed upwards. Joseph set about building a box-like chamber {{units|1 by 1 by 1.3 meters|3 by 3 by 4 ft}} out of very thin wood and covering the sides and top with lightweight taffeta cloth. Under the bottom of the box he crumpled and lit some paper. The contraption quickly lifted off its stand and collided with the ceiling. Joseph then recruited his brother to balloon building.

The two brothers then set about building a contraption 3 times larger in scale (27 times larger in volume). The lifting force was so great that they lost control of their craft on its very first test flight on 14 December 1782. The device floated nearly 2 kilometres (about 1.2 mi). It was destroyed after landing by the &quot;indiscretion&quot; of passersby.

===b. Jean Francois Pilatre de Rozier and Francois Laurent Marquis d'Arlandes.===
[[image:Early flight 02562u (4).jpg|thumb|200px|The first untethered balloon flight, by Rozier and the Marquis d'Arlandes on 21 November 1783.]]
Jean-François Pilâtre de Rozier (30 March 1754 – 15 June 1785) was a French chemistry and physics teacher, and one of the first pioneers of aviation. His balloon crashed near Wimereux in the Pas-de-Calais during an attempt to fly across the English Channel, and he and his companion, Pierre Romain, became the first known victims of an air crash.

In June 1783, he witnessed the first balloon flight of the Montgolfier brothers. On 19 September, he assisted with the untethered flight of a sheep, a cockerel and a duck from the front courtyard of the Palace of Versailles. After a variety of tests in October, he made the first manned free flight in history on 21 November 1783, accompanied by the ambitious Marquis d'Arlandes. During the 25-minute flight using a Montgolfier hot air balloon, they traveled 12 kilometres from the Château de la Muette to the Butte-aux-Cailles, then in the outskirts of Paris, attaining an altitude of 3,000 feet.

===c. [[w:Jacques_Alexandre_Cesar_Charles|Jacques Alexandre Cesar Charles]] and Nicolas Louis Robert.===
In December of 1783, these two flew the first gas balloon, filled with hydrogen. This flight lasted for at least 2 hours, starting from the Tuileries gardens in Paris, and landing outside Paris where it was destroyed by terrified peasants. 

Charles went on to discover [[w:Charles's_Law| Charles' Law]] which describes the relationship between the density of a gas and its temperature.

===d. [[w:Ben_Abruzzo|Ben L. Abruzzo]], [[w:Maxie_Anderson|Maxie L. Anderson]], and Larry Newman===
From 11 August to 17 August, 1978, these three completed the first transatlantic balloon flight in the [[w:Double_Eagle_II|Double Eagle II]]. They began their flight from Presque Isle, Maine and ended their flight at Miserey, France. 

Ben Abruzzo and Larry Newman were also pilots on the [[w:Double_Eagle_V|Double Eagle V]] which in 1981 was the first balloon to cross the Pacific Ocean.

===e. [[w:Bertrand_Piccard|Bertrand Piccard]] and [[w:Brian_Jones_(aeronaut)|Brian Jones]]===
On March 1, 1999, Bertrand Piccard and Brian Jones began the first balloon flight to circumnavigate the earth. Their flight was a success and ended on March 20, 1999. The flight took 19 days and 21 hours. The flight started in Switzerland and ended in Egypt.

==2. Cite the principle of Archimedes, and briefly describe how it applies to each of the following: ==
::Archimedes' Principle states: ''any body fully or partially submerged in a fluid is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the fluid displaced.''
:;a. A piece of cork floating in a bowl of water.
Cork is less dense than water, and weighs less than the volume of water displaced, causing the cork to float.
:;b. A ship floating in the ocean
Ships, though made of dense materials, are shaped so that much of the interior is air. Because the weight of the ship and its cargo is less than the volume of water displaced, the ship will float.
:;c. A hot air balloon floating in the atmosphere
As long as a balloon plus the gas it contains weighs less than the atmospheric air which it displaces, the balloon will float in the air.

==3. Using a textbook of Chemistry, or a reference book of scientific tables, draw up a simple table showing the composition of air by weight and by volume.==
{|border=1 cellspacing=1 cellpadding=5 align=&quot;center&quot;
|-
! Gas || Air Percentage || Weight of pure gas
|-
|Nitrogen || 78%||  1.25 g/liter
|-
|Oxygen ||21%|| 1.43 g/liter
|-
|Argon  ||.93%|| 1.78 g/liter
|-
|Carbon Dioxide  ||.03%||1.96 g/liter
|-
|Other (including Neon, Helium, &lt;br&gt;Hydrogen, Xenon, &amp; Radon)|| .04%||

To calculate the average weight of air in a balloon it can be worked out using rough percentages 70% Nitrogen and 30% oxygen as the make up of air. Atomic weight of Nitrogen is 14 g. Atomic weight of Oxygen is 16 g. Nitrogen and Oxygen gasses are formed using two atoms. So for a balloon with 22.4 litres of air use this formular. Of course if you want it more accurate the exact percentages of all gasses present would be used. 

70% x 28 + 30% x 32 = 0.7 x 28 + 0.3 x 32 = 19.6 + 9.6 = 29.2

So a balloon with 22.4 litres of air weighs 29.2 g plus the weight of the balloon. 

&lt;!-- See talk page for discussion of this section

To calculate weights of gases. One mole of the gas has a vloume of 22.4 litres.Avogadro's number. 

Eg, Helium has an atomic weight of 4 g per mole so the weight of 22.4 l = 4 grams. Oxygen as a gas has two Oxygen atoms so the weight is twice the atomic weight.

==4. Draw up a simple table showing a comparison of the atomic number, atomic weight, and density of hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, and oxygen.==

==5. Name two gases that are used in flying gas filled balloons.==
Hydrogen &amp; Helium are both less dense than air and may be used when flying a balloon. Warm air is also used for flying balloons, since it is less dense than cold air.

*Note: Hydrogen burns violently when ignited.  After the destruction of the Hindenburg, hydrogen was largely abandoned for the flying of manned balloons.

==6. Explain how heat/temperature affect the density of air, and how this applies to flying hot air balloons.==
As described by [[w:Charles's_Law|Charles' Law]], heat applied to a gas will cause its molecules to move farther apart, reducing it's density. When the air in a balloon is heated above the temperature of the surrounding air, the air in the balloon becomes less dense than the air outside the balloon. Because the balloon is less dense, it will float or rise. The greater the difference in temperature between the air in the balloon and the surrounding air, the greater the difference in density between the air inside and outside the balloon, which increases the lift that the balloon will generate. This explains why balloons are mostly launched in cooler weather.

==7. Explain the role of each of the following in the structure and flying of a hot air balloon.==
; a. Envelope: The outer skin of the balloon, forming the container that holds the gas.
; b. Support structure: The framework of larger balloons.
; c. Throat: The lower opening through which the hot flame is applied to heat the air.
; d. Fuel source: The fuel used to heat the air to make the balloon less dense than the surrounding air.

==8. Name two materials that may be used for the envelope of a hot air balloon, and compare the advantages each accords because of its properties.==
;Paper: Paper may be used for model hot air balloons because of ease of acquisition and low price.
;Plastic: Plastic may be used for model hot air balloons because it is water resistant, easy to work with, and easy to acquire.
;Fabric: Fabric is usually used for larger, manned balloons. The fabric is specially treated.

==9. Describe how flying balloons have served a useful function in==
=== a. Military campaigns===
Military uses include: “eyes in the sky”, observation of enemy troops and positions, delivery of explosives to enemy positions, and defensive use of entangling incoming enemy flying craft.
===b. Scientific research===
Scientific uses include instrument transport for data collecting, atmospheric studies, and aerial photography.

==10. At what time of the day do most sport balloon flights take place? Why?==
Early morning is best because the air has cooled over night making the difference of temperature inside &amp; outside greater, thus increasing buoyancy.

==11. Describe how a pilot controls the vertical movement of==
===a. A hot air balloon===
The pilot controls the vertical movement of a hot air balloon by burning more fuel to make the air in the balloon hotter, causes the air in the balloon to become less dense, making it rise. Conversely, turning off the flame and allowing the air in the balloon to cool renders the air in the balloon more dense with respect to the surrounding atmosphere, causing the balloon to descend. More rapid increases in altitude can be achieved by lessening the weight of the balloon usually by dropping ballast, however this is limited by the amount of ballast available.

===b. A gas filled balloon===
Adding more of the lighter than air gas to ascend, and spilling some of the gas in order to descend varies the altitude of a helium or hydrogen filled balloon.

==12. Describe how a pilot controls the lateral or horizontal movement of a flying balloon.==
Horizontal movement of a gas filled flying balloon is entirely at the mercy of air currents. The pilot can only vary the altitude so as to get into the path of air currents, such as the jet stream. This involves careful study of charts of air currents, close attention to weather data, and a certain element of trial and error. Older airships, like the Hindenburg, had a rudder and propellers to move it so that it did not have to depend on air currents.

==13. Build to completion one model hot air balloon ( or two if working in pairs ).==
===Materials===
* Tissue paper
* Scissors
* Glue Stick(s)
* Sewing pins (optional)
* Thin wire (22 gauge is suggested)
* Needle-nose pliers &amp; wire cutters
* 1 50&quot;x20&quot; piece of Linoleum (for making balloon panel form)
* A spool of string

===Directions for balloon panel form===
[[image:AYHAB-Model-Hot-Air-Balloons-draw2.png|thumb|400px|Illustration of distance from center]]

Use a rigid or semi-rigid material such as poster board or a piece of linoleum flooring. I would suggest a piece of linoleum flooring,as it is more rigid and can be used more times. Cut out a piece that is 50 inches long and 20 inches wide. For every other measurement, you will have to measure from the center of the form you are creating. You will need to mark each measurement on the outside edge (furthest from the center of the form).

* The first measurement is the very bottom of the form (and all others will be going from bottom to top) and is 3 1/2 inches each direction from the center.&lt;br&gt;
* Seven inches from the bottom is another measurement of 3 1/2 inches from center.&lt;br&gt;
* Four inches up the center line is a measurement of 4 7/8 inches from center.&lt;br&gt;
* Four more inches up the center line is a measurement of 6 3/4 inches from center.&lt;br&gt;
* Six inches up the center line is a measurement of 8 5/8 inches from center.&lt;br&gt;
* Six more inches up the center line is a measurement of 9 5/8 inches from center (this is the widest measurement).&lt;br&gt;
* Six inches beyond the widest measurement is a smaller measurement of 9 1/8 inches from center.&lt;br&gt;
* Three inches up the line is a measurement of 7 1/2 inches from center.&lt;br&gt;
* Three inches further is a measurement of 6 1/2 inches from center.&lt;br&gt;
* Three inches further is a measurement of 4 3/4 inches from center.&lt;br&gt;
* Three inches further is a measurement of 3 inches from center.&lt;br&gt;
* Finally, 2 3/4 to 3 inches further is your top measurement. The top measurement is 1 5/8 inches from center.

Take the pen you are using to mark the measurements with and draw a line, starting from the bottom measurement, all the way around the outside of the measurement. It will look like a light bulb.

Cut along the line that you just drew to remove the extra material around the &quot;light bulb&quot; shape. That should give you the form needed to create the proper shape for the panels of your balloon.

===Directions for making balloon===
# Take 2 pieces of tissue paper and glue them end to end (vertically). Continue doing this with each set of tissue paper until you have 6 panels (a panel is 2 pieces of tissue paper glued end to end (vertically). You should only glue about a thumb's width or one straight line with the glue stick.
# Once you have 6 panels, lay them one on top of another, making sure that one end of the stack has an even edge at the bottom of the panels.*
# Take your Panel Form and lay it on top of your 6 panels. line up the bottom of the form with the straight edge of your 6 panels.
# Trace, with a black marker, along the edge of the form (making sure not to move the form or the panels). The form will not reach the other end your your panel stack. This is alright. Just keep tracing beyond the form in a diagonal line until you reach the top of your panel stack. Then remove the form from on top of the your panels.
# Take your scissors and cut on the outside of the black lines that you created by tracing the panel form. When you are done, you should have two (2) sets of scrap, one on each side of your panels. DO NOT THROW THESE AWAY! You may need to patch some panels that develop holes as well as use some of it to create a top for your balloon.
# Take the top two (2) panels and pull them out beyond your other panels. Pull the bottom of the two panels out about one inch from the top panel. Take your scissors, and cut flaps into the bottom panel. &lt;u&gt;Only cut in about 1/2 an inch deep.&lt;/u&gt; Do this all the way along one side of the bottom of the two panels. The flaps make it much easier to attach panels together.
# Take a glue stick and apply glue to the top of the two panels. You want to apply the glue to the side of the panel that is next to the flaps that you just cut. Also when applying the glue, you will only need one glue stick width of glue along the edge. Because the glue dries quickly, you may want to apply, at most, enough glue for 2 or 3 flaps at a time. Then you will fold over the flaps on the bottom panel onto the edge of the top panel where the glue was applied. Continue doing this until you have fully attached 2 of the panels together.
# Take a third panel and lay it on top of the 2 panels that you just glued together. Lay it so that the edge of the top panel, of the 2 attached panels, that has not been glued is exposed about an inch.
# Once again, cut flaps on the inch of exposed panel that are about a half inch deep. The glue and fold over the flaps to attach the third panel to the second panel. Now you should have 3 panels attached together. Continue repeating steps 8 &amp; 9 (Disregard the 2 panels reference in 8. Instead understand that it will now refer to the 2 panels that you just joined.) until all of your panels have been attached. '''Remember to alternate which side you are cutting the flaps on so that you do not tamper with any of the joints of the other panels.'''
# Once you have attached all 6 of your panels together, flip them over. Raise the top panel and fold the inner panels back. Do not crease the inner panels. Then replace the top panel.
# Cut the bottom panel just as you have every panel before. Remember to make the cuts only about 1/2 inch deep. Then pull the top panel towards the edge of the bottom panel until you have the same width of the bottom panel as you would have for previous panels.
# Apply glue to the top panel just as you have for every panel before. Remember that it may be easier to apply glue for only 2 or 3 panels at a time and then fold the flaps over before continuing to apply the glue.
# Now. Open up your balloon. You will notice that it does not have a top yet. From the scraps that you saved, when you cut out your panels, pick as large a piece as possible. From this piece, cut as large a circle as you can. (You may fold the piece of paper over once or twice to make cutting out the circle easier.)
# Apply glue to the circle you just cut out (around the outside edges by one or two glue stick widths). Then attach the circle to the top of your balloon to cover the hole.
# Take some wire and cut roughly a 2 foot section off of the spool.
# Take some needle-nose pliers and shape the wire into a rigid circle. (I suggest making a little loop in one end. Turning it slightly. Threading other end of the wire through the loop a little ways and the twisting the threaded wire around the looped end. This keeps the wire circle from expanding or contracting in size.)
# Put the open end of the balloon through the wire circle. Then fold the balloon over the wire and glue the folded over end back to the balloon. (You may cut flaps in the open end of the balloon to make it easier to glue.) There will be more balloon surface than wire. You may have to fold the end of a panel or two over a little to decrease the amount of panel that you have to deal with while gluing the balloon over the wire.
# At this point your balloon is finished. You will want to go over the entire surface of the balloon to make sure there are no holes in the panels, no unglued panel joints, no unglued balloon cap spots, or rips at the bottom where the wire is. If there are any of these issues, take some of your left over scraps (Aren't you glad you saved them?) and patch the balloon by gluing pieces from your scraps over any holes.

==14. Successfully launch, fly, and recover the model hot air balloon(s) which you have built.==

[[Image:launching balloon at night.jpg|thumb|300px|left|launching balloon at night]]

Take a single burner camp stove and use it to heat the air underneath your balloon. Be careful not to get the balloon too close to the flame as it will ignite and burn up.

A more efficient way of getting hot air into your balloon is to take some rigid dryer vent, cut notches that can be slid over the pot stabilizers on your camp stove, and then slide the vent pipe onto the stove. This causes the heated air to be channeled up the vent pipe into the balloon. However, this does not eliminate the possibility of your balloon igniting and burning up. You will have to keep the balloon from touching the vent pipe and also watch the balloon to make sure it doesn't start turning brown nearest the vent pipe.

You will need two (2) people to launch the balloon. One to hold the top end of the balloon up (until enough hot air is within the balloon), and the other to hold the balloon mouth over the stove. Before holding the balloon over the stove, tie a spool of string to the wire that keeps the form of the balloons mouth. Hold the balloon over the stove so that hot air may enter the balloon. Keep the balloon over the stove until it looks/feels as though it is ready to take off (usually anywhere from 30-45 seconds will do). When enough hot air has entered the balloon, release the balloon and let it fly up and away. Let the balloon fly for about twenty (20) seconds. When the balloon has successfully been flown pull on the string that you attached to the balloon to recover the balloon. The string keeps the balloon from being blown away as well as keeping it from flying into trees or other objects.

Please keep safe by using heat resistant gloves such as oven mitts or welders gloves. The metal duct does get hot. The balloon is not over the duct pipe long enough to catch fire. We had to have both gas burners going to get sufficient heat up the pipe. Happy flying. There is a good DVD called ''Night Crossing'' about a family who escaped over the Berlin boarder. They built two balloons and had two attempts to freedom.

=== Expressions ===

'''はじめまして'''

This expression is only used when you first meet someone and has the same meaning as &quot;Nice to meet you&quot; or &quot;How do you do?&quot;  

'''よろしくおねがいします'''

This expression is difficult to translate into English.  It's a greeting statement that's common after 「はじめまして」.  In this context, it's like asking &quot;Please favor me with your friendship&quot;  or &quot;I'm looking forward to working with you.&quot;   There are many different levels of politeness for this expression.   From most polite to casual, we have

:どうぞよろしくおねがいします
:よろしくおねがいします
:どうぞよろしく
:よろしく

The decision to which to use depends on the listener.  「よろしくおねがいします」 is polite enough for most circumstances.

== Grammar Overview ==



=== The question particle ===

The kana 「か」 is used at the end of the sentence, after a verb, to indicate that the sentence is a question or doubt. The use of a question mark is optional, and most of the time a 「。」 is used. Some people must substitute the 「か」 with the question marker, but even in these cases the sound is still spoken.


=== The さん Honorific ===
* 〜さん (''-san'') is an honorific suffix denoting Mr., Miss, Mrs., or Ms. 
:: すずき さん
:: ''Suzuki-san''
:: Mr/Ms Suzuki.

This should be used when speaking to someone of higher status (e.g., your boss) or out of respect to another individual.  There are many more honorifics that may be used.  You do not attach an honorific to your own name.  However, there are exceptions to this (e.g., sensei.)
&lt;center&gt;

&lt;/center&gt;

===What is a copula?===

In English, the verb 'to be' serves two purposes: It acts as the copula, and it acts as the verb for existence. However, in many languages, including Japanese, these two verbs are separate—so it helps to have an understanding of the difference between the two usages.

A copula can be thought of as an equals sign: it equates two things to each other. In the sentence &quot;That is a dog,&quot; 'is' is the copula. In the sentence &quot;The dog is inside,&quot; you don't mean that 'the dog' and 'inside' are the same thing; you mean that the dog exists inside.

These two usages have different verbs in Japanese, so it'd be good to get used to it now. Here are some examples:

Using 'to be' as a copula:
* That man is the president.
* Joe is a salesman.
* The dog is a golden retriever.
* This paper is my report.

Using 'to be' to mean existence:
* Sara is outside.
* The plate is on the table.
* The watch is on my wrist.
* They are at the mall.
* There is John.

In Japanese, です is the copula.  It is used to equate two things, not used for existence of an item.  Japanese uses two separate verb to express existence of inanimate and animate items.  [[wiki:Copula_(linguistics) | Wikipedia]] has a detail entry on the copula, its basic use, and its use in various languages.  The negative form of です is  じゃ ありません.  This is an example of verb [[wiki:Grammatical_conjugation|conjugation]].  As you would imagine, this would mean two items are not equal to each other.
&lt;center&gt;

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|+'''です  Conjugation'''
|-
! Type of speech !! Verb
|-

| (This) is a pencil.

| (This) is not a dictionary.
|-
 |John です
| I'm John.
|-
| John-san じゃ ありません 
| (That) is not John.
|}
&lt;/center&gt;
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;Note, these are loose translations since there's no topic described.  These examples are meant to illustrate the use of the copula.

===Predicates===
====English Predicates====
In English, we learn that a sentence consists of a '''[[w:Subject (grammar)|subject]]''' and a '''[[w:Predicate (grammar)|predicate]]'''. The predicate of a sentence indicates what the subject is, what the subject does, or what happens to the subject. For example, in the English sentence:

:John is a baseball player.

The subject is &quot;John&quot;, and the predicate is &quot;is a baseball player&quot;. The sentence is about John, but it states that John is something, namely he &quot;is a baseball player.&quot; In English, the predicate of a simple sentence starts with the '''[[w:Verb|verb]]''' and continues to the end of the sentence.

====Japanese Predicates====
In Japanese, a complete sentence must have a predicate, but the subject can be implied rather than stated, which is exactly the case more often than not. The Japanese equivalent of the above sentence would be (informal/formal ending):

:ジョンは{{ruby-2|野球|やきゅう||選手|せんしゅ|}}だ/です。
:''Jon wa yakyuu senshu da / desu.''

However, if you were already talking about John, his name would not be mentioned again and the sentence would be shortened to:

:{{ruby-2|野球|やきゅう||選手|せんしゅ|}}だ/です。
:''Yakyuu senshu da / desu.''

In Japanese, when you want to form a predicate with a noun, the structure to use is:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|+'''Noun Predicate Formation'''
|-
! Type of speech !! Japanese !! Roomaji 
|-
! Formal
| NOUN です  || NOUN ''desu''
|-
! Informal
| NOUN だ      || NOUN ''da''
|}

Japanese ''[[w:Japanese particles|particles]]'' (助詞 ''joshi'') are a Japanese part of speech consisting of suffixes or short words which '''follow''' other words such as nouns, verbs and adjectives, to indicate a wide range of grammatical and discursive (communicative) functions. For instance, particles are used to indicate, or ''mark'', the subject, direct object, and so on; in English, this task is normally performed by word order. Particles may also indicate the speaker's assertiveness, certitude, or other feelings. Note that a particle cannot exist by itself, it always '''follows''' another word or phrase.

== Quick explanations ==
* 〜さん (''-san'') is an honorific suffix denoting Mr., Miss, Mrs., or Ms. 
:: すずき さん
:: ''Suzuki-san''
:: Mr/Ms Suzuki.
* The easiest Japanese sentence contains just one word followed by です. です is the [[some link to a longer explanation|Japanese Copula]], linking two words much like the English word &quot;to be&quot;. For example: そうです - soo desu, meaning &quot;it is so&quot;. Note that very often the subject will be implied in Japanese, and です doesn't change for different people, so if you see ぐみです that could mean &quot;I am Gumi&quot; or &quot;He is Gumi&quot; (or even &quot;you are Gumi&quot; or &quot;they are Gumi&quot; or anything &quot;be Gumi&quot;) depending on the context.
* To turn any sentence into a yes/no question, add the [[some link to a longer explanation|particle]] か : そうですか? - Is that so? か is used at the end of the sentence, after a verb, to the point that it has become synonymous with a question mark. Some people don't write か anymore and just write ? (still pronouncing the &quot;ka&quot; though). But in most cases you will see &quot;か。&quot; at the end of a question - the &quot;?&quot; is optional as か is marker enough. 
* When meeting somebody for the first time, say &quot;はじめまして&quot; (nice to meet you). Don't say this when you've met them before. Also don't forget the phrase &quot;よろしくおねがいします&quot; (please be kind to me). Japanese is full of funny polite expressions like that.</text>

== Description ==

This component blurs a color image.  It's expensive but reduces noise. 

== Input ==

[[Image:SwisTrack_ColorImage.jpg]]

A grayscale or a color image.


== Parameters ==

=== Mode ===
The type of blur.  This is from the openCV documentation:
        * CV_BLUR_NO_SCALE (simple blur with no scaling) - summation over a pixel param1×param2 neighborhood. 
          If the neighborhood size is not fixed, one may use cvIntegral function.
        * CV_BLUR (simple blur) - summation over a pixel param1×param2 neighborhood with subsequent scaling by 1/(param1•param2).
        * CV_GAUSSIAN (gaussian blur) - convolving image with param1×param2 Gaussian.
        * CV_MEDIAN (median blur) - finding median of param1×param1 neighborhood (i.e. the neighborhood is square).
        * CV_BILATERAL (bilateral filter) - applying bilateral 3x3 filtering with color sigma=param1 and space sigma=param2.

=== Radius ===
The size of the square to average over.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=How To Get Started with PHP CCAPS=

'''CCAPS''', or ''Carefully-Controlled Alternative [[PHP]] Syntax'', is a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_template_system web template system] alternative to template engines such as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smarty Smarty] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CakePHP CakePHP]. CCAPS, pronounced ''Cee-Caps'', is what PHP web developers can use to separate [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XHTML XHTML] source from programming logic, yet glue the two together nicely without introducing [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spaghetti_code spaghetti code].

==Preference==
Many developers prefer it to engines such as Smarty because:

* it is thinner in architecture and therefore runs faster
* uses concepts most PHP developers already know
* PHP is already a great templating engine
* PHP already provides conditional and control flow features
* requires no extra installation step
* guarantees you that it won't break on your server because it includes no extra libraries -- no function add-ons to ensure you have installed
* it is more adaptable

==Guidelines==
PHP already has an [http://www.onlamp.com/pub/a/php/2001/05/03/php_foundations.html?page=1 Alternative PHP Syntax], but what CCAPS does are the following guidelines:

* The template pages end in the file extension &quot;.php&quot; unless other arrangements make it possible to load these into one's editor with proper colored formatting of source, and unless Apache directives permit certain other file extensions to be processed like PHP pages.

* Templates go into a folder called &quot;views&quot; and has Apache access controls so that the pages can be included, but not viewed directly by end users.

* All template file names must begin with a lowercase &quot;v&quot; for &quot;View&quot;. In an [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model-view-controller MVC framework], a template is a view. For instance, a file could be named vLogin.php. The &quot;v&quot; helps one delineate easier in a text editor between the view and the page controller, which might be called, for instance, Login.php.

* In order to get PHP values into the XHTML, PHP constant variables are used. PHP constant variables are only included in the XHTML in uppercase so as to make them easy to spot in the usually lowercase XHTML source. 

* The PHP constant variables are included as &lt;?= MYVAR ?&gt; so as to use the fewest keystrokes possible, rather than &lt;?php echo MYVAR; ?&gt;. If this requires alteration in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_web_server Apache] settings, or in how the PHP is compiled of configured, then this is accommodated.

* As a ground rule, only three (3) if/then conditions are permitted in a given XHTML page. If more are necessary, then it is strongly recommended that these be moved into separate smaller view files, or that the XHTML be composed inside the calling page's programming logic via a function or object method, and then passed down into the XHTML template as a single variable. This keeps the source clean and makes it easier to edit.

* Nested if/then conditions are strongly discouraged and, if necessary, one should make XHTML inside the calling PHP page (the page controller) and pass to the view for insertion.

* If/then conditions are only permitted using alternative syntax style without the curly braces, such as:

&lt;pre&gt;
 &lt;? if (TAB == 'main'): ?&gt;
 &lt;xhtml goes here&gt;
 &lt;? else: ?&gt;
 &lt;xhtml goes here&gt;
 &lt;? endif; ?&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

* No loops are permitted whatsoever. Instead, this functionality must be created in the calling page's programming logic, usually through a contained function or object method, and then inserted as a single, capitalized variable in the XHTML source of this page template.

* No other conditional logic is permitted besides if/then, such as select/case logic. Instead, this logic must be implemented in the calling page.

* The templates should include a header or footer in a separate file. This file is usually capitalized such as vHEADER1.php, vFOOTER2.php so as to make it more easily found in the templates folder.

* For pages that require a sidebar, this is probably more suited to being composed as a smaller view file and included as such.

* Often it is suitable for a class of static methods be composed in PHP to address this template, such as...

&lt;pre&gt;
 View::Assign('MYVAR','This is my test');
 View::Display('vMain.php');
&lt;/pre&gt;

...whereas the Display method automatically assumes vMain.php is in a subfolder called &quot;views&quot;.

* Another guideline is a word of caution. Since we use constants, you will need to watch out for PHP's little-known feature where if you try to display a constant that is not defined, it displays the variable name instead, which may be completely unexpected and erratic. So, if you only do a View::Assign() on a variable with an if/then condition, and not provide that same View::Assign() to make an empty value pre-defined constant, then PHP will automatically display that constant as its own variable name. Therefore, watch out for...

&lt;pre&gt;
 &lt;?php
 require_once('classes/View.php');
 if (empty($_POST['name'])) {
     View::Assign('ERRORMSG','No name was provided');
 }
 View::Display('vTest.php');&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
 &lt;?php ?&gt;
 &lt;?= ERRORMSG ?&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

...which would cause the word 'ERRORMSG' to appear on the page. The fix is this:

&lt;pre&gt;
 &lt;?php
 require_once('classes/View.php');
 $sErr = '';
 if (empty($_POST['name'])) {
     $sErr = 'No name was provided';
 }
 View::Assign('ERRORMSG',$sErr);
 View::Display('vTest.php');&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
 &lt;?php ?&gt;
 &lt;?= ERRORMSG ?&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

==Installation==
Most PHP installations already support CCAPS and do not require additional libraries to be installed.

==Sample View Class==
A sample View class could look like the following.

&lt;pre&gt;
 &lt;?php
 
 class View {
 
 const ENCODE_DEFAULT = 0;
 const ENCODE_HTML = 1;
 const ENCODE_URL = 2;
 
 function Assign($sVarName, $sVal, $nType = self::ENCODE_DEFAULT) {
     switch ($nType) {
         case self::ENCODE_HTML: // show the html
             $sVal = htmlentities($sVal);
             break;
         case self::ENCODE_URL: // prepare for urls
             $sVal = urlencode($sVal);
             break;
         default: // 0, default, as is, unaltered
             break;
         
     }
     $sVarName = strtoupper($sVarName);
     define($sVarName, $sVal);
 }
 
 function Display($sTemplateFile) {
     $sScriptName = $_SERVER['SCRIPT_NAME'];
     $sBaseName = basename($sScriptName);
     define('U',str_replace($sBaseName,'',$sScriptName));
 
    $sPath = dirname(__FILE__);
    $sPath = str_replace('classes','',$sPath);
    require_once($sPath . 'views/' . $sTemplateFile);
 }
 
 }&lt;/pre&gt;

So, as an example, you could have a test.php which looks like:

&lt;pre&gt;
 &lt;?php
 require_once('classes/View.php');
 View::Assign('TEST','This is my test.');
 View::Display('vTest.php');&lt;/pre&gt;

Then, your vTest.php might look like:

&lt;pre&gt;
 &lt;?php ?&gt;
 &lt;html&gt;
 &lt;head&gt;&lt;title&gt;Test&lt;/title&gt;&lt;/head&gt;
 &lt;body&gt;
 &lt;?= TEST ?&gt;
 &lt;/body&gt;
 &lt;/html&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

Notice how we use TEST instead of $TEST. This is because it's a constant. This not only discourages abuses that could lead to spaghetti code, but also runs a lot faster than if we used a global variable array technique in our View class to load and unload variables as they are passed from one PHP page to another.

== How Do I Categorize a New Book to the Proper Subject ==

I created a new book: [[A New Model of the Atom]]. When I initiated the &quot;Cleanup-link&quot; I received this message:

This book may be hard for readers to find. Please add a link to it on any appropriate bookshelves.
For assistance, post a notice on the Staff Lounge with the title of this book included.
When this book is properly shelved, you can remove {{tlx|cleanup-link}} from this page. If this is a new book, use {{tlx|New book}} instead.

This template is becoming deprecated because bookshelves are being abandoned in favor of the Subject Pages. Use {{tlx|Uncategorized}} instead.

So, I am unclear on how to link my book to the Subject Pages.
Your advice would be appreciated.

--[[User:Pcfjr9|Pcfjr9]] ([[User talk:Pcfjr9|talk]]) 19:11, 2 October 2008 (UTC)

:Books are listed on subject pages through the use of subject categories. If you categorize a book using an existing subject category, it will show up automatically on the right Subject page. You can add {{tlx|subject|Molecular Biology}} for instance to the bottom of &quot;A New Model of the Atom&quot; and than on [[Subject:Molecular Biology]] that book would be listed. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:23, 2 October 2008 (UTC)
== Tort Law Student Spreading the Love ==

Hello.  I'm a student studying Tort Law at a state university.  I came here to look for more info on this, but found most of the categories empty.  Since I've got our first test next week, I figured I'd enter some info from my notes into the empty categories as a way of reinforcing my knowledge, and to generally inform &amp; entertain the casual reader seeking introduction to Tort concepts, terminology, etc.  

The many harrowing exploits of the fictional SW, used as examples of various concepts, are almost entirely from class lectures by my fine teacher, an attorney, who I imagine would like to remain nameless here, but who appreciates &amp; collects stories of bizarre torts.  All modifications to his examples anecdotes are my fault alone.  If anyone has any examples of bizarre torts, please send them my way so I can get some extra credit. ;D

All civil comments are welcome, as are constructive suggestions. 

This is a great resource!

Send those comments &amp; bizarre torts to

== How to write Book Review? ==

Hello,
I am a student of Internationla Relations. I want your assistance in reviewing book. Could you please tell me the basics of how to write book review?

Regards,
Ali.

:Hello Ali, what book are you interested in reviewing, one of ours? We don't normally do book reviews here, at least nobody ever has in an organized way. So, I can't really answer your question because we don't know of a good way to do it either. Probably the best way to do it would be to write your review on the talk page of the book. Click the &quot;discussion&quot; tab at the top of the page to get to the talk page, and write your review there. If you're talking about reviewing a book that's not here on Wikibooks, I don't know and can't help you. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 13:08, 4 October 2008 (UTC)

== Move Book search gadget to Common.js ==

I have noticed that a link to search within currently read book using Google has been removed from toolbox and moved to optional gadgets. I completely don't understand this move, as this function is mostly useful for our readers and I'm sure most people reading Wikibooks are not logged in and consequently aren't able to turn on this gadget. For me, our internal search is not very useful when someone needs some information read previously but does not remember in which chapter of currently read book it is located - and I suppose such situation happens often when reading a manual/textbook.

I suggest removing the gadget and incorporating its code in Common.js so that all people can use it.--[[User:Derbeth|Derbeth]] [[User talk:Derbeth|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 17:48, 11 September 2008 (UTC)
:'''Agree.''' It would surely enhance the usability of the project.  I used this feature just this morning when I wanted to know how to do something in LaTeX.  I surely did not want to read the whole book or even skim it, when all I needed was a tiny bit of information (and in a hurry)! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 18:39, 11 September 2008 (UTC)
:{{agree}} The more features we can integrate into the site directly to support book-like structures, the better off we would be. I think that this should be part of common.js and not an optional gadget. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 01:42, 14 September 2008 (UTC)

&lt;pre&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;A&lt;/noinclude&gt;&lt;includeonly&gt;B&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
But within a template &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; etc. is already evaluated. Thus, how do I write templates that generate different texts for the print version? --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|talk]]) 09:07, 23 September 2008 (UTC)

:This is a relatively tricky topic, and one that has generated no satisfactory answers in years of discussions. You might want to ask [[User:Darklama]] as he's our resident expert with template esoterica (I'm no slouch, but he's better).
:If the template is general purpose, you're basically out of luck with few exceptions. Setting class=&quot;metadata&quot; or class=&quot;noprint&quot; as a CSS class in a template will make the template invisible when printed, but not when displayed on the web. I might be able to put together the reverse, a CSS class that is &quot;printonly&quot; that would only display on a printed version but not on the web. I'll work on that now and see what kind of success I have. You would be able to create two &amp;lt;div&amp;gt;s, one that was &quot;noprint&quot; and one that was &quot;printonly&quot; for each purpose.
:If the template is only intended for use in a single book, you could use a parser function to differentiate based on the page name: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{#ifeq:{{PAGENAME}}|My Book/Print Version|&lt;SHOWN ONLY IN PRINT VERSION&gt;|&lt;SHOWN ONLY IN WEB VERSION&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; That can get a little messy though, and is not transferrable between books.

::Actually, looking at the CSS there does appear to already be a &quot;printonly&quot; CSS class. I'll do some testing to see if it works as advertised. --'''Whiteknight'''&amp;nbsp;([[User:Whiteknight|Page]])&amp;nbsp;([[User talk:Whiteknight|Talk]]) 20:54, 23 September 2008 (UTC)

== Does ifexist not work on images? ==

At the [[Japanese]] wikibook we have lists of characters for which we (try to) provide the correct stroke order for. There are many gaps in the several sets of images available at Commons. I would like to be able to try each set of images for the one I need so I [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Template:Japanese_kanji_readings&amp;diff=1303986&amp;oldid=1273131 modified] [[Template:Japanese kanji readings]] to loop over these.

It didn't work. Playing around with ifexist in [[User:Swift/sandbox|my sandbox]] it seems that it won't work with images. Is there any way to fix this? --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 04:38, 10 October 2008 (UTC)

: Yug on Commons gave me the fix:
::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#ifexist:&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''Media:'''image_name.ext|then ...|otherwise ...}}&lt;/code&gt; - test is the '''file''' exist on '''upload.wikimedia.org'''
::&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#ifexist:&lt;/nowiki&gt;'''Image:'''image_name.ext|then ...|otherwise ...}}&lt;/code&gt; - test is the '''image page''' exist on the '''local wiki'''

== copyright uncertainty ==

Hello, 

I am revising the book &quot;US history&quot; for content and organization.

Of course one nice thing to do in such a book is include pictures that illustrate my ideas and give some sense of perspective to dramatic events and places.

I have done quite a lot of research of wikipedia and that strikes me as a very good resource for a broad project such as a introductery textbook.

Since images are already on wikimedia, is the licensing of wikipedia images allow me to place them in the textbooks.  is there some mark or note I should look for on wikipedia, to know whether I can use the image on my textbook and lastly is there some better way of using the images than , downloading them, putting them on my harddrive and uploading them into the textbook.

I know there is a commons area with a lot of images, is there any way to search through whats in there?

hoping I not asking dumb questions.--[[User:JoliePA|JoliePA]] ([[User talk:JoliePA|talk]]) 12:39, 27 October 2008 (UTC)

: In my experience, I have found that ''most'' of the images in Wikipedia are hosted on the Commons.  If you go to the [http://commons.wikimedia.org Commons] you should find a search box so you can look for images.  On Wikipedia, if you click on an image, it will tell you if it is available on the Commons by saying:
::''This is a file from the Wikimedia Commons. The description on its description page there is shown below.  Commons is a freely licensed media file repository. You can help. ''
:Clicking on &quot;its description page&quot; will take you to the Commons.  If the file is not on the Commons, you should carefully read the licensing info given for the image on WP.  If you judge it to be legitimate, then you can copy it to the Commons (that's far better than uploading it to Wikibooks).  It is a manual process though - you have to download it to your computer, then upload it to the Commons.  The Commons has a tool for copying licensing info from WP, so the process is somewhat automated.  If you have questions, please ask.  Hope that helped. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 13:54, 27 October 2008 (UTC)

== Question about Re-Titling a Wikibook ==

Hi - Everyone! 

I have really enjoyed creating my fist Wikibook and plan to create more as I gather data. 
After some time, I realized I should give my book a better title. However: 

Are there negative ramifications to re-titling?&lt;br&gt;
Will re-titling cause my book to &quot;get lost&quot; from links and status already created? 

The title has been &quot;'''A New Model of the Atom'''&quot;. I think a better title would be &quot;'''New Models for the Duality of Light and Atomic Structure'''&quot;. 

[[User:Pcfjr9|Pcfjr9]] ([[User talk:Pcfjr9|talk]]) 17:56, 28 October 2008 (UTC) &lt;br&gt;
My Wikibook is located at: [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/A_New_Model_of_the_Atom A New Model of the Atom]

: I belive what you can do is you can redirect it so that if someone types '''A New Model of the Atom''' in then it will be redirected to &quot;'''New Models for the Duality of Light and Atomic Structure'''&quot;. Hope that helps you. [[User:HayesC|HayesC]] ([[User talk:HayesC|talk]]) 20:26, 28 October 2008 (UTC)
== Collapsible Tables ==

Thanks to the kind admin who has added collapsible tables to the repertoire.
For those who are wondering about it, it is a clickable table which drops the content and hides it again with a toggle action.   They have only a couple of words different from other tables.   This is the basic shell of the code, and it makes the table below:
&lt;poem&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;{| class=&quot;wikitable collapsible collapsed&quot;
! Press to drop the contents
|-
| Hidden text or image here
|}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
&lt;/poem&gt;

{| class=&quot;wikitable collapsible collapsed&quot; 
!  style=&quot;background:white;&quot;| Press to show the contents
|- align=left
| [[image:Hawthorn_blossom.jpg|300px]]&lt;br&gt;''Hawthorn Blossom''
|}

How can the color of the heading be change from purple?

== PDF and ODT export, Collection management enabled ==

The open source PediaPress extension is now running in all Wikibooks languages (see our [http://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Wikis_Go_Printable press release] from last year). This enables users to easily build collections of pages, to structure them hierarchically, and to download them in PDF and ODT versions. You can also order a print-on-demand copy directly from PediaPress.

See [[Help:Collections]] for documentation. Help with translating it is appreciated; I've also posted a notice to translators-l to this effect.

I've created an English example collection:
[[User:Eloquence/Collections/Blended_Learning]]

Collection meta-pages are, IMO, an excellent way to manage the structure of Wikibooks. Note how you can hide the ugly subpage syntax from PDF output by simply using piped titles. It wouldn't be terribly difficult, I think, to build a MediaWiki extension that builds automatic navigation headers from collection meta-info.

To get a PDF, ODT or to order a printed copy of the collection above, go here:

http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special:Collection/load_collection/?colltitle=User:Eloquence/Collections/Blended_Learning

Again, note that this is a predictable URL which could be embedded into printable version templates and such.

To report bugs, please visit:
http://code.pediapress.com/

create an account, and create a &quot;new ticket&quot;. The PP team is very responsive &amp; helpful. :-)

Known issues:

* Licensing info isn't perfect. This is a tricky one because proper attribution of collaborative works is generally non-trivial, but we're working together on improving it.
* There are non-internationalizable strings in the PDF output. The PediaPress team is working with translatewiki.net to sort this out.
* ODT support is still experimental, so please give lots of feedback on brokenness.

Please give us plenty of feedback on this initial deployment. :-)

# Remove from the fire and stir for 5 to 7 minutes till the milk is slightly cool.
# Add the citric acid solution and stir the milk gently.
# The milk mill curdle and the whey will separate. The whey has to be clear thus indicating the milk has completely curdled. Allow it to rest for 3 to 4 minutes.
# Strain out all the whey using a clean damp muslin cloth.
# Fold all the 4 sides of the muslin cloth and twirl it gently so that all the whey that is in the milk solids gets evenly drained out.
# Gather the cloth from all 4 sides and squeeze the chenna lightly about 3 to 4 times so that most of the whey gets drained out.
# Remove the chenna onto a clean plate and knead gently so that it is free of lumps and take care not to apply too much pressure while kneading the chenna.
# It is advisable to use this almost immediately. Use as required. 


==== For the sugar syrup ====

#   Combine the sugar and milk with 3 cups of water in a large pan approx. 200 mm. (8&quot;) in diameter and 150 mm. (6&quot;) in height and heat while stirring continuously till the sugar dissolves.
#   When the syrup comes to a boil, the impurities in the sugar will begin to float on the surface, forming a grey layer.
#   Heat over a medium flame to allow the grey layer to float. Do not stir at this point as the layer will break and it will not clarify the syrup.
#   After about 5 minutes, slowly drizzle 1 cup of water form the sides of the pan with the help of a ladle. Water added at this stage will bring down the temperature of the sugar syrup and will not allow it to boil and break the grey layer.
#   Continue to simmer the syrup over a medium flame for about 10 minutes and then gently remove the grey layer using a slotted spoon.
#   Bring the syrup to the boil once again and then slowly drizzle another cup of water from the sides of the pan using a ladle. remove all the remaining impurities from the syrup, again using a slotted spoon.
#    Increase the flame and boil vigorously for 1 to 2 minutes. Keep aside. 


==== For the rasgullas ====

# Divide the chenna into 16 equals parts and roll each part into a ball, taking care to see that the there are no cracks on the surface
#Dust the back of a flat plate (thali) lightly with the flour and place the rolled chenna balls on it. 


==== How to proceed ====

#   Mix 2 teaspoons of the plain flour with 3/4 cup of water to make a flour solution. Keep aside.
#   Heat the sugar syrup in a deep pan over a high flame and allow it to boil vigorously.
#   When it boils, sprinkle half the flour solution in the sugar syrup and then add the chenna balls by upturning the plate on which they are kept. (Do not touch the chenna balls at this point as they are fragile).
#   When the flour solution is added, a frothy layer is formed on the surface of the syrup.
#   If the frothy layer begins to subside, sprinkle the remaining half portion of the flour solution.
#   After this, keep on sprinkling water (minimum 1 cup) on the surface of the sugar syurp. Ensure that the syrup froths all the time while cooking the rasgullas.
#   Cook for about 15 minutes, continuously sprinkling water to enable the froth to form.
#   Check if the rasgullas are cooked. This is determined by touch. If the rasgulla springs back and retains its shape when pressed, it is cooked. Another way of checking is to drop a rasgulla in a pan of cold water.
#   If it sinks to the bottom, it is cooked.
#   Remove form the fire.
#  Transfer the rasgullas to a bowl along with 2 ladles of sugar syrup and 1 cup of water.
#  Cool and chill for approx. 3 to 4 hours before serving. 


==== Tips ====

#  Rasgullas should always be cooked on a very high flame.
#   While cooking rasgullas, the sugar syrup must froth continuously.
#   The pan should be approximately 200 mm. (8&quot;) in diameter and 150 mm. (6&quot;) in height and the sugar syrup should fill about 1/3 of the pan.
#   While making rasgulla shapes (see variation below), always ensure that there are no cracks on the surface of the shapes.
#  While cooking, rasgullas expand to at least 4 times their original size.
#  While sprinkling water on the syrup when the rasgullas are cooking,
#   make sure you sprinkle a little water at a time (approx. a teaspoon at a time using your hands) and not large quantities.
#   The cooking time of the rasgullas will vary depending on their size. (i.e. large shapes viz. the rolls, rajbhog etc. will need more cooking time and versa).

Hullo!!! I wish to add my welcome to that of mike's. :-) I just observe a recent page that you've created. Well, Wikibooks does not accept original research. So, please do add your references. Also, it isn't a practice in Wikibooks to sign one's contributions. Such a practice is highly discouraged. I am sorry I couldn't understand what youb were trying to express. The content required a copy-edit. That's the reason why I tagged it for deletion. Thanks. We welcome your contributions. If you are in need of any help do contact me at my talkpage -&lt;font color=&quot;maroon&quot; size=&quot;4&quot; face=&quot;Monotype Corsiva&quot;&gt;[[User:Ravichandar84|Ravichandar]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;aqua&quot; face=&quot;Monotype Corsiva&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Ravichandar84|My coffee shop]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; 12:38, 18 October 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* Formation of Double Helix */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== General Information ==
American scientist '''Josiah Willard Gibbs''' (1839-1903) had created the theory of available energy, known as '''Gibbs Free Energy''' in 1873. The theory relates the energy changes within the chemical reaction and how they depend upon the following quantities: [[Structural Biochemistry/Enthalpy|enthalpy]], temperature, reagents concentration and [[Structural Biochemistry/Entropy|entropy]] of the system. In other words, these quantities will determine whether the reaction is favorable (exergonic) or not (endergonic).

The free energy change of a reaction (delta G) can tell us whether or not a reaction occurs spontaneously. Reactions that occur spontaneously have a negative delta G value, and such reactions are called exergonic.  When delta G is positive, the reaction does not occur spontaneously, and the input of free energy is required for the reaction to proceed, thus it is called an [[Structural Biochemistry/Endergonic reaction|endergonic reaction]].  When a system is at equilibrium where no net change occurs, then delta G is zero.  The delta G of a reaction is the free energy of the final state minus the free energy of the initial state, making it is independent of the reaction pathway.  However, the value of delta G provides no information on the rate of a reaction.

== Gibbs Free Energy Equation ==
[[Image:Wykres Gibbsa.svg|175px|thumb|right|This is a '''Gibbs free energy''' graph by Josiah Willard Gibbs. it shows a plane perpendicular to the axis of ''v'' (volume) and passing through point A - represents the initial state of the body. MN is the section of the surface of dissipated energy. Qε and Qη are sections of the planes ''η'' = 0 and ''ε'' = 0, and therefore parallel to the axes of ε (internal energy) and η (entropy), respectively. AD and AE are the energy and entropy of the body in its initial state, AB and AC its '''Gibbs free energy''' and its '''capacity for entropy''' (the amount by which the entropy of the body can be increased without changing the energy of the body or increasing its volume) respectively.]]

We often focus on how to manipulate the use of Gibbs free energy equation instead of how to derives it and its derivation. The most commonly used equations for calculation are

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S \,&lt;/math&gt; (for constant temperature) - equation(1)

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta G = -R T \ln K \,&lt;/math&gt; (for equilibrium constant that depends on temperature) - equation(2)

Where ΔH is change in [[Structural Biochemistry/Enthalpy|enthalpy]], T is the temperature of the system (in kelvin (K)), ΔS is change in [[Structural Biochemistry/Entropy|entropy]] of the system, R is gas constant, K is equilibrium constant.

=== Numerical Meaning of ΔG ===
If '''ΔG &lt; 0''' (negative), then the reaction will proceed spontaneously. Meaning the reaction is favorable (exergonic)

If '''ΔG &gt; 0''' (positive), then the reaction will not proceed spontaneously. Meaning the reaction is unfavorable (endergonic)

If '''ΔG = 0''' (equal to zero), then the reaction is at equilibrium

In general, every system wants to achieve a minimum of free energy. Therefore, when Gibbs free energy is negative, the reaction is more favorable.
=== Meaning of work to free energy===
The sign of entropy (S) can determine whether a reaction is spontaneous or not. However, the sign of work (Delta H) cannot determine the spontaneous process. For instance, the exothermic reaction become spontaneous under certain conditions. And the endothermic reaction can also become spontaneous under different conditions. Silberberg used&lt;ref&gt;Silberberg, Martin S.(2010). Principles of General Chemistry (2nd Edition).McGraw Hill Publishing Company. ISBN978-0-07-351108-05&lt;/ref&gt; water as an example to explain such conditions. 


&quot;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (l) ---&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (s)     Delta H of the reaction = -6.02 KJ (an exothermic reaction; spontaneous when T&lt;0&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;C)


H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (s) ---&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (l)     Delta H of the reaction = +6.02 KJ (an endothermic reaction; spontaneous when T&gt;0&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;C)&quot;



In both reactions,the sign of enthalpy has no effect on the spontaneous change. Therefore, one cannot use enthalpy as a factor to determine the direction of a spontaneous reaction.

== Standard Gibbs Free Energy of Formation ==
When we have to consider the relationship between Gibbs free energy and the standard-state free energy of a reaction, we use this equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta G = \Delta G^\circ + R T \ln Q \,&lt;/math&gt;

to calculate Gibbs free energy at that of time under a specific circumstances. Where ΔG&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;
is the standard-states - reactants (or components) at 25&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;o&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;C (degrees Celsius) and 1 atm (atmospheric pressure, 1 atm same as 100 kilopascals), Q is the reaction quotient. The motivation behind it is that these elements, reactants, and substances, are thermodynamically stable at such atmosphere.

== Chemical potential ==
From elementary thermodynamics, Gibbs free energy, G, is defined as,&lt;ref name=&quot;as,&quot;/&gt;

&lt;math&gt;	
dG = -SdT + VdP +\sum_{i=1}^C u_i dN_i   
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;u_i&lt;/math&gt; is the partial molar Gibbs free energy of species i.

The chemical potential is not favorable for phase-equilibria calculation when the pressure approaches zero. Then, fugacity is used instead:

&lt;math&gt;
f_i=C \exp(u_i/RT)
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f_i &lt;/math&gt; is the partial fugacity of species i. C is a temperature-dependent constant.

Because fugacity has relationship with pressure, then fugacity coefficient of a pure species:

&lt;math&gt;
\phi_i =f_i/P
&lt;/math&gt;

fugacity coefficient of a species in a mixture:

&lt;math&gt;
\phi_{iV} =f_{iV}/(y_i P)
&lt;/math&gt;

==Free Energy of Enzymes ==
Free energy determines whether a conversion of reactants to products will occur spontaneously. In the case of an enzyme, ΔG determines the rate of a reaction. Enzymes cannot affect thermodynamics of a reaction, and hence do not affect the equilibrium; Additionally, enzymes accelerate the attainment of equilibria but do not shift their positions.  The equilibrium position is a function only of the free-energy difference between reactants and products&lt;ref&gt;Berg, Jeremy M., Tymoczko, John L., and Stryer, Lubert. Biochemistry. 6th ed. New York, N.Y.: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2007: 211.&lt;/ref&gt;.  They are however, able to reach the equilibrium point at a far faster rate than without the presence of an enzyme. 

For instance, in the presence of an enzyme, products could form within a second. On the other hand, products could take a as long as days to form without the presence of the catalyst. In both cases, concentration and amount of product formed remains entirely the same- it's equilibrium state. The amount of products it has formed has balanced with the amount of substrate.

Enzymes decrease &lt;u&gt;only&lt;/u&gt; the free energy of activation- otherwise known as the activation energy. The '''Transition state''' between a substrate and the product is the point between a reaction where the substrates and products &quot;meet in the middle&quot;. At this point, the highest free energy exists for the reaction. The activation energy is the energy it takes for a substrate to reach this transition state.

There are many competing theories of how enzymes actually bind their substrates, and each theory has a different graphic representation of the affect of the enzyme on the free energy of the reaction. In the lock and key mechanism theory, an enzyme has the pre-existing conformation to bind to a unique substrate. After binding and catalyzing the reaction, the enzyme will release the final products. 

In the induced-fit mechanism theory, a similar approach is hypothesized. The only difference is that the pre-existing, unbound enzyme does not originally assume the exact conformation to bind the substrate; but rather assumes a slightly different structure prior to binding. Then, as the substrate binds to the enzyme, the structure of the active site conforms around the structure of the substrate to fit properly. Both of these mechanisms can be represented similarly in relation to their effect on the free energy of the reaction. Without really changing the pathway of the energy curve, these models serve to decrease the activation energy of a reaction, thereby increasing the rate of the reaction. 

Another model has been suggested however, that appears slightly different on the free energy graph. This is the proposed transition-state model. This model suggests that an enzyme is not structurally adept to bind to the substrate itself, but that it is actually optimized to bind to the transition state of the reaction pathway. This produces a small stabilization of the transition state decreasing the overall activation energy as is characteristic of enzymes. The first increase in energy is due to the binding of the enzyme to the original substrate. The return to original free energy state is stabilization of the enzyme-substrate complex before reaction occurs. The next increase in energy comes from achieving the transition state, and the subsequent fall is the creation of the products. This theory is currently accepted as an alternative because the enzyme-substrate complex of the other theories acquires a very low free energy level due to stabilization. To achieve the transition state after this relatively low level of free energy is much more difficult than achieving the transition state from the relatively more energetically free enzyme-substrate complex suggested in this transition-state model.

==Formation of Double Helix==

[[File:Formation of Double Helix.png|thumb|Formation of Double Helix]]




Double-stranded molecules of nucleic acids form the double helix structure such as DNA and RNA. Formation of double helix is one of  biological process that the principles of thermodynamics are applied to it. In a solution containing single strands, all stands can easily move around, rotate, and disperse in the solution. In addition, forming conformation is easy in the single strands solution. However, when the double helix forms, it cannot displace as easy as two single strands could before. Moreover, it has less possible conformations. Thus, by forming double helix the randomness and entropy decrease.  

Due to the Second Law of thermodynamics, significant heat has to be released to the surroundings for the process to be consistent with increasing the entropy of universe. Measuring the changing of temperature of a solution before and after formation of double helix reveals that approximately 250 kJ/mol (60 kcal/mol)heat is released. This large released energy is sufficient to overcome the effects of formation double helix - increase of order- and make universe more disorder. &lt;ref&gt;Berg, Jeremy M., Tymoczko, John L., and Stryer, Lubert. Biochemistry. 6th ed. New York, N.Y.: W.H. Freeman and Company, 2007: 211.&lt;/ref&gt;

Electrostatic freeenergy of the DNA doublehelix in terms of the counterion condensation theory:
The polyelectrolyte theory reveals the formation of the double helix. The secondary structure of DNA is similar to the secondary structure of proteins. 
The number of condensed counterions is the same as for a line charge with charge density equal to the axial charge density of the helix. The logarithmic salt dependence of the electrostatic free energy is equivalent in range of lower salt concentration, thus the limiting laws stays constant. The helical parameters have a large influence on the overall electrostatic free energy and on the internal free energy of the condensed layer of counterions. The free energies of the single and double helix are negative at a higher salt level. Being negative indicates of the stabilization of the helical charge lattices electrostatic, because of mixing entropy of the condensed counterions. On the other hand, when the salt level is low, the free energy of a single helix is higher than the free energy of a double helix. 
With B-DNA parameters imagined as single helixes, the salt dependence of the free energy of transition from double strand to single is greatest at about 0.2 M salt, which is very similar to the area of the feature of separation of the DNA strand.The electrostatic freeenergy for the transition of the DNA doublehelix from the B to the A conformation can also be calculated. The Bform is the most electrostatically stable over the salt range. 
The electrostatic freeenergy values are close to the experimental values of the overall (electrostatic plus non-electrostatic) transition freeenergies for A-philic base pair sequences. 
B-to-A transition for A-philic sequences around concentration of  1 M  is watched over by the polyelectrolyte properties of these two orientations of the DNA double helix. On the other hand the effect of ethanol cannot be tied to the lowering of the dielectric constant.

==Bond Energies==
How is energy being used?  Is energy being consumed or absorbed in a reaction?

1) Bonds formed = Energy is '''released''' because it forms a more stable state. ΔH &lt; 0 heat is released.

2) Bonds broken = Energy is '''absorbed''' because breaking a stable state and moving towards a less stable state. ΔH &gt; 0 heat is absorbed.

Bond Energy products &gt; Bond Energy reactants : spontaneous

Bond Energy products &lt; Bond Energy reactants : non-spontaneous

[[Image:Bond Energy Diagrams.png|left|thumb|300px|Bond Energy Diagrams]]












ΔG = G products - G reactants

Note: You cannot switch the equation to be G reactants - G products.  

The key is to understand if energy is being overall released or absorbed in a reaction.  This will give you the correct sign for your ΔG.

== Devmon SNMP Hobbit Setup HOWTO ==
This howto is to explore processes of adding SNMP manager querying ability to a hobbit server. 
The assumptions and procedures are from http://www.techagent.com/devmon_snmp_hobbit_setup.htm with some minor editing.
== Assumptions ==
* Hobbit is installed and working.
* Devmon in installed with no apparent problems.
* You have a target device that has snmp enabled.
* You know the IP address of the target device.
* You know the read only (query) community string of the target device.
* No firewall is installed on the Linux machine or between your Linux machine and the snmp target device.
* You have [http://net-snmp.sourceforge.net/ net-snmp-utils] (or equivalent) installed on the Linux machine.
* This procedure use a Windows XP machine as an example SNMP device. Instructions for [http://manageengine.adventnet.com/products/applications_manager/help/appendix/snmp-agent-discovery.html installing/configuring an SNMP agent] for a variety of operating systems are available.

== Initial setup and testing ==
=== Ping the target snmp device ===
Do this from the hobbit server, of course. NOTE: In the examples below the snmp target device will be called '''winserver'''.
&lt;pre&gt;
[root@hob tmp]# ping winserver
PING winserver (192.168.100.105) 56(84) bytes of data.
64 bytes from winserver (192.168.100.105): icmp_seq=0 ttl=124 time=48.7 ms
&lt;/pre&gt;
This tells us that the device is up and is reachable across the network.

If you can't ping the snmp device, you must troubleshoot this problem before going any further. Remember sometimes devices are configured to not respond to a ping.

=== Try to read the sysDescr from the snmp device ===
This will tell us that we can reach the snmp device via snmp, we are using the correct read only (query) community string and we will use the returned information in future steps.
&lt;pre&gt;
[root@hob tmp]# snmpget -v2c -c public winserver 1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0
SNMPv2-MIB::sysDescr.0 = STRING: Hardware: x86 Family 15 Model 3 Stepping 4 AT/AT COMPATIBLE - Software: Windows 2000 Version 5.0 (Build 2195 Multiprocessor Free)
&lt;/pre&gt;
If you were successful, Hooray! This is a good thing:
* We can talk snmp to the device.
* We are using the correct community string.
* We are using the correct snmp version.
* We now know the sysDescr for the device, Devmon setup will need to know this.

If you weren't successful then you must troubleshoot this step before going any further. Perhaps try snmpget with the '''-d''' ( debug) option to gather more information and maybe try [[Wikipedia:tcpdump|tcpdump]] to listen for any communication between the linux server and the snmp target device.

=== Add the target device to your hobbit setup ===
Add a line for the device to your bb-hosts file. See the Devmon documentation for more information on the options you can add here.
 192.168.100.105 winserver # DEVMON:cid(public)

== Adding an unrecognized device and/or new test ==
=== Consider how Devmon operates ===
This was written by ''eschwim'' (the project admin). The way Devmon works is fairly simple. 

# An outside process (most likely devmon running with the '''--readbbhosts''' flag) updates the Devmon database from the Hobbit or BigBrother bb-hosts file.
#* In a single-node installation, the Devmon database is stored in the '''hosts.db''' file.
#* In a multi-node installation, it is kept in a MySQL database.
# Devmon reads its templates.
#* A single-node installation reads the templates from disk at the beginning of every polling cycle.
#* The multi-node version reads the templates from the database, but only if they have been updated/changed since the last time it read them.
# Devmon does SNMP queries on all of the devices in its database. SNMP queries are optimized so that if the same SNMP OID is specified in multiple tests for a device, it is only queried once.
# Devmon applies template logic against the returned SNMP data. This involves doing transforms, applying thresholds, and then finally rendering the message to be sent to the display server.
# Devmon sends the rendered messages to the Display server.
# Devmon sleeps for any remaining time in the poll cycle.
# Usually, return to step 1. If the interval at which your external process updates your devmon database is not be the same as your poll interval, Devmon might actually go to step 2 instead.

=== Create a template for the device ===
We now have a basic understanding of Devmon. We can talk to our target device via snmp, we know the sysDescr, and we have the device entered into our bb-hosts file. Since the device (a Windows 2000 server) is not one of the supplied templates, the next step is to create a new template using a preexisting one as a guide.

# In the templates directory, make a new directory for the new device.
# Copy a specs file from another device directory to use as a guide.
# Edit the specs file:
#* Change the Vendor to a vendor name you want to use.
#* Change the model to a model number you want to use.
#* Change the snmpver to the snmpver of the device (you confirmed the version in an earlier step).
#* Most importantly, change the sysdesc to match the sysDescr you received from the device earlier.
&lt;pre&gt;
[root@hob win2000server]# more specs
vendor : Microsoft
model : Win2000
snmpver : 2
sysdesc : Hardware: x86 Family 15 Model 3 Stepping 4 AT/AT COMPATIBLE - Software : Windows 2000 Version 5.0
&lt;/pre&gt;
In this example, the full sysDescr was used, but you can use something shorter like &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Software : Windows 2000 Version 5.0&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; or even &quot;&lt;tt&gt;Windows 2000&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; as long as it's matched. It depends on how granular you want to be (e.g. treat x86 vs x64 devices differently).

Don't yet worry about a test directory like all the other devices have. We are just trying to make sure Devmon is going to work with hobbit.

=== Confirm template matched ===

Run devmon with the --readbbhosts -vvv flags. When we do this the devmon process will read the bb-hosts file looking for the DEVMON tag. When it finds one, it will query the device for sysDescr and try to find a matching device in the templates directory's specs files. If a match is found then the device is added to the Devmon hosts.db. If devmon doesn't find a match then the device will be ignored.
&lt;pre&gt;
[root@hob devmon]# ./devmon --readbbhosts -vvv
[07-01-31@04:42:07] SNMP querying all hosts in bb-hosts file, please wait...
[07-01-31@04:42:07] Querying pre-existing hosts
[07-01-31@04:42:08] Querying new hosts /w custom cids using snmp v2
[07-01-31@04:42:08] Discovered winserver as a Microsoft Win2000
&lt;/pre&gt;

If the discovery was unsuccessful (i.e. no Discovered line), you need to double check the sysDescr against the sysdesc in the specs file. Try copy/paste to avoid any transcription errors.

=== Decide on a test for the device ===

We now know devmon has successfully identified the target device and has entered it into the hosts.db.  Our next step is to add a test. You should pick a value from the MIB for the device that you want hobbit to check. On my test device I have loaded the free standard edition snmp package from http://www.snmp-informant.com/. This package allows me to check the free disk space on the machine using this oid (object identifier)  '''.1.3.6.1.4.1.9600.1.1.1.1.5.2.67.58'''. So my test will be a check of free disk space. Let's test with snmpget first to confirm that this is a good oid:
&lt;pre&gt;
[root@hob win2000server]# snmpget -v2c -c public winserver .1.3.6.1.4.1.9600.1.1.1.1.5.2.67.58
SNMPv2-SMI::enterprises.9600.1.1.1.1.5.2.67.58 = Gauge32: 71
&lt;/pre&gt;
As you can see a value was successfully retrieved, so this is going to be the basis of the test. Create its directory.
&lt;pre&gt;
[root@hob win2000server]# mkdir disk
[root@hob win2000server]# cd disk
[root@hob disk]#
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Create a test: files ===
Now is the time we concern ourselves with the other files we skipped in the new directory we created earlier. There are 5 files that are used, the only ones required are '''oids''', '''message''', '''thresholds'''. The others are useful and you will probably end up using them, but our goal is just to get going. 

* '''oids''' : This file contains the OIDs of the tests to be performed. Notice I just made up a name in the first field, this name will be used in the other files also, so you want to make it unique. The documentation that comes with Devmon is very good for these files, so I won't be going into great detail.
&lt;pre&gt;
root@hob disk]# more oids
win2000model :                 .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.1.0                  :leaf
win2000uptime :                .1.3.6.1.2.1.1.3.0                  :leaf
win2000freespace :           .1.3.6.1.4.1.9600.1.1.1.1.5.2.67.58   :leaf
root@hob disk]# 
&lt;/pre&gt;

* '''message''': This is used to construct the message that will go to the hobbit server. It uses the names you made up in the '''oids''' file.  The win2000uptime_m is a variable created in the '''transforms''' file.  Again the documentation is fine for this file.
&lt;pre&gt;

==== How to override a mismatch or no match ====
One can override the detected specs via the model tag in bb-hosts. For example, one could use &lt;code&gt;DEVMON:model(dell;poweredge)&lt;/code&gt; for a Dell PowerEdge server running Microsoft Windows (which only reports &quot;&lt;code&gt;Hardware: x86 Family 15 Model 4 Stepping 3 AT/AT COMPATIBLE - Software: Windows Version 5.2 (Build 3790 Multiprocessor Free)&lt;/code&gt;&quot; for Microsoft Windows Server 2003).

== Graphing ==
Some documentation for graphing is provided in the &lt;code&gt;docs/GRAPHING&lt;/code&gt; file. There are two common ways to get graphs from Devmon data. If you are collecting data from an SNMP branch, you would use the instructions for &quot;Graphing a Table&quot;. If you are collecting data from an SNMP leaf, you would use the instructions for &quot;Graphing one or several Values&quot;.

=== Graphing a Table ===
In the message file, one can add RRD definitions to a table definition. This is preferred if the oids are branches. The example given in the documentation is
&lt;pre&gt;
TABLE:rrd(DS:ds0:ifInOctets:COUNTER; DS:ds1:ifOutOctets:COUNTER)
&lt;/pre&gt;
This rrd tag does not belong on it's own line, rather the line defining the table to follow. This will add a comment to the generated HTML page with information that can be parsed by the devmon-rrd.pl script located in the extras directory under your devmon install. That will begin to generate the .rrd files for the the table.

To parse the .rrd files to make a graph, you must create a definition for the graph in the hobbitgraph.cfg file in your Xymon install directory.

Then add the &lt;code&gt;,''column''=devmon&lt;/code&gt; setting to the TEST2RRD variable in hobbitserver.cfg.

Note that old versions of Devmon could only use exactly two datasets with specific names of &lt;code&gt;ds0&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ds1&lt;/code&gt;.

Note that, if you add a table which will have multiple rows, you should add a &lt;code&gt;--multigraphs&lt;/code&gt; setting to &lt;code&gt;CGI_SVC_OPTS&lt;/code&gt;; see the [[../../FAQ|FAQ]] (Why does my custom graph only show in the trends column but not its own column ?) for more information. If you don't do this, the graphs will only appear in the trends column and not in the expected column.

=== Graphing one or several Values ===
One can format the message file as something hobbitd_rrd's &quot;ncv&quot; module will recognize. This is preferred if the oids are leaves. NCV stands for &quot;Name Colon Value&quot; and the &quot;ncv&quot; module will parse the generated HTML page for this data. In the message file within your devmon template, when you add a line to display the temperature of a UPS, you would add:
&lt;pre&gt;
Temperature: {tempVar}
&lt;/pre&gt;
This would show the value on the web page, but also give the &quot;ncv&quot; module something to parse. It would set a variable of &quot;Temperature&quot; equal to whatever value {tempVar} happens to be, and add it to the .rrd with a DS name of &quot;Temperature&quot;. After the .rrd files are being generated, you can add a definition to the hobbitgraph.cfg file that will read the .rrd and display the graph on the page.

To begin generating the .rrd files, one could specify an NCV setting in &lt;code&gt;hobbitserver.cfg&lt;/code&gt; like the following for an APC UPS:
&lt;pre&gt;NCV_env=&quot;Temperature:GAUGE&quot;&lt;/pre&gt;
If one anticipates adding or removing values then it's better to use SPLITNCV instead of NCV, again for an APC UPS:
&lt;pre&gt;SPLITNCV_power=&quot;RuntimeRemaining:GAUGE,BatteryCapacity:GAUGE,UPSLoad:GAUGE,Voltageactual:GAUGE,Voltagein:GAUGE,Voltageout:GAUGE,Timeonbattery:GAUGE&quot;&lt;/pre&gt;
In both cases, add a &lt;code&gt;,''column''=ncv&lt;/code&gt; setting to the TEST2RRD variable in hobbitserver.cfg. Use only &lt;code&gt;=ncv&lt;/code&gt; within the TEST2RRD variable, not &lt;code&gt;=splitncv&lt;/code&gt;. See the hobbitd_rrd documentation for more information.

=== Confirming data is available for a graph ===
The hobbitd_rrd daemons only read these values at initialization, so if Xymon is running, you'll need to kill the daemons or restart Xymon. Once either of these are in use, wait a few minutes for new data, then check the rrd directory for the usual data files.

=== Output a graph from the data ===
If one or more rrd files are available, add the appropriate code to hobbitgraph.cfg. Then add &lt;code&gt;,''column''&lt;/code&gt; setting to the GRAPHS variable, in hobbitserver.cfg.

If there are multiple graphs, add &lt;code&gt;,''column'':''column''|''column1''|''column2''&lt;/code&gt; or something similar to each host's TRENDS setting in bb-hosts. Note that you'll only get one graph in the normal column if it isn't a &quot;multigraph&quot; type, but many can appear in the trends column.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Information==

Anabolic reactions are those that require energy to occur.  Cells can couple anabolic reactions together with catabolic ones to form an efficient energy cycle; the catabolic reactions transform chemical fuels into cellular energy, which is then used to initiate the energy-requiring anabolic reactions. 

Anabolism can be thought of as a set of metabolic processes, in which the synthesis of complex molecules is initiated by energy released through [[Structural Biochemistry/Catabolism|catabolism]]. These complex molecules are produced through a systematic process from small and simple precursors. For example, an anabolic reaction can begin with relatively simple precursor molecules (created previously by catabolic reactions) and end with fairly complex products, such as [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/Sugars|sugar]], certain [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids|lipids]], or even [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/DNA|DNA]], which has an extremely complex physical structure. The increased complexity of the products of anabolic reactions also means that they are more energy-rich than their simple precursors. 

Anabolic reactions are divergent processes. That is, relatively few types of raw materials are used to synthesize a wide variety of end products. This results in an increase in cellular size or complexity—or both. Anabolic processes are responsible for cell differentiation and increases in body size. Bone mineralization and muscle mass are attributed to these processes. Anabolic processes produce peptides, [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|proteins]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Carbohydrates/Polysaccharides|polysaccharides]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids|lipids]], and [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid|nucleic acids]]. These molecules comprise all the materials of living cells, such as [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids/Biological Membranes|membranes]]and chromosomes, as well as the specialized products of specific types of cells, such as [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzymes]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Protein function/Antibodies|antibodies]], hormones, and neurotransmitters. 

ATP provides the energy needed for anabolism to take place. ATP is a high energy molecule that couples anabolism by the release of [[Structural Biochemistry/Free energy|free energy]]. This energy does not come through the breakage of phosphate bonds; instead it is released from the hydration of the phosphate group.The chemical reaction where ATP changes to ADP supplies energy for this metabolic process. Anabolism is the opposite of catabolism, for example, synthesizing glucose is an anabolic process whereas the breaking down of glucose is a catabolic process. The[[Structural Biochemistry/Free energy|Gibbs free energy]] for the synthesis of glucose is positive, meaning that the reaction is not spontaneous and will not go to completion in any time frame. However, when coupled with ATP, this reaction becomes more thermodynamically favorable, as is the case with many other endothermic reactions in the body. Anabolism and catabolism must be regulated in a way that does not allow the two processes to occur simultaneously. Each process has its own set of hormones that switch these processes on and off. Anabolic hormones include growth hormone, testosterone, and estrogen. Catabolic hormones include adrenaline, cortisol, and glucagon. 

There is a need for cells to separate the metabolism process into anabolic and catabolic pathways. Anabolism requires the input of energy, which can be described as an &quot;uphill&quot; (energy intake) process. Catabolism is a &quot;downhill&quot; process which energy is released as the organism had used up energy. At certain points in the anabolic pathway, the cell must put more energy into a reaction than is released during catabolism. Such anabolic steps require a different series of reactions than are used at this point during catabolism.

==Stages of anabolism==
*There are three basic stages of anabolism. 
'''Stage 1''' production of precursors such as amino acids, monosaccharides and nucleotides.

'''Stage 2''' use energy from ATP to turn the precursors into reactive form.

'''Stage 3''' the assembly of these activated precursors into complex molecules such as proteins, polysaccharides, lipids and nucleic acids.

==Examples of Biochemical Anabolic Reactions==

1) '''Polysaccharides''': Polysaccharides serve as an example of anabolism because polysacchrides are derived from their subunits of simple monosaccharides. A simple exmaple is the formation of glycogen. Glygocen is a polysaccharide that is composed of subunit glucose monosacchrides connected by glycosidic bonds. 

2) '''Polypeptides''': Polypeptides serve as an example of anabolism because polypeptides are derived from their subunits of simple peptides. Polypeptides such as hemoglobin are composed of four different protiens (essentially peptides) that come together and form a completely different protien. Peptides them selves are a result of anabolic reactions themselves due to the condensation reactions that simple amino acids go through to combine and thus form peptide chains. 

3) '''Carbon Fixation''': Carbon fixation is another example of anabolism because in photosynthetic organisms such as plants, cyanobacteria, algae and other photoautotrophic ogranisms fixate carbon dioxide into glycerate 3-phosphate which is then further converted into glucose. Beginning with photosynthesis, synthesis of carbohydrates from sunlight and carbon dioxide. This process uses ATP and NADPH produced by the photosynthetic reactions to convert CO2 into glycerate 3-phosphate. This shows anabolism because from a smaller simpler subunit of carbon dioxide, glycerate 3-phosphate is produced, a much larger and complex biochemical compound.

==Examples of Anabolic hormones==

&lt;big&gt;Growth hormone:&lt;/big&gt;

Growth hormone is a protein-based peptide hormone that stimulates growth, cell reproduction, and regeneration in humans and other animals. Growth hormone is often used to treat children with growth disorders as well as adult growth hormone deficiency.

&lt;big&gt;Insulin:&lt;/big&gt;

Insulin is a hormone that is essential for regulating fat and steroids metabolism in the body. It causes the uptake of glucose from the blood by cells in the liver, muscle, and fat tissue. Glucose is then stored as glycogen in the liver and muscle. Insulin also contributes to other body functions such as vascular compliance and cognition.

&lt;big&gt;Testosterone:&lt;/big&gt;

Testosterone is a steroid hormone found in mammals, reptiles, birds, and other vertebrates. In mammals, testosterone is mainly secreted in the testes of males and the ovaries of females. However, small amounts of testosterone are also secreted by the adrenal glands. Testosterone is the principal male sex hormone.

&lt;big&gt;Estradiol:&lt;/big&gt;

Estradiol is the predominant sex hormone present in females. However, it is also found in males and acts as an active metabolic product of testosterone. Estradiol has major impacts on the reproductive and sexual functions as well as other organs. [http://science.jrank.org/pages/319/Anabolism.html#ixzz0UM1KSRXO] [Berg]

{{BookCat}}
 
Side effects may occur when anabolic hormones (or steroids) are used in excessive amount. If used too much by men, it can cause a decline in testosterone secretion, testicular atrophy (wasting away of the testes), and even breast enlargement. For women, excess use of anabolic hormones may cause a decrease in estrogen secretion and the ability to ovulate, the growth of facial hair, as well as regression of the breasts.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==

Catabolism is the release of energy from a set of metabolic pathways which break down molecules into smaller units, including the breaking down and oxidizing of food molecules.  An example would be [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|proteins]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid|nucleic acids]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids|lipids]] and [[Structural Biochemistry/Carbohydrates/Polysaccharides|polysaccharides]] being broken down into smaller molecules like [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acids]], nucleotides, [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids/Fatty Acids|fatty acids]], and [[Structural Biochemistry/Carbohydrates/Monosaccharides|mono saccharides]]. By glycolysis, the glucose is break down into two pyruvates which can be used for later mechanism (Kerb's cycle) to produce energy. The oxidation of long-chain fatty acid to acetyl-CoA is a central energy-yielding pathway in many organisms. Its opposite process is [[Structural Biochemistry/Anabolism|anabolism]], which combines small molecules into larger molecules. Energy that is released from catabolism will store as ATP within the cell. The cell will then use this source of energy for synthesizing cell components from simple precursors, for the mechanical work of contraction and motion, and for transport of substances across its membrane. Catabolism maintains the chemical energy needed in order to help the cell grow and develop. Some waste products caused by catabolism are carbon dioxide, urea, and lactic acid.  Heat is also sometimes released as a by product because these are oxidation processes. Examples of catabolism are the citric acid cycle.

The energy cells contain is liberated through two distinct processes: glycolysis and cellular respiration



'''GLYCOLYSIS''' 
Glycolysis is a series of reactions that break down glucose into two smaller organic molecules. 

'''Glycolytic pathway''' 
Glycolysis occurs in the cytoplasm, in the presence or absence of oxygen. The pathway has several steps to convert six-carbon glucose into two molecules of three-carbon pyruvates. The direct generation of ATP from ADP and Pi is known as substrate-level phosphorylation. NAD+ is reduced to NADH twice, so we start with two molecules of NAD+ and finish with two molecule of NADH. 

The net reaction for glycolysis is: 
Glucose + 2 ADP + 2P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 NAD&lt;big&gt;+&lt;/big&gt; → 2 Pyruvate + 2 ATP + 2 NADH + 2H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Most of the chemical energy exrtracted from the sum is still stored in pyruvate’s bonds. Pyruvate has two potential fates based on the character of the cell’s environment. In aerobic organisms, pyruvate undergoes further oxidation through the mitochondrial electron transport chain. In anaerobic organisms, pyruvate undergoes an oxygen-free process called fermentation. Some cells are obligate aerobes or anaerobes, meaning that they require that designated environment. Others are facultative; they refer one environment over the other but can survive in either.

'''Fermentation'''
In the glycolysis reaction equation, NAD+ is a necessary reagent and must be present for glycolysis to occur. At the end of glycolysis, the coenzyme is present only in its reduced form, NADH. One way to regenerate NAD+ is through oxidation in the electron transport chain, but anaerobic organisms would not participate in that. So another method is used: fermentation. Fermentation reduces pyruvate to either ethanol or lactic acid. 

'''Alcohol Fermentation'''
This process occurs in yeast and some bacteria. Pyruvate is first decarboxylated to acetaldehyde, which is then reduced by NADH to ethanol, thereby regenerating the NAD+
	Pyruvate (3C) → CO2 + Acetaldehyde (2C)
	Acetaldehyde + NADH + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → Ethanol (2C) + NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

'''Lactic acid Fermentation''' 
This process occurs in some fungi and bacteria, as well as in mammalian muscles when oxygen demand exceeds supply. Basically, many glucose molecules are put through glycolysis, yielding twice as many molecules of cellular respiration, so it builds up. Concurrently, NADH builds up, depleting cells’ supply of NAD+. To keep muscles working, pyruvate is reduced to lactic acid, and NADH is oxidized back to NAD+. Lactic acid decreases the local pH, which we fell as the burn and fatigue effects of strenuous exercise. Once oxygen supply catches up to demand, the lactic acid may be converted back to pyruvate in the process known as the Cori cycle. The amount of oxygen necessary to do this is known as the oxygen debt.
		Pyruvate (3C) + NADH + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → Lactic Acid + NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;




'''CELLULAR RESPIRATION''' 
It is the most efficient means of glucose catabolism, generating approximately 36 to 38 ATP per molecule of glucose. Respiration is aptly named; it is an aerobic process using an electron transport chain, with oxygen being the final electron acceptor.
There are three key phases: pyruvate decarboxylation, the citric acid cycle, and the electron transport chain.  A productive way to keep track of these reactions will be the follow the carbon. 

'''Pyruvate decarboxylation'''
The first step in aerobic respiration is pyruvate decarboxylation. This step itself does not require oxygen, but it only occurs once the cell commits to aerobic respiration—and the commitment is made only in the presence of oxygen. Pyruvate is transported from the cytoplasm into the mitochondrial matrix, where it is decarboxylated. The remaining acetyl (2C) group is bound to a coenzyme A molecule to form acetyl-CoA. Once NAD+ is reduced to NADH per pyruvate; in other words, two NAD+ molecules are reduced per molecule of glucose. Acetyl-CoA is a key intermediate in the utilization of fat, protein, and other carbohydrate energy reserves. 

2 Pryuvate (3C) + 2 CoA + 2 NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → 2 NADH + 2 Acetyl-CoA (2C) + 2 CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (1C)

'''Citric Acid Cycle'''
The citric acid cycle starts with the combination of acetyl-CoA (2C) and oxaloactate (4C) to generate citrate (6C). Through a series of eight reactions, two CO2 molecules are released, and oxaloacetate is regenerated. 
The citric acid cycle does not directly generate much energy. Each turn of the cycle generates one ATP via substrate-level phosphorylation and a GTP intermediate, for a total of two pyruvates per glucose molecule. The value of the citric acid cycle is its ability to generate high-energy electrons that are carried by NADH and FADH2. For each molecule of acetyl-CoA that enters the cycle, three NADH and one FADH2 are produced by two to account for the fact that the cycle turns twice per molecule of glucose.
These enzymes then transport the electrons to the '''electron transport chain''' on the inner mitochondrial membrane, where more ATP is produced via oxidative phosphorylation. At the end of the citric acid cycle, oxaloacetate is regenerated in anticipation of the next round. 

The overall reaction is:
	2 Acetyl-CoA + 6 NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 FAD + 2 GDP + 2 P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; + 4 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 4 CO2 + 6 NADH + 2 FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2 ATP + 4 H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + 2 CoA

[[File:Metabolism.jpg|500px|thumb|Metabolism]]

Metabolism regulates life through a set of chemical reactions. Chemical reactions are often coordinated with each other and occur in sequence called metabolic pathways, each step of which is catalyzed by a specific enzyme. These pathways are categorized according to whether the reactions lead to the breakdown or synthesis of substances. Catabolic reactions result in the breakdown of molecules into smaller molecules. Such reactions are often exergonic. By comparison, anabolic reactions promote the synthesis of larger molecules from smaller molecules. This process usually is [[Structural Biochemistry/Endergonic reaction|endergonic]] and, in living cells, must be coupled to an [[Structural Biochemistry/Exergonic reaction|exergonic reaction]]. These processes are responsible for the growth and reproduction of organisms, maintaining their structures, and responding to changes in the environment. The involvement of enzymes is essential for metabolism because they couple the organisms, which are thermodynamically unfavorable, to other organisms which are thermodynamically favorable and drive the metabolism towards desirable reactions. Not only do enzymes drive organisms toward desirable reactions, but they also regulate metabolic pathways to respond to changes within the cell's environment as well as signals from other cells. The metabolism of an organism also establishes which substances which enter the organism are nutritious and beneficial and which are harmful. Additionally, the speed of metabolism, or the metabolic rate, of an organism affects how much food the organism consumes.
Prokaryote's metabolism is diverse. In other words, prokaryotes run all the major nutrient cycles. They play a major role in the Sulfur cycle and biological process that affects oxidation states of minerals in the earths crust. Also, the cyanobacteria both invented photosynthesis and still dominate the carbon fixation on this planet.
We can also harness energy from redox couples by releasing all at once or releasing gradually (chemical bonds).&lt;ref&gt;Biochemistry 6th edition. Berg, Jeremy M; Tymoczko, John L; Stryer, Lubert. W.H. Freeman Company, New York&lt;/ref&gt;

In Metabolism, there are something that we need for life. For example, we need a) the energy/reducing equivalents (ATP, NADH, NADPH). Also, we need b) Carbon Skeletons (glucose, glycine, etc...). We also need c) Other minor stuff (NPK, metals, etc...). 

About the various Trophs:
1) Chemotroph: is the energy from redox
2) Phototroph: is the energy from light
3) Heterotroph: is the carbon from organic molecule
4) Autotroph: is the carbon fixed from CO2

In metabolism, glycolysis and the TCA cycle can be used just to produce molecules for growth. 
About Anaerobic Respiration: It is the the use of a terminal electron acceptor other than O2. Moreover, the process produce generally less energy than using O2. Also, it can be considered the Redox Tower. 

Assimilative Vs. Dissimilative Metabolism:
1) Assimilative Reduction: Compound gets reduced and incorporated into the organism. For example: NO3- becomes amino group -NH2.
2) Dissimilative Reduction: Compound gets reduced as an electron acceptor and is discarded. For example: NO3- becomes amino group -NH2.

Nitrate Reduction and Denitrification: 
a) Nitrite is one of the most common alternative electron acceptors.
b) Denitrification removes nitrogen from systems as gas. Agriculture is bad and sewage is good.

- Nitrate Reduction: Nitrate Reductase is the critical protein for NO3- reduction. Nitrate reductase production is repressed by O2 and activated by NO3-. There are fewer protons are pumped.
- Denitrification: Utilizes 4 reductive enzymes. It can start with nitrite from nitrate reduction. Also, the process can produce more energy than nitrate reduction. 
- Reduction of Various Metals:
a) Geobacter metallireducens is a gram-proteobacterium. It can reduce a number of metals by oxidation of organic compounds. For examples, for iron: Fe3+ to Fe2+; for manganese: Mn4+ to Mn2+; for uranium: U6+ to U4+. Fe3+ compounds are much less soluble than Fe2+ iron compounds. U4+ compounds are much less soluble than U6+ compounds. 

Chemoautotrophs:
- Generate energy (ATP) from oxidation of inorganic compounds.
- Carbon fixation of CO2 is by Calvin Cycle (same as plants/cyanobacteria).
- Using the Electron Tower, we can predict metabolisms.

Hydrogen Oxidation:
- Many bacteria produce H2 as a metabolic byproduct.
- The critical enzymes are hydrogenases. 

The Phototrophs:
a) Photoautotrophs: Use light for energy and CO2 as carbon source. 1) Oxygenic: Oxidize H20 for electrons generating O2. 2) Anoxygenic: Oxidize other compounds for electrons (ie: H2S).
b) Photoheterotrophs: Use light for energy and organic carbon as carbon source. 

Photosynthetic Pigments:
- All phototrophs contain chlorophyll or bacteriochlorophyll.
- Each chlorophyll variant has different absorption spectra.
- Different pigments allow bacteria to co-exist in one environment.
- All chlorophylls have a porphyrin ring with different substitutions.

Accessory Pigments:
a) Function: expand light spectrum and photoprotection.
b) Main Pigments: Carotenoids and Phycobilins.

Photosynthetic Structures:
- The purpose: a) increase surface area for light absorption. b) cluster proteins/pigments for electron transfer.
- Bacteria do not have chloroplasts...they are the chloroplast.
- Membrane Folds: Highly folded membrane invaginations.
- Chlorosomes: Found in green sulfur and non-sulfur bacteria.
- Phycobilisomes: Specific to cyanobacteria.

Hydrothermal Vents:
- Chemoautotrophs are the producers of these communities.
- Do not require light for survival.
- Can require no input from outside organisms.

Acid Mine Drainage (Fe2+ Oxidation):
- Fe2+ is stable in acidic water (won't spontaneously oxidize).
- Fe2+ gives e- for pumping out cytoplasmic H+.
- e- is also used in reverse electron flow to produce NADH.

- Green non-sulfur bacteria
- Heliobacteria
- Acidobacteria
b) Only a single light reaction occurs.
c) Electrons are derived from non H2O.

Oxygenic Photosynthesis:
a) Represented Phyla:
- Cyanobacteria
- Plants
b) Electrons flow through two light reactions.
c) Electrons are derived from H20. 

Cyanobacteria:
a) Require oxygen for growth

*'''ATP'''
[[File:Structure of ATP.jpg|250px|thumb|Structure of ATP]]
During catabolism, useful energy is temporarily conserved as ATP - adenosine triphosphate. ATP is  the universal standard of energy exchange in biological systems as the energy is always transformed and conserved as ATP .















*'''NAD'''
[[File:Structure of NAD.jpg|250px|thumb|Structure of NAD]]
NAD (Nicotinamide Adenine Dinucleotide)also involves in metabolic pathways. The chemical nature of metabolic pathways usually involves oxidation/reduction reactions. In order for a biochemical to be oxidized, its electrons must be removed by an oxidizing agent. The oxidizing agent is an electron acceptor that gets reduced in the reaction. The molecule that usually functions as the electron carrier in the biochemical oxidation-reduction reactions is NAD and its phosphorylated derivative, NADP.  NAD or NADP can become alternately oxidized or reduced by the loss or gain of two electrons. The oxidized form of NAD is symbolized NAD; the reduced form is symbolized as NADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

== Metabolic pathways are regulated in three general ways: ==
 
'''1.Gene Regulation'''''
Because enzymes in every metabolic pathway are encoded by genes, cells can control chemical reactions via gene regulations. For example, if a bacterial cell is not exposed to a particular sugar in its environment, it will turn off the genes that encode the enzymes that are needed to break down the sugar. Alternatively, if the sugar becomes available, the genes are switched on. 

'''2.Cellular Regulation'''''' 
Metabolism is also coordinated at the cellular level. Cells integrate signals from their environment and adjust their chemical reactions to adapt to those signals. Cell-signaling pathways often lead to the activation of protein kinases that covalently attach phosphate groups to target proteins. For example, when people are frightened, they secrete a hormone called epinephrine into their bloodstream. This hormone binds to the surface of muscle cells and stimulates an intracellular pathway that leads to the phosphorylation of intracellular proteins, including the enzymes involved in carbohydrate metabolism. These activated enzymes promote the supply of energy to the frightened individual. Epinephrine is sometimes called the “fight or flight” hormone because the added energy prepares an individual to either stay and fight or run away. After a person is no longer frightened, hormone levels drop and other enzymes called phosphates remove the phosphate groups from enzymes, thereby restoring the original level of carbohydrate metabolism. 

'''3.Biochemical regulation''' 
Metabolic reactions can also be controlled by reactions at the biochemical level. In this case, the binding of a molecule to an enzyme directly regulates its function. Biochemical regulation is typically categorized according to the site where the regulatory molecule binds.

=== Example(s) of Metabolic Pathways ===
''Gluconeogenesis''

This metabolic pathway involves the generation of glucose from non-carbohydrate carbon substrates (i.e. lactate, glycerol, and gucogenic amino acids). This is one of two main mechanisms (the other being glycolysis) that the human body uses to keep blood glucose levels from dropping to a dangerously low level, a condition called hypoglycemia.  This mechanism isn’t exclusive to humans, and is also present in plants, animals, fungi and other microorganisms, with some variation in the locations in which glucogenesis takes place. This mechanism kicks in during periods of fasting, starvation, or intense exercise and is endergonic. It is also associated with ketosis and has been a target of therapy for Type II Diabetes to inhibit glucose formation and stimulate glucose uptake by cells.

The pathway itself consists of eleven enzyme-catalyzed reactions, which can begin in the mitochondria or cytoplasm (depends on the substrate being used).  Many of these steps are the reversible reactions of those found in glycolysis. 

•It begins in the mitochondria with the formation of oxaloacetate through carboxylation of pyruvate. This part requires ATP and catalytic help by pyruvate carboxylase, which is stimulated by high levels of acetyl-CoA and inhibited by high levels of ADP.

[[Image:Pyruvate to oxa.gif|thumb|center|400px]]

•Oxaloacetate is then reduced to malate using NADH, which will prepare it for mitochondrial exit. Afterwards, it is oxidiced in the cytoplasm again to oxaloacetate using NAD+, in which the remaining steps of glucogenesis will take place.

•The next step is the decarboxylation and phosphorylation of oxaloacetate to produce phosphoenolpyruvate, which is catalyzed by phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEP carboxykinase).  This step also hydrolyses one molecule of GTP to GDP. 

[[Image:PEP carboxykinase.gif|thumb|center|400px]]

•The next steps of the reaction are essentially the same as those involved in reversed glycolysis, with the only difference being that fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase converts fructose-1,60bisphosphate to fructose-6-phosphate. Note that this conversion is the rate limiting step of the whole process of glucogenesis. 

[[Image:Reversed glycolysis.gif|thumb|center|400px]]

•Next, glucose-6-phosphate is formed from fructose 6-phosphate with the help of phophoglucoisomerase. This product can be used in other metabolic pathways or can be further dephosphorylated to make free glucose. Cell control of intracellular glucose levels is attained by the fact that free glucose can diffuse in and out of the cell, whereas the phosphorylated form is locked in the cell. Glucose formation happens in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum. Here, glucose-6-phosphate is hydrolyzed by glucose-6-phosphatase to produce glucose, which is then shuttled into the cytosol by glucose transporters located in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum.  

[[Image:Glucose conversion1.gif|thumb|center|400px]]

===Relation to Obesity===
As the availability of energy-rich food increased, people started to gain more weight by converting excessive energy into body fat. While this kind of environmental factors play a significant role in increasing rate of obesity, lipid based metabolism in the body is also partly in charge of phenomenon.

Diabetes is one of the common metabolic diseases in relation to obesity. There are two types of diabetes:

&lt;u&gt;Type 1 diabetes&lt;/u&gt;: Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease which usually starts before 20 years of age. It is caused by destroying insulin-secreting beta cells in the pancreas. Thus, the person with Type 1 needs insulin to stay alive.

&lt;u&gt;Type 2 diabetes&lt;/u&gt;: Most people have type 2 diabetes, in which they have a higher level of insulin in their blood (unlike Type 1 diabetics); however, they are unresponsive to a hormone, insulin resistance. Type 2 diabetes is the most common metabolic disease currently. Also, obesity is one of the main factor for developing type 2 diabetes.

==Metabolic syndrome==

Obesity is one of the main factors to the development of insulin resistance, which leads to type 2 diabetes. The clustering of insulin resistance, hyperglycemia, dyslipidemia is called metabolic syndrome and is presumed to be a precursor of type 2 diabetes. 

One of the reasons for obesity is the amount of triacylglycerides one consumes will exceed the adipose tissue's capacity. Thus, other tissues will begin to store the excess fat (usually the liver and muscle)/ 

==The extra fatty acids in the muscles alter metabolism==
The mitochondria is not able to process all of the fatty acids by Beta oxidation. Thus, the extra fatty acids accumulate into the mitochondria and eventually go into the cytoplasm. The inability of the mitochondria to process these fatty acids leads to the fatty acids forming into triacylglyverols and then amount of fat increases in the cytoplasm.

[[File:Diabetes and cancer influence O-GlcNAc through the HBP.jpg|thumb|The HBP binds various metabolic inputs to optimally deliver the synthesis of UDPCLcNAc, which is the donor substrate for OGT. Glucose is funneled into the HBP where it will get phosphorylated by the hexokinase to produce glucose 6-phosphate (Glc-6-P) which is then transformed to fructose 6-phosphate (Fruc-6-P) through the presence of phosphoglucose isomerase. During the rate-limiting procedure of the pathway, glutamine:fructose-6-phosphate (GFAT) converts Fruc-6-P into glucosamine 6-phosphate (GlcN-6-O). Enzymatic steps will guide the production of UDP-GLcNAc, which is termed as a negative feedback inhibitor of GFAT. Flux through the HBP and the generation of UDP-GlcNAc and O-GlcNAcylation are greatly affected by the disease states, which include diabetes (indicated by the purple arrows) and cancer (indicated by the teal arrows) through metabolism (glucose= green, amino acid =red, fatty acid = orange, and nucleotide = blue). Resistance of insulin leads to an increase in glucose levels that marks a specific diabetic condition. As a consequence, the increase in glucose will cause HBP to increase HBP flux through the rise of O-GlcNAcylation. Cancer cells require energy, and metabolites are often in excess which can be funneled into the HBP stimulating flux also, precisely glucose, glutamine, and UTP.]]

O-linked β-N-acetylgluosamine (O-GlcNAc) is a metabolic signaling sugar molecule. More specifically, O-GlcNAc is a post-translational protein modification that is made up of a single N-acetylglucosamine piece, which is attached to an O-β-glycosidic linkage to serine and threonine hydroxyl moieties on nuclear and cytoplasmic proteins. Proteins that contain O-GlcNAc take part in cellular processes such as transcription, translation, signal transduction, and cytoskeletal assembly, along with other functions. Studies have shown that diseases like diabetes and cancer are strongly affiliated with the major alterations in metabolism, which affect the alterations of O-GlcNAcyclation. Such alterations to O-GlcNAcylation interfere with cellular signaling forces and worsen the disease state.

O-GlcNAc signaling is closely associated with cellular metabolism, and ties very closely to phosphorylation due to post-translational modifications that process swiftly in response to internal and external signs. Furthermore, the similarity between O-GlcNAc and phosphorylation is founded in the sugar’s capability to be dynamically connected or detached based on the changed in the cellular environment activated by stress, hormone, or nutrients. Since O-GlcNAc is linked to the serine and threonine residues, the sugar is strictly competing with phosphorylation. Steric hindrance can be encountered when o-GlcNAcylated and phosphorylated residues are in close proximity to each other. O-GlcNAcylation is catalyzed by an enzyme known as uridine diphospho-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc): polypeptide β-N-acetylglusaminyltransferase (OGT). In most cells, the enzyme OGT dynamically creates many specific holoenzyme proteins complexes that monitor specific activity approaching the myriad of target protein substrates. On the contrary, phosphorylation includes many individual unique kinases. Just like how there are protein phosphatases that detach phosphorylation, there exist a single cytosolic or nuclear β-N-acetylglucosaminidase (OGA) that aim substrates by shaping transient holoenzyme complexes to remove the sugar component.

An important glucosamine, Hexosamine biosynthetic pathway (HBP), which is a prominent precursor in the synthesis of glycosylated proteins, accommodates a collection of metabolic components that are relative to the formation of Uridine diphosphate N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-GlcNAc). To do this, the HBP integrates various metabolic inputs that will essentially deliver the synthesis of UDP-GlcNAc, which is implicitly the donor substrate for OGT.  Seemingly, a rise in cellular glucose and flux to a particular level of concentration via HBP will increase UDP-GlcNAc levels to a certain degree. Slight increases in UDP-GlcNAc concentration will suffice O-GlcNAc to function as a nutrient sensor. This is due to the unique responsive property of O-GlcNAc transferase to UDP-GlcNAc concentrations.
Rising levels of flux via the HBP causes a resistance for insulin. Flux through the HBP, which leads to the production of UDP-GLcNAc and O-GlcNAcylation are influenced by diseases like diabetes and cancer through metabolic effects. Studies have proven that O-GlcNAcylation play a strict role in insulin signaling. When there is O-GlcNAc and OGT that disrupt insulin signaling, the antipodal of decreased O-GlcNAcylation and O-GlcNAcase stimulate proper insulin signaling. Under specific diabetic conditions, such low levels of O-GlcNAcylation are advantageous in the sense it relieves hepatic insulin resistance and saves the diabetic cardiomyocytes functionality. 

Much clarity is needed to gain a better understanding of O-GlcNAc signaling. For instance, uncertainty in the approach of how OGT and OGA target their substrates remains a struggle in fully grasping the mechanistic abilities of this specific metabolic signaling molecule. Development in such research can unravel metabolic diseases like diabetes and cancer.

==Biochemicals==
Amino acids, carbohydrates, and lipids are essential for life; therefore, metabolism focuses on the production of these molecules during the creation of cells and tissues, and the digestion and use of them when they are broken down and used as a provider of energy.

===Amino Acids/Proteins===
When amino acids arrange themselves as a linear chain joined together by peptide bonds, proteins are formed. Many proteins are enzymes that catalyze the chemical reactions involved metabolism.

The name protein came from the Greek word proteios, meaning &quot;first place.&quot;  In bacterial cells, almost 50% of the dry mass is made up of proteins. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.proteincrystallography.org/protein/&lt;/ref&gt; Almost all organisms contain proteins. All functions of living organisms are related to proteins and each of their specific functions. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.proteincrystallography.org/protein/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Carbohydrates===
Carbohydrates are the most abounding biological molecules found in organisms and are responsible for the storage and transport of energy, such as starch and glycogen, and structural components, like cellulose in plants or chitin in animals.

Carbohydrates are classes of macromolecules - large polymers built from monomers.  Carbohydrates include both sugars and polymers of sugars.  The simplest carbohydrates are monosaccharides, also known as simple sugars. Another group of carbohydrates are the disaccharides, which are created by joining together two monosaccharides by a covalent bond.  Polysaccharides consist of many monosaccharides used as building blocks.&lt;ref&gt;Microbiology. Spencer (Teacher Assistant). Microbiology 120 Lecture. 11/6/12.&lt;/ref&gt;

      a. simple sugar with general formulas, (CH2O)n
      b. the most common monosaccharide is glucose
      c. the molecule contains a carbonyl group and many hydroxyl groups attached to the carbon atom
      d. a monosaccharide can either be an aldose (sugar with an aldehyde) or a ketose (sugar with a ketone) depending on the location of the carbonyl group
      e. monosaccharide can be categorized by the number of carbon on the chain starting with carbon 3
  2. Disaccharide
      a. two monosaccharides join together through a glycosidic linkage - a covalent bond that can be formed by a dehydration reaction

  3. Polysaccharides
      a. polysaccharides are polymers of multiple monosaccharides joined by glycosidic linkages
      b. some polysaccharides are storage materials and some are structural

===Lipids===
Lipids are the most diverse group of biochemicals. Structurally, the lipids' primary function is to be part of biological membranes, such as the cell membrane, or as a source of energy in organisms. Another major class of lipids that is produced in cells are steroids, such as cholesterol.

Lipids are grouped together by their hydrophobic behavior - meaning they mix poorly with water.  Lipid consist mostly hydrocarbons. 

Different kinds of lipid include the following:
  1. Fats
      a. fats consist of a glycerol and three fatty acids, which are constructed from hydrocarbons and the carbon at one end containing a carboxyl group.
      b. the fatty acids are joined to the glycerol by an ester linkage.
      c. saturated fats are fats that do not contain any double bond on the hydrocarbon chain
      d. unsaturated fats are fats that contain double bonds on different positions of the hydrocarbon chain
           1) most double bonds in the hydrocarbon chain are cis- double bonds
           2) trans fats contain trans-double bonds

== [[Musical keyboard]] ==

Hullo!!! Welcome to Wikibooks :-) I just observed [[Musical keyboard|this page on Musical keyboard]] which you created. I just wish to clarify whether you intend to create a book on the topic. And if it is yes, then what sort of book are you planning to create. Please do keep in mind that content which isn't of much use would be removed. Indeed, such a removal is mandated by policies and guidelines. Do have a look at [[WB:WIW]] to check whether the book you are  planning to create abides by the policies. :-) If you are in need of help, please do not hesitate to contact me. Thanks :-) -&lt;font color=&quot;maroon&quot; size=&quot;4&quot; face=&quot;Monotype Corsiva&quot;&gt;[[User:Ravichandar84|Ravichandar]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;aqua&quot; face=&quot;Monotype Corsiva&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Ravichandar84|My coffee shop]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; 12:47, 18 October 2008 (UTC)</text>

Who in the world am I, you ask? I'm Greyman and if I look familiar, you have probably come across me in your travels on [[CentralWikia:Wikia|Wikia]].

Throughout my wiki-career I've held various global-sysop positions within Wikia, ranging from a Helper in the Entertainment division of Wikia, to most recently a Wikia Janitor. In September of 2008 I decided it would be best if I resigned my global-sysop user rights within Wikia.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Spark plugs are a simple modification to a vehicle.  If your plugs are dirty or old, it can make a big difference in how the engine runs.  Also, quality plugs can improve cold starting behaviour, and improve fuel economy.  Some may claim a power advantage from the spark plugs, but any improvements there are likely to be negligable.  For boosted applications, spark plug choice can be very important.  Under boost, the spark plugs should be slightly &quot;colder&quot; than stock, meaning the plug itself doesn't retain as much heat.  This can aid in preventing detonation (aka motor death).

There are also after market ignition systems.  MSD makes a product called the Boost Timing Master which just retards the timing under boost conditions.  They also offer ignition coil upgrades (Blaster, Blaster 2), though many have complained about the MSD coils not giving good results on 240SX applications.  There are also complete stand-alone units, such as those made by Megasquirt.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I would say that the following statement isn't accurate when applying it to Inventor:

   ''Sketches of the object represent the orthographic view of the object on that plane.''

Since sketches do not require all detail all the standard orthographic detail to be present, it is not a true orthographic view of the part at any stage of the part design.  Some CAD systems tried to make 3D models using various orthographic views of a part, but Inventor is not one of them, as this method of 3D design was not very successful.

The following statement should be moved to a page where we actually start to tutor the reader as to how to create a sketch:

   ''keyboard shortcuts are the fastest way of rendering on the plane.''</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A Fuel Management Unit (FMU), also known as a rising rate fuel pressure regulator, is an alternative to an ECU upgrade.  This is *not* the same thing as an adjustable fuel pressure regulator (AFPR).  The AFPR will not change &quot;on the fly&quot;, it's &quot;set it and forget it&quot;.  The FMU is used in boosted applications.  The problem is simple:  the ECU from the factory will not send enough fuel for a proper air/fuel mixture under boosted applications.  The common solution is to upgrade the ECU to one that has been pre-programmed for your injectors, or one that allows you to adjust the programming for your injectors.  The FMU, though, can &quot;trick&quot; the system and correct the fuel delivery.  It has a vacuum line that measures boost, and as boost increases, it increases the fuel pressure, forcing the injectors to over-flow by a corresponding amount.

The FMU is not considered a reliable solution for high power applications, but for a low boost (under 7psi) situation, you can get by with this method.  It is generally cheaper to get an FMU than an ECU upgrade.

As always, be conscious of the somewhat agressive stock timing on the 240SX.  An FMU will not adjust timing, and under boost you can end up with the dreaded detonation.  The MSD Boost Timing Master is a popular solution to this problem.  However, it should be noted that the price of an FMU and an MSD BTM will be close to that of a CalumSult ECU setup, which pretty much resolves all ECU concerns.  The only catch is CalumSult does not work yet on OBD II cars (96-98 240sx).  This is a work in a progress and by the time you read this it may be resolved.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Brock, Thomas == 

=== “The Queen's Memorial” (Spy), September 25, 1905 ===


[[Image:Brock_T_Vanity_Fair_1905-09-25.jpg|thumb|right]]''Mr. Thomas Brock is a bluff, businesslike Englishman who learnt his art in the land that now honours him as a sculptor.  He is a man who loves his home, practises the simple life, works hard, dresses like a mere inartistic individual, and has a conscientious objection to posturing before the public.


	''He was born near Worcester in the year 1847.  His father had some skill in decoration.  He was educated at the Government School of Design in that City, and showing unusual ability was forwarded to London.  His success in the greater city was evidence by his winning the silver and gold medals at the Royal Academy schools.  Thereafter he became an assistant in Mr. J.H. Foley’s studio, and when that sculptor died young Brock completed the works that he had in hand, including the O’Connell monument which patriotic Dublin desired to erect.  He became an Associate in 1883 and an Academician in 1891.  Portrait statues of Sir Rowland Hill, Sir Richard Temple, Sir Erasmus Wilson, Lord Derby, and Lord Bowen, and the Westminster Memorial to Longfellow have been among his most noticeable achievements.


	''To crown his reputation came his selection as the sculptor of the Queen’s Memorial which will stand in front of Buckingham Palace.  He is now at work upon it, and will be thus engaged for several years to come.  At present, therefore, Mr. Brock is displaying agility upon ladders and platforms, varying his performance by studying the effect of his labours through the larger end of an opera glass.


[[Image:Buckingham_Palace_and_Victoria_Monument_-_September_2006.jpg|right|400px]]''He has no love for Society and is a most indifferent courtier.  He pulled a good oar in the  [[w:Auriol_Kensington_Rowing_Club|Kensington Rowing Club]], and when Captain in the Artists’ had some reputation as a shot.  He is a man of method and order, adding thereto an inartistic faculty for finance.  You can criticise his work without making him an enemy for life.  He admires Rodin, but despises the imitators of the great Frenchman.  For an opinionated man he is tactful.''


[[w:Thomas_Brock|Thomas Brock]] (1847-1922) did not row in the Boat Race or at Henley Regatta or get legally entangled with R.C. Belt, in each of those respects unlike fellow sculptor and rower of &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; C.B. Lawes.


=== The 1872 London v. Atalanta Boat Race ===


&lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; (June 15, 1872) carried this anonymous account of the “Anglo-American Boat-Race,” in which London R.C. beat Atalanta B.C. of New York from Mortlake to Putney -- the Boat Race course in reverse.  Both crews used sliding seats.


[[Image:Atalanta_launching_The_Graphic_1872.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Atlanta launching from Biffen Boatbuilders 'Anchor'  Boathouse (now Auriol Kensington R.C.)]]''That the interest taken in the International Boat-race was very great amongst a certain set of the population of London no one could doubt who chanced to be in the neighbourhood of the Thames last Monday.  Along every road leading to the scene of the coming struggle poured a motley crowd, with the usual accompaniments of nigger-singers, knock-’em-down men, fortune-tellers, &amp;c., without whom the British public never go to see a race, whether on land or water.  Arrived at Putney and on board one’s steamer, there was ample time to contemplate the black living mass that thronged both banks of the river.  Every window and every roof from which a view could be got was fully occupied, the very branches of the trees being made into temporary grand-stands by the more active of the eager multitude.  Time enough, too, to admire the gorgeous splendor of the steamer chartered by the Atalanta Boat Club, with its draper of crimson cloth and many flags, Guards’ band, and gaily-dressed ladies.''


	''As time wore on many anxious inquiries were made and many contending rumours afloat -- some fearing that as a slight breeze was blowing the Americans would claim the power reserved to them in the preliminary agreement of declining to row on the day fixed if the water should be rough.  However, all doubts as to whether the race would come off were set at rest a little before six, when both crews appeared, and were seen to go on board the umpire’s steamer with their oars.  Information soon spread that the Americans had asked that the race might be rowed with the wind, and not against it, as would be the case if the previously-arranged course -- Putney to Mortlake -- was adhered to.  This having been conceded, “Go a-head!” was the order, and the four privileged steamers started on their way to Mortlake.  As we steamed along the same sight met our eyes on both banks -- every available position being crammed with expectant thousands; Hammersmith Bridge one mass of eager faces gazing on the river -- all wondering what the change of programme was.  As we approached Mortlake we found the sides of the river swarming with steamers and boats of all sizes and shapes all having as they fondly hoped secured good places to see the finish.  Very aggrieved they doubtless thought themselves when they heard the course was reversed.  As it turned out, however, they saw the only interesting part of the race, which was virtually over in the first mile.  “Here are our fellows!” from a bystander drew my attention then to the London four paddling away from shore to the starting-boat -- wonderfully fit and workmanlike they looked, and all over like going.  Just then the flash of something scarlet on the umpire’s boat caused all heads to be turned in that direction.  Very strange, indeed, to English eyes did the Atalanta four’s dress appear -- the scarlet body and bare and, by comparison, white arms, and scarlet handkerchief bound round the temples, at first rather causing one to expect a voice at one’s elbow shouting, “Names and colours of the riders, gentlemen!”  They were soon, however, in their gig and proceeding towards their racing-boat, on reaching which they performed the rather hazardous acrobatic performance of getting into her from the gig as both boats floated down steam.  However, having accomplished this without accident they soon were also at the starting-post.  Now the anxious and long-expected moment had arrived, and the differences of opinion were to be decided.  Was the American or the English system of rowing right?  For so entirely different were the two styles that everyone felt it was more a trial of speed between styles of rowing than between two crews.  The report of a pistol, a suppressed shout “They’re off!” a dig in the back from an eager man behind me, the collision of my field-glass and the nape of the neck of someone in front -- such was my personal experience of the start.  The number of strokes per minute, the length, the catch, &amp;c., has it not all been written by many ere this?  Well, I dare say they are right.  Perhaps I, too, might have indulged you with some figures, but beyond the exact angle of the brim of a hat a little in advance of me I cannot give any information -- for that hat would get in my line of sight no matter what I did.''


	''Cheerful shouts soon were heard as London steadily drew ahead, increasing their lead every stroke, and rowing well within themselves, and all soon felt that barring accident the English crew must win.  Alas! however, the race was not destined to be rowed through without some contretemps.  Like the proverbial Derby dog, the river generally produces some creature to try and do harm.  So on Monday appeared a horrid man in a horrid boat, who cleverly managed to get in the way of the American crew, thereby losing them some distance.  That it in any way affected the result of the race no one could for a moment imagine.  Loud and long were the shouts of contempt and vehement the torrents of abuse that fell on his devoted head from the steamers as they passed this lumber in his boat, and very sincere were the expressions of regret on all sides that this mishap should have happened to the Atalanta crew.  Some hearty cheers for Gulston and his crew as they paddled back to their boat-house, and another cheer for their opponents as they came in, for the plucky way in which they persevered right through when it was evident that all chance of their winning the race was gone; and so ended the Anglo-American Boat-race.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Assessment Structure ==

=== Examination ===
Candidates answer three questions from four, each worth 24 marks.
The total time allowed is 1 hour 30 minutes.
The total number of marks for the paper is 72.

=== Coursework ===
==== Structure ====
The total marks available for coursework is 18.
One modelling assignment involving the use of differential equations at an appropriate level of sophistication.
There are no restrictions on the context chosen.

==== How Differential Equations are used to Solve Real-World Problems ====
'''Rationale'''
The aims of the coursework are that students should learn how differential equations are used to solve real-world problems and that they should appreciate how the theory they have learnt for the examination helps them to do this.
The objectives are that they should be able to undertake the various steps in the problem solving procedure shown in the flow chart in Section 5.2. The assessment criteria are closely related to these steps.

'''Description'''
There are two aspects to the work.
(i) The modelling cycle consists of pen and paper development of the consequences of the basic assumptions made, leading to a predicted outcome which must then be tested against reality.
(ii) In the experimental cycle, results are collected in order to give insight into the situation under investigation, so that a realistic model can be developed.

'''Level of Work'''
The task represents 20% of the assessment and the work involved should be consistent with that figure, both in quantity and level of sophistication. Tasks which allow only superficial or trivial treatment should be avoided.

'''Assessment'''
Each task must be assessed on one of the coursework assessment sheets, A or B. The assessor decides on the appropriate sheet according to the way the candidate has approached the particular task.
(A) In this case the modelling cycle is investigated in some depth, whilst the check against reality may use the data from published sources, from experiments which the candidate has not actually performed or from experience; there must however be a quantitative element in such data.
(B) The work presented is approximately evenly divided between developing the model, and one or more experiments conducted by the candidate to verify the quality of predictions from it and/or to inform its development.
No other mark sheet may be used, nor may these be amended in any way.
One mark is available for each criterion statement. Half marks may be awarded, but the overall total must be rounded (up or down) to an integer.
Note that in the case of Mark Scheme A, the marks for ‘Manipulating the Model’ may be awarded for the quality of the work either on the first or the second modelling cycles.

'''Task Selection'''
Centres are encouraged to develop their own coursework tasks. If they have any doubt about the suitability of a proposed task, they are recommended to submit details of it to the Principal Coursework Moderator, via OCR.
However, Centres which are new to the scheme are strongly recommended to use the tasks published by MEI while they are familiarising themselves with the nature of coursework. They should ensure that the material they have is that published for this specification and not that for an earlier specification.
Centres are advised that the choice of suitable tasks is crucial to the success of their candidates’ coursework.

A Mark Scheme is available at the OCR website (Specification B: MEI).

== Assumed Knowledge ==

Candidates are expected to know the content of C1, C2, C3 and C4.
In addition candidates are expected to know basic kinematics and Newton’s Second Law.
Relevant knowledge of complex numbers will also be required.
Unless otherwise specified the value of the acceleration due to gravity should be taken to be
exactly 9.8 ms-2.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I am originally from Vermont, a transfer student from Champlain College in Burlington Vermont.  My focus of study is Earth Science Education.  In the future I will teach ninth grade Earth Science.  Nature is my nurturer.  I enjoy everything that has to do with being in nature and respecting nature.  I hope to pass on to my students and others that I encounter in my life the importance of studying and learning about our natural world, because treating our earth with the same respect that we should all treat each other is just as important and imperative. “Reduce, Reuse, Recycle”!!! “Protect, Respect, Affect”!!!

Education should be beneficial and enjoyable for both teachers and students alike.  The learning environment should be supportive and encouraging, for both support and encouragement foster motivation and active learning.

Teachers and students should set long and short-term goals that will aid in developing and honing personal growth and knowledge.  Teachers should guide student’s individual long and short-term goals to achieve successful learning by encouraging and motivating students to take advantage of the many learning resources readily available to them.  

I believe that teachers should be not only educators but advisors and mentors as well.  Students should feel at ease in their relationships with their teachers.  Teachers need to be approachable and readily available so that students feel comfortable in all aspects of learning.

All students are unique and vary in their individual learning styles and developmental stages.  Teachers should be able to understand and recognize specific individual needs by developing individual relationships and providing individual attention.  Teachers should incorporate different instructional approaches that accommodate all learning styles and promote curiosity.  For example, I think that teachers should implement group interaction and independent thought to foster social and mental development both in and out of the classroom by using real world examples and problems.

Constant improvement and change to teaching styles and methods is important for the professional growth of the teacher and the personal growth of the student.

Both teachers and students alike are lifetime learners that should apply what they learn in the classroom and from each other in all aspects of life, both in and out of the classroom.  A teacher can learn just as much from their students as students can learn just as much from their teachers.

'''Rösti''' is a [[Cookbook:potato|potato]] dish from Switzerland. It was originally a common breakfast eaten by farmers in the canton of Bern, but today is eaten all over Switzerland.  Many Swiss people consider rösti a national dish.  Today it is more commonly served to accompany other dishes, rather than for breakfast. 

==Ingredients==
* One potato (either washed or peeled)
* One tablespoon of vegetable oil

==Procedure==
#Grate the potato into a dish, and squeeze out the excess moisture, pouring the liquid away.
#Split the mixture into two even piles.
#Pour the oil into a frying pan and heat moderately.
#Place the two piles separately onto the pan, pushing down on top of them with a spatula in order to ensure that the piles stay intact.
#Fry until the underside is golden brown, then carefully flip and cook the other side.
#Add salt and pepper to taste, and serve.

==Notes, tips, and variations==
*There are many variations of rösti.
*Various rösti use eggs, bacon, onion or cheese. These can be mixed in with the potato before you start to fry the rösti.
*Generally, any dry ingredients you use should be grated or diced before being added to the mix.
*The outside of the rosti should be crisp. To achieve this the potato should be as dry as possible before it is fried.

==General Information==

&lt;b&gt;Differential centrifugation&lt;/b&gt; is a method used to separate the different components of a cell on the basis of mass.  The cell membrane is first ruptured to release the cell’s components by using a homogenizer.  The resulting mixture is referred to as the &lt;b&gt;homogenate&lt;/b&gt;.  The homogenate is centrifuged to obtain a pellet containing the most dense [[Structural Biochemistry/Cell Organelles|organelles]].  Compounds that are the most dense will form a pellet at lower centrifuge speeds while the less dense compounds will likely remain in the liquid supernatant above the pellet.  Each time, the supernatant may be centrifuged at faster speeds to obtain the less dense organelles.  Performing centrifugation in a stepwise fashion, in which the centrifugation speed is increased each time, allows the components to be separated by mass.  The rather dense [[Structural Biochemistry/Cell Organelles/Nucleus|nucleus]] is most likely to be found after the first centrifugation step, followed by the [[Structural Biochemistry/Cell Organelles/Mitochondria|mitochondria]], then smaller organelles, and finally the cytoplasm, which may contain soluble proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Berg | first = Jeremy | year = 2006 | title = Biochemistry | edition = 6th Ed. | publisher = W. H. Freeman | id = ISBN 0716787245}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Blood-centrifugation-scheme.png|thumb|The result of the centrifugation of blood- compounds are separated by their weight.]]

&lt;b&gt;Equilibrium sedimentation&lt;/b&gt; uses a gradient of a solution to separate particles based on their individual densities (mass/volume). A pivotal aspect about this type of sedimentation is that it is completely independent of the shape of the molecule. It is used to purify the differential centrifugation. A solution is prepared with the densest portion of the gradient at the bottom. Particles to be separated are then added to the gradient and centrifuged. Each particle proceeds until it reaches an environment of comparable density. Such a density gradient may be continuous or prepared in an incremental fashion. For instance, when using sucrose to prepare density gradients, one can carefully float a solution of 40% sucrose onto a layer of 45% sucrose and add further less dense layers above. The homogenate, prepared in a dilute buffer and centrifuged briefly to remove tissue and unbroken cells, is then layered on top. After centrifugation typically for an hour at about 100,000 x g, disks of cellular components residing due to the change in density can be observed from one layer to the next. By carefully adjusting the layer densities to match the cell type, specific cellular components can be enriched.

Sedimentation equilibrium is quite useful because a pellet is not formed. The speed of rotation creates enough force to make the protein leave the rotor, but it doesn’t condense it into a pellet. This is because a gradient in the concentration of the protein is produced. Diffusion reacts to counter the creation of the gradient and after a certain amount of time, a perfect balance between sedimentation and diffusion is achieved. 

Sedimentation equilibrium is also practical to study the interactions between [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|proteins]]. In particular it is used to ascertain the &lt;b&gt; native state or native conformation &lt;/b&gt; of the protein. The native state tells us the exact structure in three dimensions. This information includes if it is a monomer, dimer, trimer, tetramer, etc. A monomer is a protein made up of one subunit. A dimer is two protein subunits that are rotated 180 degrees. A trimer is three subunits etc. This type of experimentation also allows us to determine whether the proteins can form oligomers (identical polypeptide chains tha make up two or more units of a protein). Additionally, the use of sedimentation equilibrium is that it determines equilibrium constants for protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions. The value of this Kd is often between 1nM-1mM.  This is calculated by measuring the equilibrium constant (Kd). A final use of this is to determine stoichiometric ratios between protein complexes. An example of this is a ligand and its receptor or an antigen-antibody pair

==Covalent Bonds==
[[File:Covalent.svg|thumb|left]]
[[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Covalent bonds|Covalent bonds]] are another type of chemical bond used to achieve a noble gas configuration, or an octet of electrons. Covalent bonds are formed between nonmetals, usually from the Boron, Carbon, Nitrogen, Oxygen, and Halogen families. Metals are rarely involved in covalent bonds. Each covalent bond consists of two electrons, one usually from each atom involved in the bond. The atoms form enough covalent bonds that when the electrons in the bonds are added with the valence electrons, they will have an octet.
The key difference between ionic and covalent bonds lies in how the electrons are distributed between the two atoms. In ionic bonds, the electrons are transferred from one atom to the other, giving the atoms effective +1 and -1 charges. However, in covalent bonds, the valence electrons from both of the two atoms are shared between two atoms. Thus, neither atom is given a full positive or negative charge. Instead, the electrons shared between the two atoms - whether it be 2, 4, or 6 electrons - varies from molecule to molecule.

There are two types of covalent bonds: pure covalent bonds and polar covalent bonds.
Pure covalent bonds exist when there is no difference between the two atoms sharing the electrons. The electronegativity of the two atoms is identical. Because the electronegativity values do not differ, they pull the electrons that are being shared between them with the same force. Thus, the electrons are shared equally and none of the atoms bears a partial positive or negative charge. An example of a pure covalent bond is a Cl-Cl or a Br-Br bond. Pure covalent bonds rarely exist for bonds that are not between identical atoms. Another example would be the covalent bonds between the carbons in long alkane chains.

Polar covalent bonds are those that exist between atoms of different electronegativities. The electrons in the bond are still being shared, but not equally between the two atoms. Though the exact ratio of the electron density that each atom bears cannot be determined easily, it is very easy to determine which atom pulls more electron density towards itself. The more electronegative atom will pull the shared electrons more, causing it to now bear a slightly negative charge. Because charge has to be conserved, the less electronegative atom must now bear a slight positive charge, equal in magnitude to the negative charge. As an example, consider a bond between carbon and chlorine. Chlorine is much more electronegative than carbon, thus it pulls more of the electrons towards itself. This gives the chlorine a slightly negative charge and the carbon a slightly positive charge. If the difference between the two atoms is so great causing one of the two atoms to posess a lot of the electron density, the bond becomes increasingly ionic and less covalent. For this reason, though H-Cl is considered a covalent bond, it is classified as a very strong acid, meaning it dissociates completely. Because the electronegativity difference is so vast, the chlorine molecule pulls all the electron density towards itself, thereby dissociating into H+ and Cl- ions in the presence in water.

However, it is important to note that a molecule that contains polar bonds can be nonpolar. For example, take the molecule carbon tetrachloride. This molecule has four polar C-Cl bonds. However, due to the orientation of the polar bonds, they cancel out and the molecule as a whole is nonpolar.

==Hydrogen Bonds==
[[File:Hydrogen-bonding-in-water-2D.png|thumb|right]]
A [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Hydrogen bonds|hydrogen bond]] is a bond created by the [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Dipole interaction|dipole-dipole interaction]] of a hydrogen atom and an electronegative atom such as an oxygen or nitrogen atom due to dipole dipole interactions. A common example of this is water where the electronegativity of the oxygen allows it to have a slight negative charge while the two hydrogen atoms have a slight positive charge.  The negative charge on the oxygen forms a weak bond with the slight positive charge of another water molecule's hydrogen.  This type of bonding is also present in organic fluorine compounds between C and F groups. This force is weaker than [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Covalent bonds|covalent bond]] and [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Ionic interaction|ionic bonds]], but stronger than [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Van der Waals interaction|Van der Waals interactions]].

Intermolecular hydrogen bonding is responsible for the high boiling point of water (100 °C), or most of the solutions that use water as the solvent. This is because of the strong hydrogen bond, as opposed to other group 16 hydrides. Intramolecular hydrogen bonding is partly responsible for the secondary, tertiary, and quaternary structures of proteins and nucleic acids.

==Role of Noncovalent Interactions in Macromolecules==
In macromolecules such as proteins, DNA, and RNA, noncovalent interactions are essential. Noncovalent interactions include hydrogen, ionic, hydrophobic, and Van Der Waals bonding. These interactions are described in more specificity in the list that follows this group. When compared to [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Covalent bonds|covalent bonds]], noncovalent bonds are weak and continuously form and break bonds. However, when several noncovalent bonds are formed, there is a net increase in bond strength. Their combined participation in a macromolecule makes a difference (i.e. substrate binding to enzyme and the lipid bilayer's role in transport). With several hydrogen bonds, ionic, and [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Hydrophobic interaction|hydrophobic interactions]] existent at the same time, it is unlikely that these several weak interactions will break the substrate and enzyme without external energy. This property is the reason why enzymes have specific catalytic power. Protein folding and the unique properties and structures of proteins also depend on these noncovalent interactions.

==Metallic Bonding==
Metallic bonding is the bonding between metal and metal. The bonding involves electron pooling and metallic bonding. Since metal atoms are larger and can easily lose their valence electrons, the electrons on their outer shell can be pooled and be distributed evenly with other metal atoms. Differently from the covalent bonding, electrons in the metallic bonding are delocalized which means that the electrons can move freely through the metal.

1) Metallic bonding in sodium:
Metals tend to have high melting points and boiling points suggesting strong bonds between the atoms. Even a metal like sodium (melting point 97.8°C) melts at a considerably higher temperature than the element (neon) which precedes it in the periodic table.
Sodium has the electronic structure 1s22s22p63s1. When sodium atoms come together, the electron in the 3s atomic orbital of one sodium atom shares space with the corresponding electron on a neighbouring atom to form a molecular orbital. This is the same sort of way that a covalent bond is formed.
The difference, however, is that each sodium atom is being touched by eight other sodium atoms, the sharing occurs between the central atom and the 3s orbitals on all of the eight other atoms. And each of these eight is in turn being touched by eight sodium atoms, which in turn are touched by eight atoms and so on, until you have taken in all the atoms in that lump of sodium.
All of the 3s orbitals on all of the atoms overlap to give a vast number of molecular orbitals, which extend over the whole piece of metal. There have to be huge numbers of molecular orbitals, because each orbital can only hold two electrons.
The electrons can move freely within these molecular orbitals. Each electron becomes detached from its parent atom. The electrons are said to be delocalized. The metal is held together by the strong forces of attraction between the positive nuclei and the delocalized electrons.

2) Metallic bonding in magnesium:
Magnesium has the outer electronic structure 3s2. Both of these electrons become delocalized, so the &quot;sea&quot; has twice the electron density as it does in sodium. The remaining ions also have twice the charge and so there will be more attraction between ions and sea.
Each magnesium atom has 12 protons in the nucleus compared with sodium's 11. In both cases, the nucleus is screened from the delocalized electrons by the same number of inner electrons,the 10 electrons in the 1s2 2s2 2p6 orbitals.
That means that there will be a net pull from the magnesium nucleus of 2+, but only 1+ from the sodium nucleus.
So not only will there be a greater number of delocalized electrons in magnesium, but there will also be a greater attraction for them from the magnesium nuclei.
Magnesium atoms also have a slightly smaller radius than sodium atoms, and so the delocalized electrons are closer to the nuclei. Each magnesium atom also has twelve near neighbors rather than sodium's eight. Both of these factors increase the strength of the bond.

3)Metallic bonding in transition elements:
Transition metals tend to have particularly high melting points and boiling points. The reason is because they can involve in the 3d electrons in the delocalization as well as the 4s. The more electrons can involve, the stronger the attraction.

4) The metallic bond in molten metals:
In a molten metal, the metallic bond is still present, although the ordered structure has been broken down. The metallic bond is not fully broken until the metal boils. That means that boiling point is actually a better guide for the strength of the metallic bond than melting point. In melting, the bond is loosened and is not broken.

==Relative Strength of Chemical Bonds and Intermolecular Forces==
All the bonds known to chemistry can be described the the various dissociation energies needed to break the bonds. It is these dissociation energies that rank the strength of the various bonds found in chemistry. Ionic bonds, being the strongest bonds, have a dissociation energy of &gt;400 kcal/mol. Covalent bonds where are the second strongest bonds have a dissociation energy of about 400 kcal/mol. Hydrogen bonds, dipole-dipole, and london (van der waals) dispersion bonds are in a sub category of bonds labeled intermolecular forces. These forces are significantly weaker than ionic and covalent bonds because of their nature of being interactive forces between compounds rather than physical bonds. Hydrogen bonds are the strongest of said forces and overall third strongest in all bond interactions with a dissociation energy of 12-16 kcal/mol. Dipole Dipole interactions are the second strongest intermolecular force but the fourth strongest bond interaction with a dissociation energy of 0.5-2 kcal/mol. Lastly comes the london vander waal forces that the weakest interaction in chemical bonding with a dissociation energy of &lt;1 kcal/mol.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

Thermodynamics is the study of energy and its interconversion. It is the branch of physics that studies temperature, heat, and other macroscopic properties. 

The science of thermodynamics began in the nineteenth century with the need to describe the operation of steam engines and to set limits of what they were capable of doing. Thus, the name itself denotes the power developed from heat, which used the steam engine as the initial example. Observations of engines were then generalized, which later became the first and second law of thermodynamics.

Thermodynamics also limit a cell's growth to a narrow temperature range. So, the heat increases the molecular movement within the proteins. The species grows within a specific thermal range since its proteins have evolved to endure that range. Anyways, the proteins tends to denature or function very slow for growth if it is outside the range. [Microbiology]

In chemistry, thermodynamics predicts the spontaneity of a process rather than the kinetics of the process. It takes into account only the final and the initial states and does not require knowledge of the pathway between reactants and products. It is a state function. It is the study of heat in chemical reactions and the change of physical state in correspondence to the laws of thermodynamics.  

A system defines the parameters of an object or a process that is being studied and everything else in this universe is considered the &quot;surrounding.&quot; A system is considered to be in thermodynamics in equilibrium with another system, if both the systems have the same temperature. These two things are separated by this boundary that maybe imaginative. There are four main types of boundaries: fixed, real, movable, and imaginary This provides a volume for the system in which things such as work, heat, and matter between the system and the surroundings can be studied upon. .

The principles of thermodynamics are incorporated into the three basic laws. As an old joke summarizes them, the [[Structural Biochemistry/First law|first law]] says you can't win, the [[Structural Biochemistry/Second law|second law]] says you can't break even and the [[Structural Biochemistry/Third law|third law]] says you can't leave the game.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hey, 

I like this lesson. I just added an exercise and a summary of the grammar, because I believe that it is scary when the grammar section takes up more space than the rest of the lesson. I would put the explanations about the copula into a separate book page where we can collect explanations of anything, and then just refer people to these explanations from several course pages.

: Thanks for reviewing the lesson.  I'm not really done with the grammar section.  I just pulled a bunch of existing sections and placed them into the lesson.  I plan on putting more examples, but since this is &quot;the first lesson,&quot; I might be very limited with the current scope.
: I agree that a large grammar section can be daunting.  The use of a &quot;grammar&quot; redux page may prove to be useful.  However, this could backfire for things like the copula, where material in the lesson are not necessarily linked to the grammar point in the linked page.  For example, there's no mention of plain or polite past-tense/past-tense negative.
: Again, this is just a starting point.  We still have a long way to go.  --[[User:Retropunk|Retropunk]] ([[User talk:Retropunk|talk]]) 23:20, 19 October 2008 (UTC)

Hello,
I thought this was a really solid first lesson.  However, I thought there needed to be some corrections, additions, deletions, and stylistic modifications.  I've placed the new version of the page at [[User:Elaeum/Testbed/Japanese/Retropunk/Lesson1]], simply because I didn't know if &quot;review&quot; meant that it was all right to make changes.  Sorry, I'm a bit new here, and trying not to step on other peoples toes.  If you like the modifications, I can remake them on your site, or we can just do a substitution. Hopefully we can get this into the book soon! [[User:Elaeum|Elaeum]] ([[User talk:Elaeum|talk]]) 22:32, 15 June 2010 (UTC)

When 'A Man' replies, 'No, I'm not.', shouldn't the correct Japanese be いません instead of ありません? --[[User:Earthiverse|Earthiverse]] ([[User talk:Earthiverse|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Earthiverse|contribs]]) 00:13, 13 May 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Douglas-Scott-Montagu, John Walter Edward (''2nd Baron Montagu of Beaulieu'') == 

=== “A Southern Scott” (Spy), October 8, 1896 ===


[[Image:Douglas-Scott-Montagu_JWE_Vanity_Fair_1896-10-08.jpg|thumb|right]]''He became the first son of his father (now Lord Montagu of Beaulieu) and grandson of the fifth Duke of Buccleuch thirty years ago; and he has never been still since.  So full of energy is he that when he went to Eton he rowed, and shot for his school at Wimbledon; when he went to Oxford he helped the New College boat to the Head of the River; and, after having shown himself something of a scholar as well as a good actor, he worked for a year in the sheds of the London and South-Western Railway Company, and so was made into a practical engineer.  Then we went round the world with his cousin, the late Lord Ancrum, and his friend, Lord Ennismore; and when his father was made a Peer, he followed him into Parliament, getting himself returned as the wholesome Tory Member for the New Forest Division of Hampshire:  from all which it is clear that he is a versatile young fellow of considerable parts.''


	''He is a good-looking all-round sportsman, a capital shot, a wonderful hand at wild fowling, and almost the only gentleman in England who can scull a gunning-punt.  Popular with all classes, he recalls to those who knew it the hearty simplicity of his grandfather.  He owns a ranch in America; he has twice been to South Africa (where he is supposed to have studied the railway question); he has acted as correspondent of ''The Times'', and he has interviewed Oom Paul.  Consequently he is on the Board of several South African Companies; and, having written a Prize Essay on finance at Oxford, he is as great an authority on money matters as he is on railway difficulties.  Yet he yachts partially, cycles with ease, writes fluently for magazines, throws flies quite irresistibly, and talks well with nervous energy.  He often steered the ''Sciola'' (built by Admiral Victor Montagu) to victory, and he is both a Justice of the Peace and a Captain of Volunteers.''


	'' He owns a beautiful collection of shooting coats; some of which are very well worn.''

Douglas-Scott-Montagu]] (1866-1929) rowed for the Oxford Etonians in the 1887 Grand with Guy Nickalls and D.H. McLean.  He is remembered as a pioneer of motoring, commemorated by his son in 1950 with the establishment of the [[w:National_Motor_Museum|National Motor Museum]] at Beaulieu, the family estate in the New Forest, Hampshire.  Douglas-Scott-Montagu was responsible for the iconic Rolls Royce hood ornament, in that the design he commissioned in 1910 from Charles Sykes became the ''[[w:Spirit_of_Ecstasy|Spirit of Ecstasy]]'' that the company eventually adopted as a standard feature.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Hemmerde, Edward G. == 

=== “The New Recorder” (Spy), May 19, 1909 ===
[[File:Hemmerde_EG_Vanity_Fair_1909-05-19.jpg|thumb|right]] ''Although Mr. Hemmerde is only thirty-eight years of age he already has a reputation of which an older man might boast. Needless to say, his popular success has not been along the lines he would have chosen. Most people think of him as a brilliant K.C., whereas his heart's desire is to shine as a politician. Mr. Hemmerde is a philosopher, however, and has learnt that we usually break a toe against substantial success while chasing a butterfly.''

''He was born in London and educated at Winchester and University College, Oxford. At Winchester he won twenty or thirty prizes for running, jumping, and hammer-throwing, and at Oxford represented his college in Association football and at Rugby in cricket [sic]. Rowing, however, was his favourite recreation. He rowed in the University Trial Eights for three years, and captained the University College Boat Club for two years. Later, in 1900, he won the Diamond Sculls at Henley, defeating Howell, who had won in the two previous years.''

''Devotation to sport did not prevent his appliction to study. He won a college scholarship in 1890, a first-class in Classical Mods. in 1892, graduated with honours in Classics in 1894, took honours Jurisprudence in 1895, and the degree of B.C.L. in 1896.''

''In 1906 he was elected Member of Parliament for East Denbighshire, and in August, 1907, went to Jamaica, and, after being called to the Bar there, won the caes against the insurance companies arising out of the famous earthquake fire. He also successfully contended the Appeal Case in Privy Council, as a result of which the companies paid about £700,000 in claims and £75,000 in costs.''

''In 1908 he was returned and took silk at the same time as F.E. Smith, with whom he is persistently associated by the public, presumably because they differ on every point of opinion. He is now Recorder of Liverpool, while about fifteen years younger than any previous holder of the post, and his friends confidently prophesy that he will break other records.''

''He is an advocate of the democratic cause, a decided Free Trader, and a popular orator, who will no doubt quickly enhance his reputation when his party goes into Opposition. He has insight and decision, is a precise and logical speaker, and will not fail for lack of self-assurance. He is tall and broad -- and deep.''

[[w:Edward_Hemmerde|Edward Hemmerde]] (1871-1948) rowed for University College, Oxford in the Visitors and Wyfolds in 1894. He did not return to the Henley regatta until 1899, when he entered the Diamonds and advanced to the final against Howell, who won by a verdict of easily. In 1900 they faced off again in the Diamonds final, which the regatta records reported as follows:

''This was a desperate race from start to finish. Mr. Howell led for the first half of the race, and was half a length ahead at Fawley Court Boathouse, but at the three-quarter mile mark Mr. Hammerde was a trifle in front, led by a half length at the White House, was clear at the lower end of Phyllis Court, and led by two lengths opposite the Grand Stand. Mr. Howell, however, making a desperate finish, only lost by three-quarters of a length. Time 8m. 42s. Mr. Howell fell out of his boat on stopping. He had a bad attack of malaria in the early part of the week, which caused the weakness from which he suffered.''

=== Romance and Rowing, Part II: “In Which a Hero of Henley Suffers Adversity” ===
[[w:Bertram_Fletcher_Robinson|B. Fletcher Robinson]], who had rowed for Jesus College, Cambridge in the '90s, edited Vanity Fair from 1905 to 1907. In the July 4, 1906 issue he contributed the following as a companion to [[The Rowers of Vanity Fair/Johnstone BC#Henley 1906: The Debate on Foreign Entries|the debate on foreign entries]] that appeared in the same issue and offering a different perspective on [[The Rowers of Vanity Fair/Gold HG#Romance and Rowing|romance and rowing]] than had appeared previously:

''Henry Denton Marshall, commonly called &quot;Bunker&quot; Marshall, for reasons which I have never determined, was a fine oar. Had I the pen of a lady novelist, one of those brilliant idealists who, when they discourse on Cambridge life go yet further astray in their enthusiasm than when they analyse London society, I should translate &quot;Bunker&quot; Marshall, who was a well proportioned lad with a cheerful face and a cherubic complexion, into a god-like youth, the joy of dons, the darling of a mythical University society, and the object of a slavish adoration by the entire undergraduate fraternity. There are, hower, as many sets in Cambridge as in Mayfair. &quot;Bunker&quot; was a member of the &quot;Pit;&quot; but did not wear the pink and white of the Athenaeum. He had not the prestige of an old Etonianism. The son of a respected Yorkshire manufacturer who suffered permanently from a cut-throat competition, he had neither the money nor the birth to become an object of admiration amongst the young gentlemen who play indifferent polo, fall in gallant fashion over impossible fences with the Drag, are not unknown at the Savoy and the Carlton, and generally labour to prove themselves men of the world and very terrible fellows.''

''Yet &quot;Bunker&quot; Marshall had sniffed the incense of hero worship. He had been a rowing Blue for two years, and winning years at that. Both his dean and tutor, who had seen him raise the college boat five places on the river in that period, were his firm friends. Freshmen, when he was pointed out to them by their seniors, glanced at him humbly; and the undergraduates of his own college of -- let us say -- Boniface (which was not Trinity, but might have been the Hall, Jesus, or Caius) regarded him as their natural leader. He was not unaffected by this admiration. He was no fool, but he knew that he was a person of some importance, and bore himself accordingly.''

''He had met Miss Dereham at his college ball. She was the daughter of General Sir Hugh Dereham, G.C.B., C.M.G., &amp;c., &amp;c., and her brother, a freshman from Radley, had rowed bow in the Boniface Eight. She was a tall girl, graceful, brown-eyed, and brown-haired, and two-and-twenty years of age. Dick Dereham was very proud of his sister; also he worshipped &quot;Bunker&quot; Marshall. That the two had become friends pleased him; that &quot;Bunker&quot; had fallen desperately in love he failed to perceive; which is the way of brothers.''

''At the conclusion of the May races the Boniface boat had been left second on the river. They would have gone head, in the general opinion, if there had been another night of racing, being an uncommonly good crew, big and strong, though still capable of further improvement. To Henley they migrated as a matter of course. Things went so well with them that their chances for the Grand Challenge began to be seriously considered by the experts who sit after dinner on a first-floor veranda of the Leander Club. The Press, however, excited by the freaks of training practiced by a visiting American Eight, neglected them altogether.''

''&quot;Bunker&quot; Marshall saw much of Miss Dereham, for the General had taken a house in the Fair Mile for the regatta. It was, moreoever, plain that Miss Dereham took a personal interest in &quot;Bunker.&quot; She was frequently to be seen upon the tow-path watching the practice of the Eight. On Sundays they laughed and chatted away the afternoon in the General's garden, while Dick sneered over the sporting papers in the shade of the big yew, or they went up-stream in a launch which the General hired. The positon of affairs was accepted by the crew, though not without apprehension. For a man to fall in love while training was a dangerous experiment. The weight of their captain was carefully noted. One week when he fell away by four ounces Miss Dereham became quite unpopular. The only two excepted from and entirely unaware of their secret consultations were Dick Dereham and &quot;Bunker&quot; himself.''

''It was nine o'clock in the evening, and the Saturday before the Regatta. &quot;Bunker&quot; had been interviewed and photographed several times during he week, and the crew had been pulling his leg during dinner over the efforts of various weekly papers. As the Canadian canoe which he shared with Dereham drifted past the Phyllis Court wall &quot;Bunker&quot; referred to the matter.''

''&quot;Of course it's all nonsense, Dereham,&quot; he said. &quot;Yet it's fame of a sort. I can see my sisters snipping out the pictures -- they keep a book of cuttings about me. Women like a man to be talked about, don't you think?&quot;''

''&quot;Rather,&quot; said Dereham. &quot;But what a rotter that chap on ''Field Sports'' must be, making you say that a swivel rollock was--&quot;''

''&quot;I suppose it will be a long time before I am as famous again,&quot; sighed &quot;Bunker,&quot; careless of the interruption.''

''&quot;Did you see what ''The River'' said about you?&quot; urged Dick.''

''&quot;I don't care what they say. When a man is a sort of public character he's fair game. Look at the way they slang Chamberlain.&quot;''

''&quot;Anyhow, it's a beastly cheek,&quot; said Dick, accepting the parallel as reasonable.''

''&quot;They'll talk about you just the same someday.&quot;''

''&quot;Do you really mean it, 'Bunker'? Do you think I--&quot;''

''&quot;If you continue to improve as you have in the past fortnight you'll get your blue all right.&quot;''

''&quot;By Jove! but the governor would be pleased. And Ida -- she thinks a blue is the end of all things.&quot;''

''&quot;Does she really?&quot; said Marshall, sitting up suddenly.''

''&quot;Rather.&quot;''

''&quot;Bunker&quot; Marshall hesitated, settled himself amongst the cushions, gave a lazy stroke or two with the paddle, sat up again, and finally spoke.''

''&quot;Look here, Dereham,&quot; he said, &quot;I really don't quite know how to put it, but the fact is -- perhaps you may have -- well, I love your sister very much.&quot;''

''Dick whistled and stared.''

''&quot;Do you think I've any chance?&quot;''

''&quot;Chance? Why of course you have. My dear fellow, a man like you, President of the 'Varsity, one of the best Sevens that ever rowed -- I'm deuced glad. It's splendid, really splendid.&quot;''

''&quot;It's awfully good of you, Dereham,&quot; said &quot;Bunker.&quot;''

''&quot;You're such a modest chap. You don't know how famous you are. The boatmen and townees point you out to trippers. 'That's Marshall. He was President last year. Finest oar Cambridge has had for years.' You'd hear them yourself if you listened.&quot;''

''&quot;If I have a chance,&quot; said &quot;Bunker,&quot; modestly, &quot;and if you back me up, Dereham -- well, that's something.&quot;''

''&quot;Don't you worry, 'Bunker.'&quot;''

''&quot;You won't say a word to anyone, Dereham. Promise now.&quot;''

''&quot;Of course not.&quot;''

''* * *''

''Now, as the Fates ordained, the Boniface Eight was promoted on the following Tuesday afternoon into an object of International interest. The sporting sections of the two peoples, which are separated by the Atlantic, fixed their eyes on Mr. Marshall and his crew. For Leander was beaten by the Tuxedo crew in the first heat of the Grand Challenge, and the Boniface Eight paddled home a length in front of St. Benedicts, the head of the river at Oxford. Plainly if the Cup were not to follow other articles of silver plate across the Atlantic Boniface would be the cause of its retention on English soil.''

''On Wednesday both crews won their heats with ease. On Thursday came the final.''

''It would have caused surprise, and perhaps some indignation to the group of enthusiasts who watched the Boniface Eight push off from the landing-stage if they had known the state of mind in which the stroke -- for it was at that thwart that &quot;Bunker&quot; sat -- then found himself. For so healthy a young man he was pale -- not very pale, but far from red. It was remarked on the bank that &quot;Bunker&quot; had a pretty bad needle which, being translated, means an attack of nerves usual to oarsmen in such circumstances. As a matter of fact &quot;Bunker's&quot; head was buzzing with a few words snatched from a wildly enthusiastic young lady who had pressed his hand as he carried his oar down to the boat. &quot;Dear 'Bunker,'&quot; she had said; &quot;you'll beat them, I know you will.&quot; &quot;Dear 'Bunker'&quot; what did she mean? Could it be -- &quot;Forward,&quot; cried the cox -- did she really -- &quot;Are you ready?&quot; -- she must have -- &quot;Paddle.&quot; And so they swept down the course towards the starting-place.''

''&quot;Bunker's&quot; amatory speculations were still unfinished -- was ever a stroke in so cruel a situation? -- while he passed his sweater to the boatman, undid two buttons at the waist, wriggled himself in his sliding seat, and regarded the straps that confined his toes. Yet for a moment Diana conquered Venus. &quot;Now you men,&quot; he addressed the boat, &quot;Don't get flurried. We're all right; but for Heaven's sake pick it up when I quicken.&quot; &quot;Are you ready, Marshall?&quot; called the Starter. &quot;Yes,&quot; he answered, regarding the trim lines of the Umpire's launch moving slowing upon them. A similar question to the Americans alongside, a sliding forward, a moment of tense, vicious excitement little less acute to some members of the crew than that which the condemned man suffers when the hangman lays his hand on the lever of the drop, a voice, a pistol, the swish of oars, a short second stroke, the thud of a cannon from somewhere on the bank -- and the great race had begun.''

''And &quot;Bunker&quot; kept his head, like the good man he was. The Americans were gaining on him; he could see nothing but their rudder now as he took a swift glance from the tail of his eye. But he knew their style of rowing, those short and rapid strokes that drive a boat so fast and tire a crew so quickly. They were both clear of the island now, and the white launch was flying after them with a curl of foam at the bows. They had reached the farm. He looked at the cox. &quot;Three-quarters of a length.&quot; It contented his soul. The boat was going well; the men rowing cleanly together. He was not afraid -- if they stuck to it.''

''&quot;Two, you're late,&quot; cried the cox. He cursed two in his heart; the shout interrupted his thoughts. He must keep his head clear. Fawley -- they were near the half-way post. &quot;Close on a length,&quot; said the cox. He nodded his head. &quot;Pick it up,&quot; cried the cox, and the crew took the spurt finely.''

''They were amongst the thick of the pleasure craft now. A great dull roar filled the air, a mass of inarticulate cries. Once he saw an American flag waving over the boom that guarded the course, and heard a shrill ordered war-cry from a score of Tuxedo supporters somewhere on his left. Beyond that he could not remember to have heard or seen anything from the island to the half-way post beyond the cox's face and the white curl on the launch's forefoot, and the dull rumbling of people shouting it might have been miles away. &quot;Under half a length,&quot; cried the cox. They were going up, then? They were close on Phyllis Court now. Again he spurted. A glance from the tail of his eye; there was the enemy's rudder coming back to him. And now it was their cox, with an odd megaphone attachment on his head that made him look so funny. Curse that cox, what a fool he looked! Another spurt -- they were passing the wall. What a noise there was. There could be little in it. Come on, you men! Row, row, row! For the honour of English muscle and English skill -- row, row, row! There was the Yankee stroke. He was falling back; he was behind them. Row, row! He could not see very clearly now. Perhaps it was all right. Row, row! A gun. &quot;Easy all,&quot; cried the cox. &quot;Half a length, 'Bunker,' half a length to the good, by God.&quot;''

''And yet the cox was a pious little man.''

''* * *''

''Oh, what a hero was &quot;Bunker&quot;! How they shouted as he stepped from his boat! How old veterans came running up to slap him on the back! How the college boatman clasped his hand, shouting, with tears in his eyes, &quot;Gawd, it was wonderful! Gawd, it was wonderful; and I've won two quid.&quot; Oh, &quot;Bunker&quot; Marshall, you will never be so famous again, so worshipped by friends, so admired by even your beaten enemies; not even if you become Prime Minister of England and reduce the income-tax!''

''It was next morning, under the yew tree in the General's garden, that he came upon Ida Dereham. She was alone. To be truthful, Dick was still in bed suffering from what he accurately described as a sick headache. There was little of the hero about &quot;Bunker.&quot; Indeed, he spoke to her with a hanging head.''

''&quot;I have something to say,&quot; he began. &quot;It's this. I love you very much. Will you marry me?&quot;''

''&quot;My ''dear'' boy!&quot; she said.''

''&quot;Is there no hope, then?&quot;''

''&quot;You'll soon get over it,&quot; she said, cheerfully. &quot;And now tell me some more about the race. You're a hero, you know.&quot;''

''* * *''

''&quot;And you refused him, Ida?&quot; cried Dick, in vast indignation some two hours later.''

''&quot;My dear Dick. Please let me manage my own affairs.&quot;''

''&quot;Oh, but I say--&quot;''

''&quot;Why you should wish me to marry a boy that has just left school I can't imagine. Besides, who are his people? What can he do but become a schoolmaster or something on half commission in the City? Don't be so absurd.&quot;''

''&quot;But everybody knows &quot;Bunker&quot; Marshall. He is as famous--&quot;''

''&quot;As a professional cricketer, perhaps. But would you ask me to marry a professional cricketer?&quot;''

''&quot;Oh, I say!&quot; said Dick Dereham.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">The purpose of this page is to show tricks to dealing with the confusing math that sometimes arises from problems in quantum physics. It will not answer your homework, but might help you become unstuck.

==Normalization==

When a question asks you to normalize a wavefunction, they mean defining the value of some coefficient such that 

	&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \left|\Psi(x,t)\right|^2\, dx = 1&lt;/math&gt;

For example, consider a function 

&lt;math&gt;\Psi(x,t) = A\beta(x,t)&lt;/math&gt;

To find A, you must first find the absolute value of &lt;math&gt;\left|\Psi(x,t)\right|^2&lt;/math&gt;. Because wavefunctions often have complex parts, it is not sufficient to square the wavefunction. You must instead multiply it by its complex conjugate. To learn how to take the complex conjugate of a number, see the page on [[This quantum world/Appendix/Complex numbers|Complex numbers]].

&lt;math&gt;\left|\Psi(x,t)\right|^2 = A^2\beta(x,t)\beta(x,t)^\star&lt;/math&gt;

Rearranging to solve for A, 

&lt;math&gt;A =1/\sqrt{\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\beta(x,t)\beta(x,t)^\star dx}&lt;/math&gt;

Note that since the limits of integration are infinite, &lt;math&gt;\left|\Psi(x,t)\right|^2&lt;/math&gt; must go to zero as x goes to infinity or negative infinity. Otherwise, the probability of a particle being anywhere is greater than 1, and the function is not normalizable. There are only a few cases where these conditions are satisfied.

===Dealing with Gaussians===
One of the most common cases is a function where &lt;math&gt;\left|\Psi(x,t)\right|^2&lt;/math&gt; is of the form &lt;math&gt;A^2 e^{-\alpha x^2}&lt;/math&gt;. In which case, you end up with an integral:

&lt;math&gt;A^2\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-\alpha x^2}dx = 1&lt;/math&gt;

But this means integrating &lt;math&gt;\int e^{x^2} dx&lt;/math&gt;, a function which is impossible to integrate. Integrating it in Mathematica and Maple will give you a bunch of complex functions which are not easy to handle. Trying to transform it to &lt;math&gt;\int e^{2x}dx&lt;/math&gt; is not the correct method to proceed, remember that there is a difference between &lt;math&gt;\int e^{x^2}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\int (e^x)^2&lt;/math&gt;.

However, although the limits of integration are at infinity and negative infinity, the integral is still definite, and there is a solution. 
&lt;br&gt;
Define a new function &lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;I = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-\alpha x^2}dx&lt;/math&gt;.
&lt;br&gt; 
Square the function.&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;I^2 = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-\alpha x^2}dx*\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-\alpha x^2}dx&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Use a change of variables, &lt;math&gt;x = y&lt;/math&gt;, on one integral, to get:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;I^2 = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-\alpha x^2}dx*\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-\alpha y^2}dy = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}e^{-\alpha (x^2+y^2)}dxdy&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Do another change of variables into polar coordinates (for an introduction to polar coordinates, see the [[Calculus/Polar Introduction|Calculus wikibook]]).&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x=r\cos(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;y = r\sin(\theta)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;r^2 = x^2 + y^2 &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;I^2 = \int_{0}^{2\pi}\int_{0}^{\infty}re^{-\alpha r^2}drd\theta&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Which is a much easier form to integrate.

==Quantum Operators==
The five most common quantum operators in basic quantum physics problems are:&lt;br&gt;
x operator: &lt;math&gt;\hat x = x&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;x^2&lt;/math&gt; operator: &lt;math&gt;\hat {x^2} = x^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
momentum operator: &lt;math&gt;\hat p = {\hbar /i} \nabla&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
momentum squared operator: &lt;math&gt;\hat{p^2} = -\hbar^2\nabla^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Hamiltonian operator: &lt;math&gt;\hat H = -\hbar^2/{2m}\nabla^2 + V&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
To use these operators on a wavefunction, sandwich it in the integral. For example, to find the average value of x, also known as the expectation value of x or the first moment of x, take the integral:
&lt;math&gt;&lt;x&gt; = \int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\Psi\hat x \Psi^{\star}dx&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
===Even and odd functions===
If a wavefunction is symmetric and centered around the origin, it is even (f(x)=f(-x)). Therefore, the expectation value of x must be found at 0, as the probability that it will be in the region of -x is equal to the probability that it will be in the region of x. &lt;br&gt;
A more rigorous proof is as follows:&lt;br&gt;
Suppose &lt;math&gt;y(x) = \left | \Psi(x,t)\right|^2&lt;/math&gt; is even. y(x) = x is odd (f(x)=-f(x)).&lt;br&gt;
Then   &lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;y(x) = \left | \Psi(x,t)\right|^2*x&lt;/math&gt; is an odd function (even*odd = odd).&lt;br&gt;
Then &lt;br&gt;&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left | \Psi(x,t)\right|^2*xdx = \int_{-\infty}^{0}\left | \Psi(x,t)\right|^2*xdx + \int_{0}^{\infty}\left | \Psi(x,t)\right|^2*xdx&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Since &lt;math&gt;y(x) = \left | \Psi(x,t)\right|^2*x&lt;/math&gt; is an odd function,&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{0}\left | \Psi(x,t)\right|^2*xdx = -\int_{0}^{\infty}\left | \Psi(x,t)\right|^2*xdx&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
So &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\left | \Psi(x,t)\right|^2*xdx = -\int_{0}^{\infty}\left | \Psi(x,t)\right|^2*xdx + \int_{0}^{\infty}\left | \Psi(x,t)\right|^2*xdx = 0&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
We can use the properties of even and odd functions to our advantage, and find the average value of &lt;x&gt; by inspection.
===Useful Integrals===
There are many reoccurring integrals to be solved in quantum physics, and these general solutions may help you solve them.

&lt;math&gt;\int x\sin(ax)dx = (1/a^{2})\sin(ax)-(x/a)\cos(ax)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\int x\cos(ax)dx = (1/a^{2})\cos(ax)-(x/a)\sin(ax)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{\infty}x^{n}e^{-x/a}dx = n! a^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{\infty}x^{2n}e^{-x^{2}/a^{2}}dx = \sqrt{\pi} \frac{(2n)!}{n!} (\frac{a}{2})^{2n+1}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;\int_{0}^{\infty}x^{2n+1}e^{-x^{2}/a^{2}}dx = \sqrt{\pi} a^{2n+2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

Integration by parts is also very useful:

&lt;math&gt;\int udv = uv-\int vdu&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Often in a question involving expectation values, you will be expected to find the expectation value and the expectation value squared, so using integration by parts usually means you've already solved a part of the integral for the expectation value squared.

==Uncertainty==

Although the math involved in finding expectation values is messy and offers many opportunities for making mistakes, quantum theory comes with it's own error check - the [[This quantum world/Serious_illnesses/Born#Heisenberg|Heisenberg uncertainty principle]].

&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x\sigma_p\ge\frac{\hbar}{2}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x&lt;/math&gt; is the standard deviation of position, &lt;math&gt;\sigma_p&lt;/math&gt; is the standard deviation of momentum. Don't worry, we don't have to do a whole lot of tedious calculations like you might be used to in statistics to find standard deviation. Instead, use the relation:

&lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^{2} = &lt;x^{2}&gt;-&lt;x&gt;^{2}&lt;/math&gt;

If you find that your answers don't satisfy the uncertainty principle, either you've made a mistake, or you've been assigned an unphysical question.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== De Rutzen, Albert == 

=== “A Model Magistrate” (WAG), August 16, 1900 ===
[[Image:De_Rutzen_A_Vanity_Fair_1900-08-16.jpg|thumb|right]]
''He is the third son of the late Charles, Baron de Rutzen of Slebeck Park, in Pembrokeshire; he was born sixty-nine years ago; he began life at Eton, and continued it at Trinity, Cambridge; and he became a Barrister of the Inner Temple at the age of six-and-twenty.  His conduct of his own (and of other people's) affairs at the Bar is forgotten; for he took upon him the duties of a Magistrate more than thirty years ago -- as Stipendiary at Merthyr Tydfil.  There he became a Justice of the Peace and Deputy-Chairman of Quarter Sessions for Glamorganshire, and did so well that he was summoned to a London Police Court in 1876.  He sat successfully and successively at Marylebone, Westminster, and Marlborough Street; and last year he was &quot;moved on&quot; to Bow Street, where  he is now dispensing equal Justice among sinners.  He is a big-hearted Magistrate, full of cruel and sordid experiences which have not hardened his soul.  On the contrary, Mr. De Rutzen is a very honest, painstaking, kindly mentor to those whose distress brings them before him; and, despite the tedious monotony of his Office, he never fails in any one of his virtues.''


''He is a model Magistrate.''

Albert de Rutzen (1831-1913) rowed no. 3 for Cambridge in the two Boat Races of 1849.  He appeared in &lt;span style=&quot;font-variant:small-caps&quot;&gt;Vanity Fair&lt;/span&gt; on becoming Chief Magistrate in London, a post he held until retirement in 1913.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Fuller-Acland-Hood, Alexander (''Baron St. Audries'') == 

=== “First Conservative Whip” (Spy), November 26, 1903 ===
[[Image:Fuller-Acland-Hood_A_Vanity_Fair_1903-11-26.jpg|thumb|right]]''Born at St. Andrews in 1853, he succeeded his father as fourth Baronet ten years ago, after having gone through Eton, Balliol, and Sandhurst with credit, having served with the Grenadier Guards in Egypt, and having been A.D.C. to the Governor of Victoria.  As a Baronet he retired from the Army, became M.P. for West Somerset, and Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasury; for he is the head of a good old Somersetshire family whose father and grandfather represented the country before him.  He is also Vice-Chamberlain to His Majesty and First Whip of the Conservative Party.''

''He can speak to the point, he is a very cheerful, good fellow, and he believes in the future of the Conservative Party.''

[[w:A_Fuller-Acland-Hood|Alexander Fuller-Acland-Hood]] (1853-1917) rowed No. 6 for the 1st Battalion Grenadier Guards in the Grand in 1877 with H.F. Eaton and Alwyne Frederick Compton.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Lord Barnard (Henry de Vere Vane) == 

=== “Raby Castle” (GAF), December 15, 1898 ===

[[Image:Barnard_Lord_Vanity_Fair_1898-12-15.jpg|thumb|right]]''Henry de Vere Vane, ninth Baron Barnard, of Barnard Castle in the Bishopric of Durham, B.A., Barrister, Deputy-Lieutenant of County Durham, Justice of the Peace, and a County Councillor, is forty-five years old, the husband of the third Marquis of Exeter's third daughter, and the father of three sons.  He succeeded to the Barony seven years ago, on the death of his kinsman, the fourth Duke of Cleveland and Baron Barnard:  when all the Duke's other styles and honours became extinct.  His family is of Welsh extraction and quite ancient; for, according to history, one Sir Henry Vane was knighted for his valiant achievements at the Battle of Poictiers [sic].  He lives in the historic Raby Castle; which was formerly the seat of the great Nevill family, Earls of Westmorland; and the rest of the doings and achievements of his house may be discovered by the diligent in four columns of Burke.''

''He was an Eton boy (in &quot;Badger&quot; Hale's House), a Wet Bob, and a B.N.C. man; he has been a Militiaman and Private Secretary to the Chief Commissioner in Charity, and he now interests himself in Politics, Education, Freemasonry, and Sport.  His amateurish hobbies include books, pictures, antiquities, and genealogies.  He has been outside a horse; but he is more at home on foot with a gun.  He is an unaffected person who regards himself as an average Englishman; but he is generally liked, over a big agricultural property which extends into several counties, as a man of great kindness.''

''He sometimes attends the House of Lords when he is in town.''

Henry de Vere Vane (1854-1918) rowed bow for Brasenose College, Oxford in the 1874 Visitors’, losing to University College with J.E. Bankes.

== [[Reti opening]] ==

Hi! :-) You've created a good one on [[Reti opening]]. However, an user feels that it was better if it could be merged with [[Opening theory in chess]]. Thanks-&lt;font color=&quot;maroon&quot; size=&quot;4&quot; face=&quot;Monotype Corsiva&quot;&gt;[[User:Ravichandar84|Ravichandar]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;aqua&quot; face=&quot;Monotype Corsiva&quot;&gt;[[User talk:Ravichandar84|My coffee shop]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; 16:41, 19 October 2008 (UTC)
:Not a good one imo but rather a copy (so copyvio?!) from [[w:Reti Opening]]! [[User:SunCreator|SunCreator]] ([[User talk:SunCreator|talk]]) 20:10, 20 October 2008 (UTC)
Please expand the page [[Opening theory in chess/1. Nf3/1...d5/2. c4|Reti Opening]] but without copying from wikipedia. If you really want to copy wikipedia then a [[Wikibooks:Requests for Import]] can be made. [[User:SunCreator|SunCreator]] ([[User talk:SunCreator|talk]]) 20:15, 20 October 2008 (UTC)</text>

yeah it should be merged with something else or put into some junior section on how things work (as suggested in that banner)

&lt;big&gt;'''Head &amp; Neck Palliation'''&lt;/big&gt;

*'''Princess Margaret; 2011''' (2003-2008) PMID 20950952 -- &quot;Retrospective study of palliative radiotherapy in newly diagnosed head and neck carcinoma.&quot; (Stevens CM, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2011 Nov 15;81(4):958-63.)
**Retrospective. 148 pts underwent palliative RT. Median age 72. Reason for palliative treatment was advanced locoregional disease in 24%, metastatic disease in 38%, poor performance status in 22%, or a combination in 16%. Various regimens: 50/20 (most common), 24/3, 60/25, 30/10, 60/30, 70/35. The 50/20 regimen gave 2 cycles of 25 Gy in 10 fractions separated by a 2 week break, total course of 6 weeks.
**70% completed the planned RT course. 73% of pts had died, with a median f/u of 4.8 months and MS of 5.2 months. Radiation dose was a significant predictor for overall survival and treatment response. 
**Conclusion: palliative RT provides symptomatic relief in most patients. In selected patients, higher dose palliative RT should be considered to maximize the durability of local control.

*'''UC Davis; 2008''' (2001-2007) PMID 18798313 -- &quot;Palliative radiation therapy for head and neck cancer: Toward an optimal fractionation scheme.&quot; (Chen AM, Head Neck. 2008 Sep 16. [Epub ahead of print])
**Retrospective. 60 patients, primary H&amp;N sites, typically painful recurrent disease. Used various regimens: 44.4/12 (RTOG 85-02 protocol @ 3.7 Gy/fx BID for 2 consecutive days at 2-3 week intervals), 70/35, 30/10, 37.5/15, 20/5
**Palliative response: 83%, 77%, 67%, 86%, 60% (NS)
**Toxicity: Grade 3+ 44.4/12 9% vs. other regimens 37% (SS)
**Conclusion: All schedules effective at palliation, RTOG 85-02 scheme less toxicity</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Monoclonal antibodies''' are a homogeneous collection of [[Structural Biochemistry/Protein function/Antibodies|antibodies]] that all bind to the same antigenic determinant.  They were first prepared by Cesar Milstein and Georges Kohler.

Similar to working with impure proteins, working with impure antibodies(polyclonal antibodies) made it difficult to interpret data and to understand function. Because their specificity was not known, immunological methods (e.g. [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Structural_Biochemistry/Proteins/Enzyme-Linked_Immunoabsorbent_Assay_%28ELISA%29 ELISA], [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Structural_Biochemistry/Proteins/Western_Blotting Western Blotting]) were not able to be applied.

The ideal method of obtaining monoclonal antibodies would be to simply isolate the desired antibody producing cell. However, the problem with that is that antibody producing cells isolated from the organism don't live very long. The solution to this problem would be to use a '''cancer cell (myeloma cell)'''.

Multiple myeloma is a disorder of antibody producing cells characterized by the uncontrollable division of a mutated cell.  Each time this cell divides, it produces an exact copy of itself. Because cell division is not being regulated, a large aggregation of cells are quickly formed.  All of these cells are identical to one another, and are thus referred to as clones.  Milstein and Kohler hypothesized that if a cancer cell of this type could be fused with an antibody producing cell, they could have a potentially infinite source of monoclonal antibodies.

Monoclonal antibodies are produced by the process outlined in the flowchart above.  A mouse is first injected with an antigen that is known to stimulate the production of the desired antibody.  After approximately three weeks, the spleen of the mouse is removed.  Plasma cells from the spleen are fused in vitro with myeloma cells, giving rise to a colony of hybrid cells (hybridoma cells). These hybridoma cells are capable of producing an indefinite amount of the antibody obtained from the spleen.

[[File:How to obtain monoclonal antibodies.jpg|thumb|How to obtain monoclonal antibodies]]

A mixture of hybridoma cells is often formed. This mixture must be separated in order to obtain a homogeneous collection of antibody producing cells. An assay that tests for specific antibody-antigen interactions can be used to achieve separation. The assays are repeated and the collection of cells is continually subdivided until a pure cell line is obtained. It is good to note that the spleen also contains numerous other cells that produce antibodies for different antigens. Purification is necessary is order to find the one type of hybridoma cell that produces the desired antibody. The isolated cells can either be grown in a culture or injected into a mouse in order to procure the desired antibody. Another option is to freeze the cells for later use.

The advantage of monoclonal antibodies is that they are identical antibodies with the same affinity for the same area of the same antigen, thus allowing better purification results. Polyclonal antibodies, on the other hand, are a mixture of different antibodies each recognizing a different site (epitope) of the same antigen.

Antibodies have the ability to bind to two antigens. This is possible since any antibody has the ability to bind to two antigens and can be recognized by many antibodies (monoclonal and polyclonal) as far as there is still exposed surface where the antibodies could bind.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Fluorescent markers, sometimes known as fluorophores, is any molecule with the ability to absorb light and emit it at some other well defined wavelength.  Flurophores come in a variety of types ranging from simple organic compounds to large proteins like Green Fluorescent Protein.  Fluorescent markers give the ability to investigate [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|proteins]] in their biological environment. When light of a certain wavelength is directed at the molecule's chromophore, a photon is absorbed and excites an electron to a higher energy state. The electron then relaxes back to its ground state. The energy that is released is determined by the formula E = hν, where h is Planck's constant and ν is the frequency of the photon. This energy can then be related back to the wavelength of the emitted photon, which corresponds to a specific color on the visible spectrum. The difference between the absorption and emission wavelength is called the Stokes shift.  Large Stokes shifts are generally desirable because the emitted light from the fluorescent tag can be filtered out more easily from the excitation light.  Fluorescence educing molecules such as FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate) are used to stain cells which give the ability to examine these cells under a fluorescence microscope. Multiple fluorescent markers can be used to stain different parts of cell. Fluorescence microscopy can aid in determining the location of specific proteins within a cell. One can even track the movement of these proteins and derive possible functions for these proteins of interest.

==Green Fluorescent Protein==

[[Image:Gfpantibodycell.jpg|frame|GFP attaching to target cell for fluorescence microscopy using the direct method]]

Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) is a fluorescent protein that is found in the jellyfish, ''Aequoria victoria''. In biochemistry, it is frequently used as a marker to monitor gene expression and cell division. The naturally-occurring GFP has a major absorbance peak at 395&amp;nbsp;nm and a minor absorbance peak at 475&amp;nbsp;nm. It has an emission peak of 508&amp;nbsp;nm. This means that when exposed to blue light, it emits photons that give off green light, hence giving it the name Green Fluorescent Protein. 

The Green Fluorescent Protein is comprised of 238 [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acid]]. It has a barrel shape, called a β-can, with 11 β-strands forming the walls of the protein and a α-helix running through the center. The β-can has a diameter of 30Å and a length of 40Å. At the center of the molecule is the hydrophobic fluorophore, which is the part of the protein that is responsible for absorbing and emitting light. The fluorophore is comprised of three amino acids: serine, tyrosine, and glycine, at locations 65, 66, and 67 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Tsien, Roger Y. &quot;[http://www.tsienlab.ucsd.edu/Publications/Tsien%201998%20Annu.%20Rev.%20Biochem%20-%20GFP.pdf THE GREEN FLUORESCENT PROTEIN.&quot;] Annu. Rev. Biochem. 67 (1998): 509-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

To observe a target protein using fluorescence microscopy, the gene for the production of GFP must be spliced into the RNA transcript that codes for the protein of interest. Wherever the gene is expressed to produce this protein, GFP will be produced along with it. These target proteins will now fluoresce when observed under a fluorescence microscope. 

The fluorophore is generated by a sequential mechanism in the catalytic process. No co-factors is required for the activation for the catalysis reaction. The reaction is initiated by a rapid cyclization between Ser65 and Gly67 to form an imidazolin-5-one intermediate, which is followed by a much slower rate-limiting oxygenation of the Tyr66 side chain by O2 on a timescale of hours. Gly67 is required for formation of the fluorophore, no other amino acid can replace Gly in this role. The reaction here is thermosensitive. The yield of formation of the fluorophore decreases when the temperature increase higher than 30oC. Once GFP has produced, GFP turns into thermostable state.

When fluorescent molecules are introduced into a genome, they tend to be phototoxic which can cause death of cells when the fluorescent molecule is active. Majority of small fluorescent molecules tend to have some degree of phototoxicity such FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate). Because GFP's tri-peptide fluorophore is activated by oxygen, the addition of an enzyme is unnecessary. This oxygen activated characteristic allows the target cell to be less disturbed which causes GFP to be less harmful when used in living cells. This allows GFP to be maintained in the genome. 

Another method that can be used to locate a protein is to bind GFP to an antibody that will bind to the target protein. The direct method would bind the fluorescent antibody to the corresponding antigen on the target protein. The indirect method first binds a non-fluorescent antibody on the target protein. Then the fluorescent antibody is introduced which will bind to the non-fluorescent antibody. Although it is possible to stain specific parts of cell directly, indirect methods are preferred due to high affinity. Then using fluorescence microscopy, the target cell which is now fluorescent can be studied.

==Other Uses of GFPs==
The use of GFP is not only limited to monitoring gene expression and cell regulation. Inorganic species such as zinc and nitric oxide are important agents that help drive physiological processes. Therefore, it is valuable to study and visualize how these inorganic agents interact and are processed within cells. For zinc, there are many turn-on sensors that offer good methods to visualize zinc ions inside cells. Most zinc indicators used are intensity-based sensors such that the response to zinc indicators establishes the intensity of fluorescence emission. Nitric oxide, on the other hand, are more difficult to monitor because of their gaseous nature, limited water solubility, and other limitations. One way to work around this challenge is to use genetic encoding of nitric oxide-sensitive proteins which have transition metal nitric-oxide reactive sites. For example, two mutant GFPs are fused together to be used as a nitric oxide indicator. In a sense, one can manipulate GFPs to use as indicators, thereby giving even more possibilities to understand organization and regulation of signaling networks.&lt;ref&gt;Lippincott-Schwartz, J. &quot;[http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-biochem-121010-125553 Emerging In Vivo Analyses of Cell Function Using Fluorescence Imaging.&quot;] Annu. Rev. Biochem. 80 (2011): 327-332.&lt;/ref&gt;

Green fluorescent proteins are also used in the in vivo technique of FRET (Fluorescent Resonance Energy Transfer), an imagining method used to understand interactions between proteins. In FRET, the energy transfer from a fluorescent protein (the &quot;donor&quot;) to another fluorescent protein with a longer wavelength (the &quot;acceptor&quot;) are measured. By measuring the inter-molecular and intra-molecular distances between the GFP bounded proteins, researchers are able to observe and take note of protein interactions. For example, FRET allows us to detect interactions between signaling molecules. By situating a protein that is sensitive to changes in conformations between the FRET donor and acceptor proteins, we can determine the activity of the pathway.&lt;ref&gt;Lippincott-Schwartz, J. &quot;[http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/pdf/10.1146/annurev-biochem-121010-125553 Emerging In Vivo Analyses of Cell Function Using Fluorescence Imaging.&quot;] Annu. Rev. Biochem. 80 (2011): 329-330.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fluorescent Sensors for Nitric Oxide==
	Metal-based fluorescent probes have been developed as method for detecting the presence of NO in a system; NO is a prominent compound that is associated with signaling pathways in the living organisms. These metal-based fluorescent indicators are based on the metal Cu(II). When the Cu(II) ions react with NO, Cu(II) gets reduced into Cu(I). This process results in diminishing the quenching energy of the lone pair on the nitrogen atom of the nitric oxide; the reaction causes a decrease in the fluorescence intensity of the lone pair on the nitrogen atom. In addition, the react between Cu(II) and NO that takes place in the system also leads to a lowering of the PET quenching in the N-nitrosamine. Fluorescent probes based on Cu(II) are ideal for detecting NO that reside in environments that do not contain oxygen. 
	A specific fluorescein dye that utilizes Cu(II) ions for identifying NO is the CuFL1 platform. The fluorescein dye in this particular scaffold has an aminoquinoline,a derivative of quinoline, which binds to Cu(II) and forms a 16-fold emission turn on. This reaction converts the secondary amine of the aminoquinoline into an N-nitrosated prdouct, which reinforces the fluorescence of the molecule; the increase in the intensity of fluorescence is based on the concentration of NO. The presence of NO in the Raw 264.7 macrophages and certain gram positive cells such as Bacillus subtilis and Bacillus anthracis has been identified with the CuFL probe.&lt;ref&gt;Pluth, M.D; Tomat, E.; Lippard, S. J. [http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-biochem-061009-091643?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed Biochemistry of Mobile Zinc and Nitric Oxide Revealed by Fluorescent Sensors.&quot;] Annu. Rev. Biochem. 80 (2011): 333-355.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fluorescent Markers in DNA Sequencing==
Fluorescent markers are often used in DNA studies to determine the sequences of bases in a strand. The upside to this method is that it does not utilize radioactive reagents as in the auto-radiography seen in Western blotting. As a result it has become a very popular method of DNA sequencing. In a method devised by Frederick Sanger and colleagues, DNA polymerase was used to create complementary strands to a single strand DNA molecule in four mixtures of radioactively labeled nucleotides. Incorporated into this synthesis was a mixture containing the 2',3'-dideoxy analog of a nucleotide, a different analog for each mixture. The 2',3'-dideoxy analog in the mixture causes the termination of DNA replication creating fragments. This is due to the analog having no 3' hydroxyl terminus to promote phosphodiester bonding. The mixtures then underwent electrophoresis allowing base sequences to be read through autoradiogram. With the use of fluorescent markers, a different colored tag is attached to the dideoxy analog of each base instead of having to be radioactively labeled. The fragments then undergo the same electrophoresis. The resulting bands are detected by their fluorescence and the sequence of colors subsequently translates into the sequence of the bases. With this method more than 1 million bases can be sequenced per day with modern sequencing tools.&lt;ref&gt;Berg, Jeremy M., Lubert Stryer, and John L. Tymoczko. Biochemistry. 6th ed. Boston: W. H. Freeman &amp; Company, 2007. 138-139.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fluorescent Protein Reporters==
Strategies are being developed for fluorescent protein (FP) reporters that &quot;speak&quot; the language of the cell and allows scientists to understand complex networks of biochemical processes that they were unable to witness before. There are three main types of FP's that are made currently. The first are ones that are bound to a protein to report its location and turnover, the second are ones created to undergo changes in fluorescent signal to allow scientists to know when there are changes or intermolecular interactions with the protein they are studying. Lastly, there are FP's that contain a sensory element which detects the accumulation or degradation of small molecules. These FP reporters are then used to understand the behavior of tagged signaling molecules and their spatiotemporal organization. 

In a normal signaling pathway receptors on the plasma membrane detect extracellular cues and mediate production of intracellular second messengers, these second messengers then regulate the activity of signaling enzymes and downstream transcription factors. These reporters allow scientists to see how a protein reacts in its natural environment, whether it diffuses across a membrane or needs a receptor on the membrane to send a message. These can be observed using a GFP whose fluorescence changes color with time or are photoactivatable,  This method allows for direct showing of molecules within cells responsible for the action being observed. The best part of FP's is their ability to remain discrete and not disturb pathways of cell function.&lt;ref&gt;Lippincott-Schwartz, J. &quot;Emerging In Vivo Analyses of Cell Function Using Fluorescence Imaging.&quot; Annu. Rev. Biochem. 80 (2011): 327-332.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hello and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]], a collection of open-content textbooks!

You should consider [[Special:Userlogin|creating an account or logging in]]. Here are some advantages:

* The use of a username of your choice.
* Greater security and privacy, as your IP address will be hidden from most users.
* You get your own personal user page and talk page, instead of having to share it.
* [[Special:Contributions/{{PAGENAME}}|Your contributions]] will be recognized as your own, and not confused with anyone else's.
* The use of your own watchlist which shows when pages you are interested in have been edited.
* Your opinions carry greater weight in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making|decision making process]].
* You become a recognized member of the Wikibooks community.
* Creating an account is easy and only takes a few minutes of your time, especially given the benefits.

We hope that you choose to become a Wikibookian and [[Special:Userlogin|create an account]].&lt;br/&gt;
Feel free to ask any questions on my talk page or in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]].&lt;br/&gt;
Be sure to sign your posts and comments on talk pages with four tildes (&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;),
this will let other editors know you said it.&lt;br/&gt;

| &lt;!-- this is so if anyone tries to use it where it doesn't go they will know. --&gt;

'''Gel-filtration chromatography''', also known as ''''''size exclusion chromatography'''''', ''''''molecular exclusion chromatography'''''' or ''''''molecular sieve chromatography'''''' is the simplest and mildest technique that separates molecules based on their size difference (hydrodynamic volume). This approach allows each polypeptide to be purified from other different sized polypeptides by passing through a gel filtration medium packed into the column. Unlike ion-exchange or affinity chromatography, fractions passing through the column do not bind to the chromatography medium. The big advantage of Gel-filtration chromatography is that the medium can be varied to suit the properties of a sample for further [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Purification|purifications]].  

When an organic solvent is used as a mobile phase, chemists tend to call it '''Gel permeation chromatography'''. The  [[Structural Biochemistry/Buffer|buffer]] or organic solvents used as the mobile phase are chosen based on the chemical and physical properties of the specific protein sample. The stationary phase of the column is simply the carbohydrate polymeric beads and the mobile phase goes through the stationary phase at a different speed depending upon the size of the molecule. This technique is used to analyze the molar mass distribution of organic-soluble polymers. It was invented by Grant Henry Lathe and Colin Ruthren who were working at Queen Charlotte's Hospital in London, United Kingdom. 

Gel-filtration chromatography can be applied in two different ways: for '''group separations''' and '''high resolution fractionation of biomolecules'''. The ''' group separation''' technique separates compounds in a sample into groups based on the size range. This technique is used for purification of a sample from high or low weight contaminants. The ''' high resolution fractionation of biomolecules ''' is a more precise technique. It can be used for isolation of one or more components in a sample, separation of monomers from aggregates, to determine molecular weight, or to perform molecular weight distribution analysis. Gel-filtration chromatography is very suitable for biomolecules which are very sensitive to pH changes, concentration of metal ions, or co-factors. 

Within the size range of molecules that are subjected to gel-filtration chromatography and are separated by a particular pore size of beads in the column, there is a linear relationship between the relative elution volume of a substance (i.e., the volume of the fractions in which the molecule is found)and the logarithm of its molecular mass (this is assuming that the molecules have similar shapes). If a given gel filtration column is calibrated with several proteins of known molecular mass, the mass of an unknown protein can be estimated by its elution position.

== Analogy ==
An analogy to understand (this is CONCEPTUAL, not even remotely a literal representation of what happens in ME chromatography) why gel filtration works is to picture several whiffle balls (or sponges or Swiss cheese-whatever cratered object works for you) suspended in a glass tank.  Now imagine that you have a mixture of sand, small marbles, and golf balls in a bucket; you dump it in.  As you watch, first the golf balls reach the floor of the tank, then the marbles, and finally a layer of sand settles.  Why?  Essentially all of the sand goes into the holes of the whiffle balls(or Swiss cheeses or sponges), and it tends to fall from the interior of one whiffle ball to the interior of another,  significantly slowing passage of the sand to the bottom of the tank.  The marbles are only slightly smaller than the holes in the whiffle ball, so they sometimes fall into the holes on the way down but also sometimes bounce off; again, the whiffle balls slow their progress, but to a lesser extent.  The golf balls are way too big to fit the holes of a whiffle ball, and so they push straight through the whiffle balls—the fastest and most direct route. 
Key: sand=small molecules; marbles=medium molecules; golf balls=large molecules; whiffle balls=porous beads; tank of water=column &amp; aqueous solution  

== General Procedure ==
 
The gel medium packed into the column is a porous matrix that consists of spherical beads, which have stable physical and chemical properties such as non-reactivity and lack of adsorption. The small molecules can enter the beads but the larger one cannot. The small molecules are distributed in the aqueous solution both inside and between the beads where as the large molecules are located in the solution between the beads. These beads are not soluble and are normally made from highly hydrated polymers such as dextran, agarose, or polyacrylamide. For commercial purposes, Sephadex, Sepharose, and Biogel are used. These commercial beads are about 100 miciro-meters in diameter and are used to separate proteins based on sized. Also, silica or cross-linked polystyrene can also be used as material for the beads under higher pressures. The pores and space between the particles is filled with a liquid buffer, which fills the entire column. The liquid filling the pore space is called a stationary phase and the liquid in the space between particles is a called mobile phase. Once the sample has been applied to the top of the column, it passes through the column along with the mobile phase from the top of the column to the bottom.  Smaller molecules are able to cross and go through these polymer beads but large ones are not able to. Therefore, small molecules in the column are both inside the polymer beads and between them, whereas large molecules can only travel between the polymer beads. Since less traveling space is allowed for the larger beads, they tend to move faster down the column and they emerge first at the end of the column. Think of it this way. The molecules traveling down the column represent a faucet. If the faucet has a smaller volume of space to allow the water to travel, the water will come out faster and with greater force. The same concept applies here as well. Since less volume is accessible to the bigger molecules, they move much faster through the column than smaller molecules do. So, since the small molecules are stuck inside the beads, they tend to move slower. Theoretically, molecules that have the same size should elute simultaneously. An elution diagram, or a chromatogram, can be constructed to verify complete separation. Before separation of unknown sample, solutions with known biomolecules can be run in order to make a calibration curve, which later can be used as a reference for identifying of unknown molecules.

==Utilization==

Gel-Filtration Chromatography is commonly used for analysis of synthetic and biological polymers such as nucleic acid, proteins, and polysaccharides. A downfall to this technique is that the stationary phase may also interact in an undesirable way with a molecule and affect its retention time. A major drawback to this method is its difficulty in producing a high-resolution image. An alternative to this may be Discontinuous Electrophoresis. Disc electrophoresis uses gels with different pHs and the proteins produce sharp bands when they go from one gel to the other, which creates high-resolution images.&lt;ref name=&quot;DiscElectro&quot;/&gt; This technique requires three different gels: the sample gel, the stacking gel, and the running gel. The proteins moves through the stacking gel and between the sample and running gels before the proteins enter them. This compresses the proteins and increases the resolution.&lt;ref name=&quot;gel&quot;/&gt;

Gel-Filtration Chromatography should not be confused with gel electrophoresis, where electricity is applied to create an electric field to separate molecules through the gel towards the electrode (anode and cathode) depending on their electric charge. Besides, large molecules in Gel-filtration Chromatography migrate down the column first whereas small molecules in gel electrophoresis migrate down the gel first.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
&lt;b&gt;High Pressure Liquid Chromatography&lt;/b&gt; (also known as &lt;b&gt;High Performance Liquid Chromatography&lt;/b&gt;, or simply &lt;b&gt;HPLC&lt;/b&gt;) is an enhanced form of column chromatography that is commonly used in biochemistry to separate and purify compounded samples.  Instead of the solvent dripping through the column as a result of gravity as is the case in other methods of chromatography, the solvent is pushed through with high pressures. 

The column materials of HPLC are much more neatly and greatly divided, and so there are more interaction opportunities and greater resolving (separating) power. Since the columns are made of materials of better quality, constant pressure must be applied to the column to obtain acceptable flow rates. Therefore, the final result is high resolution and very fast separation.

==History==
HPLC was developed and improved with new column technologies in the mid-1970's, replacing the other primeval column chromatographic techniques which failed when it came to quantifying and purifying similar compounds. Pressure liquid chromatography proved to be much less time consuming than the old methods. Compared with classical column chromatography, in which the columns are powered by gravity and a separation can take hours or even up to days, HPLC was able to produce results as fast as five to thirty minutes. 

HPLC was used frequently for the compound [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Purification|purification]] by the 1980's. Computers and other improved technology added to the convenience of HPLC. Improvements in the types of columns and consequently, reproducibility of HPLC, led to developments of micro-columns, affinity columns, and fast HPLC.

The past decade has seen a vast advancement in the development of micro-columns, now commonly used for HPLC, and other specialized columns. The diameter of the typical HPLC column is about 3-5 mm. But the usual diameter of micro-columns, or capillary columns, ranges from 3 µm to 200 µm, so it is considerably smaller. Fast HPLC utilizes a column that is shorter than the typical column, and so they are packed with smaller particles. 

These days, one has the option of considering several types of columns for the Purification of mixtures, as well as a variety of detectors to work with the HPLC in order to get the best possible analysis of the compound.

==Theory==
A small volume of the sample is put into the High-Pressure Liquid Chromatography where a mobile phase will move it through the stationary phase. The mobile phase is usually a gas or a liquid and the stationary phase is immobile and immiscible.  The stationary phase will slow down the flow of the sample because of it physical or chemical properties (size, net charge, or other differences depending on the type HPLC) where it will be filtered or purified. Because of the difference in how the stationary phase affects the impurities from the desired compound, the different components of the sample will come out at different times. The time that a component comes out of the column is called the retention time. The retention time should be unique to the component in the particular sample, so that no two components being analyzed elute at the same time and obscure each other. If solvent composition cannot be tweaked to effectively separate components in HPLC analysis, then a different type of chromatography might be better suited. HPLC, unlike other column chromatography techniques, uses pressure via pumps to push components through the more finely packed columns to speed up analysis and enable analysis of component and column combinations that take longer to elute on their own.

==Mobile Phase==

The mobile phase is a solvent or mixture of solvents that carries the sample through the stationary phase. As it moves through the stationary phase, molecular interactions between the sample's components and the column material determine the retention time of the different components. The components that have stronger interactions with the mobile phase than the column will &quot;prefer&quot; the mobile phase and elute quicker with a shorter retention time while components that have stronger interactions with the stationary phase than the solvent will &quot;prefer&quot; the column and elute slower with a longer retention time.  This is how HPLC separates, filters, and aids in purification of the compound. There are different techniques in regards to mobile phases that are tweaked to optimize retention time, separation, and peak clarity. These are isocratic, gradient, and polytyptic.

===Isocratic===

Isocratic elution involves a constant mobile phase composition. For example, a mobile phase of 50% acetonitrile and 50% water for a reversed phase HPLC (RP-HPLC) run that remains unchanged through the entire analysis. A solvent system is chosen and it will be used for the entire duration of the HPLC run. The sample is injected as the mobile phase flows through, enters the HPLC at a constant flow rate, and passes through the chosen column. This method is generally used when the sample being analyzed is simple enough that all the components of the sample come out at different times with sufficient clarity, and do not have impractically long retention times.

===Gradient===

Most samples are not so easy to work with. In these cases, a gradient elution method is set up. The mobile phase mixture will shift as the run proceeds, and the concentrations of the solvents are modified so that the run begins with the &quot;weaker&quot; solvent, and the &quot;stronger&quot; of the solvents will be the most concentrated at the end. One such example is a reversed phase HPLC run that begins with more mobile phase A, which is composed of a 95% water and 5% acetonitrile mixture, and will gradually increase mobile phase B, which is a 100% acetonitrile mixture, until at the end of the run the majority of mobile phase flowing through the column is mobile phase B. Usually for reversed phase HPLC, the mobile phase will begin with the more polar solvent combination and increase the concentration of the less polar solvent combination as the run proceeds. This is so that the less polar molecules (relative to the mobile phase and stationary phase being used) will eventually elute due to a higher concentration of a less polar solvent and the necessary run time for the analysis can be shortened. An isocratic mobile phase can have a polarity too close to the stationary phase, resulting in components eluting out together immediately and their peaks overlapping, or a polarity too different from the nonpolar stationary phase, resulting in nonpolar components taking too long to elute. This is why a gradient mobile phase is often used in analysis, where concentration of less-polar to more-polar solvents can be modified to obtain optimal peak separation. 

===Polytyptic===

The polytptic elution, also known as mixed-mode chromatography, involves the use of a special column that can switch modes of analysis depending on the solvent. The same column can perform size exclusion, ion exchange, or affinity chromatography depending on the type of solvent that flows through it.

==Retention Time==

Retention times depend on the interaction of the component of the sample, the mobile phase, and the stationary phase to each other. Therefore, a well-designed HPLC run relies on choosing the correct type of column for the analysis desired and the right combination of mobile phases for the analyte and the column.

==Column Efficiency==

Column efficiency describes how well the stationary phase filters or purifies, basically how packed it is and how well things move along it. There are a couple of ways to measure column efficiency but they all use the same formula:&lt;center&gt;'''&lt;br/&gt;N=at&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/W&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;'''
&lt;br/&gt;'''N'''=number of theoretical plates
&lt;br/&gt;'''a'''=constant that depends on the height of a graph
&lt;br/&gt;t&lt;sub&gt;'''r'''&lt;/sub&gt;=retention time
&lt;br/&gt;'''W'''=width of a peak
&lt;/center&gt;

==Applications of HPLC==
===Normal phase chromotography===
'''Normal phase chromatography''', or '''NP-HPLC''' is the first kind of HPLC developed. In this method a polar stationary phase and a non-polar mobile phase is used in order to separate analytes based on their polarity. Since the polar phase is stationary, polar analytes will bind to that phase. Their adsorption strength and elution time depend on the strength of the analyte polarity and the analyte’s steric factors. Since the elution time depends on steric clashes, it is then possible to differentiate and separate structural isomers since each isomer has a different steric clash. One can increase the elution time by adding a non-polar solvent to the non-polar mobile phase. One can also able to decrease the retention time of the analytes by adding polar substances to the non-polar mobile phase and even occupy the stationary phase surface preventing the polar analytes from binding to the polar surface. 
&lt;br/&gt;In the past, this method is unfavorable due to the fact that water or protic organic solvents changed the hydration sate of the media in the system. However, this problem was solved with another version of '''NP-HPLC''' called '''hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography''', which uses a variety of phases that had better retention times.

===Reversed phase chromotography===

'''Reverse phase chromatography''', as the name suggests, is the opposite of normal phase chromatography, where it now has a non-polar stationary phase and a polar mobile phase. Consequently, the non-polar analytes will bind to the non-polar phase, and its elution time will also depend on how non-polar it is. One can still also increase the elution time by adding a polar solvent to the mobile phase or decrease the elution time by adding a non-polar solvent to the same phase. However, unlike NP-HPLC, the method depends on hydrophobic interactions. 

Some factors can influence hydrophobic interactions. One of those factors is surface area. An analyte with a larger hydrophobic surface area would consequently have a longer retention time since there would be more bonds interacting between the analyte and the non-polar surface. However, too large of an analyte surface won’t be able to enter the pores of the non-polar phase and have no interactions with the phase. This strengthening in bonds is also due to the force of water for “cavity-reduction” around the analyte, and the energy released in this process depends on the surface tension of the eluent, which in this case is water. 

Another factor that can affect the hydrophobic interactions is the pH. An ideal environment is one that is uncharged. As a result, chemists use buffering agents, such as sodium phosphate, to regulate the pH and neutralize the charge on exposed media, which usually is composed of silica, on the stationary phase and the charge on the analyte. 

Reverse phase columns are stronger than normal silica columns, but still have some weaknesses. Aqueous bases shouldn’t be used with columns consisting of alkyl derivatized silica particles since the base will destroy the underlying silica particle. Also, if an aqueous acid is used, it should be exposed too long to the column in order to prevent corrosion.

===Gel filtration===
'''Gel-filtration chromatography''' separates proteins based on differing in size. The process involves a gel in a buffer solution that is packed into a column. This gel has many porous carbohydrate polymer bead-like particles. The size of the pores is selected so that it can only allow proteins with a certain size to diffuse through them. The movement of the molecules that are small enough to enter through the pores of the beads is then slowed down because it is forced to enter the stationary phase of the column. The larger molecules on the other hand, end up moving through the column faster because they cannot enter the internal volume of the beads. 

The most important advantage of '''gel-filtration chromatography''' is its ability to separate the proteins in its original, non-denatured condition, giving you a sample that is in a suitable form for possible further analysis. Another advantage as well is the high resolution that is obtained by applying pressure into the column to get adequate flow.  Improved resolution is achieved with slower flow rates. An optimum flow rate for [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|protein]] fractionation of approximately 5mL/cm2/h is recommended for most gels.

===Ion exchange===
'''Ion-exchange chromatography''' separates proteins based on their charge. It is efficient enough to be able to resolve proteins that differ only by one single charged group. It depends on the formation of ionic bonds between the charged groups on the proteins and an ion-exchange gel carrying the opposite charge in a column. Proteins that do not have an electrical charge and are neutral are removed by washing. Those proteins that can form ionic bonds, though, are recovered by elution with a buffer of either higher ionic strength or changing pH. An increase in oppositely charged ions (those of the protein being analyzed and those of the gel medium) increases the retention time, which is based on the attraction between the protein ions and charged ions of the gel medium. 

There are two types of ion-exchangers. One is the anion exchanger, which has positively charged groups that are stationary in a gel-medium and will interact and bind to negatively charged ions in the protein. The other is the cation exchanger, which has negatively charged groups that are stationary in a gel-medium as well but interact and bind to positively charged ions in the protein.

The pH of the solution can also alter how the ionization process between the protein ions and the ions in the gel-medium. When the pH is equal to the isoelectric point of the protein (the point where the net charge is zero). However, when the pH is less than the isolectric point, the net electric charge on the protein will be positive and it will bind to the cation exchangers. Finally, if the pH is greater than the isoelectric point, the net charge on the protein will be negative and it will bind to the anion exchangers. Therefore, by controlling the pH of the solution we can control how the protein gets separated since it is these exchangers that separate the protein

===Affinity chromatography===

[[Category:Structural Biochemistry|High Pressure Liquid chromatography]]

'''Affinity chromatography''' is the method of the separation of biochemical mixtures, based on a highly specific biologic interaction. It is used to purify a molecule from a mixture and concentrate it into a buffering solution, and also to recognize what biological compounds bind to another molecule, like drugs. It was discovered in 1968 by Pedro Cuatrecasas and Meir Wilcheck.

The process involves the trapping of the target protein (or molecule) that one wants separated from the mixture onto a solid or a medium. A column is filled with beads that contain covalent glucose residues, which are chosen to correspond with the target protein. The proteins will travel down through the beads as they are poured into the column, and when the target protein is recognized, it will get trapped to the column by covalent bonds due to its affinity for glucose. The rest of proteins will run down the column and become successfully separated. The portion of buffer will be added to the column to wash out the unbounded protein. Lastly, a concentrated solution of glucose is added to separate the target protein from the column-attached glucose residues, resulting with the protein being completely purified out of the mixture.

'''Adsorption Chromatography'''

Adsorption, meaning the accumulation of solutes of the surface of a solid or liquid, chromatography is useful in separating a mixture of solutes based on their different polarities. It is based on the notion that  polar solute will form a tighter bond with the polar stationary phase than a less polar solute will. 
An insoluble, polar material like silica gel (a derivative of silica gel, Si(OH)¬4) is filled into a glass column, making it the stationary phase. The sample containing the mixture is the mobile phase, which can be a liquid or gas, is poured onto the glass column, where each solute with a different polarity will bind differently to the solute. The polar solutes will bind tightly to the stationary phase, the less polar ones will bind more loosely, and the neutral ones will pass right through the column. The solute can be eluted with solvents of progressively higher polarity, where the solutes will be eluted with increasing polarity. So, neutral solutes will pass right through the column, the less polar ones will be eluted first, and very polar solutes will be eluted last.

Immunology deals largely with the interactions between [[Structural Biochemistry/Protein function/Antibodies|'''antibodies''']] and '''antigens'''. However, immunological techniques can be used for protein research. Antibodies are highly specific to their target proteins, thus making it possible to tag a certain [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|protein]] for further in depth studies.

Immunological techniques can be utilized to make the polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies used in protein identification.

      <text xml:space="preserve">NMM spectroscopy is unique in being able to reveal the atomic structure of macromolecules in solution, provided that highly concentrated solution can be obtained. This technique depends on the fact that certain atomic nuclei are intrinsically magnetic. The chemical shift of nuclei depends on their local environment. Furthermore, the spins of neighboring nuclei interact with each other in ways that provide definitive structural information. This information can be used to determine complete three-dimensional structures of proteins. 
== General Information ==
'''Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (NMR)''' is an analytical technique which exploits the fact that certain nuclei possess a property called spin (I). NMR spectroscopy is possible due to the Zeeman Effect discovered first in the 1890s. The structures of proteins can be determined by NMR by first preparing the isotopically labeled samples. In the magnet, the &quot;natural magnets&quot; in the atoms of the sample line up with the magnetic field of the NMR magnet. Then, the sample is exposed to a series of radio wave pulses to disrupt the magnetic equilibrium of the atoms. The reaction of these nuclei can be observed to assess their chemical nature specifically, their chemical shift properties. Sets of experiments can be conducted to refine possible structures and present the average of the experiments as the final structure. It can have advantages over X-ray crystallography because the samples of proteins can be in solution rather than crystallized form and other properties of the sample protein, such as flexibility and interactions, can be determined while X-ray crystallography only reveals the structure of the protein. 
It is the splitting of atomic energy levels when the atoms are placed in a magnetic field. This effect was later found to occur as a result of nuclear spin. In 1924, Wolfgang Pauli first suggested the theoretical basis of NMR when he concluded that some atomic nuclei should possess nuclear spin and these nuclei would split into degenerate energy levels when placed in a magnetic field. These nuclei have a magnetic moment, in and of themselves, which is called spin. Nuclei that possess spin are said to be NMR active. Some NMR active nuclei can be seen in Table 1, with italicized nuclei being those commonly studied in biological molecules. [[Image:NMR Active nuclei.jpg|500px|thumb|Table 1 NMR active nuclei]]

Separately, Bolch at Stanford and Purcell at Harvard in 1946 each translated the Zeeman effect into the first NMR spectrum. In 1949, Proctor and Yu at Stanford measured the first chemical shift and spin couplings. Initially, commercial NMR spectrometers were continuous wave type and were only able to detect the most sensitive nuclei, 1H &amp; 19F. 
NMR ‘active’ nuclei are active if the nuclear spin, I, is non zero.

To determine spin of nuclei:

Mass # is even and # neutrons is even, I=0, therefore no spin

Mass # is even and # neutrons is odd, I= integer, therefore spin

Mass # is odd and # neutrons is even or odd, I=half integer, therefore spin

The cause of spin can be visualized with the following analogy. A rotating charged particle (e.g. hydrogen nucleus aka proton) will produce a magnetic field perpendicular to the direction of rotation which is analogous to the magnetic field of a bar magnet, as seen in Figure 1.
[[Image:Spinning proton magnetic field lines.jpg|500px|thumb|Figure 1]]

Absent an external magnetic field (B¬0) these active nuclei are oriented in random directions, but in the presence of an external magnetic field (B¬0) these nuclei orient themselves either with or against the field, as seen in Figure 2.
[[Image:Nuclei in and out of magnetic field.jpg|500px|thumb|Figure 2]]

Nuclei are dispersed between states of different energies. The different energy levels are induced by the presence of the external magnetic field (B¬0). (For spin ½ nuclei two orientations are possible, with the higher energy orientation being ‘β spin state’ and the lower energy orientation being ‘α spin state’.)  This is evident in the following equation where E=energy, h=Planck’s constant, ν=frequency, γ=gyromagnetic ratio (nucleus dependent), B0= external magnetic field:

ΔE= h ν = γ B0  

To see this graphically see Figure 3.

[[Image:Magnetic field induced energy levels.jpg|500px|thumb|Figure 3]]

These induced energy level differences are what allow the use of NMR. At equilibrium, nuclei will occupy both levels of energy, low and high. However, according to the Maxwell-Boltzmann Distribution, the lower energy level will be occupied by a greater number of nuclei. This difference in the number of nuclei, between low and high energy levels, is what NMR exploits. The energy required to cause a spin flip, transition from low to high energy state, corresponds to the radio frequency range of the electromagnetic spectrum. 
ΔE= h ν
A nucleus will only flip spins, absorb energy, when the frequency of electromagnetic radiation just matches the change in energy, ΔE.  This is called the point of resonance. Nuclei will have differing resonant frequencies based on their local electronic environment. This can be seen in “A handmade example of a proton (1H) NMR spectrum.”  All nuclei under observation are irradiated with radio waves to the higher energy state and are then allowed to decay back to the lower energy state. This decay is what is observed. A free induction decay signal is collected as the nuclei fall back to the lower energy state, Figure 4 depicts a generic FID.

[[Image:FID generic.jpg|500px|thumb|Figure 4]]

This FID is then subjected to a Fourier transform to convert from the time domain to the frequency domain, seen in Figure 5.
[[Image:NMR spectrum generic.jpg|500px|thumb|Figure 5]]

A change in the magnitude of the magnetic field will change the resonant frequency of the nucleus. Therefore, in order to compare spectra between instruments with varying size magnetic strength it is necessary to convert from frequency to parts per million, ppm. This can be done with the equation seen in Figure 6.
[[Image:Frequency to ppm.jpg|500px|thumb|Figure 6]]

With the arrival of Fourier Transform instruments in the 1970s it became possible to acquire spectra of nuclei that are not naturally abundant, such as 13C which is only 1.1% naturally occurring. This requires the acquisition of multiple spectra and adding them together to get a greater sensitivity. The signal to noise ratio (S/N) will increase as acquisitions increase, because the signal magnitude increases linearly with acquisition number while the noise magnitude increases as the square of the number acquisitions. So, the S/N will increase as the square of the number of acquisitions as seen in Figure 7.
[[Image:Signal to noise.jpg|500px|thumb|Figure 7]]

The Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2002 went partly to Kurt Wuthrich for “NMR Studies of Structure and Function of Biological Macromolecules,”[1] so NMR is important to structural biochemistry. Table 2 lists Noble prizes awarded for discoveries related to NMR spectroscopy.

NMR is a powerful technique that can be used to determine the structure of [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|proteins]] in highly concentrated solution, by analyzing the relative positions of certain atoms (Shriner 136). Protein NMR exploits the absence of zero net nuclear spin of the most abundant isotopes of carbon and oxygen (12 and 16) as well as the abundant isotope of Nitrogen (14) with a net nuclear spin of 1. NMR cannot be performed on an atom with zero net nuclear spin. Since there are many distinct nuclei present in a single protein much overlap is expected in the chemical shifts produced through the NMR analysis therefore a multidimensional approach is applied. Magnetization is applied to the protein and nuclei through electromagnetic pulses that can magnetize nuclei in two ways. The first involving magnetization through nuclei bonding and the second through open space. Each approach offers a different way to analyze the protein such as the first approach allowing for distinct nuclei to be targeted whereas the second approach allowing for structure calculation distance restraints and targeting an unlabeled protein. 

Intrinsically magnetic nuclei display spinning properties that produce a magnetic moment. When an external magnetic field is applied to the system the magnetic moment can adopt either an alpha or beta state. The strength of the magnetic field determines the proportionality of alpha to beta with a tendency to favor alpha as it is aligned with the field and has a lower energy. By supplying an electromagnetic pulse alpha spin nuclei will change to beta and produce resonance. By keeping a constant magnetic field on the system and adjusting the frequency of the electromagnetic pulses a spectrum of resonance can be obtained. 

Currently, NMR spectrometers use the Fourier transform method of pulse radiation. To change the nuclei in alpha state to beta, a strong pulse of radiation is used. Then the pulse of radiation is removed and the nuclei go back to their original alpha state, giving a decay signal. This signal is converted by the computer to a frequency domain spectrum in a very fast way. By storing many signals a more intense spectrum is produced. (Shriner 136)

Electrons around a magnetic nucleus produces a local magnetic field opposite to the applied magnetic field. Magnetic nuclei can absorb the electromagnetic pulses at specific frequencies coined &quot;chemical shifts&quot; (signal positions) expressed in parts per million (ppm). These chemical shifts are designated relative to a standard compound such as a derivative of tetramethylsilane (TMS) (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Si (which has a chemical shift of 0.0) that is soluble in water. NMR spectra that are produced through this assay can be analyzed, and with the combination of a multidimensional analysis the structure of the protein can be determined.

When an atomic nuclei is influenced by a magnetic field, it creates a magnetic moment which will give an orientation of spinning to itself. Different orientation of spinning, spin states, exist in different states of energy - alpha-state and beta-state - where alpha-state is found to be more stable with a lower energy through experiments as it has the same direction with the magnetic field. In order to transits alpha-state to beta-state (excited state), pulse of electromagnetic radiation is needed to increase the frequency of the electromagnetic radiation (through irradiation) to have the spinning nucleus to overcome the energy barrier and change its orientation. (See [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bohr_model Bohr Model] for more information) Thus, resonance will be obtained. It was discovered by American physicist Edward Mills Purcell and physicist Felix Bloch from Switzerland in 1946.

The difference between energy levels split by a magnetic field corresponds to the energy of radio waves. So, the electronics required for the NMR spectrometer weren’t developed until WWII when the government invested heavily into radar technology. Radar is simply the use of radio waves to detect location and direction of moving objects. Better frequency synthesizers, amplifiers, receivers and signal processors all contributed to advancements in the field of NMR spectroscopy. 
The components of a NMR Spectrometer can be seen in Figure 8.

==Magnets used for NMR==

The magnets used for NMR are very strong. Those used for high resolution protein structure determination range from 500 megahertz to 900 megahertz and generate magnetic fields thousands of times stronger than the Earth’s. Although the sample is exposed to a strong magnetic field, very little magnetic force gets out of the machine. 
NMR magnets are superconductors, so they must be cooled with liquid helium, which is kept at 4 Kelvin. Liquid nitrogen, which is kept at 77 Kelvin, helps keep the liquid helium cold.

== Appropriate Isotopes ==
Only certain isotopes are capable for use in NMR. The most common isotope that is used in NMR is Carbon-14, which is typically used for archaeological and radioactive dating. Other commonly used isoptopes are Carbon-13 and Nitrogen-15.  

== Vector Model ==
The Vector Model only holds for uncoupled spins. Nuclei that are active under NMR spectroscopy have associated with them a nuclear spin magnetic mooment, which means that these nuclei produce a small magnetic field. When these nuclei are placed in a magnetic field the energy of the interaction depends on the angle between the field and the magnetic moment. The highest energy interaction is when the magnetic field and the magnetic moment point in opposite directions, and the lowest energy interaction  is when the magnetic field and magnetic moment point in the same direction. 
Before a magnetic field is applied to a population of nuclei the magnetic moments of these nuclei are oriented randomly due to random thermal motion. After a magnetic field is applied one has to wait for the spins to come to equilibrium, a process known as relaxation. Pointing in the direction of the magnetic field is slightly energetically favored, and hence only a very small number of spins will do so, forming the bulk magnetization vector. The sample is hence magnetized. At equilibrium the bulk magnetization vector will point in the direction of the magnetic field (we will assume this is the z direction) and will be stationery. If the magnetization vector was tilted away from the axis it would precess at the Larmor frequency (-gyromagnetic ratio * magnetic field). 
The purpose of a pulse is to quickly change the direction of the magnetization vector. This can be done by creating a much weaker magnetic field in the direction one desires, but allowing it to oscillate at the aforementioned Larmor frequency. This will result in the magnetization vector pointing in the direction one desires. This occurs because when the B1 field (the weaker field) oscillates near the Larmor Frequency, the result is that the strength of the B0 field (the stronger field in the z direction) appears to be reduced. Hence the resulting magnetic field (the effective field) can point very close to the direction of the B1 field if the B1 field is much larger than the reduced field.
An on resonance pulse involves changing the direction of the magnetization vector by applying the B1 field in a certain direction for a specific time. The angle through which the magnetization vector is rotated is given as the product of the frequency of the effective field and the time the pulse is applied. By applying different times one can rotate the magnetization vector to different angles.
For a real NMR experiment there are going to be more than one resonance frequencies in the sample. If one makes the B1 field strong enough it is possible to bring the magnetization vector very close to the desired orientation, which means we can bring it close to the ideal case of an on resonance pulse. 
The vector model can be used to understand simple NMR experiments.

== Chemical shifts ==
'''Chemical shifts''' are the units used in Protein NMR analysis graphs. Chemical shift correlates to the different radiofrequency electromagnetic pulses sent through the protein sample. Each molecule that exhibits spin properties show different distinct chemical shifts. Chemical shifts can be observed by sending nuclear magnetic energy onto the protein sample. The electron clouds that surround each spin nuclei create a local magnetic field that opposes the applied magnetic field. When the electromagnetic pulse runs through the sample alpha spin nuclei that are hit with the correct amount of energy to switch to beta spin do so and subsequently cause resonance. This resonance can then be recorded and is reported for the different frequencies applied to sample as parts per million (ppm chemical shifts). For example, when the nuclear magnetic field strength sends out a frequency of 1 ppm (parts per million), CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; reacts to it and exhibits beta spin behavior from which the spectroscopy catches this signal and records it.

Most hydrogen absorptions in 300-MHz 1H NMR fall within a range of 3000&amp;nbsp;Hz. Rather than record the exact frequency of each resonance, we measure it relative to an internal standard, the compound tetramethylsilane, (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Si. Its 12 equivalent hydrogens are shielded relative to those in most organic molecules, resulting in a resonance line conveniently removed from the usual spectral range.
A problem with these numbers, however, is that they vary with the strength of the applied magnetic field. Because field strength and resonance frequency are directly proportional, doubling or tripling the field strength will double or triple the distance (in hertz) of the observed peaks relative to (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Si. To make it easier to compare reported literature spectra, we standardize the measured frequency by dividing the distance to (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Si (in hertz) by the frequency of the spectrometer. This procedure yields a field-independent number, the chemical shift δ.

== NMR in Characterizing Organometallics ==
NMR spectra uses superconducting magnets to many metal nuclei. Carbon 13 NMR has become increasingly useful in facilitating due to its low natural abundance and low sensitivity for NMR experiment. The integration of NMR peaks of organometallic complexes can provide the ratio of atoms in different environments. Since the relaxation times of the carbon atoms vary in organometallics, a great deal of inaccuracy result from this. However it does have its advantages as well. For example, terminal carbonyl peaks are frequently in the range of 195 to 225ppm, which allows it to be easily distinguished from other ligands. The 13C chemical shift correspond with the strength of the CO bond. The stronger the bond, the smaller the chemical shift. 13C in cyclopentadienyl ligands have a wide range of chemical shifts in paramagnetic compounds whereas it's narrower for diamagnetic compounds.

== Nuclei Spin States ==
In NMR, certain atomic nuclei must be magnetic by nature in order for this technique to be used. However, only a certain number of isotopes have this magnetic characteristic called spin. An example is hydrogen. When an external magnetic field is applied, hydrogen's spinning proton generates a magnetic moment which can take either the α or β spin state. The energy difference between the two states is directly proportional to the amount of external magnetic field applied. The α state is aligned with the applied field and has lower energy than the β state. When a pulse of electromagnetic radiation is applied to the α state, it can be excited to the β state, thus a resonance will be obtained.    

The NMR is only able to detect certain atoms and only certain isotopes.  For example, it can detect the Hydrogen molecules with a mass of 1 amu, but not the other isotopes.  Most commonly the Hydrogen and Carbon NMR's are used.  The information that can be determined by the NMR is immense.  In the case of the Hydrogen NMR, one can use a certain amount of knowledge from a table to determine what each peak corresponds to which group within your sample.  Interpreting NMR's can also be a little tricky in that one must understand splitting patterns.  For example, the carbon atom you may be examining may have only one hydrogen attached, however if attached to a methyl group, it will appear as a quartet.

==Shielding and Deshielding==

Protons in different chemical environments are shielded by different amounts. When a nucleus surrounded by electrons is exposed to a magnetic field of strength H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,these electrons move in such a way as to generate a small local magnetic field, h&lt;sub&gt;local&lt;/sub&gt;, opposing H&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. As a consequence, the total field strength near the hydrogen nucleus is reduced, and the nucleus is thus said to be shielded from the magnetic field strength by its electron cloud. The degree of shielding depends on the amount of electron density surrounding the nucleus. dding electrons increases shielding; their removal, consequently, would cause deshielding. Also, a proton is deshielded when the induced field reinforces the applied field. For example, the induced field can reinforce the applied field. As a result, these protons are deshielded and their chemical shifts are at a higher value of ppm.

==Coupling==

'''J-coupling''' arises from the interaction of different spin states through the chemical bonds of a molecule and results in the splitting of NMR signals. This coupling provides detailed information about the connectivity of atoms and the structure of a molecule. 
Spin-spin slitting is given by the '''N+1 Rule''': 1) H that is neighbored by one H resonnate as a doublet.2) H that is neighbored by two set of equivalent Hs resonate as trplet. 3) H that is neighbored by three equivalents of hydrogens resonate as a quartet.

A multiplet can be shown when there is a mixture of couple patterns, some of which could be broken down to small parts (i.e. qd- quartet of doublet). But for the most part, if a coupling pattern shows complexity not easily countable by N+1 rule, such pattern is called a multiplet. 
In addition, functional groups containing alcohol (-OH) such as alcohol, carboxylic acid have a broad band on NMR spectra. This is due to the fact that Hydrogens on alcohol can hydrogenbond easily, thus being able to couple in broad spectra than other H's. Thus just by looking at the type of the spectra (such as multiple peaks or broad peak), one can easily categorize the functional group to which the H is associated with.

The ratio of the splitting peaks is given by a mathematical mnemonic device called Pascal's triangle. Each number in this triangle is the sum of the two numbers closest to it in the line above. It is important to remember that nonequivalent nuclei mutually split one another. In other words, the observation of one split absorption necessitates the presence of another split signal in the spectrum. Moreover, the coupling constants for these pattern must be the same. Double and triple bond characteristic chemical environments show complex splitting peaks. An alkyne for example, can have hydrogen splitting patterns an extra adjacent carbon away. An alkene depending on where the hydrogen is located (cis or trans) to a relative chemical environment, can show a slightly distorted peak.

==Integration==
'''Integration''' is very useful in NMR spectrum in determining the structure of a molecule. The relative integrated intensity of a signal is proportional to the relative number of nuclei giving rise to that absorption. Normally, a NMR spectrum plot you get will tell you very complex integration numbers. However, integration doesn’t have to be exact. You can just divide each integration number by the smallest number in your NMR spectrum. The ratio is would help you get a big picture of the relative number of H’s represented by a peak. Combining the chemical shifts and the peak integration, you might be able to determine the structure of a molecule by using the ''chemical shift table''.
Researchers usually use NMR to check if the product they make from a reaction is what they really want. So they don’t have to figure out the structure of a molecule by looking at a complex spectrum. They know what the spectrum should look like if the reaction works. By comparing the actual spectrum to the ideal one, they are able to verify the molecule they want is in the product. Solvent used is usually CD&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, since D would not show up in a H NMR spectrum. Combine with chemical shifts, they can be used to determine structure.
== Proton NMR interpretation ==
To interpret proton NMR, it is important to know where each type of proton lies. Below is a list of types of proton and their chemical shift on NMR.

[[Image:Table HNMR.jpg|Proton NMR frequency]]

It is important to know that proton NMR peaks only indicate the presence of protons (H). It does not show other atoms like Carbon, Oxygen...etc. As mentioned in the above section, proton peaks shows spliting because of coupling by the neighbor protons. The integration of each peak is the amount of proton relative to other proton on the NMR. When solving structure from the H NMR, it is important to write down the chemical shift, integration and the split of each peak. Then base on the chemical shift of the peak, write down the possible functional group and structure. Lastly, arrange and connect each structure so that it matches the split and the integration of proton NMR. Below are examples of hand drawn proton NMR and also the detail instruction to interprete proton NMR. 

=== Example ===

The interpretation of each proton NMR is given right below of each graph. Try not to look at the structure, and only look at the molecular formula and proton NMR to interpret the structure of the compound.  Note that the examples given are the basic and simple compound. The NMR of protein structures is much more complex than these examples. The goal of these examples is to give you an idea how proton NMR are interpreted. 

[[Image:ethyl acetate NMR.jpg|Proton NMR]]

Base on the chemical shift of proton NMR, there should be a ketone functional group or a structure that contains a carbonyl group at peak around 2.0. The peak around 1.3 could be a primary or secondary alkyl group. 

Now look at the splitting of the peaks at chemical shift 1.3 (C), the triplet (3 peaks) shows that the proton is probably split by 2 neighbor protons (base on the n+1 rule mention in integration section). If it is split only by 1 neighbor proton, then it would be a doublet (2 peaks). Next, look at the peak at chemical shift 2.0 (B). The singlet (single peak) means that this proton environment probably has no neighbor proton. The peak at chemical shift 4.2 (A) is a quadruplet (4 peaks). This means there are about 3 neighbor proton next to proton environment A. Since it is known that B has no proton right next to it, and A and C both has neighbor protons, it is safe to assume that proton environment A is right next to proton environment C, which could be a -CH2CH3.
The following possible structures deduced above are a ketone and an ethyl group.

[[Image:ethyl acetate nmr1.jpg|possible proton structures]]

Note that the there are two oxygen atoms from the molecular formula. One of the oxygen is included in ketone. The other oxygen must be binding onto one of these two structures. Take a look at peak A, the chemical shift is near 4.0, which means it might be connected to a heteroatom like oxygen. Place the oxygen next to the -CH2CH3 and connect the structure together, you will get ethyl acetate as indicated below the proton NMR. Notice that the proton B does not have any neighbor proton. Proton A is split into 4 peaks by proton C (n+1 rule, n = 3 neighbor protons). Proton C is split into 3 peaks by proton A (n = 2 neighbor protons). The CH2, secondary alkyl, base on the proton frequency table should be around the chemical shift ~1.2 ppm, but instead it is at ~4.2 ppm. The reason for this is that the CH2 is attached to oxygen a heteroatom, which is a electron withdrawing group. The result is that the chemical shift is pulled left field resulting in a chemical shift of 4.2 ppm. Another way to look at this is to assume there is an ester functional group at chemical shift of 4.2 ppm, and the primary alkyl group is attached to the ester.
The integration of the proton NMR also matches the structure well. The methyl CH3 next to the carbonyl group has 3 protons, and the primary alkyl next to the CH2 has 3 protons as well. This explains why peak B has the same height as peak C (same amount of protons). Peak A has the lowest height because it only has two protons.

[[Image:3-methoxyphenol NMR.jpg|proton NMR]]
This proton NMR example looks more complicated than the first one, but it is actually easier. One important information from this proton NMR is that there are peaks around 6.0~ 7.0 ppm (F,B,D,E). This always almost indicates the presence of aromatic ring. Noticed that there are about 4 group of peaks from 6.0 to 7.0 ppm? This means that there are four protons attach to 4 carbons on the aromatic ring. This leaves 2 carbons of the armatic ring free to attach to two substituents. The position of these substituents is clearly an ortho and para position on the aromatic ring. The reason is that two different substituents on ortho and para position of the aromatic ring would give 4 proton environments. If there are only two proton environments around 6.0~ 8.0 ppm with the same integration (height), it means that the aromatic ring is probably symmetric on both sides with double para substituents. Now look at the peak (A) at 5.5 ppm. The peak is a broad peak instead of sharp peak like the rest. This means that the proton of this environment is attached to a heteroatom. The only heteroatom present in the sample base on the molecular formula given is an oxygen atom. This means that the proton is directly attached to oxygen, which would be a alcohol group -OH (Note that the proton on the alcohol group can have the chemical shift range from 0.5 to 5.0 ppm). It is important to remember that the proton that attached to a heteroatom is also known as exchangeable proton. Exchangeable proton sometimes do not show up on H NMR, so do not worry when an expected exchangeable peak doesn’t appear on HMNR. 
The peak (C) at the chemical shift of ~3.9 ppm has the highest integration (height) and is a singlet. Usually when such a high singlet peak is observed around 3.9 ppm with oxygen in the molecular formula, there is a high chance that it is a ether group, -OCH3. Since there is no neighbor proton next to the CH3 of the ether, it is a singlet peak. In addition, the height of the peak is high compare to the other peak, which indicate a possibility of CH3 with at least 3 times more protons than other proton environment. Base on the interpretations above, these are the possible function groups:
[[Image:3-methoxyphenol NMR1.jpg|possible proton structures]]

Attach the alcohol group and the ether group in ortho- para position will result in the correct structure of the compound.

== Nuclear Overhauser Enhancement Spectroscopy (NOESY) ==
[[File:Noesy.jpg|thumb|NOESY Spectrum of Codeine. Each peak correlates to a proton.]]

'''NOESY''' is a NMR technique that uses the Nuclear Overhauser effect to help understand the tertiary structure of proteins and other large molecules. The nuclear Overhauser effect is the interaction of nuclei at short distances from each other. The extent of the effect is approximately 5 Angstroms. This is a better analysis of tertiary structure for proteins that do not form crystalline structures and need to be analyzed in solution.  Like in NMR, a magnetic field is produced around the molecule and RF waves at different frequencies are produced to produce resonance. The resonance is produced when the nucleus reverses spin. Unlike normal NMR, the aim of NOESY is to determine the effect of the resonance of one nucleus on the other nuclei in the area. The graph that is produced gives you an idea of where the nuclei are in relation to each other. 

The NOESY experiment reveals the distance of protons relative to one another. Protons very close to each other, (about 3 Angstroms apart) will produce a very large signal. The limit of detection is about 5-6 Angstroms apart, and will produce only a very weak signal. 

The graph has diagonal dots correspond to the placement of the nuclei on the one dimensional NMR. There are dots out side of this diagonal spectrum. These dots show what nuclei are in close proximity of each other. If a line was drawn horizontally and vertically from the outlaying dots, the dots, on the diagonal spectrum, that lay on the lines would be in close proximity to each other. Using the information from the NMR and the NOESY a tertiary structure of the macromolecules could be formed. However, the resulting tertiary structure would contain a family of structures. This happened for three reasons. The first is the approximation of the distance between the nuclei. Second, there may not have been enough constraints to produce a singular structure. Thirdly, the protein is in solution, and the solution contains many proteins.

This technique is mainly used for hydrogen atoms, because they are the most abundant atom in biological systems and are also the simplest.

==Protein NMR==

An NMR machine is essentially a huge magnet.  Many atoms are essentially little magnets.  When placed inside an NMR machine, all the little magnets orient themselves to line up with the big magnet.  By harnessing this law of physics, NMR spectroscopists are able to figure out physical, chemical, electronic, and structural information about molecules.

NMR relies on the interaction between an applied magnetic field and the natural “little magnets” in certain atomic nuclei.  For protein structure determination, spectroscopists concentrate on the atoms that are most common in proteins: hydrogen, carbon, and nitrogen.  What researchers seek to learn through NMR is how this chain of amino acids wraps and folds around itself to create the three-dimensional, active protein.  Solving a protein structure using NMR is a series of experiments, each of which provides partial clues about the nature of the atoms in the sample molecule, such as how close two atoms are to each other, whether these atoms are physically bonded to each other, or where the atoms lie within the same amino acid.  Other experiments show links between adjacent amino acids or reveal flexible regions in the protein.  Each new set of experiments further refines possible structures until finally the scientists carefully select 10 to 20 solution that best represent their data and present the average as their final structure.

'''Sample Preparation for NMR'''
In order to study protein structure by NMR, highly purified samples of the protein of interest must be prepared. The protein can either be isolated from natural sources, or expressed in host organisms such as E. Coli through recombinant DNA techniques. The bacteria with the recombinant gene coding for a specific protein are grown in minimal media with 15NH4Cl being the only source of nitrogen for the bacteria, and 13C-glucose offering the only source of carbon for the bacteria to make proteins. This way, when the bacteria produce the protein of interest, these proteins are labeled with 15N and 13C, both of which are NMR active. The protein of interest is then purified through various protein purification techniques (See protein purification techniques). Finally, the protein, in an appropriate buffer, is loaded into an NMR tube and is ready to be placed in the NMR magnet.[[File:Figure 1.pdf|thumb|Figure 1. General scheme for protein structure determination by NMR in solution phase.]]

'''NMR Experiments'''
'''2D Experiments'''There are many different types of NMR experiments one can run to help to reveal information about the structure of the protein. The experiments usually differ in what correlations are detected. For example, a 2D [1H-1H]-NOESY experiment will reveal hydrogen atoms that are within 0.5&amp;nbsp;nm apart.  Protons that exhibit this interaction will show up as a cross peak on the 2D spectrum (Figure 2).[[File:Figure 2.pdf|thumb|Figure 2. Simplified example of 2D [1H-1H]-NOESY NMR spectrum. The dots on the diagonal represent the 1D spectrum of the molecule. There are two protons that are being examined, one at 9 ppm and the other at 8 ppm. The presence of the cross peak (circled) reveals that these two protons are within 0.5&amp;nbsp;nm apart.]]
Taking this information, theoretically, the protons at 8 ppm and 9 ppm on the 1D spectrum could be assigned to a certain residue in the amino acid sequence. For example, if Ala1  is the point at 8 ppm and Ala54 is at 9 ppm, and there is a crosspeak present, then the observation of this NOE reveals a circular structure for this polypeptide chain (Figure 3). [[File:Figure 3.pdf|thumb|Figure 3. Circular structure of polypeptide chain revealed by presence of NOE on 2D NOESY spectrum.]]
Because proteins are much more complicated than this example above, the 2D NOESY spectrum is often cluttered and crosspeaks cannot be made out clearly because many of these points may stack on top of one another. Other experiments are required to reveal the necessary information to determine the 3D structure of the protein, such as 3D experiments.

'''3D Experiments'''
3D experiments use a third dimension to reveal peaks that may be stacked on top of one another in the 2D spectrum. An example is 3D 15N-correlated [1H-1H]-NOESY  (Figure 4).
There are many other experiments to correlate different nuclei and their neighbors. 
[[File:Figure 4.pdf|thumb|Figure 4. Example of 3D 15N [1H-1H] NOESY. The peaks that would be stacked on top of one another in the 2D [1H-1H] NOESY are now drawn out in the third dimension by relating its 15N chemical shifts. This cleans up the spectrum and helps in resonance assignments.]]

==Protein NMR Advantages==

NMR is a good method in trying to solve the structure of a protein and the continued unanswered protein folding problem.  However it is not the only method as crystallography is also a possible method for determining protein structure.  However, NMR has its advantages over crystallography.

One instance is that it uses molecules in solution, so it is not limited to those that crystallize well since crystallization is a very uncertain and time-consuming step in X-ray crystallography. In addition, some proteins do not readily crystallize. Furthermore, although structures present in crystallized proteins very closely represent those of proteins free of the constraints imposed by the crystalline environment, structures in solution can be sources of additional insights. NMR also makes it fairly easy to study properties of a molecule besides its structure such as the flexibility of the molecule and how it interacts with other molecules.  With crystallography, it is either impossible to study these aspects or it requires an entirely new crystal.

==Protein NMR Disadvantages==
Most NMR spectroscopists focus on molecules no larger than 20-30 kilodaltons. X-ray crystallographers have solved structures upto 2,500 kilodaltons.

==NMR in Real Life==
The 15 carbon compound viniferone found in grape seeds was isolated in 2004.  Viniferone falls into a group of substances, grape seed, that are very active against radicals and oxidative stress.  There was very little recovery of viniferone from an abundance of grape seeds (~40 mg of viniferone from 10.5 kg of grape seeds), so precautions had to be taken in the techniques used to obtain its structure.  Most tests would destroy the minuscule amoun proanthocyanidins t of viniferone obtained, so a combination of spectroscopic techniques were utilized (including NMR) to obtain viniferone's structure.  Obtaining the &lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H and &lt;sup&gt;13&lt;/sup&gt;C NMR data was critical in determining the structure of Viniferone.  The variety of absorption signals at various chemical shifts helped determine the presence of alkenes and benzene rings.  Correlation spectroscopy and eventually X-ray crystallography were used to verify the structural arrangement of Viniferone.&lt;ref name =&quot;Schore&quot;&gt;Schore, Neil E. (2011).

===X-ray crystallography===
X-ray crystallography is an experimental technique that is used to determine the structure of a molecule. X-ray crystallography works because the x-ray radiation used to study the sample is of a wavelength that is short enough to be able to discern the features of the molecule.  The sample of interest is isolated, purified, and crystallized, and then the crystal sample has a beam of x-ray radiation fired at it. The path of the x-ray photons is perturbed depending on the structure of the molecules making up the structure of the crystal, and the path of the x-rays is captured on a photosensitive paper behind the crystal sample. The patterns the x-rays make on the photosensitive paper are analyzed and the structure of the molecule can be deduced.

=====Recombinant Protein Refolding Methods used in conjunction with X-Ray Crystallography and NMR:&lt;ref&gt;Hiller, S., Abramson, J., Mannella, C., Wagner, G., and Zeth, K., &quot;The 3D structures of VDAC represent a native conformation,&quot; ''Trends in Biochemical Sciences'', 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;=====
Because x-ray crystallography and NMR require large amounts (on the order of milligrams) of a purified protein (often unattainable with complications in current purification techniques) to analyze the protein’s structure, recombinant techniques are usually employed whereby a host organism is manipulated to express the protein to be studied. Usually, protein refolding methods must then be used because the protein does not fold properly and abnormalities, known as inclusion bodies, in the protein’s structure develop. To attain the correctly folded protein, the abnormalities are removed; the protein is denatured and then refolded to its correct structure. As a result, the refolded protein can then be studied via x-ray crystallography or NMR. Structure and function analysis of known proteins confirms that this method is comparable to studying the protein directly from its native source.

===NMR spectroscopy===
A solution of proteins is placed in a magnetic field and the effects of different radio frequencies on the resonance of
different atoms in a protein are measured. Proteins must be small (~120 residues) and must be soluble for this method.
Ab initio methods, homology modeling, and fold recognition are also other popular methods used to determine the structure of tertiary proteins.

===Cryo-electron microscopy===
A visualization can be created by this method which takes place at or below liquid nitrogen temperatures. It is a fairly new technique that can create visualizations at an extremely high resolution. This method is a form of electron microscopy which utilizes the extremely low temperatures to reduce the occurrence of radiation damage to the specimen. 
===Tertiary structure prediction===
'''Ab initio methods''' is used to predict tertiary structure of protein from first principle. It bases on Thermodynamic hypothesis predicts that the native conformation of a protein corresponds to a global free energy minimum of the protein/solvent system. 
'''Homology modeling''' is a class of methods for constructing an atomic-resolution model of a protein from its amino acid sequence. Its motivation is if sequence similarity is high, then structural similarity is probably high, too. Almost all homology modeling techniques rely on the identification of one or more known protein structures likely to resemble the structure of the query sequence, and on the production of an alignment that maps residues in the query sequence to residues in the template sequence. The sequence alignment and template structure are then used to produce a structural model of the target. Because protein structures are more conserved than DNA sequences, detectable levels of sequence similarity usually imply significant structural similarity.

===Hard X-ray Fluourescence Tomography===
Hard X-ray fluorescence (XRF) microscopy is a powerful method for structural visualization. It detects traces of metal distributions in biological systems like Cu and Zn. 10-15 elements are mapped at the same time, which leads to accurate elemental colocalisation maps. The trace elements are important for most life forms. Metals play an essential role in many proteins by catalyzing functions or for a structural role. Metals are also recognized to have an impact on human health and disease. 

X-ray fluorescence is suited for quantifying trace elements. X-ray fluorescence can be excited through x-ray beams or through exposures to a particle like a proton or electron. This helps map the elemental content at high spatial resolution. X-ray microprobes have zone-plates, Kirkpatrick-Baez mirrors, compound refractive lenses, and tapered capillaries, with ranging probe sizes and photo intensities. 

Tomography (known as slice imaging) is a two-dimensional technique that is performed on many neighboring slices together, resulting in a three dimensional reconstruction. XRF has also used full-field imaging and structure detector approaches. The technologies have mixed strengths and weaknesses with varied spatial resolutions, sensitivities, and different elemental contrast. Projection tomography uses projections of a specimen as input data to a tomographic reconstruction algorithm. However, x-ray fluorescence micrographs are not exactly equivalent to projection imaging because of self-absorption effects, which include the absorption of the incident beam and re-absorption of the fluorescence by the specimen. Heavier metals in thicker biological tissue have successfully used back projection without correction. Confocal tomography is a direct-space approach to scanning XRF tomography with axial resolution reaching below 5 micrometers. A collimator or lens confines the field of view of the energy-dispersive detector so that the signal derives from only a small portion of the illuminated column. The probe volume is then reduced to a spheroid and elemental distribution is mapped by scanning the specimen through the probe volume in three dimensions. The confocal geometry also allows direct access to a small region of specimen; however, it can be very difficult to target features of interest. 

Self-absorption plays a significant role in XRF tomography, and so good correction algorithms are required to ensure image fidelity to expand the specimen size domain, to extend the elemental domain, and to maintain quantitative data accuracy.

===Soft X-ray Tomography===
In soft x-ray tomography, projection images of a specimen are collected at different angles around a rotation or “tilt” axis, which is mathematically capable of being computed to reconstruct the specimen. A problem that is encountered with three-dimensional tomography is that biological materials become damaged when exposed to intense light in an x-ray microscope from photons or from ultra violet illumination in a fluorescence microscope. However, with soft x-ray tomography, collections of images are acquired at 1-2 degree increments through 180-degree rotation. This causes the specimen to get structurally damaged by receiving a large dose of radiation. However, cryoimmobilization of the specimen avoids this problem. When cells are imaged at liquid nitrogen temperature, more than a thousand soft x-ray projection images can be collected without apparent signs of radiation damage. 

The major advantage of water-window soft x-ray tomography is that it can be applied to any imaging investigation in cell biology such as imaging simple bacteria, to yeast and algae, to advanced eukaryotic cells and tissues. The images also keep eukaryotic cells in the native state without the use of stains or labels, which is something that can’t be done with light or electron microscopy. 

===Electron Tomography===
Electron Tomography, also known as ET, is a novel visualization technique that does what other structure determination methods cannot do in that this method is able to bridge the gap between the atomic structural information of supramolecular structures and its cellular events. It allows visualization of not only the structure of a molecule but its association with other structures and organelles. For instance, electron tomography has opened doors to the observation of virus propagation and viral life cycle in the host cell. Tomography slices allow the examination of molecular architecture of virus as it attaches to cells, penetrate cells, move to replication sites, assemble progeny and transport them to the membranous regions, and exits the cell. Though this technique is still new, it has already been applied to human and simian immunodeficiency viruses (HIV and SIV) and other viruses that infect plant, animals, and humans. 

The following are examples of cellular events that have been observed and elucidated through the use of Electron Tomography:

1) Virus Entry: ET shows the presence of &quot;entry claws&quot; which are characteristic architectures of virus coming into contact with the host cell. The entry claw is made up of five to seven rods and represents the interaction between the viral spikes and cell surface receptors. Furthermore, CT shows that some cells, such as vaccinia virus infected cells, shows clear change in shape of the vaccinia virus before and after intrusion of the cell. 

2) Virus Factory: ET sheds more light on viroplasms, which are inclusion bodies found at the viral replication site responsible for virus assembly and replication. ET supported the discovery of core proteins P1, P3, P5, and P7 inside the viroplasm and outer capsid proteins P2, P8, and P9, and the formation of virus particles around the viroplasm. With this information, scientists were able to propose a three-step viral replication process: 1)formation of core particles inside the viroplasm, 2) core particle coating with outer capsids at the periphery of the viroplasms, and 3) transportation of mature virus to the membrane region by microtubules. 

3) Transportation of Virions inside the Cell: The third step of the proposed viral replication process was observed and confirmed by ET. After the virus propagate at the initial site, they move to another site for secondary multiplication. This movement to another site occurs through virus utilization filamentous substances such as microfilaments and microtubules (MTs) composed of actin and beta tubulins. ET has allowed visualization of the mechanism of cytosolic transportation and strong suggestion that microtubules aid in the transportation of newly assembled virus to the membrane which leads to cell-to-cell spread of the virus. This suggests that microtubules assist in cell-to-cell spread rather than in the entry of viruses to the replication site. Finally, ET shows a gap between the virus and the microtubules indicating that the virus particles do not interact directly with microtubules. Instead, the gap is filled with a rod-like structure that might act as a plus end-directed motor. 

In conclusion, ET has shown to have two advantages to the other structure determining methods. The first is that ET prevents misleading conclusions based on 2D structures. Second, observation of finer structures in cells and virus allow elucidation of the organization of detailed virus particles in association with microtubules. This has only been observed using ET. 

 


===Soft X-ray Microscopy===
In soft x-ray microscopes, third generation synchrotrons are used as the x-ray source. Soft x-ray projection images are a result of precision nanostructured x-ray lenses, high-efficiency direct detection CCD cameras, and well designed transmission X-ray microscopes. Images are generated using phase contrast techniques. 

Soft x-ray microscopes are operated using photons with energies in the “water window,” which is the region of the spectrum that lies between the K shell absorption edges of carbon and oxygen. White cellular water remains transparent as the structures in the cell are visualized as a function of biochemical composition and density. Lipid droplets which are structures that absorb more than high water content organelles like vacuoles.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''X-ray crystallography'''

X-ray crystallography can reveal the detailed three-dimensional structures of thousands of proteins. The three components in an X-ray crystallographic analysis are a protein crystal, a source of x-rays, and a detector.

X-ray crystallography is used to investigate molecular structures through the growth of solid crystals of the molecules they study.  Crystallographers aim high-powered X-rays at a tiny crystal containing trillions of identical molecules.  The crystal scatters the X-rays onto an electronic detector.  The electronic detector is the same type used to capture images in a digital camera.  After each blast of X-rays, lasting from a few seconds to several hours, the researchers precisely rotate the crystal by entering its desired orientation into the computer that controls the X-ray apparatus.  This enables the scientists to capture in three dimensions how the crystal scatters, or diffracts, X-rays.  The intensity of each diffracted ray is fed into a computer, which uses a mathematical equation to calculate the position of every atom in the crystallized molecule.  The result is a three-dimensional digital image of the molecule.

Crystallographers measure the distances between atoms in angstroms.  The perfect “rulers” to measure angstrom distances are X-rays.  The X-rays used by crystallographers are approximately 0.5 to 1.5 angstroms long, which are just the right size to measure the distance between atoms in a molecule.  That is why X-rays are used.

== Introduction ==
Protein X-ray crystallography is a technique used to obtain the three-dimensional structure of a particular [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|protein]] by x-ray diffraction of its crystallized form. This three dimensional structure is crucial to determining a protein's functionality. Making crystals creates a lattice in which this technique aligns missions of proteins of molecules together to make the data collection more sensitive. It's like getting a stack of papers, measuring the width with a ruler, and dividing that length with the number of pages to determine the width of one piece of paper. By this averaging technique, the noise level gets reduced and the signal to noise ratio increases.&lt;ref&gt;Viadiu, Hector. &quot;Why do we need crystals?&quot; UCSD Lecture. November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The specificity of the protein's [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Active Site|active sites]] and binding sites is completely dependent on the protein's precise conformation. X-ray crystallography can reveal the precise three-dimensional positions of most atoms in a protein molecule because x-rays and [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Covalent bonds|covalent]] bonds have similar wavelength, and therefore currently provides the best visualization of protein structure. It was the X-ray crystallography by Rosalind E.Franklin, that made it possible for J.D. Watson and F.H.C. Crick to figure out the double-helix structure of DNA.

== Utilization ==
We use this procedure to grasp the cellular mechanism and the knowledge of the 3-D structure of enzymes and other macromolecules. It is critical that we can better understand how each chemical reaction that occurs in a cell needs a specific enzyme for it to happen. Two common techniques used for analysis of proteins structure are [[../NMR Spectroscopy|Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)]], and x-ray crystallography. X-ray crystallography can be used to analyze any different compounds up to a molecular weight of 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; (g/mol) for instance; where as NMR is restricted to biopolymers(polymers produced by a living organism such as starch, peptides, sugars) with a molecular weight no more than 30,000 (g/mol).  It can also measure compounds that are very small because the appropriate size to measure the distance between atoms in a molecule is 0.5 to 1.5 angstroms. X-rays are used as the form of radiation because their wavelengths are on the same order of a covalent bond (~1 Ǻ or 1 * 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;m) and this is necessary to obtain a diffraction pattern that reveals information about the structure of the molecule.  If the radiation had a wavelength much bigger or much smaller than the bond length of a covalent bond, the light would not diffract and no new knowledge of the structure would be obtained.

==Techniques==
The three components needed to complete an X-ray crystallography analysis are a '''protein crystal''', a '''source of x-rays''' and a '''detector'''.

==First Step==
The process begins by crystallizing a protein of interest. Crystallization of protein causes all the protein atoms to be orientated in a fixed way with respect to one another while still maintaining their biologically active conformations - a requirement for X-ray diffraction. A protein must be precipitated out or extracted from a solution. The rule of thumb here is to get as pure a protein as possible to grow lots of crystals (this allows for the crystals to have charged properties, and surface charged distribution for better scattering results). 4 critical steps are taken to achieve protein crystallization, they are:

#Purify the protein. Determine the purity of the protein and if not pure (usually &gt;99%), then must undergo further [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Purification|purification]].
#Must precipitate protein. Usually done so by dissolving the protein in an appropriate solvent(water-buffer soln. w/ organic salt such as 2-methyl-2,4-pentanediol. If protein is insoluble in water-buffer or water-organic buffer then a detergent such as sodium lauryl sulfate must be added).
#The solution has to be brought to supersaturation(condensing the protein from the rest of the solvent forming condensation nuclei). This is done by adding a salt to the concentrated solution of the protein, reducing its solubility and allowing the protein to form a highly organized crystal (this process is referred to as salting out).  Other methods include batch crystallization, liquid-liquid crystallization, vapor diffusion, and dialysis.
#Let the actual crystals grow. Since nuclei crystals are formed this will lead to obtaining actual crystal growth.

NOTES ON RECRYSTALLIZATION TECHNIQUE TO ACHIEVE A MORE PURE PROTEIN:

Recrystallization is an incredibly important technique used for the purification of substances. Understanding the solubility of the solid in a certain solvent is the key to recrystallization. One of the applications of this technique can be seen in pharmaceutics and in many other fields. For example, crystallographers use methods of nuclear magnetic resonance and x-ray diffraction to gain insight into different compounds. X-ray diffraction requires the formation of pure crystals in order to acquire accurate results. Crystallographers can gain insight into protein structure by using x-ray diffraction, but in order to be able to use x-rays to examine their crystals, they must first spend time forming pure protein crystals. It is very difficult to form protein crystals. It may even take years and incredibly specific conditions.  Temperature, pH, and concentration have to be very specific to form larger crystals with a pure structure. Recrystallization in this process is vital to get rid of impurities in the crystal lattice.  Scientists today use crystallography and recrystallization techniques to understand protein structure and help understand how a single abnormality in the protein's primary structure can cause diseases. All in all, purification techniques are vital in order to use x-ray diffraction to understand structure. In this experiment we explore the differences in micro and macro recrystallization.  
	The techniques employed in recrystallization include finding a good solvent to work in, gravity filtration, slow cooling, and vacuum filtration.  The key to a successful recrystallization is a good solvent. We need a solvent that will not dissolve the sample at cool temperatures but will dissolve it at high temperatures. This allows the precipitation of the solute after the solution is dissolved in warm temperatures. Since the solute is only soluble in the warm solute, upon cooling, a precipitate forms. Gravity Filtration is used to remove insoluble impurities remaining in the solution before recrystallization and it is used to filter out the charcoal used to remove the color impurities. Gravity filtration is effective, but we must avoid crystallization during this process as to avoid losing pure crystals in the filter paper.  Slow cooling is also essential to ensure the purity and size of the crystals. When the solution is allowed to cool slowly, the dissolved impurities have time to interact with the solvent instead of remaining trapped in the crystal lattice. During fast cooling, impurities may remain trapped in the crystal lattice because crystallization occurs to quickly and impurities do not have time to return to the solvent. After the crystals are put in an ice bath to ensure maximum recrystallization, the solution is filtered using a vacuum filtration to extract the pure crystals from the solution with the impurities.  After it is vacuumed, the pure crystals are collected and weighed. Micro recrystallization differs from macro recrystallization in the instruments and techniques used for filtration of the pure crystals. Micro recrystallization involves using a Craig tube and centrifugation instead of vacuum filtration. It is used for a recrystallization of less than 300mg of solid.

==Second Step==

For the next step, x-rays are generated and directed toward the crystallized protein. X-rays can be generated in four different ways, 
#by bombarding a metal source with a beam of high-energy electrons,
#by exposing a substance to a primary beam of X-rays to create a secondary beam of X-ray fluorescence,
#from a radioactive decay process that generates X-rays (Gamma rays are indistinguishable from X-rays), and
#from a synchrotron (a cyclotron with an electric field at constant frequency) radiation source.

The first and last method utilize the phenomenon of bremsstrahlung, which states that an accelerating charge will give off radiation.

Then, the x-rays are shot at the protein crystal resulting in some of the x-rays going through the crystal and the rest being scattered in various directions. The scattering of x-rays is also known as &quot;x-ray diffraction&quot;. Such scattering results from the interaction of electric and magnetic fields of the radiation with the electrons in the atoms of the crystal. 

The patterns are a result of interference between the diffracted x-rays governed by Bragg's Law: &lt;math&gt; 2d \sin \theta=n*\lambda&lt;/math&gt;, where d is the distance between two regions of electron density, &lt;math&gt; \theta &lt;/math&gt; is the angle of diffraction, &lt;math&gt; \lambda &lt;/math&gt; is the wavelength of the diffracted x-ray and &lt;math&gt; n &lt;/math&gt; is an integer.  If the angle of reflection satisfies the following condition:  

&lt;math&gt;\sin\theta= \frac {(n*\lambda)}{2d}&lt;/math&gt;,

the diffracted x-rays will interfere constructively. Otherwise, destructive interference occurs.

[[Image:Xray.jpg]]

Here is an example of constructive interference:

[[Image:Constructive Interference.jpg]]

Here is an example of destructive interference:

[[File:Destructive Interference.jpg]]

Constructive interference indicates that the diffracted x-rays are in phase or lined up with each other, while destructive interference indicates that the x-rays are not exactly in phase with each other.
The result is that the measured intensity of the x-rays increases and decreases as a function of angle and distance between the detector and the crystal.

The x-rays that have been scattered in various directions are then caught on x-ray film, which show a blackening of the emulsion in proportion to the intensity of the scattered x-rays hitting the film, or by a solid-state detector, like those found in digital cameras.  The crystal is rotated so that the x-rays are able to hit the protein from all sides and angles.  The pattern on the emulsion reveals much information about the structure of the protein in question. The three basic physical principles underlying this technique are:

#Atoms scatter x-rays. The amplitude of the diffracted x-ray is directly proportional to the number of electrons in the atom.
#Scattered waves recombine. The beams reinforce one another at the film if they are in phase or cancel one another out if they are out of phase. Every atom contributes to a scattered beam.
#Three-dimensional atomic arrangement determines how the beams recombine.

The intensities of the spots and their positions are thus the basic experimental data of the analysis.

==Final Step==

The final step involves creating an electron density map based on the measured intensities of the diffraction pattern on the film.  A Fourier Transform can be applied to the intensities on the film to reconstruct the electron density distribution of the crystal.  In this case, the Fourier Transform takes the spatial arrangement of the electron density and gives out the spatial frequency (how closely spaced the atoms are) in the form of the diffraction pattern on the x-ray film.  An everyday example of the Fourier Transform is the music equalizer on a music player.  Instead of displaying the actual music waveform, which is difficult to visualize, the equalizer displays the intensity of various bands of frequencies.  Through the Fourier Transform, the electron density distribution is illustrated as a series of parallel shapes and lines stacked on top of each other (contour lines), like a terrain map. The mapping gives a three-dimensional representation of the electron densities observed through the x-ray crystallography.  When interpreting the electron density map, resolution needs to be taken into account.  A resolution of 5Å - 10Å can reveal the structure of polypeptide chains, 3Å - 4Å of groups of atoms, and 1Å - 1.5Å of individual atoms.  The resolution is limited by the structure of the crystal and for proteins is about 2Å.

== Type of X-ray Device ==
Protein molecules are very large, thus their crystals diffract x-ray beams much less than crystals from smaller molecules. Because larger molecules have fewer crystals, diffraction scattering and hence intensity emitted is very weak. Proteins contain carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen, and so are lighter elements(that is they have fewer electrons/atom); this is important since electrons are responsible for the diffraction and intensity, and therefore they scatter x-rays weaker than heavy elements. Knowing this, protein crystallographers use high intensity x-ray sources such as a rotating anode tube or a strong synchrotron x-ray source for analyzing the protein crystals.

# The number of electrons in an atom is proportional to the wave's amplitude. An example would be comparing a carbon atom and hydrogen atom, you would see that the carbon atom would scatter six times as strongly as the hydrogen atom.
# If in phase the waves combine with one another at the film but if the waves are out of phase then they cancel out one another at the film.
# The only thing that matters when looking at how scattered waves recombine is the atomic arrangement.

Energy of X-ray: 
:&lt;math&gt;
E = hf\ =\frac{hc}{\lambda},
&lt;/math&gt; where ''f'' is frequency and ''λ'' is wavelength. The SI unit of energy is the joule (J).
X-rays have higher energy than visible light due to its small wavelength.

== Phase Problems ==

The interaction of X-rays with the electrons in a crystal gives rise to a diffraction pattern, which mathematically is the Fourier transform of the electron density distribution. The detectors used to measure the X-rays, however, can only measure the amplitude of the diffracted x-rays; the phase shifts, which are required to use the Fourier Transform and find the electron density distribution, is not measurable directly using this method. This is known in the physics community as the &quot;Phase Problem&quot;. In simpler terms the phases cannot be found from the measured amplitudes of the X-rays. Other extrapolations must be made and additional experiments must be done in order to get an electron density map. Many times, the existing data on the compound's physical and chemical properties can help aid when there is a poor density map. Another method known as Patterson Synthesis is very useful to find out an initial estimate of phases and it is very useful for the initial stages to determine the structure of proteins when the phases are not known. The problem can be simplified by finding an atom, usually a heavy metal, using Patterson Synthesis and then using that atom's position to estimate the initial phases and calculate an initial electron density map that can further help in the modeling of the position of other atoms and improve the phase estimate even more.  Another method is called Molecular Replacement; it locates the location of the protein structure in the cell. In addition to the molecular replacement method, the phase problem can also be solved by the isomorphous replacement method, the multiple wavelength anomalous diffraction method, the single-wavelength anomalous diffraction method, and direct methods.

=== Molecular Replacement ===
Phase problem can be solved by having an atomic model that can compute phases. A model can be obtained if the related protein structure is known. However, in order to build this atomic model, the orientation and position of the model in the new unit cell needs to be determined. This is when the technique, molecular replacement (or MR) comes in.

'''Molecular Replacement''', also known as MR, is a method to solve phase problems in x-ray crystallography. MR locates the orientation and position of a protein structure with its unit cell, whose protein structure is homologous to the unknown protein structure that needs to be determined. The obtained phases can help generate electron density maps and help produce calculated intensities of the position of the protein structure model to the observed structures from the x-ray crystallography experiment.

MR method is also effective for solving macromolecular crystal structures. This method requires less time and effort for structural determination, since heavy atom derivatives and collecting data do not need to be prepared. The method is straight forward and model building is simplified because it needs no chain tracing. 
   
This method consists of two steps: 
# a rotational search to orient the homologous model in the unit cell or target
# a translational target where the new oriented model is positioned in the unit cell

===== Patterson-based (Molecular Replacement)=====
Patterson maps are interatomic vector maps that contain peaks for each related atom in the unit cell. If the Patterson maps were generated based on the data derived from the electron density maps, the two Patterson maps should be closely related to each other only if the model is correctly oriented and placed in the correct position. This will allow us to infer information about the location of the unknown protein structure with its cell. However, there is a problem with molecular replacement, it has six dimensions, three parameters to specify orientation and position. With the Patterson maps, it can be divided into subsets of the parameters to look at each part separately.

==== Rotation Function ====
Rotation function has intramolecular vectors that only depend on the molecule’s orientation and not its position because even when the molecule is translated in the unit cell, all of the atoms are shifted by the same amount but the vectors between the atoms are the same. The Patterson map for the unknown protein structure is compared with the homologous known protein structure in different orientations [[Image:MR Rotation Function.gif‎|right|thumb|280px|The figure shows the molecule in a random orientation (left) and together with the rest of the intramolecular vectors (right).]] [[Image:Patterson Map.gif|right|thumb|300px|This is a Patterson map of the above structure. The intramolecular vectors are shown in red.]]
===== Classic Rotation Function =====
To find the orientation, determine the rotation axis and rotation angle about that axis. Two parameters will be needed to define an axis (a vector from the center of the sphere to a point on the sphere surface). The rotation axis starts off parallel to the z-axis and is rotated around the y-axis with angle ᶱ, then the object rotates around the z-axis with angle ᶲ, and finally it rotates around the rotation axis with angle ᵠ. These specify a point on the surface of a unit sphere.
[[Image:Classical Rotation Function.gif‎|right|thumb|550px|The ĸ/ᵠ/ɸ description is useful if looking for rotations with a particular rotation angle (ĸ). For instance, a 2-fold rotations will have ĸ=180°, while a 6-fold rotations will have ĸ=60°]]

===== Fast Rotation Function =====
The rotation function can be computed by comparing two Patterson maps or the peaks in those Pattersons. Rotation function can be computed much faster with Fourier transforms only if the Pattersons were expressed in terms of spherical harmonics.

===== Direct Rotation Function =====
In direct rotation function, the protein structure can be placed in the unit cell of the unknown structure and the Patterson for the oriented molecule is compared with the entire unknown structure Patterson.

==== Translation Function ====
Once the orientation of the known structure is known its model (electron density map) can be oriented to compute structure factors where a correlation function is used to determine the vector to translate the model on top of the homologous one within an asymmetric unit.

With the correct oriented and translated phasing models of the protein structure, it is accurate enough to derive the electron density maps from the derived phases. The electron density maps can be used to build and refine the model of the unknown structure.

=== Multiwavelength Anomalous Diffraction ===
X-Rays are generated in large machines called synchrotrons. Synchotrons accelerate electrons to nearly the speed of light and travel them through a large, hollow metal polygon-ring. At each corner, magnets bend the electron stream, causing the emission of energy in the form of electromagnetic radiation. Since the electrons are moving at the speed of light, they emit high energy X-rays.

The benefits of using synchrotrons is that researches do not have to grow multiple versions of every crystallized molecule, but instead only grow one type of crystal that contains selenium. They then have the ability to tune the wavelength to match the chemical properties of selenium. This technique is known as Multiwavelength Anomalous Diffraction. The crystals are then bombarded several times with wavelengths of different lengths, and eventually a diffraction pattern emerges which enables researchers to determine the location of the selenium atoms. This position can be used as a reference, or marker to determine the rest of the structure. The benefits of this allow researchers to collect their data much more quickly.

=== Isomorphous Replacement Method ===
This method compares the x-ray diffraction patterns between the original protein crystal and the same type of crystal with an addition of at least one atom with high atomic number.  The method was used to determinate the structure of small molecules and eventually that of hemoglobin by Max Ferdinand Perutz (1914–2002).  A perfect isomorphism is when the original crystal and its derivative have exactly the same conformation of protein, the position and orientation or the molecules, and the unit cell parameters. The only difference that the crystal and its derivative have in a perfect isomorphism is the intensity differences due to the addition of heavy atoms on the derivative.  These differences can be identified manually or by an automatic Patterson search procedure, such as SIR 2002, SHELXD, nB, and ACORN, and such information is important as to determine the protein phase angles.  However, perfect isomorphism hardly occurs because of the change in cell dimensions. For the protein with heavy atom, its tolerable change in cell dimension is d&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt;/4, for d&lt;sub&gt;min&lt;/sub&gt; is the resolution limit. Other factors, such as rotation, also contribute to nonisomorphism.

====Procedures====
# Prepare a few derivatives of the protein in crystalline structure.  Then, measure the cell dimension to check for isomorphism.
# Collect x-ray intensity data of the original protein and its derivative.
# Apply the Patterson function to determine the coordinates of the heavy atom.
# Refine the heavy atom parameters and calculate the phase angle of the protein.
# Calculate the electron density of the protein.

The derivatives are made through two different methods.  The preferred method is to soak the protein crystal in a solution that is composed identically to the mother liquor, but with a slight increase of precipitant concentration.  Another method is co-crystallization, but it is not commonly used because the crystal will not grow or grow nonisomorphously.  The soaking procedure depends on how wide the crystal pores are.  The pores should be wide enough for the reagent to diffuse into the crystal and to reach the reactive sites on the surface of all protein molecules in the crystal.

=== Multiple Wavelength Anomalous Diffraction Method ===
Multiple Wavelength Anomalous Diffraction (abbreviated MAD) is a method utilized in X-ray crystallography that allows us to determine the structures of biological macromolecules, such as proteins and DNA, in order to solve the phase problem. Requirements for the structure include atoms that cause significant scattering from X-rays; notably sulfur or metal ions from metalloproteins. Since selenium can replace natural sulfur, it is more commonly used. The use of this technique greatly facilitates the crystallographer from using the Multiple Isomorphous Replacement (MIR) method as preparation of heavy compounds is superfluous.

this method is used to solve phase problems, when there is no available data regarding scattered diffraction besides amplitudes. Moreover, it is used when a heavy metal atom is already bound inside the protein or when the protein crystals are not isomorphous which is unsuitable for MIR method. The method has been mostly used for heavy metallo solution, these metallo enzyme normally comes from the 1st transition series and their neighbors. it is important to have a source for a powerful magnetic field to carry out this experiment, environment such as underground should be considered. A particle accelerator called a synchrotron is also required for the method.

=== Single-Wavelength Anomalous Diffraction Method ===

In comparison to multi-wavelength anomalous diffraction (MAD), single-wavelength anomalous diffraction (SAD) uses a single set of data from a single wavelength. The main beneficial difference between MAD and SAD is that the crystal spends less time in the x-ray beam with SAD, which reduces potential radiation damage to the molecule. Also, since SAD uses only one wavelength, it is more time-efficient than MAD. 

The electron density maps derived from single-wavelength anomalous diffraction data do need to undergo modifications to resolve phase ambiguities. A common modification technique is solvent flattening, and when SAD is combined with solvent flattening, the electron density maps that result are of comparable quality to those that are derived from full MAD phasing. Solvent flattening involves adjusting the electron density of the interstitial regions between protein molecules occupied by the solvent. The solvent region is assumed to be relatively disordered and featureless compared to the protein. Smoothing the electron density in the solvent regions will enhance the electron density of the protein to an interpretable degree. This method is called ISAS, iterative single-wavelength anomalous scattering.

=== Direct Methods ===
The direct method can help recover the phases using the data it obtains. Direct Method estimates the initial and expanding phases using a triple relation. Triple (trio) relation is the relation of the intensity and phase of one reflection with two other intensities and phases. When using this method, the size of the protein structure matters since the phase probability distribution is inversely proportionate to the square root of the number of atoms. Direct method is the most useful technique to solve phase problems.

== Interesting facts ==

Paul Peter Ewald and Max von Laue developed the idea to use crystals as a diffraction grating for X-rays in 1912. Von Laue proposed that compared to the larger wavelength of visible light, x-rays might have a wavelength close to the spacing of crystals' unit cells. He worked with Walter Friedrich and Paul Knipping to record the x-ray diffraction of a copper sulfate crystal onto a photographic plate. Von Laue developed a relation between the scattering angles and the size of the unit cell spacing and their orientation in the crystal, winning the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1914. As a result of von Laue's research, William Lawrence Bragg developed a law to connect a crystal's observed scattering and reflection from evenly-spaced planes in the crystal. This could be used to deduce atomic structure, and the significance of Bragg's Law to determining molecular structure was recognized immediately. In 1914, the first structure to be solved was that of table salt. Its electron distribution proved that not only covalent but also ionic compounds can form crystals.

In 1914, the structure of diamond was solved using x-rays, and it was shown that the length of the carbon-to-carbon single bond is 1.52 Angstroms.

X-ray crystallography was first used to determine protein structure in the late 1950s.

John Kendrew and Max Perutz while both at Cambridge used x-ray crystallography to discover the structure of hemoglobin &amp; myoglobin(oxygen carrier in muscle) in 1945. They received the Nobel Prize in chemistry in 1962.

The first three-dimensional crystal structure of an enzyme determined via x-ray crystallography was a hen egg-white lysozyme. This was especially important as visual evidence of the transition-state theory because it was physical proof that the catalytic site was complementary to the transition-state geometry. Immediately following this first crystal structure, there was an upsurge in reports of the x-ray structures of many different enzymes.&lt;ref&gt;Kraut, Joseph. &quot;How Do Enzymes Work?&quot;, Science, vol.242, 28 October 1988, Pg.534&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

Many advances in drug discovery and medicine are due in large part by X-Ray Crystallography by identifying drug targets in many diseases that thrive today. In the late 80’s for example, scientists made a breakthrough in using X-Ray Crystallography to produce the structure of HIV Protease, an enzyme that was vital to the retrovirus’ life cycle. The enzyme cuts viral proteins strands that are main components of immature viral cells into separate, mature proteins that can continue on to form more mature and infectious viral particles. By looking closely at it structure, specifically its symmetry, researchers began making compounds that interacted with the active site of the enzyme, which is in the middle of its symmetric halves, to  shut the enzyme down and prevent it from functioning properly. Amazingly, by the mid 90s, three HIV Protease inhibitor drugs were on the market, drastically reducing the death rate of the AIDS Virus.&lt;ref&gt;National Institutes of Health, Structure Of Life'', 2007, Pgs. 37-38, 40, 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not only is X-Ray Crystallography a useful tool for drug discovery, it is proven to be beneficial for making drugs better. For instance, current treatment for Parkinson’s disease involves inhibiting an enzyme called Monoamine Oxidase B [MAO B] that help recycle neurotransmitters by removing sometimes crucial molecular components that are left inactive.  Although effective, such inhibitors cause undesirable side effects such as changes in heart rate, blood pressure, breathing, etc.  However by determining the three dimensional structure of MAO B, along with seeing how some inhibitors attach to the enzyme, Dale Edmondson and his coworkers at Emory University have begun to contemplate methods of making new drugs that bind more specifically to the enzyme, in order to ultimately reduce the side effects.&lt;ref&gt;National Institutes of Health, “Medicine By Design, 2006, Pg.31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, X-ray crystallography has helped to explain how drugs work within the body, how they interact, what makes them work, and so on. A good example of such a case is the widely used drug aspirin. Aspirin has the ability to block the production of prostaglandins, messenger molecules that play various important roles in metabolism, by blocking the cyclooxygenase enzyme (COX) known to operate in the body's metabolic and immune systems. Scientists were able to study the COX enzyme and determine its structure via X-ray crystallography, and by doing so they got a clear picture of how the precise details of the enzyme's structure contribute to its overall molecular function. By determining the 3-dimensional structure of COX enzymes, we are able to understand how drugs like aspirin interact and block it.&lt;ref&gt;National Institutes of Health, “Medicine By Design, 2006, Pg.25-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

== MIR Experiments ==

The MIR experiments, conducted by NASA, revealed that some proteins produce better quality crystals in a microgravity environment. DCAM, Ambient Diffusion-Controlled Protein Crystal Growth, was the procedure used in these experiments. DCAM uses a liquid to liquid diffusion method to grow protein crystals. These proteins were sent to the Mir Space Station by the Shuttle orbiter to crystallize. The protein crystals were later brought back to the ground for x-ray diffraction analysis. The results were promising. The largest crystals ever produced of certain proteins were produced by these experiments. These proteins include lysozyme, albumin and histone octamer. Bacteriorhodopsin, a membrane associated protein, produced crystals of improved size and quality. Furthermore, DCAM, performed in a microgravity environment, proved successful in providing unusually large protein crystals that could be analyzed for structure by neutron diffraction, a technology that cannot be utilized for smaller crystals grown on Earth. These promising results could produce numerous benefits for people on Earth. Protein crystals are needed to make therapeutic drugs. Scientists can develop new drugs to treat diseases by growing protein crystals in space that could not be grown in a large enough size on the Earth due to the limitations of gravitational forces.  

== Advantages with X-ray Crystallography ==
Some of the advantages of X-ray crystallography are that the technique itself can obtain an atomic resolution structure even if the atomic structure is in solution. This is because the structure in crystal form is the same if it were in solution. Another advantageous aspect is that atomic structure contains a huge amount of data pertaining to the crystallized pure protein. The information one could receive from the structure of the protein can provide more information then finding its niche in the cellular environment. 

== Applications of X-ray Crystallography ==

The utilization of x-ray crystallography to determine protein structure has led to huge and significant breakthroughs in the area of structural biochemistry. 

== HIV ==

Although researchers have not found a cure for AIDS, structural biology has greatly enhanced their understanding of HIV  and has played a key role in the development of drugs to treat this deadly disease.  HIV was quickly recognized as a retrovirus, a type of virus that carries its genetic material not as DNA but as RNA.  Long before HIV, researchers in labs all over the world studied retroviruses, some of which cause cancers in animals.  These scientists traced out the life cycle of retroviruses and identified the key proteins the viruses use to infect cells.  When HIV was identified as a retrovirus, these studies gave AIDS researchers an immediate jump-start making the previously discovered viral proteins the initial drug targets.

Scientists also determined the X-ray crystallographic structure of HIV protease, a viral enzyme critical in HIV’s life cycle, in 1989.  Pharmaceutical scientists hoped that by blocking this enzyme, they could prevent the virus from spreading in the body.  Scientists could finally see their target enzyme.  By feeding the structural information into a computer modeling program, they could spin a model of the enzyme around, zoom in on specific atoms, analyze its chemical properties, and even strip away or alter parts of it.  Most importantly, they could use the model structure as a reference to determine the types of molecules that might block the enzyme.  Such structure-based drug design strategies have the potential to shave off years and millions of dollars from the traditional trial and error drug development process.  The structure of HIV protease revealed a crucial fact, the enzyme is made up of two equal halves.  For most such symmetrical molecules, both halves have an active site, that carries out the enzyme’s job but HIV protease has only one active site in the center of the molecule where the two halves meet.  Pharmaceutical scientists can take advantage of this feature by blocking the single active site with a small molecule, they could shut down the whole enzyme and theoretically stop the virus’ spread in the body by using the enzyme’s structural shape as a guide.

== Arthritis ==

Celebrex was initially designed to treat osteoarthritis and adult rheumatoid arthritis and became the first drug approved to treat a rare condition called FAP or familial adenomatous polyposis that leads to colon cancer.  A fortunate discovery enabled scientists to design drugs that retain the anti-inflammatory properties of NSAIDs without the ulcer-causing side effects.  By studying the drugs at the molecular level, researchers learned that NSAIDs block the action of two closely related enzymes called cyclooxygenases: COX-1 and COX-2.  COX-2 is produced in response to injury or infection and activates molecules that trigger inflammation and an immune response.  By blocking COX-2, NSAIDs reduce inflammation and pain caused by arthritis, headaches, and sprains.  In contrast, COX-1 produces molecules called prostaglandins that protect the lining of the stomach from digestive acids so when NSAIDs block this function, they foster ulcers.

To create an effective painkiller that doesn’t cause ulcers, scientists realized they needed to develop new medicines that shut down COX-2 but not COX-1.  Through structural biology, they could see exactly why Celebrex plugs up COX-2 but not COX-1.  The three-dimensional structures of COX-2 and COX-1 are almost identical except for one amino acid change in the active site of COX-2 that creates an extra binding pocket.  It is this extra pocket into which Celebrex binds.  In addition to showing researchers in atom by atom detail how the drug binds to its target, the structures of the COX enzymes will continue to provide basic researcher with insight into how these molecules work in the body.

== Problems with X-ray Crystallography ==

Some of the drawbacks of X-ray crystallography are that the sample needs to be in a solid form, the sample must be present in a large enough quantity to be studied, and the sample is often destroyed by the x ray radiation used to study it. This means that nothing in the gas or liquid state can be analyzed via x ray crystallography. Also, rare or hard to synthesize samples may be difficult to study, because there may not be enough of the sample for the radiation to provide a clear image. Thirdly, studying biological samples can be problematic because the radiation used to study the samples is most likely going to harm or destroy the living tissues.

One must also consider that x-ray crystallography takes a huge amount of time to complete upon one protein structure. The rough time estimates for each step of the process goes as follows: Cloning and purification of a protein structure to take up to 3-6 months with perfect execution and 99% purification. Crystallization can take up to 1-12 months pertaining to the physical properties of the protein which is completely based on the favorable enthalpy in which crystal formation is induced and the given solvent that the crystal is induced in. In addition data collection on the protein crystallized structure can take up to a month. Lastly, phasing the structure in solution can take about 3 months to complete. With this said, the process is not quick and with that comes financial issues when taking up a large time span and utilization of various laboratory equipment.

==Part Creation==

Part creation is the process of making a 3D model that can later be used to generate Drawings, or as part of an Assembly.  

Parts can be created on their own, or while editing an Assembly.

To make a Part, one can either build it from scratch, or build it based on existing parts by using the Derived Part function.  The Derived Part function imports the 3D model of another part (the parent) and allows the new part (the child) to use features of this part in the creation process of the new part.  The child will always be linked to the parent.  So if the parent is altered, then the child will adopt the changes as well.

The concept of using Derived Parts is useful for many applications.  When building Parts that must mate with existing Parts, the mating surface of the new Part can be Derived from the old Part.  

An example of this would be a bolted flange that attaches to the side of a tank the designer is currently working on.  Or another case could be if the designer is building some tooling like a mold to cast a part that was previously modeled.  The mold could have all of its casting surfaces derived from the Part Model.  This is extremely useful if the Part Model is complex, or still in development.

Using Derived Parts can also be used to show a part though various stages of manufacturing.  A part that is created from a casting can be first created to represent its as cast state.  Then a Derived Part can be created from the first to show the finished product after machining operations.

==Types of Parts==

There are three main types of Parts.  

* Standard Parts
* Sheet Metal Parts
* iParts (sometimes called Factories)

'''Standard Parts''' are plain 3D models.  All Inventor generated parts share the features available to Standard Parts.

'''Sheet Metal Parts''' contain additional design tools specially suited to making components made from thin, ductile material. Since oftentimes these types of parts are bent, Inventor contains several tools to aid the designer.  While creating a Sheet Metal Part, the designer has the option to view a 'Flat Layout' of the current model.  This shows the designer how his/her material would have to be cut in order produce the part. If the designer assigned the proper material to the model, then Inventor will modify the Flat Layout to reflect the proper bend allowances.

'''iParts''' is a single 3D model that has variables can be set when inserting the iPart into an Assembly which allows the iPart to become on of an entire family of parts.  An example of this would be a screw.  As you know there are probably thousands of different sizes of screws available to make the products we use every day.  But the vast majority of these screws are basically the same with the exception of their diameter, length, and thread pitch.  With an iPart, the designer can easily program the hundreds of combinations of these variables into a single model.  Then when the designer needs any one of these screws, she can simply insert the iPart, select the diameter, length, and thread pitch, and the new screw is ready to be used.

Any part can be converted into an iParts.  Thus even a Sheet Metal Part can be an iPart.  The designer is not limited to choosing to make an iPart over any other type of part.

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.

* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]] (requests for importation) to bring the material over in compliance with the GFDL.
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.

== Regarding [[Structrual biochemistry]] ==
I have tagged the page as a query, please see if you made a mistake. I also removed an incorrect statement from that edit, criminal substitution of a compound (not the quality) was the reason for the poisoning.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 05:35, 20 October 2008 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

The spectrum of biochemistry studies span numerous fields of science. Biochemistry finds roots in the fields of [[Structural Biochemistry/Physics|physics]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemistry|chemistry]] and biology; though its connotations rest primarily in the fields of [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemistry|chemistry]] and biology, as the term ''biochemistry'' implies.

== Physics ==

Biochemistry ties to [[Structural Biochemistry/Physics|physics]] as a result of biomolecules abiding by the same physical laws as all other molecules, thus being affected by the laws of [[Structural Biochemistry/Thermodynamics|thermodynamics]] and the principles of [[Structural Biochemistry/Bioenergetics|bio-energetics]].  Biomolecules undergo reactions which, like reactions of other molecules, either release energy[ as they occur spontaneously, or require energy to proceed.  Spontaneous reactions generally increase [[Structural Biochemistry/Entropy|entropy]], the disorder of a system, though spontaneity is determined by the Gibbs' [[Structural Biochemistry/Free energy|free energy]] equation: 
&lt;math&gt;
\Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S
&lt;/math&gt;

== Chemistry ==

The principles of chemistry is crucial to the field of biochemistry.  [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding|Bonding ]]and interactions between atoms and molecules are vital to the existence of biomolecules and life in general.

[[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Hydrogen bonds|Hydrogen bonding]] is one aspect of the topic of bonding and interactions in the field of [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemistry|chemistry]], but has proven incredibly important to biochemistry, as bonds between carbon and oxygen are critical to life.  With hydrocarbons being fundamental organic molecules, as well as nitrogen being a major element in [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acids]], and thus [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|proteins]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Hydrogen bonds|hydrogen bonds]] are key to stability of biomolecules composed highly of oxygen, hydrogen and nitrogen.

Other interactions that are key to biochemistry are [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Covalent bonds|covalent bonds]] (which are general bonds between atoms), [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Van der Waals interaction|Van der Waals interactions]] (which are interactions between molecules as they get very near one another), and [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Ionic interaction|ionic interactions]] (bonding interactions between positively and negatively charged atoms or molecules).

== Biology ==

Without biology, there would be no purpose for the study biochemistry, since biology is the study of living organisms and biochemistry is the study of the functions of biomolecules and their structures.  Biochemistry involves studying the cells, and the functions of its components, since it focuses on biomolecules.  Similarly, biochemists must consider genetics, since  [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|proteins]] are a crucial aspect of the processes of life and proteins are composed of  [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acids]] and are major biomolecules to study.

Biochemistry has legitimate reason to focus on the process of evolution, since evolution has been the continuing process of the development of life and biomolecules as a group.  Evolution on earth began with single-celled organisms capable of self-replication.  There are many theories regarding how the formation of early life occurred, and many scientific experiments and theories are in play at any given time.  Recently an old experiment of Stanley Miller's&lt;ref name=&quot;Note-Miller&quot;&gt;Stanley Miller was a renowned biochemist working with Harold Urey on an experiment simulating hypothetical early atmospheric conditions to test whether life could begin spontaneously from such conditions.&lt;/ref&gt; was discovered and reanalyzed, with a simulated early Earth scenario, with lightning striking in volcanic eruption situations, yielding numerous amino acids being formed in small groups.  As such, it is possible that the formation of amino acids was one of the earliest steps in the evolution of biomolecules.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Cryo-Electron Microscopy''' specializes in interpreting and visualizing unstained biological complexes such as viruses, small [[Structural Biochemistry/Cell Organelles|organelle]], and [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Types of Macromolecules|macromolecular]] biological complexes of 200 kDa or larger preserved in vitreous (''i.e.'' glassy or non-crystalline) ice. The basic goal is to compare other electron microscopy techniques to use cryo-fixation to rapidly freeze the biological sample so as not to destroy its aqueous enviornment. This avoids ultrastructural changes, redistribution of elements, and washing away of substances. Specimens frozen in vitreous ice show a structure similar to the liquid state, or the native state. The near native imaging conditions allows three dimensional reconstruction of the cellular machinery. Using state of the art computer controlled, automated microscopes, image reconstruction software, and visualization tools, sub-nanometer resolution structures of large biological complexes can be achieved. In Cryo-Electron Microscopy, an electron beam, a stream of high energy particles bombards the sample. The image that is viewed is a result of the interaction of the sample with this beam. Most of the electrons that form the high resolution image appear due to elastic scattering, where only their trajectory has been changed, but their energy is unaffected. However, a small fraction of the electrons transfer some of their energy to the sample. This energy accumulates and can break apart molecular bonds, destroying the sample after some time. Therefore, for high-resolution imaging, low dose parameters require that the area to be imaged is not exposed until the picture is actually taken. 

Cryo-electron microscopy can be performed by various methods of specimen preparation, two popular methods use  thin film and vitreous sections of biological material. The thin film method requires biological material to be placed on an electron microscopy grid and is rapidly frozen close to liquid nitrogen temperatures. Larger samples (vitreous sections) can be vitrified by different methods including high pressure freezing. These samples can then be cut thinly and placed on the electron microscopy grid, similar to the thin film. These samples must remain at liquid nitrogen temperature to undergo the high vacuum and are exposed to the electrons.  

One branch of Cryo-electron microscopy is Cyro-Electron tomography (CET). Cyro-electron tomography is performed at cryogenic temperatures as is cryo-electron microscopy; CET constructs a 3D sample from 2D images. 

==Uses for Cryo-Electron Microscopy==
Cryo-electron microscopy is used in a variety of fields. Nanoparticle research relies heavily on electron microscopy for the visualization of small particles. Pharmaceutical companies doing drug research utilize electron microscopy to help predict the behavior of drugs and biological matter. In the case of pharmaceutical research a 3D visualization is extremely useful and at cyro-electron microscopy proposes the least damage to the sample to obtain a usable image.

==Advantages in using Cryo-Electron Microscopy==
# Allows the examination of native and hydrated structural features of the biological sample. The sample is always in solution and never comes into contact with an adhering surface. Therefore, the shape that is observed is the true shape of the hydrated molecule in solution and has not been distorted by attaching itself and flattening against the supporting film.
# Provides good preservation of biological structure in the microscope vacuum.
# There are no stains or chemical fixatives to distort the sample. When stained, the sample can be damaged in many ways, such as flattening and twisting.
# When the sample adheres to the carbon grid, it could stick in a preferential orientation. If this happens, then information will be missing from the final image set (a missing cone), and the resolution of the calculated model in that direction will be absent.
# Provides a 2-5 fold reduction in radiation damage compared to similar sugar-embedded or freeze-dried samples at room temperature. The reason behind this is thought to be from decreasing the temperature-dependent rearrangement or diffusion of fragments resulting from bond-fracture. In the solid frozen state, rearrangement or diffusion is decreased and the protein conformation is more likely to be maintained up to higher levels of irradiation.
# Can observe contrast between nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids to be distinguished.
# Enables one to control the chemical environment so that examination of different functional states of molecules is possible.

==Disadvantages in using Cryo-Electron Microscopy==
# Very low signal to noise ratio. Biological macromolecules are normally made up of carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. The electron absorption of such molecules is very low. As a result, image contrast is also very low and it is hard to detect features when dealing with just a few images.
# Difficult to obtain images from tilted specimen. The ice cross section of a tilted frozen sample is too thick to yield good images.
# Charging is more widespread when imaging a tilted frozen sample.
# More time consuming to generate samples. However, this is generally not a big problem, especially once a working protocol is designed and good samples are readily available.
# If vitreous ice cannot be easily formed, the resulting cubic ice absorbs electrons very easily and the frozen sample is basically worthless.
# Sample must be maintained at less than 135 degrees Celsius.

==Preparation of Frozen-hydrated Biological Specimens==
The following are some general procedures for preparing frozen-hydrated biological specimens:
1)Development of a thin layer of the biological specimen.
2)Rapid cooling of the specimen to the vitreous state.
3)Transfer the specimen to the electron microscope without rewarming above the devitrification temperature.
4)Observe the specimen below the devitrification temperature with an electron dose that is low enough to preserve the structure of the sample.

==Cryo-Electron Tomography==
[[File:TomographyPrinciple Illustration.png|thumb||120px|left|alt=Example alt text|This is a basic depiction of Tomography. In Cryo-ET, the images are obtained by tilting the specimen along an axis; this picture does not display this.]]

Tomography uses the effects and differences that waves of energy have on a solid object to produce a three dimensional image of the internal structure. Cryo-Electron Tomography is a branch of Cryo-Electron Microscopy in which two dimensional projections of a frozen sample, at cryogenic temperatures, are recorded and used to reconstruct a three-dimensional structure by computed back projection. This is done using a transmission electron microscope to take successive images of a sample while tilting the sample around an axis. The “projection theorem” states that a 3D object can be retrieved from its projections along different directions.  So to obtain a 3D description of an object, it must be projected along different directions; this is achieved by incrementally tilting the specimen. Due to the limitations with the transmission electron microscope (TEM), the specimen can only be tilted to +- 60-70 degrees, and not to 90 degrees which would be necessary to retrieve all the 3D information about the specimen. 

Cryo-ET is a very accurate way to determine the three-dimensional structure of a specimen because the rapid freezing of the object and cryogenic temperatures gives a good preservation of the structure and good time resolution of certain processes. For example, the rapid freezing of cells and tissues at a certain point in cellular processes can give a good understanding of the structure and activity of those cells and tissues at a certain point in time during that particular cellular process. This type of tomography aids in the learning of cells and their organelles at a more dynamic level. Each organelle of a cell is produced in a different color, in order to facilitate the viewing process. The cells are frozen in order for the cell to retain its original structure. Freezing such specimens is done by placing them on a grid, blotting them in a thin layer of water and emerging them into ethane before storing them into liquid nitrogen. The use of cyro-electron tomography involves the study of almost all specimens, such as viruses. This tool can be helpful in understanding the replication states of viruses, as well as, the individual structures that viruses can become. A recent study has been done on the spikes of the viruses and the various structures the spikes affect the virus. Today, cyro-electron tomography is used to help find a cure for cancer by assessing the building blocks of the protein, cadherins, which aid in blocking cancerous tumors for spreading throughout the body.  The information obtained through Cryo-ET can aid in comprehending and understanding the structural basis, and therefore, the function of many cellular processes.

There are limitations with Cryo-ET. The main limitation is the thickness of the specimen. The specimen must been thin enough for it to freeze well and so that it can be properly collected with the TEM. If the specimen is too thick, it must be cut into thinner slices while the temperature is still very low, so that re-crystallization does not occur. There are a couple ways to obtain the images, one of the is by fixed tilt increments, and the other is by graduated tilt increments. Graduated tilt increments are more favorable, this is when the tilt increment is proportional to the cosine of the tilt angle. Another issue with Cryo-ET is radiation damage. To prevent radiation damage, the specimen should be imaged under low electron dose conditions, leading to a more limited resolution in the 3D image obtained, and it also limits the specimen thickness needed for Cryo-ET.

==Icosahedral Reconstruction==
[[File:Rhinovirus.PNG|thumb|alt=Rhinovirus|Rhinovirus, a virus with icosahedral symmetry.]]
Icosahedral Reconstruction refers to the application of cryo-electron microscopy in elucidating the structure of particles with appropriate (icosahedral) symmetry.  The high internal symmetry of icosahedral specimens makes it easier to determine the positions of symmetry elements, thereby decreasing the amount of images required to determine the 3D structure of the specimen.&lt;ref&gt;Jiang, Wen, Zongli Li, Zhixian Zhang, Christopher R. Booth, and Matthew L. Baker. &quot;Semi-automated Icosahedral Particle Reconstruction at Sub-nanometer Resolution.&quot; Journal of Structural Biology . 136. (2001): 214-225. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This may seem like an arbitrary and irrelevant solid to apply to microscopy, but in fact there is an enormous number of particles that contain such symmetry.  Examples of icosahedral particles include the majority of human viruses, as well as some molecules such as dodecahydro-closo-dodecaborate ion (B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; H&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;) and the buckminsterfullerene.[[File:Icosahedron.gif|thumb|left||120px|alt=Example alt text|An icosahedron.]]

A number of virus structures have been predicted and subsequently experimentally determined through the use of icosahedral reconstruction.  An icosahedron belongs to the high symmetry group I&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt; which contains 120 symmetry operations, possibly most unique being the six five-fold symmetry axes.&lt;ref&gt;Miessler, Gary. Inorganic Chemistry. 3rd ed. Dehli: Pearson Education in South Asia, 2007. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The properties of this symmetry group are essential for the application of cryo-electron microscopy.&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, S.D., and S.J. Butcher. &quot;Three-Dimensional Reconstruction of Icosahedral Particles-The Uncommon Line.&quot; Journal of Structural Biology . 116. (1996): 48-55. Print. 
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Helical Reconstruction==
Helical Reconstruction is a method that takes advantage of Cryo-Electron Microscopy in order to develop a three-dimensional structure for certain &quot;filamentous&quot; biological structures. This method used the 2-D projection images from Cryo-Electron microscopy to produce these 3-d Images as long as there is helical symmetry. This method however cannot be applied to structures that contain &quot;seams&quot; or &quot;pertubations&quot;. There is a new method known as asymmetrical helical reconstruction that can be applied to helical structures that contain &quot;seams&quot;. Similar to conventional Helical reconstruction methods, Fourier transform images are used to produce the layer line data which are then used to produce the 3-d structures.

Helical reconstruction allows the formation of large groups by regular contacts of a single type of protein molecule. Helical symmetry can be found in filamentous viruses (e.g., Pf1), in the proteins of the actin, tubulin, or other cytoskeleton, or in the proteins that form 2-D crystals folded onto the surface of a cylinder, such as the acetyocholine receptor or CopA.

==Electron Crystallography==
Electron crystallography is a form of microscopy that uses a beam of electrons to construct images of small solids such as proteins. This process is used to determine and predict the structure and arrangement of a protein from secondary structure crystals such as alpha helices or beta sheets based on electron scattering. It can be used to study both organic and inorganic matters, and also protein structures. Electron Crystallography complements X-ray crystallography in many ways but also succeeds where X-ray crystallography fails. For example, X-ray crystallography study requires the quaternary structure of proteins which is often hard to attain than secondary structures. Electron Crystallography presents a problem in that it can cause radiation damage to the proteins under analysis. This hinders the range and function of the microscopy process. In order to reduce radiation damage, cryofixation, in which the imaging takes place in very low temperatures such as that of liquid nitrogen, is implemented. This resource is especially valuable when a specific protein is easily denatured or damaged by the electrons from the microscope.

A crystal structure determination includes two steps: ‘solving’ which finds a model of the heaviest atoms within about 0.25 Å using EM-images; and ‘refine’, which finds all atoms within about 0.02 Å using Selected Area Electron Diffraction or Convergent Beam Electron Diffraction data.

The use of electron diffraction in order to study the structures of crystals began in Moscow in 1937-1938 among a group of scientist led by Pinsker and Vainshtein. Their study used their own electron diffraction cameras that had relatively low acceleration to record electron diffraction data of different materials. From this data, they were able to locate hydrogen atoms in crystal structures which can not be done using X-ray diffraction. In order to solve unknown structures, phase information is needed which was first introduced by Hauptmann and Karle in 1953 called the &quot;direct methods&quot;. Combining the use of direct phasing methods with modern day computers, electron crystallography has made significance advances in structure determination of crystals and other molecules.

There are two different electron diffraction techniques: 1)Selected Area Electron Diffraction (SAED)which requires near kinematic condition and applies for unit cell dimension &gt;10 Å and for thin specimens &lt;200 Å; 2)Convergent Beam Electron Diffraction (CBED)which makes use of dynamical effects and applies for unit cell dimensions &lt;10 Å and for thick specimens &gt;200 Å

Why electrons? Electrons are used in favor of X-rays because it is 10^4-10^5 times stronger interaction with matter compared with X-ray; and their phases are present in high resolution electron microscopy images.

There are some key advantages of electron crystallography compared to X-ray crystallography. One of these advantages is that electron crystallography can analyze much smaller crystals. This is because electrons interact more dominantly with matter than X-rays do. Another advantage is that electron beams can be focused by magnetic lenses to create an image while X-rays cannot form an image. Because the mechanism by which electrons interact with matter is based on the electrons detecting potential distributions in crystals compared to the mechanism of X-rays which depends on the X-rays detecting electron density distribution, electron crystallography can be used in certain situations that X-ray crystallography cannot. For example, the oxidation states of atoms in a crystal.

Using electron crystallography to determine structure is important due to the ability for a protein to be observed in its natural form. By utilizing electron crystallography, one can observe a protein in a lipid-protein bilayer in the structure that it is found in, thus allowing for better determination of function.

==Single-particle electron microscopy==

The techniques used to reconstruct the 3 Dimensional images of the molecule from a collections of 2-D images is called electron microscopy. It presents to structural biochemists insight views in term of structural information of many biological molecules because of its easy-to-access features. In order to acquire 3D structure from this method, two requirement must met. 

1.  reasonable size of proteins to large macro-molecular assemblies without need to use crystals  
2. the molecules must exist in many identical copies 

The resolution produced by electron tomography have a low resolution and high noise. The main goal of the single particle electron microscopy is to determine the geometric relation between the collected projection images. In the year of 2008, scientist were able to made it possible to trace the backbone of the polypetide chains and build atomic models. Single Particles EM indeed have the capability to deliver structural information at near atomic resolution.   

The 3D structure would be the result of these following steps:

1) Sample preparation. This is the step where sample is collected and place on (metal) plate to generate the best contrast. There are three technique used to prepare the samples for single particle EM. 
a) Negative staining : molecules are adsorbed to a continuous carbon film in which molecules are put into a metal plate by drying  
b) vitrification: sample is plunged into liquid ethane to preserve molecules in a native environment, it produced low contrast. (preserving them in a fully hydrated state)Vitrification is the '''best''' speciment preparation method, but not applicable to heterogeneous samples. 
c) Cryo negative staining:  high contrast image immersed in high ionic strength of saturated ammonium molybdate solution. It is good to study the small and heterogeneous samples. 

2) Particle picking. This is one of the most tedious processes of all because electron microscopists have to classify and separate particles according to their similarities in orientations; all these works are done by hand in order to achieve maximum efficiency. Having said that automated picking programs have been developed, but they failed to perform the task thank to the low signal-to-noise ratio. Result of this step is collection of small individual images of particles. 

3) Generate initial model. Individual images collected from previous step are used to build a preliminary model. RCT is the primary method that is being used to generate initial models. 
'''Random Conial Tilt Reconstruction''' is being use throughout the process. Random Conical Tilt are the reconstruction of the 3 dimensional image one at high tilt angle and the other at untilt angle. The tilt angles allowd the testing samples to align in  unique orientations.  Please see the image at the right for the figure. Random Conical Tilt is common used in negatively or cryo-negatively stained speciments, in which works well with heterogenous particle solutions. 

[[File:Random Conial Tilt.png|thumb|alt=A cartoon centipede reads books and types on a laptop.|The Wikipede edits ''[[Random Conial Tilt]]''.]]

4) Refinement. The preliminary model is used to calculate for better alignment using Euler angles, in-plane rotated/unrotated shifts of particles. From refined data, a new 3D structure of a molecule is reconstructed. The risk of overrefinement happeneds when the testing negative temperature is applied.   

Single-particle electron microscopy is having advantages ahead of electron crystallographic because its economic features. Unlike crystallographic, it does not require crystals – meaning samples don’t have to be pure - which take a lot more works to achieve. Another advantage is that single particle electron microscopy takes very little sample which always makes researchers happy.

One of the disadvantages of single particle electron microscopy, however, is that it is difficult to determine the resolution of density maps as well as their accuracy. Since there is no evidence of a method to check for accuracy, often the only thing that can be done is to repeat the process and compare results to previous results. Therefore, results can only be assessed on the basis of consistency rather than accuracy. 

===Protein-Lipid Arrays===
Electron crystallography has been used in the study of membrane proteins by analyzing arrays of samples called protein-lipid arrays.  These arrays can be arranged in many different ways and offer many advantages and disadvantages.  Two forms that have given the most useful density maps of membrane proteins are the two dimensional sheet like crystal arrays and the tubular like crystal arrays.  These are so precise that they can reveal information about individual lipid molecules and the protein side chains due to averaging the many unit cells in the image of a sheet or tube like array enhancing the poor signal-to-noise ratio.

Over the last few decades there has been much advancement in the methods used to create these protein-lipid arrays both in tubes and sheets from detergent-solubilized purified proteins but no advancements in screens have been made like an easily manipulated robotic screen.  Despite much research in the field they still lack the ability to quickly and reliably check the quality of the samples.  Several laboratories have advanced the methods of analysis of these crystals making the process more efficient and more user friendly by enhancing the existing software.

The tubular crystals have not seen as extensive use as the sheet crystals even though their helical array symmetry allows for substantial advantages in determining structure.  One image of a tube contains many different views of the same molecule which is enough to reconstruct it in three dimensions without the need for tilting.  To correct for distortions tubes are processed in a similar way to sheets, where two repeat lengths are divided into shorter pieces and are then compared to a reference structure to determine the parameters needed to help identify the structure completely.  This procedure traditionally uses Fourier-Bessel methods to assess the data, enabling them to analyze the extent of helical symmetry preservation and twofold symmetry perpendicular to the tube axis, which can correct for the focus changes at different levels of the structure.  Another method has been developed that doesn’t employ the Fourier-Bessel methods and instead treats segments as strings of single particles.  This alternative is becoming more popularly used for extracting structural information from poorly ordered helical polymers such as tubular protein-lipid crystals.  This shows great potential for determining structures from tubes at the near atomic level of resolution.

Methods involved in electron crystallography include free-trapping to create different conformational states. To freeze-trap the specimen, the electron microscope grid is placed into liquid nitrogen-cooled ethane, which cools the specimen rapidly enough that thus allows for the trapping of a structure of a lipid-protein array which has a life-time of a millisecond or longer. The freeze-trapped protein can be activated through light or an appropriate ligand. Recent developments of helium-cooled top-entry freeze-trapping has resulted in a more clear image for data collection, and hopefully would allow for the gating mechanism of the protein-lipid bilayer to be described in more detail.

Additionally, molecular tomography is used to explore proteins in their functional context. A three-dimensional picture of an entire scene is possible to create though taking images from a series of tilt views, therefore creating a better three-dimensional image.

==Single-molecule methods==
It is a method that observing dynamic behavior of single molecule to determine mechanism of action at level of an individual molecule, and to identify, sort and compare subpopulation and substructure within cell. In order to characterize the dynamics of molecular structures, scientists look to real-time trajectories of individual molecule; and by observing many of them, a histogram of the dynamical properties over the population could be figured. 

X-ray crystallography or NMR, in comparison to single-molecule methods, provides detail structural view but limit by static molecular view and ensemble average.

1.	Single-molecule manipulation: In this method, molecules are attached to an external probe which exerts defined forces or torques on molecule in order to characterize their mechanical properties. This method is also called atomic force microscopy (AMF). Because cell is seen as a factory in which many processes are carried out by specialized machinery which converts the chemical energy into force, torque and mechanical work - of which the attached probe will now come in to detect the dynamics and mechanism. This method is recently used to study the folding and unfolding of RNA molecules and the enzymes that catalyze these reactions, and to study RNA polymerase.

2.	Single-molecule detection: The molecule is tagged with a fluorescent label in two locations in the form of a “donor” and “acceptor” that can undergo fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). The trajectory of molecules then can be watched regarding to a change in the intensity of the florescence of the probe or regarding to the change in FRET. Another name of this method is fluorescence method. . This is a powerful method to study dynamic behavior of molecules, their stability and track particles’ movements in and outside cell. This method is used to study, for example, the multiple interactions during translation by the ribosome.

Between the two mentioned above, the fluorescence detection method is preferable to researchers because it requires less elaborate and complex instrumentations, but the down side is the photons collected by instrument is limited.

むかし むかし、 ある ところ に おじいさん と おばあさん が いました。 子ども が いなかった ので おじいさん と おばあさん は さびしく て、
「手 の 指 ほど の 小さい こども でも いい から おさずけ ください。」
と おてんとうさま に お願い しました。 ある日、 本当 に 手 の 指 くらい の こども が 生まれて きました。 おじいさん と おばあさん は よろこび ました。 とても 小さい 男の子 だった ので、 いっすんぼうし という 名 を つけ、 かわいがって そだて ました。 けれども、三年 たっても いっすんぼうし は ちっとも 大きく なり ません。 五年 たっても、 大きく なり ません。 十年 たっても、 いっすんぼうし は まだ 生まれた とき と 同じ ように 手 の 指 の 高さ の 男の子 です。 おじいさん と おばあさん は しんぱい に なり ました が、 いくら だいじ に して も、 いくら 食べ させて も いっすんぼうし は 大きく なり ません。

小さな いっすんぼうし は、 家 で おばあさん の てつだい も できない し、 畑 で おじいさん と いっしょ に 働いて も 草 を 一本 しか はこべ ません。 いっすんぼうし は おどり と うた が じょうず に なり ました が せ が のび ない ので 仕事 が でき ません。 それ に 村 の こども たち に いつも ばか に されて いました。 みな は いっすんぼうし の こと を 「ちび、 ちび」 と よんで いました。 いっすんぼうし は つまらなくて ある日 たび に でかける こと に し ました。 おじいさん と おばあさん に
「わたし は みやこ に 仕事 を 見つけ に 行き ます。」
と 言い ました。 おじいさん と おばあさん は さびしかった けれども、 しかたがなく、 いっすんぼうし に おわん と おはし と はり を 持たせ ました。 そして、 いっすんぼうし は おわん を 傘 の かわり に かぶって、 はり を 刀 に し、 おはし を つえ の かわり に して みやこ に むかって 歩き はじめ ました。

いっすんぼうし は 歩き つづけ ました が、 行け ども 行け ども みやこ は 遠く て まだ つき ません。 とちゅう で、 あり に 会って、 道 を たずね ました。

&lt;poem&gt;
「たんぽぽ よこちょう、
　つくし の はずれ、
　川 を あがる。」
&lt;/poem&gt;

と あり が 教えて くれ ました。いっすんぼうし は たんぽぽ の 中 を 歩き、 つくし の 中 を 歩き つづけて、 川 に つき ました。かぶって いた おわん を 船 に して、 おはし の つえ を かい に して、 いっすんぼうし は 力いっぱい 川 を こぎ あがって 行き ました。 やっと、 大きな 橋 の ところ に 来る と、 おおぜい の 人 が その 橋 を 渡って いた ので、 「ここ は みやこ だ。」と 思って いっすんぼうし は おわん の 船 を おり ました。

みやこ には 人 が たくさん いて、 いそがしそう に あちこち 歩いて い ました。 小さな いっすんぼうし に とって、 こんで いる 道 は あぶない 場所 でした。 「つぶされ ない ように 気をつけ よう。」と 思って、 いっすんぼうし は 町 を 歩き ました。 しずかな 道 を 通って 立派 な おやしき の 前 に 出 ました。 そこ は 大尽 の 家 でした。 いっすんぼうし は げんかん の ところ まで 行って
「ごめんください。 お願いします。」
と よび ました。 すると、 だれか が やって 来て、
「声 が 聞こえた けど だれ も い ない な。」
と 言い ました。
「ここ に います。げた の そば に い ます よ。」
と 小さな いっすんぼうし が 答え ました。その 人 は げた の 方 を のぞいて そこ に 見た こと も ない 小さい 人間 が いた ので おどろき ました。そして いっすんぼうし を つまみ あげて、 おひめさま の ところ に つれて 行き ました。 おひめさま の 前 で いっすんぼうし は おどったり、 うたったり し ました。 たいへん じょうず だった ので、 みな は びっくり し ました。 とくに おひめさま は その 小さな 男の子 が かわいく て、 いつも そば に いて ほしく なり ました。 いっすんぼうし は 大尽 の 家 で せいかつ する こと に なって、 本 を めくったり、 墨 を すったり して おひめさま の てつだい を して すごし ました。 はり で 刀 の れんしゅう も ねっしん に し ました。 おひめさま が でかける 時 は、 いつも いっすんぼうし を つれて 行き ました。

ある 日、 おひめさま は きょうみずでら に かんのん さま を お参り に 行き ました。 その 帰り道 で、 とつぜん わるい おに が やって 来て、 おひめさま を おそい ました。 おに は おひめさま を さらおう と し ました。 いっすんぼうし が 声 を 上げて
「いっすんぼうし ここ に あり。 かくご しろ。」
と さけび ました。おに は いっすんぼうし を つまみ 上げ、 手 の 指 くらい の 男の子 を 見て、
「そんな に 小さな おまえ に 何 が できる。 この ちび め。」
と あざわらい ました。 そして、 いっすんぼうし を のみ込んで しまい ました。 でも、 おに の おなか の 中 で、 いっすんぼうし は はり の 刀 で あちこち さし ながら、 上 に のぼって 行き ました。
「いたい、いたい。」
と おに が さけび声 を 上げ ました が、 いっすんぼうし は 力いっぱい さし つづけて、 おに の 鼻 から とび 出て きました。 おに は こうさん して にげて 行き ました。

おひめさま は おに が おとした たからもの を 拾って、 いっすんぼうし に こう 言い ました。
「これ は おに の たからもの で、 うちでのこづち という もの です。 これ を ふれ ば、 願い が かなう そう です よ。」
たすけ られた おひめさま は いっすんぼうし に
「あなた は 何 が ほしい の です か。」
と きき ました。
「大きく なり たい です。」
と いっすんぼうし が 答え ました。 おひめさま は
「大きく なれ、 大きく なれ。」
と 言い ながら うちでのこづち を ふり ました。 すると、 いっすんぼうし は みるみるうちに 大きく なって、 立派 な わかもの に なり ました。 そして 大尽 の 家 に 帰って、 おひめさま は 大きく なった いっすんぼうし の およめさん に なり ました。 いっすんぼうし は おじいさん と おばあさん を みやこ に よびよせて、 みな は いっしょ に 長く しあわせ に くらし ました。 めでたし めでたし。

      <text xml:space="preserve">Although the term XRX was originally intended to connote the three standards - XForms, REST and XQuery, the term has been used by different people in different ways and has a spectum of defintions from very broad to very specific.

One the most broad definitions, XRX can connote any web application architecture that stores XML on the client with REST interfaces to XML on the server.  The only aspect that these architectures have in common is that they use a no-shredding system to store and edit records.

One of the most specific definitions and the definition that is used in this book is the use of XForms on the client, REST interfaces and XQuery on the server.  This implies that many of the features of these standards are integral to the overall solution.

      <text xml:space="preserve">This is my draft, I need to edit it.

The ancient Greek Philosophers looked at the world and tried to describe it. 

(Democritus and Leucippus, Greek philosophers in the 5th century BC, presented the first theory of atoms )

They wanted to know what things were made of.
They new that the things in the world had substance. 
They take up space. You can touch them and push against them.
They called this substance that all things are made of ...

Matter

Matter is defined as any substance in the universe that has mass and occupies space.

Mass is a measure of how much substance is in an object. 
On earth we measure mass by weighing an object.
Weight, however can change. 
An person who weighs 180 pounds on the Earth would only weigh
about 30 pounds on the moon.

Anyway,
These same Greek philosophers wanted to find out what the universe is built of, so they wondered ...

What if we cut this piece of chalk in half, and then cut that piece of chalk in half, and so on and so on.

Wouldn't there eventually be some place where we couldn't cut any more?
Some fundamental unit that the universe was made of?

They called this object an Atom.

Atom -  a(not) tom (to cut) - The smallest unit of matter.
also
       -The smallest component of an element that still has the properties of that element.
(The atomic theory is one of the most basic theories of science. It says that all matter is made up of atoms.)
What is an element?
To understand element we need to go further ahead in time to the middle ages when Alchemy was king.

The ancient alchemists began to study matter in their search for the philosopher's stone that could turn lead into gold. 

Well to do that, you need to understand what gold is, and what lead is.

Ancient alchemists found that atoms can be combined to make all the things found on Earth, but that some things are in a pure state, that is that all of the atoms in them are the same type of atom. 

Element - matter composed only of one type of atom
       -matter composed of atoms that have all the same atomic number.

There are 92 naturally occuring (technidium may be an exception though) elements found on Earth. Elements such as 
Iron, silver, oxygen, hydrogen, Nitrogen, Sulfur, Calcium, and Gold

We list these elements on a chart called the periodic table of elements. Which gives data about them and is organized to show trends in how the elements interact with each other.

The study of matter and it's transformations is called Chemistry.


Now back to the atom.
We could name elements and what properties they had, but we did not understand why they acted as they did until we were able to understand the structure of an atom. This was discovered in the late 19th and 20th centuries by many different scientists.

(For more on this, see physics - The study of the fundamental laws of nature)
Atomic structure -  DRAW

proton - Particle in nucleus. positive charge +1. Weight = 1 Dalton (unit named after scientist who proposed the modern atomic theory)

neutron - Particle in nucleus. no charge. Weight = 1 Dalton
electron - negatively charged particle -1, circles nucleus. Weight 1/1836 Daltons  (about 9.11 × 10−31 kg)

Atomic number -  number of protons in an atom.
Atomic mass -  number of protons and neutrons in an atom.

Return to definition:
Element -  -matter composed of atoms that have all the same atomic number.

He (Helium) atomic number 2 - 2 protons 2 electrons ( no charge)
	atomic mass 4 - 2 protons 2 neutrons (ignore mass of electrons)

isotope -  atoms of the same element that have different # of neutrons
 He 3 - isotope of helium

Atomic weight - Average atomic mass of atoms in an element. Includes differences due to different percentages of isotopes. measured in grams.

On earth Atomic mass is about the same as atomic weight. Assume the same.


THE DISCOVERY of the structure of the atom changed how we looked at the world. For one, it explained chemistry and the rules of the periodic table. 
The ways that atoms combine are determined by protons  and electrons.

electrons don't simply float everywhere. They are found at descrete distances from the nucleus in  an area called an orbital . These orbitals form layers of electrons around the nucleus called shells .

As atoms get bigger, they have more electrons, and they have more shells.

.He.   . .Li .
An orbital can only hold a fixed number of electrons. When the shell is filled, electrons must begin to fill a new orbital.

Atoms prefer to have their outer shell completely filled.

 1s2 2s2 2p6 3s2 3p6 4s2 3d10

Atoms can lose or gain electrons. This changes the charge.

A charged atom is called an Ion .
Na outer shell has one e-   often loses it to make Na+ ion .


molecule - Two or more atoms linked by a chemical bond

Ionic bond - a bond formed when two or more atoms lose or gain electrons to form an ion.

Na + Cl -
They stick to each other to form a neutral molecule NaCl (table salt).

(loss of electrons - oxidation
gain of electrons - reduction
Redox reactions important to biology )

Sometimes atoms share an electron
Covalent bond - when two or more atoms share electrons

Water H2O 
DRAW with partial charges

Periodic table -  (except noble gasses) ones on outside tend to ionize and form ionic bonds. Ones in middle tend to form covalent bonds.

Different atoms have different numbers of electrons in their outer shell.
Determines electrons they have to form covalent bonds

H 1
O 2
N 3
C 4
S 5

molecules DRAW H2O, NH3, CH4

H2O
atomic mass/weight oxygen 16, hydrogen 1
2H@1=2
2O@16=16
H2O=18 AMU ( Atomic mass units) 

You can convert molecules to grams using a unit called a mole. defined such that One MOLE of something equals the weight in grams equal to the number of AMUs.
Mole - That amount of the substance containing exactly the same number of grams as the number of the atomic weight of the substance.
equal to a particular number of atoms or molecules called Avogadro's number
6.022x10 23

Use - One mole oxygen (16 grams) plus 2 moles hydrogen (2 grams) can be used to make one mole water molecules (18 grams)

Structure of water
	polar
	partial + and - charges
	mickey mouse ears shape


Properties of water inportant for living organisms
	1. Universal Solvent
Water Ionizes, polar, surrounds molecules, dissolves many substances
especially dissolves charged and polar substances.

This means that the cytoplasm in your cells, which are made of water, can contain many many different kinds of molecules.

 Hydrophilic - water loving
hydrophobic - water hating

Hydrophobic molecules are repelled by water. &quot;Squeezed out&quot; of it called the &quot;hydrophobic effect&quot;

Remember plasma membrane. - water squeezes non-polar molecules together.  Inside and outide stay separate.

	2. high heat of vaporization

Water requres lots of heat to change from water into steam.  2,452J/g.
This means that evaporating water (sweat) can cool your body in high temperatures.

	3. High specific heat
Specific heat is the amount of energy required to raise the temperature of one kilogram of the substance by one kelvin.
Liquid water heats up very slowly.

This means that it water helps organisms maintain a constant body temperature. It also keeps lake and ocean temperatures constant.


	4.Strong surface tension

The surface of the water makes a film that resists breaking. 
This is why certain insects can skate on the surface of the water.


	5. High cohesive strength
Water molecules stick to each other very strongly. Therefore it will cling to charged substances and form a coat on them. The cohesive force also pulls water up small spaces like straws called &quot;capillary action&quot; .
Capillary action is why water can be pulled from the ground to the tops of trees. 

	6. Ice floats
	Water is most dense at 4C therefore ice is less dense and will float.
This fact means that in the winter , ice insulates lakes and makes it possible for aquatic animals to survive the winter.

Lecture 11 -  macromolecules

Macromolecules
I. Intro
On Wednesday we talked about chemistry.
All things are made of Atoms. That atoms have different numbers of protons neutrons and electrons.
The number of protons decides the element. Atomic number.
That the number of electrons decides the bonding.

We also talked about Moles, the periodic table of elements, and the properties of water.

We will continue talking about chemical bonds, discuss pH and end with a discussion of the macromolecules that make up living organisms.

CHON
TRANSPARENCY  - COMMON LIVING ELEMENTS

II. weak bonds

As well as the strong ionic and covalent bonds(50-110kC/mole), there are many weaker bonds that help keep molecules together.

A. electrostatic / aqueous ionic bonds (5kC/mole)
result from the attraction between two ionized atoms or functional groups. Ionic bonds become very weak in water.

-COO - and NH3 +   

B. hydrogen bonds (4-5kC/mole)
result from electrostatic attraction between a covalently bonded hydrogen atom which has a partial positive charge, and electronegative atoms such as oxygen and nitrogen.

N-H --- O=C-

C. Van der Waals interactions (1-2 kC/mol)
A weak attraction between the protons of one atom and the electron cloud of the neighboring atoms even in uncharged (neutral) atoms.


D. hydrophobic attractions (1-3kC/mole)
Uncharged hydrophobic molecules will group together in water.
Mostly due to molecules avoiding water, not so much them being attracted to each other.
&quot;water and oil don't mix&quot;

In large molecules, these weaker forces play important roles in helping them molecules function and keep their shape.


III. Properties of water - Ionization
A. Water Ionizes
One property of water that we did not mention last time is that water can ionize. That is to say that water can break down from the neutral molecule H2O to two charged molecules H+ and OH- .

Any body of water will normally have a small number of ionized water molecules in it at any time.

B. Acids and bases
Sometimes a molecule dissolved in water will release H+ ions into the water. This makes the H+ concentration increase so that there are more H+ ions than OH ions. 

A molecule that can donate a hydrogen atom is called an acid.

Some molecules can attract and bind a hydrogen atom taking it out of solution. Such a chemical is called a base.

When water contains an acid it is said to be acidic.
When water contains a base it is said to be alkaline or basic.

C. pH
	1. We can measure how acidic or basic water is using a scale called pH. 

	2. pH is the log base 10 of the [H+] conc. 

pH=log10[H+]

1 liter of pure water has a H+ conc. of 1x10 -7
We call this pH 7 neutral
(
pH=log10[H+]
pH=-log10[10-7]
pH=-(-7)
pH=7
)

3. Notice the exponent is a negative one, this means that a smaller exponent means a larger number of H+ ions.

Numbers below 7 are acidic
Numbers above 7 are basic

The scale goes from 1 - 14
TRANSPARENCY
e.g.
pH 1 = 10-1 H+ 
One tenth of a mole of H+/liter
pH 14 = 10-14 H+
one hundred trillionth of a mole of H+ per liter

TRANSPARENCY

4. Remember the scale is logarithmic
Each number means 10 times more than the previous

D. Buffers
So every time you add a substance you have the possibility of changing the pH by a large amount.
We can moderate the affect of pH change by adding a Buffer.
TRANSPARENCY
A buffer is a substance that stabilizes the pH by absorbing and releasing H+ ions. 
It is usually a combination of a weak acid and it's conjugate base.

TRANSPARENCY

The cytoplasm and many other parts of living organism are buffered to prevent large changes in the pH. 

IV. Functional groups
we defined Molecules as two or more molecules bonded together. Some parts of a molecule have recognizable structures. These are some important groups of atoms that are found on larger molecules.

TRANSPARENCY

-OH hydroxyl group
a chemical with such a group is called an alcohol.
C=O Carbonyl group

-COOH Carboxyl group
a molecule with this group is called a carboxylic acid.

-NH2 amino group
a molecule with this group is called an amine.

-PO4 phosphate group


V. classes of macromolecules

A. Intro
In living systems, we deal with very large molecules. We call these molecules MACROMOLECULES.
Macromolecules are made of subunits called monomers. These monomers are combined to make complex polymers.

Often polymers formed by hydrolysis, a reaction where water is removed to form a bond between monomers.
TRANSPARENCY
There are four classes of macromolecules in living systems:
Carbohydrates, Lipids, Nucleic Acids, and Proteins
TRANSPARENCY
polymer			monomer
Carbohydrates		sugars
Lipids			fatty acids
Nucleic acids		nucleotides
proteins			amino acids


B. Carbohydrates - Sugars and starches
{Carbon chain hydrated (water)}
Note the water molecules across almost every carbon node.
Often form rings of 4,5 or 6 carbons.
Formula {C(H2O)}n

most abundant source of carbon in living organisms.

monosaccharides: fructose, glucose, ribose
TRANSPARENCY
disaccharides: lactose, sucrose (table sugar)
TRANSPARENCY
polysaccharides: starch, cellulose, glycogen

Conventional Machining, one of the most important material removal methods, is a collection of material-working processes in which power-driven machine tools, such as lathes, milling machines, and drill presses are used with a sharp cutting tool to mechanically cut the material to achieve the desired geometry. Machining is a part of the manufacture of almost all metal products. It is not uncommon for other materials to be machined.

Machining is advantageous to processes like molding and casting in terms of required setup time and cost, and as such is often used in a prototyping capacity.

=Processes=

Machining principally consists of several basic cutting operations:

*'''Turning''' is performed on a Lathe, removes material with rotating workpiece(s) and stationary cutting tools.  Note that while turning is performed in a lathe, the act of turning generally removes material from the outside diameter of the workpiece.  Other operations take place in a lathe as well, such as drilling, boring, broaching, reaming, threading, tapping, grooving, knurling, honing and parting.

*'''Milling''' is performed on a Milling Machine, removes material with generally stationary workpiece(s) and rotary cutting tools.  A Milling Machine is primarily similar to a drill press, with the additional element of the ability to move the workpiece along a coordinate system, to achieve feed across the tool.

*'''Drilling''' is performed on various machines, primarily Drill Presses.  Drilling is also frequently performed in Milling Machines, and on Lathes.

*'''Boring''' is performed on various machines, most frequently lathes, is a method of enlarging a pre-existing hole, or inside diameter.

*'''Grinding''' is performed on various grinding machines, and removes material utilizing an abrasive wheel, most generally.

*'''EDM''' , or Electro-Discharge Machining, removes material with an electrical arc. Techniques include Plunging specifically shaped dies into the workpiece, and cutting with a wire.

*'''Sawing''' , or roughly parting material with a steel blade, such as on a metal bandsaw.

===Chucks and Faceplates===
Lathe chucks are used greatly for holding what is going to be machined. There are two types of chucks, an independent chuck or the universal chuck.

==Drilling==

Drilling is a Metal Cutting process whereby a cylindrical tool is rotated at high speeds to reproduce a hole in the workpiece equal to the diameter of the Drill bit. Drilling is a somewhat rough operation that is often followed by a finishing operation such as ''Reaming'', ''Boring'' or ''Grinding''. In Drilling, a cutting tool known as a ''Drill Bit'' is secured to a Drill Press by use of a ''Chuck''. Once fastened to the Chuck, the Drill bit is rotated to a high speed, and fed in to the workpiece.

==Measurement Tools==
One of the most important aspects of Machining is the ability to accurately and consistently produce high quality work that meets required specifications. The primary way to determine whether a completed product is within specification is by measurement, either during or after a product's creation. Measurement and inspection makes it possible to maintain standardization throughout production, which is critical during the production of precise components that must be interchangeable through all other exact products, such as an Engine. The way this is achieved is through the use of Measurement tools, such as the Steel Rule, Calipers, and Micrometers. More advanced instruments and devices exist to measure product dimensions all the way out to Microns, but the standard Machine shop will need only to be measure out to 0.0001&quot; (0.00254mm) for most jobs.

=Theory=

Because machining is not a single process but a group of processes, no single principle is applicable to every aspect of machining. However, all machining processes do have in common the removal of chips or &quot;swarf&quot; by the relative motion of a cutting tool against the workpiece or part. The means by which this motion is achieved varies by machine type, but can generally be broken down into two types of motion:

Primary motion is the result of a machine tool's '''speed.''' In the case of a simple drilling operation, this is the spinning of the drill bit. A secondary motion is provided by a tools '''feed'''. In the example of a drilling operation, this is the plunging of the drill bit into the material.

Determining optimal speeds and feeds is a major component of best machining practices. A huge number of variables are factors in determining these properties: materials of both workpiece and cutting tool, geometry of the cut, the coolant or cutting fluid used, finish and tolerance required, and the rigidity and power of the machine tool being used.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== 2-Dimensional Gel Electrophoresis ==

2-Dimensional Gel Electrophoresis is a method used to separate proteins by size and isoelectric point.  The samples are loaded into the wells on an agarose gel submerged in a salt-buffer.  A current is run through the aparatus and the proteins travel through the porous gel.  Small proteins travel further as they fit through the pores easier than larger proteins.  What's left is bands of proteins separated by size.  Once this is completed and the proteins are spread out enough to identify their sizes, the gel is rotated 90 degrees and the current is applied again.  These two categories allow the proteins to be separated by not only mass/size, but isoelectric point, which will differentiate them further from each other.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Inflection==

=== Declension ===
* Performed on nominals (nouns, pronouns, adjectives, determiners)
* Involves number, case, gender

=== Conjugation ===
* Performed on verbs
* Involves tense, mood, voice, aspect

=== Number ===
* Expresses count distinctions (i.e. singular, plural, etc)
* Dog / Dogs, Child / Children, etc
* Though most languages only make a distinction between singular and plurals, other languages make further distinctions such as dual, trial etc.

=== Case ===
* The case of a noun or pronoun indicates its grammatical function in a greater phrase or clause (i.e. whether the (pro)noun is the subject, object or possessor)
* For example, consider these pronouns which are of different cases and thus indicate different functions:
*# ''I'' is used when the person in question is the subject (performing an action): &quot;I sat on the chair&quot;
*# ''me'' is used when the person in question is the object (having an action performed on him/her): &quot;He hit me&quot;
*# ''my'' or ''mine'' are used to indicate possession: &quot;My chair&quot; or &quot;The chair is mine&quot;
* English does not rely much on inflection but on word order to convey meaning. In other languages (Latin, for example), however, inflection is very important because it does not rely on word order (though often there is a preferred order).
* To help illustrate this consider this sentence &quot;He hit me&quot;. In Latin this could also be written as &quot;Me hit he&quot;. The meaning is conveyed by the case of the nouns not word order. Thus is would be correctly interpreted as &quot;He hit me&quot; and not &quot;I hit him&quot;
* Note that, although I have only shown you 3 cases above, there are more.

=== Gender ===
* Describes the gender of a noun which may be masculine, feminine or neuter.
* For example, Spanish word for &quot;dog&quot; depends on the gender of the dog in question. When referring to a male dog, ''perro'' is used. When referring to a female dog, ''perra'' is used.

The 4008 is a 4-bit full [[Practical Electronics/Adders|adder]] that takes two 4-bit binary numbers, &lt;tt&gt;A[3:0]&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;B[3:0]&lt;/tt&gt; and carry-in signal, &lt;tt&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;in&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and adds them to produce a 5-bit result, made up of a sum, &lt;tt&gt;S[3:0]&lt;/tt&gt; and a carry-out.

Thr 4008 uses full carry lookahead to generate the carry-out bit. This means that when several 4008s are used in ripple configuration, the inter-chip carries are generated that they would be if one had to wait for the previous chips's summation to complete. While not as fast as full lookahead across all bits, this is significantly faster than a plain ripple counter would be.

It is clear that the youngest generation entering the workforce has different communication experiences, and companies are beginning to see the results incorporated into work-related communication methods.  The newest generation, also known as (AKA) millenials, has always had access to a cellular phone, an internet connection, and digital music using an MP3 player.  Text messaging has replaced the phone conversation as the preferred method of communication among millenials.  What impact will texting have on the ''Language of the New Generation''?  Will the current workforce of baby boomers (1946-1964), Generation Xers (1965-1976), and Generation Yers (1977-1990) be able to understand what the millenials (1991 and later) are communicating?  Or will the term '''generational moment''' become common terminology in the workplace?  Generational moment is defined as when a person engages in a method of communication with someone from another generation and does not understand what the other person is communicating.  For example, a boomer boss receives a message from a millenial after a meeting that reads, txs gr8 db8 cu l8r.

This presents a unique challenge but it also creates new opportunities for using a variety of communication approaches.  This has certainly happened before as previous generations incorporated new language into business communication.  However, over the past ten years the rapid changes in technology have created enormous communication differences. Millenials are accustomed to communicating using various social media such as FaceBook, MySpace, Twitter and YouTube.  These are the tools of the next generation of employees and HR would be foolish to ignore it.

Currently, the Human Resource (HR) profession uses acronyms to abbreviate common phrases and terms.  For instance, HRD refers to Human Resource Development; ADDIE refers to Analysis, Design, Development, Implementation, and Evaluation; ISD refers to Instructional Systems Design; and ALT refers to Adult Learning Theory.  The use of acronyms has the potential to  save time and money for the employee and the company. In addition, it has the potential to attract tomorrow's workforce to the company that best incorporates these communication tools. Team 1 purposes that a company can save time and money by incorporating the common millenial communication abbreviations and symbols into traditional business communication.

== Purpose - Objectives - Behavioral Indicators ==

=== Purpose ===

== Forcing doubled pawns ==

Well, generally White has no chances of forcing doubled pawns in the Torre either. Probably the writer thought of the Tartakower variation, but that's certainly a very special case of the Torre.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==First step in organic synthesis==

The synthesis of an organic substance took place in 1828 by Friedrich Wohler, who synthesized urea. This marked the first synthesis of an organic natural product, signifying the beginning of the branch of [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry|organic chemistry]] as it is known today.  The discovery of the enzyme diastase (today known as amylase) in 1833 by Anselme Payen is similarly regarded as the beginning of the branch of biochemistry.  

Although a number of biological processes, such as the conversion of starch to [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/Sugars|sugars]] by saliva, had been previously observed, the exact mechanism behind these processes was unknown.  The 19th century scientist Louis Pasteur hypothesized that the fermentation process was catalyzed by a &quot;vital force&quot; by studying the conversion of sugars to alcohol by yeast.  He called this vital force &quot;ferments,&quot; and he recognized that the observed conversion took place only within living cells.  This marked one of the first instances in which a scientist acknowledged the possible existence of a set of sub-cellular machinery that had the ability to bring about the transformation of one chemical to another.

==19&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century==
[[Image:Anselme_Payen.jpg‎|Anselme Payen|right|thumb]]
The discovery of the first [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzyme]], diastase in 1833 by Anselme Payen, may have marked the beginning of biochemistry. Although the term “biochemistry” seems to have been first used in 1882, it is generally accepted that the formal coinage of biochemistry occurred in 1903 by Carl Neuberg, a German chemist. Previously, this area would have been referred to as physiological chemistry.

Since then, biochemistry has advanced greatly, especially since the mid-20th century, with the development of new techniques such as chromatography, [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/X-ray Crystallography|X-ray diffraction]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/NMR Spectroscopy|NMR spectroscopy]], radioisotopic labeling, [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Cryo-Electron Microscopy|electron microscopy]] and molecular dynamics simulations. These techniques have allowed for the discovery and detailed analysis of many molecules and metabolic pathways of the cell, such as glycolysis and the Krebs cycle (citric acid cycle).

In 1878, Wilhelm Kühne came up with the word [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|&quot;enzyme&quot;]] to describe the fermentation process that Pasteur observed. The use of the word [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzyme]] has changed since its inception; it is now used to describe biomolecules that catalyze biological processes.

In 1897, Eduard Buchner began to investigate the peculiar ability of yeast extracts to ferment [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/Sugars|sugars]] to alcohols in the absence of living yeast cells.   A series of experiments led to the conclusion that an enzyme found in the yeast extract was catalyzing the reaction; he called this enzyme &quot;zymase&quot;.  The idea that enzymes could function outside of a living cell was revolutionary, and in 1907 Buchner was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his discovery.

==20&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; century==
[[Image:Sir_Frederick_Gowland_Hopkins.jpg‎|Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins|left|thumb]]

In 1912, Sir Frederick Gowland Hopkins published his seminal paper, &quot;Feeding Experiments Illustrating the Importance of Accessory Food Factors in Normal Dietaries&quot;, in which he demonstrated the need for [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemistry of important organic molecules in Biochemistry/Vitamins and Cofactors|vitamins]] in the diet. In 1921, he isolated a substance which he later proved to be a tripeptide of  (Glu)[[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|glutamic acid]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|glycine (Gly)]], and [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|cysteine (Cys)]].  This substance was shown to be widely distributed in rapidly-multiplying plant and animal cells.  In 1929, Hopkins and Christiaan Eijkman were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for their discovery that vitamins were important in order to maintain good health. Hopkins other contributions to biochemistry included discovering a method that isolated [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|tryptophan (Trp)]]and identified its structure.  Additionally, his work with Walter Fletcher on metabolic changes in muscle contraction and rigor mortis led to the discovery that lactic acid could accumulate from muscle contractions.  Furthermore, Hopkins also discovered a specific [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzyme ]]commonly found in tissues and milk known as xanthine oxidase that catalyzes the oxidation of the purine bases xanthine and hypoxanthine to uric acid. Hopkins' discoveries served as significant contributions to understanding cell metabolism and improving biochemical research methods.

In the beginning of the 20th century, Gustav Embden, Otto Meyerhof and Jakub Karol Parnas discovered the Embden-Meyerhof-Parnas pathway (EMP Pathway), the most common glycolysis pathway. In 1925, Theodore Svedberg invented the ultracentrifuge, which he used to research colloids and proteins. In 1926, James B. Sumner crystallized Urease, an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of urea into carbon dioxide and ammonia. He was later awarded the Nobel Prize in 1946 for his contribution. All of these developments have contributed to furthering biochemical research.

Another significant historic event in biochemistry was the discovery of genes and their role in the transfer of information in the cell. This branch of biochemistry is often referred to as molecular biology. In the 1950s, [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/DNA/Watson and Crick's Article|James D. Watson, Francis Crick]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/DNA/Franklin's DNA X-ray Crystallography|Rosalind Franklin]], and Maurice Wilkins were revolutionaries in solving [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/DNA|]DNA] structure and suggesting its relationship with the genetic transfer of information. In 1958, George Beadle and Edward Tatum received the Nobel Prize for work in fungi, showing that one gene produces one enzyme. Marshall W. Nirenberg is best known for his contributions to deciphering the [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Structural_Biochemistry/Genetic_Bases|genetic code]].  His collaboration with Johann Matthaei led to the demonstration that [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/RNA/Messenger RNA (mRNA)|messenger RNA (mRNA)]] was required for protein synthesis and that synthetic mRNA preparations can be used to decipher various aspects of the genetic code.  In 1964, Nirenberg announced that he and Philip Leder had developed a [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/RNA/Transfer RNA (tRNA)|tRNA]] binding technique for determining the [[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Structural_Biochemistry/Genetic_Bases|genetic code]]on pieces of [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/RNA/Transfer RNA (tRNA)|tRNA]].  As a result, three-base codons were assigned to amino acids[[|]], and as a result, 50 codons were identified.  These results were confirmed by Gobind Khorana's experiments, and thus the translation of the genetic code was completed.  In 1968, Nirenberg (along with Khorana and Robert Holley) received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine for interpreting the genetic code, and determining its function in protein synthesis based on the assignment of the three-base codons. In 1988, Colin Pitchfork was the first person convicted of murder with DNA evidence, which led to growth of forensic science. More recently, Andrew Z. Fire and Craig C. Mello received the 2006 Nobel Prize for discovering the role of [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/RNA/Interference RNA|RNA interference (RNAi)]], in the silencing of gene expression. Using RNAi scientists can determine which genes are used in the process of tissue regeneration.

Today, there are three main types of biochemistry: Plant biochemistry involves the study of the biochemistry of autotrophic organisms such as photosynthesis and other plant specific biochemical processes; general biochemistry encompasses both plant and animal biochemistry; Human/medical/medicinal biochemistry focuses on the biochemistry of humans and medical illnesses.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The RNA World Hypothesis speculates that the origin of life began with ribonucleic acid ([[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/RNA|RNA]]) because of its ability to serve both as a storage for genetic information and enzymatic activity. It is proposed that RNA preceded the current genetic material, deoxyribonucleic acid ([[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/DNA|DNA]]), and led the evolution of the DNA → RNA → protein world.

There are two schools of thought that both support the RNA World hypothesis:

1. According to the Genetic Takeover Hypothesis, an earlier form of life on earth used RNA as its only genetic component. This proposes that there may be a pre-RNA molecule that used RNA or by change created RNA as a side product.

2. The first form of life on earth used RNA as its only genetic component. This theory requires that RNA came from inanimate matter. {{ref|Gesteland2006}}

== History ==

The book, ''The Genetic Code,'' written in 1967 by Carl Woese, was the first published material that supported RNA World Hypothesis{{ref|Gilbert1986}}. Francis Crick and Leslie Orgel proposed the idea that RNA once did the work of DNA and proteins in 1968. Their theories were not validated until the work of Nobel Prize laureate Thomas R. Cech. In the 1970s, Cech was studying the splicing of RNA in a single-celled organism, ''Tetrahymena thermophila'', when he discovered that an unprocessed RNA molecule could splice itself. He announced his discovery in 1982 and became the first to show that RNA has catalytic functions. The phrase “RNA World Hypothesis” was then coined later in 1986 by Harvard molecular biologist and Nobel Prize laureate Walter Gilbert as he commented on the recent observations of the catalytic properties of RNA{{ref|Altman2001}}. Another major milestone occurred in 2000 when it was published in ''Science'' that &quot;The Ribosome is a Ribozyme&quot; and the proteins in the ribosomes exist primarily on the periphery.

== Theory ==

The primordial soup that made up Earth had compounds including nucleotides.  These nucleotides sequenced spontaneously and randomly, eventually forming an RNA molecule (or a similar molecule) with catalytic characteristics.  RNA has properties of autocatalytic self-replication and assembly, contributing to its exponential increase in number.  Scientists today have assumed that replication was not perfect in the time of primitive life, and therefore variations of RNA developed.  RNA's catalytic properties do not only apply to itself, but it also catalyzes transesterification—a process necessary for protein synthesis that allows specific peptide sequences and proteins to arise.  Some of the peptides formed may have supported the self-replication of RNA and provided the possibility of undergoing modifications.  Those modifications led to more efficient sequences of RNA molecules.  

A possible model for forming [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/Nitrogenous Bases/Purines|purine]] and [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/Nitrogenous Bases/Pyrimidine|pyrimidine]] bases was proposed by Urey and Miller's experiment. This experiment brought about evidence that organic molecules originated from inorganic ingredients such as carbon dioxide, ammonia, and water etc. Such products were mixed under a reduced environment and subjected to electric shock (via lightning), which led to the creation of more reactive molecules, such as hydrogen, cyanide, and aldehydes, as well as some amino acids and organic acids over a certain period of time.  These amino acids contributed to the formation of peptide sequences.

http://www.smithlifescience.com/MillersExp.htm (see apparatus)

Proof that the RNA World Hypothesis has clout is found through the function of present day ribosomes. RNA is the ribosome's tool for synthesizing [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|proteins]] and catalyzing the formation of peptide bonds.  Therefore, this points to the fact that RNA is multifunctional, and can act as a synthesizer, transporter, messenger, and [[Structural Biochemistry/Cell Organelles/Ribosome|ribosome]] molecule.

One may ask, if RNA was the precursor of DNA and proteins, how did this evolution occur?
DNA complements the RNA sequence and stores genomic information.  Since DNA is a more stable molecule than RNA, it makes sense for DNA to adapt to the environment and take over this job of RNA.  And how is DNA more stable than RNA?  The difference between the general structure of DNA and RNA is found in the sugar.  DNA has a deoxyribose sugar while RNA has a ribose sugar.  The missing ''2'-OH'' group on the deoxyribose sugar is what makes DNA more stable, since there is no hydroxyl group for other molecules to react with.  Otherwise, RNA does not remain in a helical ring, as does DNA, since the chain of nucleotides would be easily broken apart.  Another possibility scientists are exploring is the idea that reverse RNA transcriptase has a part in the RNA to DNA transformation.  This transcriptase, found in retro-virus and HIV processes, in addition to RNA replicase, may be the enzyme that performed this transition.  Furthermore, the combination of cyanoacetaldehyde and urea formed uracil (U) and cytosine (C)-- components of the primordial soup.  This belief was supported by another of Miller's experiments.  There is no evidence at this time that thymine (T), the nitrogenous base in DNA that takes the place of uracil (U) in RNA, was formed from this atmosphere. This infers that RNA was a predecessor of DNA.  In addition, proteins that had formed from RNA were found to be versatile structures, allowing them to take over what was initially RNA's catalytic functioning.

[[Image:RNA Instability.JPG|frame|RNA instability due to 2'OH.]]

== Properties Supporting Hypothesis ==

Properties that support the RNA Hypothesis became more clear in the 1980s when it was discovered that RNA can activate and deactivate other molecules by binding with them while folding into specific structures. Before this discovery, researchers believed that RNA only had a few functions. Consideration of RNA as the pre-component of cellular life has since been studied extensively.  

Major evidence that has the scientific community believing that RNA predates DNA and proteins are as follows:

- RNA has the ability to store genetic data, and pass down hereditary information. 

- It is the main component linking up DNA and gene formation to amino acids and protein synthesis via transcription and translation.

- RNA's ability to duplicate itself as well as the genetic information it carries, very much like DNA.

- RNA's complexity is less than that of DNA, and involves fewer types of molecules in order to self-replicate.

- DNA requires an RNA primer in order to replicate while RNA does not need any such primer. This shows how DNA seems to depend more on RNA for its continued existence rather than the other way around.

- RNA is able to catalyze reactions as proteins do. The formation of a protein is also administered by RNA which points heavily to its preexistence over the proteins.

- RNA's ability to form double helices similar to DNA, and tertiary structures similar to those of catalytic proteins.

- The structure of RNA, with an hydroxyl group in the 2' position of the sugar molecule, makes it a less stable molecule which is capable of attacking a phosphodiester bond near it as long as the RNA molecule is in a flexible position and not constrained.  This made it susceptible to breakdown and allowed an adaptation of different conformations which perhaps was beneficial to early life.

- RNA's different set of bases such as Uracil, which is “1 product of damage to cytosine” made RNA more prone to mutations thus making it more suitable to primitive life in early times.

[[File:MUexperiment.png|frame|right|The Miller-Urey experiment]]

An experiment supporting the RNA World Hypothesis was, the Miller-Urey Experiment. The Miller-Urey Experiment was an experiment tested by Stanley L. Miller and Harold C. Urey in 1953 to see which molecules were present in the origin of life. This experiment specifically tested the hypothesis of Alexander Oparin's and J.B.S. Haldane's hypothesis that stated the conditions of prebiotic Earth favored chemical reactions, synthesizing inorganic compounds into organic ones. Both experiments helped scientists around the world better understand the evolution of the Earth and how organic compounds formed. The gases used by Miller and Urey were Methane (CH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), Ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), Hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O). After putting these gases (which were presumed to be present in prebiotic Earth), Miller and Urey continuously ran an electric current throughout the closed vessel system to stimulate lightning, which was thought to be extremely common on early Earth. These compounds were put inside a sterile array of glass tubes and flasks connected in a loop, with one flask half-full of liquid water and another flask containing a pair of electrodes. The liquid water was heated to induce evaporation, sparks were fired between the electrodes to simulate lightning through the atmosphere and water vapor, and then the atmosphere was cooled again so that the water could condense and trickle back into the first flask in a continuous cycle.
Within a day, the mixture had turned pink in color,[1] and at the end of one week of continuous operation, Miller and Urey observed that as much as 10–15% of the carbon within the system was now in the form of organic compounds. Two percent of the carbon had formed amino acids that are used to make proteins in living cells, with glycine as the most abundant. Sugars and liquids were also formed. Nucleic acids were not formed within the reaction. But the common 20 amino acids were formed, in various concentrations. This experiment thus showed that organic compounds that are vital to cellular function and life were easily made under the conditions of prebiotic Earth.

In an interview, Stanley Miller stated: &quot;Just turning on the spark in a basic pre-biotic experiment will yield 11 out of 20 amino acids.&quot;[2]
This further supported the RNA World Hypothesis.

== Other Experiments ==

The Miller-Urey and Oparin experiments helped launch other experiments to further show that organic compounds formed in early Earth and to also confirm the RNA World Hypothesis. 

In 1961, Juan Oro conducted an experiment that concluded amino acids could be formed from HCN, hydrogen cyanide, and Ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) in an aqueous solution. This experiment also produced Adenine, one of the nucleotide bases. This became a major breakthrough because adenine is one of the four bases in DNA and RNA, the genetic material of a cell. Adenine is also used during the process of ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which is an energy releasing molecule in cells.

This experiment led to more showing that the other three RNA and DNA bases could be formed through similar experiments of simulated chemical environments with reducing atmospheres.

== Properties Opposing Hypothesis ==

Most of the opponents of the RNA World concentrate on dispelling the idea that RNA was the first form of genetic material, although they do agree that there may have been some other pre-RNA form of genetic material. In summary: 

1. Ribose is relatively unstable and difficult to form in a prebiotic mixture. Despite the favorable and controllable conditions that are available in laboratory settings, pre-cellular life has never been created from inanimate matter. 

2. The origin of life began roughly 300 million years ago. Some believe that this is too short of a time period for the prebiotic soup to evolve in to a pre-RNA or RNA World.

3. Lack of evidence of large amounts of polyphosphates in primitive Earth makes it unlikely that it was the source of prebiotic energy or that it was involved in the first genetic material. {{ref|Lazcano1996}}.

Others believe that RNA is not a likely pre-DNA form of genetic material. Their arguments include:

1. The limited catalytic capabilities of RNA. Theorists say that RNA needed to have had a multitude of catalytic abilities to be able to survive the prebiotic world, but RNA has not shown this. Proteins, on the other hand, ''do'' have those catalytic abilities via their varying, enzymatic abilities.

2. The prebiotic simulation of the formation of the RNA molecule has shown some difficulty in that the bases and the sugar molecule do not readily react in water.

3. Opponents advocate proteins over RNA because they are easily formed.

4. The probability of the right components of pre-cellular life to exist at the same place and time, without contaminates, and with the correct catalytic reactions is next to improbable {{ref|NationMaster.com}}{{ref|ExperienceFestival.com}}. 

5. Recent research shows that non-coding RNA regions have well-adapted and very specialized roles in the cell. Examples include siRNA and miRNA—they work well in an environment where RNAi and mRNA already exist. Because of their usefulness that we are just beginning to understand, it makes it less likely that there are &quot;relics&quot; of the RNA World present in our DNA as Gilbert originally mentioned in 1986 {{ref|Eddy2001}}.

==Alternative Theories==
The difficulty of RNA formation has caused other propositions of alternative theories on precursor materials for cellular life:

- Peptide Nucleic Acid theory (PNA), a nucleic acid with a backbone of peptide bonds, made a likely theory because it overcame the problem in RNA theory regarding the difficulty of RNA to attach ribose and phosphate groups together.

- Threose nucleic acids are proposed as a more likely starting material than RNA.

- Glycold nucleic acids are proposed as precursors rather than RNA because they are easily formed.

- Double origin theory suggests that both RNA and proteins existed around the same time independently.


==Support==

The RNA World hypothesis is supported by RNA's ability to store, transmit, and duplicate genetic information, as DNA does. RNA can also act as a ribozyme (an enzyme made of ribonucleic acid). Because it can reproduce on its own, performing the tasks of both DNA and proteins (enzymes), RNA is believed to have once been capable of independent life. Further, while nucleotides were not found in Miller-Urey's origins of life experiments, they were found by others' simulations, notably those of Joan Oro. Experiments with basic ribozymes, like the viral RNA Q-beta, have shown that simple self-replicating RNA structures can withstand even strong selective pressures (e.g., opposite-chirality chain terminators) (The Basics of Selection (London: Springer, 1997)).

Additionally, in the past a given RNA molecule might have survived longer than it can today. Ultraviolet light can cause RNA to polymerize while at the same time breaking down other types of organic molecules that could have the potential of catalyzing the break down of RNA (ribonucleases), suggesting that RNA may have been a relatively common substance on early Earth. This aspect of the theory is still untested and is based on a constant concentration of sugar-phosphate molecules.

==Difficulties==
The base cytosine does not have a plausible prebiotic simulation method because it easily undergoes hydrolysis.

Prebiotic simulations making nucleotides have conditions incompatible with those for making sugars (lots of formaldehyde). So they must somehow be synthesized, then brought together. However, they do not react in water. Anhydrous reactions bind with purines, but only 8% of them bind with the correct carbon atom on the sugar bound to the correct nitrogen atom on the base. Pyrimidines, however, do not react with ribose, even anhydrously.

Then phosphate must be introduced, but in nature phosphate in solution is extremely rare because it is so readily precipitated. After being introduced, the phosphate must combine with the nucleoside and the correct hydroxyl must be phosphorylated, in order to create a nucleotide.

For the nucleotides to form RNA, they must be activated themselves (meaning that they must be combined with two more phosphate groups, as in adenosine triphosphate). Activated purine nucleotides form small chains on a pre-existing template of all-pyrimidine RNA. However, this does not happen in reverse because the pyrimidine nucleotides do not stack well.

Additionally, the ribose must all be the same enantiomer, because any nucleotides of the wrong chirality act as chain terminators.

A.G. Cairns-Smith in 1982 criticized writers for exaggerating the implications of the Miller-Urey experiment. He argued that the experiment showed, not the possibility that nucleic acids preceded life, but its implausibility. He claimed that the process of constructing nucleic acids would require 18 distinct conditions and events that would have to occur continually over millions of years in order to build up the required quantities.

==Alternative Hypothesis==

As mentioned above, a different version of the same hypothesis is &quot;Pre-RNA world&quot;, where a different nucleic acid is proposed to pre-date RNA. A candidate nucleic acid is peptide nucleic acid (PNA), which uses simple peptide bonds to link nucleobases.53 PNA is more stable than RNA, but its ability to be generated under prebiological conditions has yet to be demonstrated experimentally.

Threose nucleic acid (GNA), and like PNA, also lack experimental evidence for their respective abiogenesis.

An alternative—or complementary— theory of RNA origin is proposed in the PAH world hypothesis, whereby 57

The iron-sulfur world theory proposes that simple metabolic processes developed before genetic materials did, and these energy-producing cycles catalyzed the production of genes.

Yet another alternative theory to the RNA world hypothesis is the panspermia hypothesis. It discusses the possibility that the earliest life on this planet was carried here from somewhere else in the galaxy, possibly on meteorites similar to the Murchison meteorite.58 This does not invalidate the concept of an RNA world, but posits that this world was not Earth but rather another, probably older, planet.

==Implications of the RNA World==

The RNA world hypothesis, if true, has important implications for the very definition of life. For the majority of the time following the elucidation of the structure of DNA by Watson and Crick, life was considered as being largely defined in terms of DNA and proteins: DNA and proteins seemed to be the dominant macromolecules in the living cell, with RNA serving only to aid in creating proteins from the DNA blueprint.

The RNA world hypothesis places RNA at center-stage when life originated. This has been accompanied by many studies in the last ten years demonstrating important aspects of RNA function that were not previously known, and support the idea of a critical role for RNA in the functionality of life. In 2001, the RNA world hypothesis was given a major boost with the deciphering of the 3-dimensional structure of the ribosome, which revealed the key catalytic sites of ribosomes to be composed of RNA and for the proteins to hold no major structural role, and be of peripheral functional importance. Specifically, the formation of the peptide bond, the reaction that binds amino acids together into proteins, is now known to be catalyzed by an adenine residue in the rRNA: the ribosome is a ribozyme. This finding suggests that RNA molecules were most likely capable of generating the first proteins. Other interesting discoveries demonstrating a role for RNA beyond a simple message or transfer molecule include the importance of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins (SnRNPs) in the processing of pre-mRNA and RNA editing and reverse transcription from RNA in Eucaryotes in the maintenance of telomeres in the telomerase reaction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Antibodies are made by injecting live animals with antigens. These animals are the sources of producing the antibodies. They can be rabbits, mice, goats, and other kinds of animals. Some antibodies that are produced from one animal can also react in [[Structural Biochemistry/Protein function/Antibodies|antibodies]] that are found in another type of animal.

For example, goat anti-mouse antibodies means the antibodies are taken out from goat and injected into mice, the antibodies from goat can react in the mouse's antibodies.

Antibodies can also be multiplied in a [[w:cell culture|cell culture]] dish.



[[Category:Structural Biochemistry|Sources of production of Monoclonal antibody]]



----


[[File:Monoclonal antibodies smaller.jpg]] 

&lt;u&gt;Preparation of Monoclonal Antibodies&lt;/u&gt;:
An antigen is injected into a mouse, and after a few weeks its spleen is removed and plasma cells are extracted. The mouse's spleen cells are fused with myeloms cells to create hybrid cells called '''hybridoma cells.''' Each hybridoma cell indefinitely produces identical antibody, and the hybridoma cells are then screened using an antigen/antibody assay that will reveal which cells produce the desired antibody. The collection of selected hybridoma cells that produce the preferred antibody are re-screened multiple times until a pure line is isolated. These cells are grown in a culture and/or injected into into mice to induce tumors. The cells can also be frozen and saved for later use.
The hybridoma method for producing monoclonal antibodies is useful because large amounts of specifically-tailored identical antibodies can be produced easily.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What is an Enzyme? ==

[[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|Enzymes]] are powerful biological [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme Catalytic Mechanism/Catalysis|catalyst]]. Catalysts speed up a reaction but are not consumed in the reaction. Enzymes are thus essential for such bodily functions as digestion because otherwise, these reactions would occur at too high of temperatures for the body to handle. The catalysis process takes place at the active site. Enzymes are extremely selective with their reactants, or substrates, and the type of chemical reactions they are involved with. This is due to similar shape, charge, and characteristics between the enzymes and the substrates.  Bringing together the enzymes and the substrates is called enzyme-substrate (ES) complexes.


== Enzyme Dynamics ==

It has been observed through experimental analysis that enzymatic transition states often use kinetic isotope effects to understand the bonding differences between reactants and the intermediates found in the transition states. Kinetic isotope effects refer to the ratio of the rates of reaction of two different isotopically labeled molecules in a given reaction. In addition to transition states, enzymes also play an important role as common pharmaceutical targets since many drugs act as enzyme inhibitors. 
The most common feature of enzymes is that they are able to catalyze reactions and increase the reaction rates. They can also overcome larger single transition state energy barriers by breaking them down and creating multiple steps of smaller barriers. Reaction rates are also limited by conformational changes that occur in proteins as well as the rate at which reactant are released to yield product. In addition, the values of the kinetic isotope effects, often intrinsic, typically are the result of differences in the bond environments for atoms in the reactant state compared to the bond environments found in transition states.

== Spectroscopy Measures Enzymatic Activity ==


The ability to determine enzymatic activity is extremely important to clinical chemistry because it allows for early diagnosis of various diseases and helps doctors determine the course of treatment for such diseases. The spectroscopic characteristics of enzymes and substrates change when they combine to form an ES complex. In order to measure this activity demonstrated by the enzyme, the following spectroscopic techniques are used: Fluorescence spectroscopy, UV/VIS Spectroscopy, Spectrophotometric Assays, and Infrared spectroscopy. 


'''&lt;big&gt;Fluorescence spectroscopy&lt;/big&gt;'''

Fluorescence spectroscopy reveals the existence of ES complexes and what they are made of. In Fluorescence spectroscopy, a compound is exposed to UV-light which excites certain molecules and causes them to emit light at a lower wavelength, which is typically in the visible light range.  This phenomenon in which the molecule's absorption of a photon at one wavelength leads to the emission of another photon from the same molecule at a longer wavelength is known as fluorescence.  In this spectroscopic technique, the fluorescence of the substrate is measured and compared to the fluorescence of the product, and it is in the difference of these two measurements that enzymatic activity is measured.

A typical procedure for light-extinction measurements is as follows. At predetermined time intervals, 5-7 measurement points are collected by measuring the light-extinction of the enzyme sample, where a light-absorbing substance is either consumed or produced during the reaction. This can be measured using a photometer. The mean value and standard deviation of these measurement points are then found and plotted versus time. Then a regression curve is drawn through these points. The enzyme activity can then be found from the slope of the regression curve at a particular time

Many impurities found in fluorescent compounds, when exposed to light, interfere with the spectroscopy, making this technique more sensitive than other assays.


'''&lt;big&gt;Ultraviolet-visible Spectroscopy&lt;/big&gt;'''

A method that is complimentary to fluorescence spectroscopy is ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy in that fluorescence spectroscopy deals with transitions from the excited state to the ground state and ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy deals with transitions from the ground state to the excited state. UV spectroscopy uses light in the UV region where molecules are most likely to undergo electronic transitions. What is meant by electronic transitions is that when a molecule absorbs UV energy, this causes the electrons to become excited, meaning they quickly and unstably move into a higher energy orbital. The instrument used in UV spectroscopy is a UV/VIS spectrophotometer. This device measures the transmittance of light through a sample. The equation used to calculate the transmittance is A=-log(%T) where A is the absorbance and T is I/Io where I is the intensity of light passing through the sample and Io is the initial intensity of the light, before it is transmitted through the sample. Once the absorbance is calculated, it can be plotted versus the wavelength giving a UV/VIS spectrum.




'''&lt;big&gt;Spectrophotometric Assay&lt;/big&gt;'''

Spectrophotometric assays can track the course of a reaction by measuring how much light the assay absorbs. When the light is absorbed in the visible light region (400-750nm), the assay will actually change colors. This is called a colorimetric assay. An example of a colorimetric assay is the MTT. In the MTT assay, Yellow MTT(3-(4.5-Dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2.5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide) reduces to purple formazan in the mitochondria of cells, giving the reaction a purple color which allows for analysis of the enzyme. Some type of solution is used to dissolve the purple formazan product. A spectrophotometer is then used to measure the wavelength, which is usually between 500-600nm. The solvent that is used determines the maximum absorption wavelength.


&lt;u&gt;Ultraviolet-visible Spectroscopy&lt;/u&gt;

Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy is a commonly used spectrophotometric assay that examines photons in the UV-visible region.  It is mainly used to determine the amount of a highly-conjugated organic compound or enzyme contained in a specific solution.  The Beer-Lambert Law is used in Ultraviolet-visible spectroscopy to determine the concentration of the species that is absorbing the light.  The Beer-Lambert Law states:

A=-log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;(I/I&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;)

This equation shows the directly-proportional relationship between the solutions' concentration and the absorption of the solution, where A is the absorption of the solution and I refers to its concentration.

   

'''&lt;big&gt;Infrared Spectroscopy&lt;/big&gt;'''

Another type of spectroscopy that can be used to obtain information about enzyme-substrate complexes is infrared spectroscopy. In enzyme-substrate complexes, there is well-organized binding modes, which is quantifiable using infrared methods. In analyzing infrared data, it is possible to identify binding modes and heterogeneity of ES complexes.

== Detectors ==

Detectors are needed to actually measure the enzymatic activity produced in the previously described processes. The following describes typical detectors used in industry.


&lt;big&gt;'''UV/visible detectors'''&lt;/big&gt;

UV/visible light detectors are the most common used in industry because they are versatile, have a wide dynamic range, have a high sensitivity, and they are not affected by temperature and flow variations.

&lt;u&gt;Fixed-wavelength detectors&lt;/u&gt;

Fixed-wavelengths detectors use lamps that emit light at certain wavelengths. To select a particular wavelength a cut-off filter can be used. Fixed-wavelength detectors are good because they don't produce a lot of noise, it doesn't cost very much to operate them, and operating them is relatively simple.

&lt;u&gt;Variable Wavelength Detectors&lt;/u&gt;

Variable wavelength detectors are different from fixed-wavelength detectors in that they use a range of wavelengths, typically between 190-700 nm continuously instead of just one wavelength at a time. For wavelength selection in the variable wavelength detector a continuously adjustable monochromator is used. The lamp is typically deuterium or tungsten. Light from the lamp travels to mirrors that focus and steer the light into a diffraction grating, and the grating drive mechanisms are all part of the monochromator assembly. To monitor more than one wavelength at a time, the grating is rapidly adjusted between two different wavelengths.

One of the most recent developments for variable wavelength detectors is the Diode Array Detector (DAD). The DAD basically speeds up the entire process by setting multiple detectors next to each other on a silicon crystal and using a capacitor to convert light to electric charge. this makes it so that light from the grating can be detected much quicker than in a conventional spectrophotometer. The advantages to using a DAD over motor-driven monochromators are that they possess fewer moving parts and they are less likely to have irregular data at high flow rates.


&lt;big&gt;'''Fluorescence detectors'''&lt;/big&gt;

Fluorescence detectors are used only when the compound can't be detected by the other methods and the compound must have fluorescence or can come to have fluorescence by reacting with a fluorescent compound. The intensity of light that is emitted is directly proportional to the power of exciting radiation, therefore fluorometric detection is much more sensitive than absorption. Usually the fluorescence detector is made up of a light source, a wavelength reflector and a single or dual-flow cell. 

The light source is typically xenon, mercury arc, or quartz halogen. The wavelength reflector allows for the excitation spectra to be obtained for the compound. This information can be used for rapid method optimization and verification of separation quality. Lastly, the single and dual-flow cells take account the fluorescence of the mobile phase.


&lt;big&gt;'''Refractive Index (RI) detectors'''&lt;/big&gt;

Refractive Index (RI) detectors measure the change in refractive indices in the reference and sample cells. The drawback to this method is that refracted indices between compounds can be very small, therefore the sensitivity of the RI detector is much smaller than for UV/VIS and fluorescence detectors. Another negative in using an RI detector is that the detector response is affected by the mobile phase composition, which means there is a lot of error in the final data collected. There are three types of RI detectors: deflection, fresnel, and interferometric, but the deflection type is the most commonly used.

In the deflection detector, a light beam passes between two parallel chambers in a glass prism, which acts as a reference. If the refractive index of the solution is equal to the refractive index of the reference, then the light beam is parallel to the incident beam. However, if the refractive indices are different, the beam is deflected and then measure by a differential photodiode.


&lt;big&gt;'''Electrochemical detectors'''&lt;/big&gt;

Electrochemical detectors are most commonly used for biogenic amines because they are more sensitive and more selective than the previous methods. There are two types of electrochemical detectors: bulk property and solute property. The bulk property detectors are most commonly used and they measure the change in cell resistance. Solute property detectors monitor the change in potential or current as the solute passes through the cell. Solute is passed over an electrode which is held at a constant voltage. The current produced is proportional to solute concentration.

==McCain's view==
The Republican presidential candidate, John McCain, has espoused a proposal put forward by specialists in international relations close to the Democratic Party, such as John Ikenberry and Anne-Marie Slaughter. The proposal is to set up a new international organization that can accept as members only countries with a democratic government, a kind of League of Democracies (sometimes also called a Concert of Democracies). Senator McCain did not go into detail concerning the characteristics this institution would have to have. He merely stated that “it could act where the UN fails to act.&quot;
==Commentary==
With global tensions rising, what do you suppose keeps some foreign policy columnists up at night? It is the idea of a new international organization, a league of democracies. On both sides of the Atlantic the idea - set forth most prominently by Sen. John McCain a year ago and again in the first presidential debate Sept. 26 - has been treated as impractical and incendiary. Perhaps a few observations can still this rising chorus of alarm.

The idea of a concert of democracies originated not with Republicans but with Democrats and liberal internationalists. Madeleine Albright, President Bill Clinton's secretary of state, tried to launch such an organization in the 1990s. More recently, it is the brainchild of Ivo Daalder, a foreign policy expert and senior adviser to Barack Obama. It has also been promoted by Anne-Marie Slaughter, dean of the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University, and professor John Ikenberry, the renowned liberal internationalist theorist. It has backers in Europe, too, such as Anders Fogh Rasmussen, the Danish prime minister, who recently proposed his own vision of an &quot;alliance of democracies.&quot; 

American liberal internationalists like the idea because its purpose is to promote liberal internationalism. Ikenberry believes a concert of democracies can help re-anchor the United State in an internationalist framework. Daalder believes it will enhance the influence that America's democratic allies wield in Washington. So does McCain, who talks about the need for the United States not only to listen to its allies but to be willing to be persuaded by them.

A league of democracies would also promote liberal ideals in international relations. The democratic community supports the evolving legal principle known as &quot;the responsibility to protect&quot;, which holds leaders to account for the treatment of their people. Bernard Kouchner, the French foreign minister, suggested it be applied to Burma, where the ruling generals refused international aid to their dying people. That idea was summarily rejected at the United Nations, where other humanitarian interventions - in Darfur today or in Kosovo a few years ago - have also met resistance.

So would a concert of democracies supplant the United nations? Of course not, any more than the Group of Eight leading industrialized nations supplants it. But the world's democracies could make common cause to act in humanitarian crises when the U.N. Security Council cannot reach unanimity. If people find that prospect unsettling, then they should seek the disbandment of NATO and the European Union and other regional organizations which not only can but, in the case of Kosovo, have taken collective action in crises when the U.N. Security Council was deadlocked. The difference is that the league of democracies would not be limited to Europeans and Americans but would include the world's other great democracies, such as India, Brazil, Japan and Australia, and would have even greater legitimacy.
==Community of Democracies==
The Community of Democracies (CD) is an intergovernmental organization of democracies and democratizing countries with a stated commitment to strengthening and deepening democratic norms and practices worldwide. The CD is composed of both a governmental component made up of government representatives, and a non-governmental component comprising civil society organizations who meet as a group at biennial ministerial conferences. In 2004, CD governments also organized themselves into a Democracy Caucus in the United Nations (U.N.).

==Princeton Project==
The Princeton Project on National Security is a multi-year, bipartisan initiative to develop a sustainable and effective national security strategy for the United States of America. Under the stewardship of honorary co-chairs George P. Shultz and Anthony Lake, the Princeton Project brings together leading thinkers on national security from government, academia, business, and the non-profit sector to analyze key issues and develop innovative responses to a range of national security threats.

Through support from the Ford Foundation, the Hewlett Foundation, Mr. David M. Rubenstein, and the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University, the Princeton Project has:

• Convened and published the findings of seven working groups that addressed different aspects of national security—including grand strategy, state security and transnational threats, economics and national security, reconstruction and development, anti-Americanism, relative threat assessment, and foreign policy infrastructure and global institutions;

• Held ten conferences in the United States and abroad to explore major issues pertaining to U.S. national security ranging from the use of preventive force to the role of the private sector;

• Commissioned seventeen working papers on critical security topics.

The Princeton Project culminated with the release of its final report, Forging A World of Liberty Under Law: U.S. National Security in the 21st Century, by project co-directors G. John Ikenberry and Anne-Marie Slaughter. Released on September 27, 2006, the report proposes that the United States must stand for, seek, and secure a world of liberty under law. It argues that Americans would be safer, richer and healthier in a world of mature liberal democracies. Getting there requires: 1. Bringing governments up to PAR (Popular, Accountable, Rights-Regarding); 2. Building a liberal order through reform of existing international institutions and the creation of new ones, such as the Concert of Democracies; and 3. Rethinking the role of force in light of the threats of the 21st century.

      <comment>/* Membrane Bounded Organelles */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Eukaryotic Cells''' are one of two types of cells that an individual organism may be classified. Both cells have a cytoplasm and nuclear membrane, and the use of DNA for its genetic information. The main distinguishing factor of a Eukaryotic Cell from the Prokaryotic Cell is the presence of nuclear envelope. Prokaryotic cells are generally smaller than Eukaryotic cells. In addition, their DNA is not packed inside a nucleus, instead it can be found in the cytoplasm. 

Eukaryotic cells contain many other membrane-bound organelles such as the mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, or golgi body which are contained in the cytoplasm. Examples of Eukaryotic cells include animals, fungi, plants and proti. Organisms containing eukaryotic cells may be either multi-cellular organisms, such as mammals and plants, or unicellular microorganisms, such as yeast. These organisms are classified under the domain called Eukarya, one of the three fundamental domains that make up the possible evolutionary path of life (See 'Evolutionary Background' below.)

==Comparison==

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Fundamental Properties of Cells&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

All organisms are comprised of cells. All cells of the simplest and most complex organisms share some basic fundamental properties that can be seen at the biochemical level.  These basic fundamental properties include plasma membrane, cytoplasm (cytosol), and nucleus/nucleoid.  

All cells are enclosed by plasma membrane that separates the cell's contents from its surrounding.  The inner environment of the cell enclosed by the plasma membrane is called cytoplasm which is composed of aqueous solution called cytosol.  

Cytosol consist of variety of suspended organelles/particles each with their corresponding functions. Ribosomes (the site of protein synthesis) and Proteasomes (degrade proteins that are no longer needed by the cell) are examples of some organelles that are suspended in cytosol.  

The third item that all cells are composed of is nucleus/nucleoid.  The genetic information is stored in the nucleus.  All prokaryotes (Bacteria and Archaea)have nucleoid which is not separated from the cytoplasm by a nuclear envelope.  Therefore a defining feature of a eukaryotic cell is the presence of the nuclear envelope.  

Another remarkable thing worth noting is that the distinguishing features that define &quot;life&quot; is displayed even at the cellular level. All cells display high degree of chemical complexity and organization.  Cells are able to extract, transform and use energy from their environment.  The organelles composed the cell each have their defined functions and the interactions among organelles are highly regulated.  Cells can sense and respond to changes in their surrounding environment.  Cells can precisely replicate and assemble themselves.  Furthermore they have potential to change over time by gradual evolution. 

&lt;big&gt;
&lt;big&gt;Eukaryote vs Prokaryote&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

Regular Sizes;

While most bacteria (or prokaryotes) are approximately 1-10&amp;nbsp;µm in diameter, Eukaryotes range from 10-100&amp;nbsp;µm in diameter.

===Genome===

Prokaryotic cells are known to be much less complex than eukaryotic cells since eukaryotic cells are usually considered to be present at a later time of evolution. It is likely that Eukaryotic cells have evolved from Prokaryotic cells. These differences in complexity can be seen at the cellular level.  The DNA of prokaryotes is circular and attached to the plasma membrane, while eukaryotic DNA is packed into chromosome bundles.
Prokaryote's DNA is contained in nucleoid which is not surrounded by nuclear membrane.  Eukaryotic DNA is more complex where it has histone (protein that winds the DNA into a more compact form), and nonhistone proteins in chromosomes.  Chromosomes are contained in the nucleus with a nuclear envelope (a defining feature of eukaryotic cells).

===Membrane Bounded Organelles===

Membrane bound organelles are absent in prokaryotic cells.  Eukaryotic cells are known to be multicellular organism that have membrane enclosed organelles. A variety of membrane bound organelles can be found in a eukaryotic cells, each with their corresponding  function.  For example ATP (cellular currency) synthesis happens in mitochondria (for animals), and chloroplasts (for plants and some algae), endoplasmic reticulum assist in glycosylation of proteins while Golgi complexes is the main transport system for the cell.

===Cell Division===

Prokaryotes simply divide by fission, which the more complex eukaryotes go through mitosis which include mitotic spindle which hold the chromosomes during cell division. Mitosis is a more orchestrated version of cell division where all genetic info,and membrane bound organelles are precisely identical in the daughter cells as it is in the mother cell.

===Nutrition===

The majority of prokaryotes simply absorb nutrients from their surrounding, but some photosynthesize.  The eukaryotes on the other hand have elaborate digestive systems which allow ingestion of nutrients, and excretion of nitrogenous waste.  Some eukaryotes (plants) go through photosynthesis with the help of chloroplasts.

===Energy Metabolism===

Prokaryotes have no membrane bound organelles, hence no mitochondria.  Instead they have oxidative enzymes bound to their plasma membrane for energy metabolism.  Various species of prokaryotes display a great variation in their metabolic pattern.  

In contrast, eukaryotes have these oxidative enzymes packed into their mitochondria, and they display a more unified pattern of oxidative metabolism which include the krebs cycle and the electron transport chain. The electron transport systems for eukaryotic cells are located in the inner membrane of the mitochondria while in prokaryotic cells, they are located in the cytoplasmic membrane. 

===Cytoskeleton===

Prokaryotes have none of this sort.
The Eukaryotes have complex array of cytoskeleton which composed of microtubules, intermediate filaments and actin filaments.  This protein-developed cytoskeleton reinforces the cell's outer structure to help with the rigidity of cell and intracellular transport.

===Intracellular Movement===

Intracellular movement is absent in prokaryotic cells.  Due to the presence of cytoskeleton, intracellucar movement is possible in eukaryotic cells.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Plant Cells&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

Plant cells have a rectangular structure, which is enclosed by a cell wall made of cellulose.  The plant cell also contains plastids, a main vacuole, glyoxysomes, and chloroplasts, apart from a nucleus and other common organelles with the animal cell.
The main vacuole of the plant can take up to 90% of the volume of the cell and is used to store water.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Animal Cells&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

Animal cells are enclosed by a plasma membrane made of a phospholipid bilayer and proteins. Unlike a plant cell, an animal cell have centrioles, lysosomes, and flagella. The flagella is needed for cell movement. Examples of animal cells include muscle cells, neurons, and skin cells.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Fungus Cells&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

Fungi are eukaryotes that are mostly multicellular with cell structures that mimic both plants and animals. Fungi contain cell walls, like plants, but unlike plants they are composed of chitin. Fungi do not create their own food however and, like animals, store their food as glycogen. Fungus cells are unique in that they are composed of hyphae, filaments that contain internal crosswalls known as septa.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;big&gt;Single Celled Eukaryotes&lt;/big&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

Eukaryotes also exist in the single celled variety. Some examples include: brown algae, microsporidia, and dinoflagellata. Single celled eukaryotes are quite varied and can be found with numerous different structures.

==Mitosis/Meiosis==
Multicellular eukaryotes undergo cell division processes called mitosis and meiosis. 

'''&lt;big&gt;Mitosis&lt;/Big&gt;'''
The process of mitosis is divided up into four parts called: prophase, metaphase, anaphase, telophase. During prophase, the genetic material inside the nucleus known as chromatin begins to condense into a more structured form called a chromosome. Chromosomes consist of two sister chromatids which separate upon complete cell division. The sister chromatids are bound by a centrosome. Centromeres also begin to form during prophase, which are used to separate the sister chromatids on opposite ends of the cell. During metaphase, the chromosomes align at the center and spindles connect to each chromosom's centromere forming a kinetochore complex. Each centromere has two spindles connect to it, one on each side. Before the cell can move onto anaphase, all the centromeres must be attach to the spindles. During anaphase, the sister chromatids begin to separate creating two distinct sister chromosomes and are then pulled to opposite ends of the cells by having the kinetochore microtubules shorten in length. Telophase marks the last stage of mitosis in which the cell begins to elongate and separate and the sister chromosomes form into a nucleus and unfold back into chromatin. 

'''&lt;Big&gt;Meiosis&lt;/Big&gt;'''
Meiosis(needed for sexual reproduction) is a type of cell division that produces haploid gametes in diploid organisms. Many of the stage of meiosis closely resemble corresponding stages in mitosis.For both mitosis and meiosis, the chromosomes replicate only once, in the preceding interphase. Meiosis is preceded by the replication of chromosomes followed by 2 successive cell division: Meiosis I and Meiosis II which result in 4 daughter cells (each with single haploid set of chromosome). It means meiosis makes daughter cells with only half as many  chromosome as the original (parent) cell

==Organelles==

'''&lt;big&gt;Centriole&lt;/big&gt;'''

A pair of centrioles are found within a centrosome of an animal cell and each composed of 9 sets of triple microtubules arranged in a ring.Centrioles are short, cylinder shaped organelles composed of nine triplet microtubles. It is found in most eukaryotes except for high plants and fungi. It organizes proteins that form flagella and cilia.Centrioles may help organize microtubule assembly, they are not essential for those function in all eukaryotes. 

'''&lt;big&gt;Chloroplasts&lt;/big&gt;'''

Chloroplasts are typically found in the mesophyll cells  on the inside of plant cells only.  Their function is to produce glucose and oxygen, by receiving carbon dioxide and water.  In order for this to happen, there has to be the presence of light in order to drive the reaction forward. Chloroplasts are members of the plastid family. Through photosynthesis, the chloroplasts turn light energy into sugar. Inside a chloroplasts are disk like structures known as tyhlakoids and when several thylakoids are stack on top of each other, the form a granum. The chloroplasts, like the mitochondira, has a dual membrane system with an inter membrane space. The space between the granum and the inner membrane is known as the stroma which is where the Calvin cycle occurs. The Calvin cycle is known as the dark reaction because it does not need light and its purpose is to make sugar out of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The light reaction occurs in the thylakoids and its purpose is to draw energy from water by splitting the oxygen from the hydrogen forming O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

'''&lt;big&gt;Chromosomes&lt;/big&gt;'''

Chromosomes is an organized structure of the genes the comprise themselves into DNA. Because of Eukaryotes have a nucleus, the chromosomes must compact itself into chromatin(complex of DNA and protein), which would then securely fit inside the cell. Chromatin usually has two identical strands of chromatid &quot;tied&quot; together by a centromere.
Chromosomes are responsible for carrying the genetic information.

'''&lt;big&gt;Cytoplasm&lt;/big&gt;'''

The cytoplasm is the space between the plasma membrane, or cell wall, and the nucleus.Cytoplasm means the interior of prokarotic cell. In eukaryotes, this is where most of the membrane-bound organelles are located.  This space is where glycolysis occurs which is important in the production of ATP for the cell. The final net product of glycolysis is 2 ATP, 2 pyruvate, and 2 NADH.
 
'''&lt;big&gt;Cytoskeleton&lt;/big&gt;''' 

Made up of three kinds of protein filaments: actin filaments (microfilaments), intermediate filament, and microtubules. Its functions are establishing cell shape, providing mechanical strength, locomotion, chromosome separation, and intracellular transport of organelles

'''&lt;big&gt;Endoplasmic Reticulum&lt;/big&gt;'''

The interconnected network of tubules, vesicles, and sacs. It specializes in protein synthesis, sequestration of calcium, production of steroids, storage of production of glycogen, and insertion of membrane proteins. There are two kinds: smooth ER that lacks ribosomes and rough ER that is bounded by ribosomes. Muscle cells have a different form of endoplasmic reticulum known as the sacroplasmic reticulum which is needed for the regulations of calcium secretion that is used for muscle contractions.

'''&lt;big&gt;Golgi apparatus&lt;/big&gt;'''

Consists of a stack of membrane-bounded cisternae that located between the endoplasmic reticulum and the cell membrane. Its functions are to sort out the processed proteins and send them to the destination, also, it can reclaim processing proteins for reuse. The Golgi apparatus sorts its protein by inserting a oligosaccharide into the protein which acts as a signal showing telling the vesicles where the target destination is. 

'''&lt;big&gt;Lysosomes&lt;/big&gt;''' 

Lysosomes are found in many eukaryotic cells. They are created by the Golgi complex. Lysosomes contain enzymes that help them digest other cells. These enzymes were first developed by the rough endoplasmic reticulum, then transferred to the Golgi apparatus where small vesicles are made. These vesicles are the lysosomes. The functions of a lysosome is to recycle the cell's worn out organic material and to digest macromolecules such as lipids, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and proteins.

'''&lt;big&gt;Membranes&lt;/big&gt;''' 
Along with the plasma membrane (which selectively filters out substances), there is the membrane that hold the organelles neatly in the cell. Eukaryotes have an extensive internal membrane that provides a barrier between organelles as well as ea storage space for them as well. These membranes consist of phospholipids and lipids (of which are composed by various proteins. Each membrane has various enzymes that help the organelle function. 

'''&lt;big&gt;Mitochondria&lt;/big&gt;''' 

The mitochondria is also known as the cell's powerhouse. It produces Adenosine Triphosphate (ATP), the energy currency of the cell. ATP is produced through the Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation. There are two plasma membranes for a mitochondria, inner and outer. Both of the plasma membranes of the mitochondria is a bilayer that has pores in it so that substances like pyruvate can be transported into the mitochondrial matrix. Here the pyruvate will be modified and then is sent through the Krebs cycle. The products of the Krebs cycle, NADH and FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, then undergoes oxidative phosphorylation which occurs along the inner membrane region of the mitochondria. The inner membrane of the mitochondria has many folds to increase the surface area to increase energy output because there is more space for oxidative phosphorylation to occur. Each NADH yields about 2.5 ATP and each FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gives about 1.5 ATP. The mitochondria also has its own DNA and Ribosomes that came from the organism's mother. It is important to note that before entering the Krebs cycle, pyruvate was made into Acetyl CoA and releach 1 NADH. The final product of glycolysis, Acetyl CoA production, and Krebs cycle is 10 NADH, 2 FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and 4 ATP (note 2 pyruvate were used). 

&lt;big&gt;'''Nucleus'''&lt;/big&gt; 

The nucleus is comprised of small chromatin units bundled into chromosome, which make up deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA). The nucleus is surrounded by a nuclear envelope structurally composed of two lipid, porous layers. The holes in the envelope permit the nucleus to pass information with the rest of the cell. Another important structure contained within is the nucleolus, which produces the ribosomes essential for protein production. 

'''&lt;big&gt;Peroxisomes&lt;/big&gt;''' 

Peroxisomes are similar to lysosomes in the way that they both contain digestive enzymes. A key difference is the type of enzymes they carry. The enzymes peroxisomes contain are oxidative enzymes which are responsible for breaking down hydrogen peroxide produced by white blood cells.

'''&lt;big&gt;Ribosomes&lt;/big&gt;''' 

These organelles are the protein synthesizers of the cell. They either float freely in a cell's cytoplasm or attach themselves to the endoplasmic reticulum. Ribosomes are responsible for connecting each amino acid to develop long chains. Protein synthesis involves the two subunits of the ribosomes locking into a strand of mRNA created by the nucleus. Another nuclei acid, tRNA, helps protein synthesis by binding into free amino acids in the cell and transferring them to the ribosomes. Ribosomes are comprised of ribosomal RNA and are produced in the nucleolus.

'''&lt;big&gt;Vacuoles&lt;/big&gt;'''

The vacuole in a plant cell is used in order to store water as well as maintain the shape of the cell, however, the vacuole in an animal cell is used to store water, as well as ions and waste.  The vacuole in the animal cell is nowhere near as big as the vacuole in the plant cell

==Metabolic Requirements==
Though Eukaryotic cells are generally larger than Prokaryotic cells, there is a metabolic limit on the practical size for a cell. The smallest, lowest limit of a cell (of which is practical to have functional DNA and sustain itself) has a diameter of approximately 0.1-1.0&amp;nbsp;µm. 

Metabolic activity requires a selective plasma membrane that allows enough oxygen, nutrients, and wastes in and out of the cell. In addition, each µm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the membrane can only allow a certain number of substances to cross at a time. So, as the size of a cell increases, the volume increases proportionally larger than the cell's surface area. Smaller objects therefore, have a greater ratio of surface area to volume and an easier time of allowing nutrients in and out of the plasma membrane. Similarly, the surface area of the plasma membrane has a limit to efficiently sustain the volume inside a cell. Larger organisms in turn, sustain themselves by having ''more cells'' rather than ''larger cells''.

==Evolutionary Background==

It is believed that Eukaryotic cells were formed when a prokaryote absorbed another prokaryote that acts like a mitochondria or chloroplasts. This theory is known as endosymbiosis. The exact mechanism of how the mitochondria cell entered the host cell is not known. The DNA of the mitochondrial prokaryote and the host prokaryote then mix to create a new genome for the new cell. The other membrane bound organelles were formed by the infolding of the plasma membrane of the prokaryote. This evolutionary process occurred over 2 billion years ago. The origins of other organelles of the eukaryotic cells are still being researched by scientists.
