      <comment>/* College Myth: There is nothing to do on college campuses */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Nothing To Do? ==
Some college students may believe that there is not much activity on their campus.  This is unlikely to be true on most college campuses, as colleges and universities have begin to focus more attention on student life and activities for students in order to improve the college experience.  For instance, The University of Tampa has over 160 clubs and organizations that students can join. These range from academic-oriented clubs to intramural sports groups.&lt;ref name=&quot;UTclife&quot;&gt;http://www.ut.edu/campuslife/&lt;/ref&gt;  Many universities also include a wide variety of fraternities and sororities that plan numerous activities, both on and off campus.  Students can also take advantage of recreation opportunities on campuses, like fitness centers, game rooms, parks, and practice fields for playing sports.  Many universities also have a student-led group on campus that is responsible for planning large events, like concerts and movies.  Students can learn about what events are happening by checking the university's event calendar online.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''durable good''' is a good which lasts for a long time, so does need to be purchased often. It can be used many times before it needs to be replaced. A diamond ring is a durable good because it can be expected to last a very long time, without wearing out or needing to be replaced. In contrast, a non-durable good (such as a sandwich) does not have a long life full of many uses. Economists such as [[w:Ronald Coase|Ronald Coase]] have pointed out that a monopolist selling a durable good is in a harder position than a monopolist of non-durable goods because with durable goods, the monopolist is essentially competing with itself over time&lt;ref name=coase1972durable&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Coase| first1=Ronald| year=1982| journal=Journal of Law and economics| title=&quot;Durability and Monopoly&quot;| volume=15| Number=1|pages=143-149| url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/725018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A monopolist who sells a fine oak desk this year reduces the demand for a similar desk next year.

Government and news reporting which uses the expression &quot;durable goods&quot; is usually about things like refrigerators, cars, factory machines, and the like. However, an information good in a digital format can be more durable than a machine built to last 20 years. In this chapter, we'll consider particular issues for information goods&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;Several things which are often emphasized in studying the strategy of a durable-goods monopolists are less relevant for information goods. For example, a monopolist of a physical good may take pains to commit to limited production, but with digital copying of information goods, that isn't a very viable strategy. Similarly, a manufacturer of airplanes might consider the increased marginal cost of making a more durable plane which will have greater overall demand, but greater durability. Such trade-offs aren't very relevant for a monopolist of an information good.&lt;/ref&gt;. For this chapter, you will need to understand various background material on time, including backward induction and discounting.

In studying the nature of durable goods, it is frequently useful to describe the consumer as consuming a flow of services over time from the good. Rather than considering a consumer as consuming a CD, we can consider the consumer as consuming the service of listening to the CD this week, next week, until the consumer loses interest, technology makes the CD obsolete or the CD breaks somehow.

When modeled this way, we assume the consumer places a value for consuming the service in each period. The consumer's willingness to pay for a durable good will be the present value for them of this flow of services.

=== How far can the idea of durability extend? ===
{{cquote|A ticket to a first-run movie has the durable quality that once someone has seen the film that person is unlikely to buy a second ticket. Thus, the movie company will find the demand for tickets on any rerelease of the film to be negatively related (ceteris paribus) to the number of viewers who saw the film when it first came out.&lt;ref name=bulow1982durable&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Bulow| first1=J.I| year=1982| journal=The Journal of Political Economy| title=&quot;Durable-goods monopolists&quot;| volume=90|number=2|pages=314-332| url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/1830295}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The quote above shows that sometimes &quot;durability&quot; is a matter of consumer tastes rather than the nature of the product. Consider a piece of music versus a movie. Both are information goods, which can be delivered on a CD/DVD or via download, for rental or sale. However, a piece of music is likely to have a lot of value in repeated listening while a movie will probably have less value in repeated watching&lt;ref group=&quot;note&quot;&gt;This is a generalization, of course. Some people like to watch some movies repeatedly. This is particularly evident to parents of young children who learn to despise their kids' favorites.&lt;/ref&gt;. In some sense, you could say that a movie watched in once September might still be delivering a flow of services in November when the viewer can still remember what they enjoyed about it. In any case, from the point of view of the firm trying to profit from the good, a single viewing of a movie may be thought of as the sale of a durable good, while a single listen to a song may not. So, you can listen to newly released songs on broadcast radio, but not view newly released movies on broadcast television.

We shouldn't forget, however, that there is more than durability going on in the difference between second-run and first-run movies. Movie studios use time-delay as an important too of price discrimination as well.

== Costs associated with durable goods ==

Because durable goods last for a long time they tend to be more expensive to both manufacture and purchase while non-durable goods have a shorter life span and usually cost less to produce and procure. The exchange for between high durability and marginal cost presents sellers with a tough question Just how durable should they make the product? To make a product more durable it requires more thorough work and the use of superior materials increasing the marginal cost of the manufactured good.  The naturally high price of durable goods causes them to generally be items of investment, this also makes it more likely that individuals are able to rent them where non durable goods are usually items of consumption and therefore not necessarily rentable.

Sometimes companies tend to avoid producing products that are perfectly durable because they will lose a consumer's business after that transaction. It is in the company's interest to make products that are durable but need to be replaced over time. A consumer wants a product that is durable and will get a lot uses out of it.  This is where the balance between durability and marginal cost must be made, the item must be durable enough to entice purchase so that marginal costs may be covered.

However, the cost structure mentioned does not pertain to information goods.  Information goods do not need a long physical life like manufactured goods do therefore the above information does not pertain to that market.

== Durable information goods ==

When discussing durable information goods, an example would be a book because this item would be able to last a long time and many people could obtain the information. This book can be passed down to many generations in a family. An even better example of an information durable good is an online website. The online website can last for many years for consumers to read as long as it is not deleted by the creator or shut down. Not all information goods are durable. An example of a non durable information good is a stock tip. This tip is considered to be an information good but will only be good for a certain period of time since the market is always changing. More than likely, a consumer would not be able to use this stock tip in the future. Therefore the good is non-durable.

One important thing to note about durable information goods is that their value may deteriorate, but the information is still durable. The value of news decreases with time because the information, while being durable, does tend to lose importance and the interest of others as its currency depreciates.  Value deterioration can also be seen in software due to compatibility, as systems change and require different or newer software the other is left with less value. Another example of deteriorating value is found in popular arts, as common taste in particular popular arts lessens so does the value.  Popular arts may consist of things such as video games, an example of the loss of value within the video game market pertaining to piracy and resale and how PlayStation and Xbox are trying to fight it is given below.
:*'''[http://games.slashdot.org/story/12/04/20/2153251/if-you-resell-your-used-games-the-terrorists-win Damage of Piracy and Resale in the Video Game Market]'''
::The ability to buy pre-owned computer and console video games has caused a threat to the industry.  Because those who buy the game in the first few days possibly have the power to pirate the contents of the game and then resell it at lower than market price the value of the game and its contents goes down. Resale has taken the largest hit on the value of single player games given that taste has swayed towards multi-player in addition to the mentioned piracy. Game designers are even claiming that the repercussions from piracy and resale include the increase of game prices since the game makers are only receiving mass amount of profits from the first day of sales because they are not given any share of the resells.

== Depreciation rate for business software ==

Depreciation Rate is defined by the percentage rate at which an asset devalues. Furthermore, this is computed by dividing the depreciable cost of the asset by the number of years in the asset's estimated productive or useful life.

Business Software is important for any organization or company. Any individual or CEO might buy business software to improve the efficiency of the business and maintain data collected. This software helps cut costs and speeds up any production outputs. Although business software will be a durable good for many years it will slowly depreciate it's value due to fast pace technology advancements. Over time companies will need to update or replace their software when it is not compatible with their current business. 

One of the more popular Business Software programs is: Microsoft Office which contains multiple uses such as Power Point, Excel, Word, and many others that Business owners use every day. This software will have many useful years but will be depreciate in the future due to technology advances and companies will want higher technology to improve their efficiency.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Relationship Violence==
College can be a tumultuous time when it comes to relationships.  Many students have relationships, but many of those relationships are unhealthy.  One study found that 44.7% of college students reported having experienced violence in a relationship.  Of those, 27.7 reported emotional violence, 24.9% reported sexual violence, and 20.9% reported physical violence; 51.8% experienced 1 type of violence, 31.9% experienced 2 types of violence, and 16.2% experienced all 3 types of violence.&lt;ref name=&quot;Forke2008&quot;&gt;Forke, Christine M., Rachel K. Myers, Marina Catallozzi, and Donald F. Schwarz. 2008. “Relationship Violence Among Female and Male College Undergraduate Students.” Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med 162(7):634-641.&lt;/ref&gt;  Not all of this violence occurred during college; in fact, most reported greater violence prior to college. Of the victims: 46.2% were victims before college only, 31.3% were victims before and during college, and 22.5% were victims during college only. Most physical and emotional violence is perpetrated by the victim’s partner, followed by friends or acquaintances and strangers. By comparison, victims of sexual violence reported the perpetrators to be distributed equally among partners, friends and acquaintances. Relationship violence is never okay; college students should be aware that this is a possibility and should take advantage of on campus counseling services if something like this occurs.

==Happiness==
College may be fun, but is it the happiest time in your life?  According to some research, women feel most confident with their body shape and love life at 28. At 30, they start worrying about wrinkles and grey hair. However, women are happiest with their careers at 29 and most content with relationships at 30. At 32 they are at ease with their home and family life financially are happiest at age 33.&lt;ref name=&quot;Beeghley2007&quot;&gt;http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/women_shealth/9422638/Women-feel-most-attractive-at-28.html&lt;/ref&gt; These findings would suggest that women may be happier just after the typical age at which they attend college.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The notion of remixing has become a much debated topic in today's culture; especially when it involves the remixing of music. With the recent growth of remixing in the music industry, there have been numerous discussions regarding various topics that have an economic background when it comes to information and durable goods. Some of these topics include cumulative innovation, intellectual property laws in relation to the art of remixing along with the effects of these laws, and synthesis between multiple parties.  

== History ==

The definition of remix culture is defined as the sharing and exchange of creative information using digital technologies that use the cut/copy and paste method. Remixing music is relatively new when it comes to forms of music considering music has existed in cultures across the world for thousands of years. The idea of remixing, that is taking an original copy and altering its features to create another copy on the basis of the first one, was first established in the 1960s and the 1970s. It was predominately done in New York City with roots in Jamaican styled music. At the time, remixing was already prevalent in the native land of Jamaica and was called 'versioning'. However, as it was brought over to the night life in NYC it was mainly used in the disco styles of music that would later lead to an influx of hip/hop subcultures and styles of music.  &lt;ref name=&quot;Remix Theory&quot;&gt;[http://remixtheory.net/?page_id=3 Remix Theory]&lt;/ref&gt; As this styles appeared more and more as the fan base grew, DJs started to use various methods to create these new versions of older songs by changing aspects of the original. One of the techniques used was called &quot;beat juggling&quot;, or beat mixing. The concept of this was all done on turntables and was done on point by the disk jockey's or DJs for short. These turntables were electronic devices commonly used in the art of Djing. They would allow the DJs to mix music by taking various segments of multiple songs and placing them on top of each other or intertwining them. These turntables allow DJs to essentially create a new musical masterpiece with the flip of a switch or the press of a button. Some common methods used by DJs to mix songs include taking the original beats of the songs and either speeding them up, slowing them down, or placing beats on top of each other to create different samples on-top of the original one. &lt;ref name=&quot;Remix Theory&quot;/&gt; 

=== Non-music remixing ===

Of course outside of the musical realms of remixing, there are also other media forms where remixing occurs. Most of these different styles first emerged in the 21st century as technology advancements created new programs that allowed for such remixes to be born. Using these software programs that would literally cut, copy and paste. For example, software such as the program Maya, uses 3-d modeling to create animation in films such as Spiderman and Lord of the Rings. What this program was doing however, was taking multiple methods of animation technology and mixing them together to create in depth animations for production. Although this can be difficult to comprehend as a remixing technique, it is still considered one simply because it is the art of taking multiple, simple animations previously created and creating a more advanced animation.&lt;ref name=&quot;Remix Theory&quot;/&gt;--[[User:ItsVerdy|ItsVerdy]] ([[User talk:ItsVerdy|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ItsVerdy|contribs]]) 02:45, 25 April 2012 (UTC)

==Different forms of remixing==
There are various forms of remixing which all have similar but very different themes revolving around how they came about and what kind of different styles and methods they take on. The different forms of remixing are as follows:

* Mashups
* Remixes
* Regenerative Remix
* Megamix

=== Mashups ===

The first kind of mashup that exists is called the regressive mashup, which is found in music production. This is the most common form of remixing and is what people are most familiar with when they think of a mashup. The idea behind a regressive mashup is to take two previously recorded songs/productions and push them together so that they mesh to make a melodic sound for the ears. This kind of mashup is most common and often takes lyrics from one song and placing them on top of the beat of another song.&lt;ref name=&quot;The New Math of Mashups&quot;&gt;[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2005/01/10/050110crmu_music id=The New Math of Mashups]&lt;/ref&gt; The second kind of mashup is a called a reflexive mashup and this is actually found outside of music. An example of this would be a map that has taken two previous forms and has combined them to create a better and more in depth map.&lt;ref name=&quot;Remix Theory&quot;/&gt; By using a program such as Web 2.0, this type of mashup is taking samples from two or more initial models to combine them to create access to more complete information. Some might see the traditional Web 2.0 program as one that is not typically used for mashups. However, what web 2.0 is doing is taking sampling from various and combining them to allow software to perform specific tasks that it would not have been able to do itself while not changing the original code of the application. This is done through either static or dynamic sampling. Static sampling is when data from another source is taken only once while dynamic sampling occurs multiple times and is constantly updated as it is done. An example of a software mashup is Google Maps/Earth. With this program, users are not only able to receive directions, but they are also able to see street level views of various businesses. Users are able to find a restaurant of their liking for example, and click on that street level view to receive links to reviews of that restaurant or even possibly the menu. This is a mashup between software used in the mapping of Google, along with software that is used to link the restaurant information to a search engine.&lt;ref name=&quot;Web Application Mashups&quot;&gt;[http://books.google.com/books?id=tHQB-kLxlZ8C&amp;pg=PA174&amp;lpg=PA174&amp;dq=regenerative+remix&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oVsHZs8VjW&amp;sig=TzUZ4CZCx_13mjabLXg7_8Xv7DI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=osuhT5vKKuWbiALYm4XeBw&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=regenerative%20remix&amp;f=false id=Web Application Mashups]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remixes===

The most common type of remix is the one that occurs within music. A musical remix is taking an original song and altering the song's qualities without getting rid of the song's original &quot;spectacular aura&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;Remix Theory&quot;/&gt; This aura is defined as what makes the song unique to any other musical composition, whether it be the lyrics, beats per minute, length, melody, etc. The first ever considered musical remix was done by Walter Gibbons on the song &quot;Ten Percent&quot; by the band Double Exposure. Although remixing was first established, the first ever recorded musical remix of this song was not done until 1976. &lt;ref name=&quot;Remix Theory&quot;/&gt; This is an example of the first kind of remix, and extended version remix. 

The second kind of remix is called a selective remix. This kind of remix constitutes of adding or subtracting aspects from the original composition of the song. This type of remix became apparent in the music industry in the 1980s. Club DJs used this type of remix to add or subtract new sounds within the content of the original song and was often used in the nightlife scene in terms of music. &lt;ref name=&quot;Remix Theory&quot;/&gt;.

Last but not least is the reflexive remix. This style of remix would actually change the &quot;spectacular aura&quot; as mentioned above through adding or subtracting various musical elements or notes. The majority of these types of remixes will often extend the length of the original due to the addition of new sounds, beats, or musical styles and/or elements. One of the first and most famous reflexive remixes ever done was composed by the notorious DJ named Mad Professor when he remixed the whole entire album &quot;Protection&quot; by Massive Attack and then renamed it &quot;No Protection&quot;. At the time of this remix, both albums were released in the same year (1994) which caused some conflict between whether the changes were a production of ingenuity or if the remixed work was essentially stealing another's intellectual property rights. &lt;ref name=&quot;Remix Theory&quot;/&gt;

===Regenerative remix===

There is a minor difference when it comes to the difference between a regular remix and one that is regenerative; however, it makes a huge difference in the implications of both types. As previously stated above, a remix is using a previously already established platform (whether it be a musical song or a software program) to create a new entity. The only difference between a regenerative remix and that of a remix, is the time. A regenerative remix is comprised of transfiguring multiple elements that are not constant. In other words, the elements from which are being used have data that is constantly being updated versus staying the same in the sense of a regular remix. With the recent influx of technological advancements in the 20th century, the regenerative remix in the form of software mashups and information has become much more prevalent and has created a subculture without anyone realizing it. &lt;ref name=&quot;Remix Theory&quot;/&gt; For more clarification, a more concrete example of a regenerative remix can be found in something like Yahoo News. All of the news in the world is constantly being updated and at one point, is never truly the same. The information is always changing. The reason Yahoo News is an example of a regenerative remix is because Yahoo doesn't actually create the content, but instead it takes the data from multiple sources and simply compiles it for easy access to all. &lt;ref name=&quot;Remix Theory&quot;/&gt;  Aspects such as this regenerative remix example have created a sub-culture of information sharing between multiple users. Other examples include platforms such as Expedia for travel fares, YouTube for video sharing, or Groupon for coupon sharing. 

===Megamix===

The last form of remixing is the megamix, which is only seen in music remixing unlike some other forms. A megamix is taking the melodies of numerous songs and mixing them together to form a separate melody. The main difference between a megamix and a regular remix is with a remix, the melody being remixed is from a single song or played by a single artist(s). This megamix often done by DJs for the most part because as previously noted it takes a a couple bars from multiple melodies to mix together to create a melodic tune. &lt;ref name=&quot;Remix Theory&quot;/&gt; The most unique aspect of a megamix is what it does. A megamix tells a story through music and gives the listener a fluid path in which that person listens to. Megamixes are almost always longer in length because of this intertwining of multiple songs together to create this story for who ever is listening to it. What the megamix does is it allows the person who is listening to it to recall a whole time period versus a single artist or composition by taking multiple songs and mixing them together with a common, fluid groove all based on the listeners recognition of the songs. This is what makes a megamix allegorical. &lt;ref name=&quot;Remix Theory&quot;/&gt;

==Intellectual Property and the Law==

Their has been much debate between the art of music and the copyright laws that are connected to them. It is not always black and white, as the terms of what is allowed and disallowed is often argued about. In terms of music itself, the original composition and the person that made that composition is the owner of that song. More detail will follow what intellectual property is, the legality behind it in relation to original compositions and remixing, and how it is viewed and works within the industry.

===Intellectual property rights===

Intellectual property is defined as the untouchable aspect of property. It is the ideas of a creator that leads to the personal property of that person. Intellectual property is the result of ingenuity that is created from a creators mind of brain and then established into a form that has physical and tangible property rights. The creation of music falls under this category because music is a form of a durable good; once it is created, the original never goes away or ceases to exist. &lt;ref name=&quot;Intellectual Property Rights&quot;&gt;[http://www.hg.org/intell.html id=Intellectual Property Rights]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Copyright act of 1976===

The copyright act of 1976 was developed to protect the original arts of individuals. It protects people from having their innovations, whether it be a tangible object or not, from being replicated. It lays down the rules and regulations regarding copyright infringement and what needs to be done in order to have a work protected under copyright law. &lt;ref name=&quot;Copyright&quot;&gt;[http://www.rbs2.com/copyrm.pdf id=Copyright] &lt;/ref&gt; In most cases that arise in courts involving copyright infringement for music, most judges have been accused of misinterpreting the law when it comes to the music. In most cases, judges have been blamed for establishing judicial opinions that made it seem like they did not understand music. A famous example is the case Northern Music vs. King Record in which Judge Ryan established a judicial opinion that would prevent certain aspect of music from being copyrighted such as drum solos. However, this is not followed as a precedent in cases following it. &lt;ref name=&quot;Copyright&quot;/&gt; 

The way copyright laws are viewed in terms of remixing music is rather gray. Because remixing is taking original works and mixing these together to make a new work, there are many arguments on wether remixes are even legal. Mostly all original works that are remixed are protected by some sort of copyright law because of the fact that they are intellectual property. So their is argument that when these original songs are being used by another party to create new music that it is stealing. However, there are many artists that thrive off of remixing such as the artist Girl Talk. Girl Talk is taking original works and mixing them together to create something new. &lt;ref name=&quot;Synthesis&quot;&gt;[http://nkelber.com/engl293/blog/?p=566 id=Synthesis] &lt;/ref&gt; What Girl Talk is doing is using creativity of their own to create new works. This is following the notion of information synthesis, something that can occur when it comes to economic information goods. Synthesis is defined as the creation of a something new on the basis of combining two or more things to create it. For economic information goods such as music, there is high amounts of value in the music and wether it is being used to remix. Music that is more popular will obviously have much more value to it if it becomes synthesized. &lt;ref name=&quot;Synthesis&quot;/&gt; This where the argument arises when it comes to copyright laws over music. Stanford Professor Lawrence Lessig argues that artists should make all of their work available to be used to create new work through information synthesis. He also argues that after all, all cultural creations have used some sort of cumulative innovation at some point in time so it is unfair to persecute the same type of innovation within music. &lt;ref name=&quot;Synthesis&quot;/&gt;

===Cumulative innovation===

Cumulative innovation is described as when there is any instance of something new being created with more than one source. Remixing music is a direct example of cumulative innovation because it is the art of creating a new entity, in this case a new song, cd, etc., from original sources. As noted above in the previous section, copyright laws have limited the amount of innovation that can occur when it comes to remixing because it protects the original piece and eliminates creativity. This is creating an innovation dilemma in music between the trade offs of protecting an original work of art and eliminating creativity and innovation to establish new information goods and cultures. &lt;ref name=&quot;Dilemma&quot;&gt;[http://leeds.academia.edu/GrahamDutfield/Papers/890732/The_Innovation_Dilemma_Intellectual_Property_and_the_Historical_Legacy_of_Cumulative_Creativity id=Dilemma] &lt;/ref&gt;

Another aspect that takes place with cumulative innovation is the opening of networks for information goods to be shared. In general music is a closed network that is generally sponsored. It's network externalities are also two sided in the sense that it is music artist creating music for listeners. However, when cumulative innovation comes into play with remixing music, it helps open this network up. This is similar to going back to what Professor Lessig mentions when he believes all artist should let their music be used as a platform for new creations of ingenuity. What others have argued in terms of cumulative innovation is that music, especially remixing, would not exist without cumulative innovation at some point in history. To bring up copyright laws on artists who use remixing to create new works is similar to saying that the cumulative innovation in the music culture of hip hop was originally stolen from the blues music culture. &lt;ref name=&quot;Dilemma&quot;/&gt;

There is some basis for economic arguments when it comes to remixing solely because music is a form of a durable information good with two sided network externalities. The major argument is whether artists should allow this network to be open rather than closed. In today's world, it is very difficult to prevent someone from downloading music and then remixing it so some argue that music should be automatically expressed as an open platform for free use while still recognizing the original as intellectual property rights.

The change on Latex toc and use of the Template:LaTeX/Top seems not to take into account the print function. Am I right ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 16:25, 24 April 2012 (UTC)
:Oh... Actually, I don't know... I am rather used to wikipedia and this is not something I knew... I tried looking at [[Using Wikibooks/Print versions and PDFs]] but I am not sure if that is what you are talking about... Can you explain me a bit, or give me the good help page to look at? Thanks!

==== Reflection ====
I’ve never written a lesson plan in my life, and developing this one was way out of my comfort zone.  It gave me a renewed appreciation for what K-12 teachers do (do they really write a plan like this for every lesson?), and it renewed my conviction that I did the right thing by majoring in computer science and not teacher education.  

Although I think I understand the concept of TPaCK, it’s more difficult to put into practice than it might seem, and that makes me wonder if I really do understand it.  I don’t know that much about world religions, and I know even less about the methods of teaching social studies to high school students; that left me feeling competent in only one of the three TPaCK areas - technology.  However, the activity types compiled by [http://activitytypes.wmwikis.net/ Harris and Hofer] put “legs” on the TPaCK concept and gave me a place to start.  

My process for designing the activities did not follow a neat sequential pattern.  In fact, I had to go back and revise the original activities and activity types, for my selected standards, after I had written the lesson plan.

Like most things, TPaCKing a lesson probably gets easier with practice, but this first time was like pulling teeth. ;)

'''Day 2'''
Students will choose one particular culture and look for information about its predominant religion. The focus of this research concerns the instruments used in the religion's ceremonies.  Students will create a video explaining their findings and share them in YouTube. A rubric identifies the number of images and other media elements, the depth and quality of the research, and additional important information.

'''Day 3'''
Students will write in a Google Doc ideas that illustrate their pre-existing knowledge about music and religious dances from South America.  Next, they will watch a video from a religious festivity in Chile at the following link - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4oYb5qwViE&amp;feature=related.  After the video, students will research this festival (and others across South America) and put the information in Google Docs.

|}


'''Extensions''' 

Students are able to earn extra credit by completing one or more of the listed activities:
* Find additional types of dances that are related to religions in other parts of the world.
* Make a video simulating a religious ceremony including dancing and music - caution must be exercised with this option; any video must be respectful of the religious ceremony. 

'''Assessment Plan''' 

''Formative assessment''

Students have a rubric to develop self assessment and peer-assessment strategies. This rubric includes quality of the artifact, quality of the information included, and use of technology.

''Summative assessment''

Students are evaluated via a rubric. This rubric includes artifact quality, evaluation of the information included, use of technology, group work, self assessment and peer assessment.

==== Reflection ====
From my point of view, TPaCK opens a new approach.  This approach is based on learners' experiences. Students select information and create something with the information available.  Also, teachers become guides helping students to understand and apply the knowledge they acquire.

The challenges that I faced were Iowa Core Standards and creating lesson plans. The first lesson was fairly simple to create.  My greatest problem lay in imagining and developing the activities, because I am not a expert in music or history. Related to the lesson plan specifically, I can say this is the first time that I have seen a lesson plan like this, so it was a kind of difficult to understand the way it works.

In summary, I learned a lot doing this. I learned how to combine the three parts of TPaCK and create a lesson plan.

Students can receive extra credit by creating a blog that pertains to this course.  They will have to find videos of performances, articles and websites, then post their thoughts and opinions on their blogs.


'''Assessment Plan''' 

''Formative Assessment''

Students will be observed throughout the course in class discussions and individual assignments.  Students will submit evidence of progress at the end of each activity through video, write-up or VoiceThread.


''Summative Assessment''

Students will use their choice of technology to express and discuss various topics in this course.  They will be evaluated by a rubric that they have access to view at any time in the course.

==== Reflection ====
TPaCK is an interesting method that I found to be very useful and possibly effective in any lesson plan strategy.  This method can be used to &quot;feed the need&quot; of anyone wanting to implement technology into his or her curriculum.

This approach is the opposite of how things are usually done.  Instead of a tool being implemented to improve a course, tools are usually added just because, it's the next new thing.  The TPaCK method forces you to think of the issue at hand and then what technology can be added to better the outcome you are trying to achieve.

'''Assessment'''

''Formative Assessment:'' Students are observed throughout the learning experience and submit evidence of progress at the end of each activity.

''Summative Assessment:''  Students use technology to communicate cultural similarities and differences in music and discuss their findings with classmates using VoiceThread. Quality will be evaluated using a rubric distributed at the beginning of the lesson.


==== Reflection ====

I found the TPACK method to be a logical, methodical process that can be used to introduce technology into conventional lesson plan development. As Judi Harris indicated, this process allows established learning goals and activities to guide appropriate technology choices, rather than selecting technology first and striving to fit learning goals to the capabilities of the technology.

This approach to technology selection is familiar to me. In my current role as a technology support specialist, one of my responsibilities is to recommend/select technologies that address and complement stated business needs. Identifying and clearly defining needs prior to selection and implementation is critical for success.

== &lt;font color=&quot;Green&quot;&gt;Group Report&lt;/font&gt; ==

'''Process Description''' 

We met via Skype and a Google Document to determine our subject, standards, activities and activity types.  We each selected two of the standards to work on, and then worked individually to flesh out the activities associated with each standard.  We met again to review our list and to make plans for next steps.  Each member then created individual lesson plans, and we met again to review our work and work together to finalize this group report.


'''Challenges''' 
* Finding times to meet that worked for everyone.
* Finding subject areas that pertained to our Performing Arts School.
* Reaching a common understanding of the assignment.
* Understanding the individual portion of this assignment.


'''Realizations''' 
* The overall process allowed us to better understand how to include TPaCK in a lesson plan.
* It is possible to develop group work at a distance using technology.
* TPaCK is more student-centered than other approaches.

The assignment allowed us to begin to develop skills necessary to select technology according the needs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Background===

An oligopoly is very similar to a monopoly in a sense where one company dominates the market but in this case there are at least two firms dominating the market. These firms are able to influence the price for a product in the market. A key component to an oligopoly is interdependence between the few firms which means that each firm must take into consideration reactions of the other firms in the market when the firm decides on a price. The products that the oligopolistic firms produce are typically very similar and are competing for market share. These companies don't have complete control since there are more than one firm with market power.

===Etymology===

The word &quot;oligopoly&quot; comes from two Greek words:  oligo, meaning &quot;few,&quot; and polein, &quot;sellers.&quot; 

===Concentration Ratios===
A Concentration Ratio is a tool used to illustrate total output produced in a certain industry by a given number of firms. Oligopolies can be discovered using concentration ratios because it measures the total market share dictated by the certain amount of firms. When a high concentration ratio is present in an industry, it can be identified the industry as an oligopoly. 

===Examples of Oligopolies===

::*Cell Phone Companies: AT&amp;T, Sprint, Verizon, T-Mobile

::*Laundry Detergent: Tide, Arm &amp; Hammer, All, Cheer

===Barriers To Entry===

Oligopolies tend to continuously dominate the market because it can be costly or difficult for potential rivals to enter the industry. These high start up costs can be too expensive and the company is at risk due to the uncertainty for success. Paying for high start up costs will put a company in the negatives and can cause a company to become bankrupt.

===Cournot Solution===
In 1838 the first solution to oligopolistic interdependence is associated with Antoine Augustin Cournot who was a French economist as well as a mathematician. Even though most theories only applied to two firms he always emphasized his analysis to three or more. He resolved this problem by suggesting that firms strive to maximize their profits under the assumption that its rivals’ outputs were constant. Each oligopoly firm will supply that remaining share to maximize profits. Cournot’s wanted to provide his awareness of the interdependence between the oligopolists and he also made demand curves to illustrate the market's reaction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Background==

Software as a Service or SaaS is sometimes referred to as On-Demand software.SaaS can be traced all the way back to the 1960s. IBM and other companies engaged in ways to automate certain business aspects. This started first with was data storage and computation or Utility Computing, which began as a metered service. This led to the development of On-Demand software. IBM is still in the On-Demand software business and it is estimated they will spend $10 billion a year on delivering and providing these software services. &lt;ref name=Background&gt; http://www.zdnet.com/news/on-demand-computing-what-are-the-odds/296135&lt;/ref&gt;

SaaS has come a long way and is constantly changing and new companies and features are popping up everywhere. With the evolution of SaaS it is possible to do things at home or from any computer. You can now do your taxes with the help of software such as TurboTax and QuickBooks without having to go down the street to an H&amp;R block or other firm. It is also possible for organizations such as restaurants to schedule employees and host training materials online with tools like WhenToManage. On the side of Customer Relationship Management firms could use tools such as Salesforce to schedule appointments and store important information. SaaS is changing the way the world does business.

With On-Demand software or Software as a Service a lot can be said for having extra help with running your business. The ability to have a software solution to handle issues that will cause businesses and individuals with headaches will alleviate pressures on employees and help businesses run more smoothly, effectively, and efficiently. There are many solutions out there for businesses that allow them to be more efficient. The explosion of smart phones and the app market has only helped this case. There are now apps people can have on their phone that help them deal with things such as personal finance, interview preparation, file storage, and many others. Applications like these help people keep track of purchases and bill paying bringing order to many peoples cluttered and hectic lives.

==Differentiation==

'''SaaS allows for:'''

*Easier Administration
*Time Savings
*Easier Collaboration
*Easier Accessibility

There are many different types of software that fall under this category. Here are a few examples:

*'''Customer Relationship Management''' 

Software as a Service is saving people and businesses time by automating things and providing tools to get things done. Take Salesforce for example, Salesforce announced in 2007 that it would now provide a platform for Financial Advisors. While working with many partners Salssforce was able to redefine how a Financial Advisor goes about everyday business. Merrill Lynch started using Salesforce software to help the company better manage clients. Salesforce allows them to put in client information including, notes on a Financial Advisor's last visit or talk with a client. Other things can also include a clients birthday as well as reminders to call the client for follow up meetings or discussions. Salesforce also allows them to bring up the clients information profile page when receiving a call from that client. Salesforce completely revamped financial services applications. Salesforce gives Financial Advisors everything they need in one place. This software will allow them to know their client better by having information about the client readily available. It also has plans of action for clients and has storage of specific goals by client so the Advisor can go into their page and know where they stand with each client. It allows teams to all have access to their own client’s information. This is helpful in many ways. When someone is out of the office and a client calls a team member can go into the system and have all the client information there. This helps big companies when clients work with specific people. Having Salesforce also eliminates a lot of paper from the workplace. Files are still kept for records but everything can be automated and put into Salesforce. This helps cut more time out of the equation and time savings is money savings. &lt;ref name=Differentiation4&gt;https://www.salesforce.com/company/news-press/press-releases/2007/02/070227.jsp.&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Accounting and Taxes'''

TurboTax simplifies many things about how people file their taxes, an individual 30 or 40 years ago would have to certainly go to an accounting firm or accountant to file their taxes and fill out forms. They would pay for this service and in many cases waste time preparing things for the accountant. Now we have services such as TurboTax and QuickBooks that can do these things for you. You pay for the software and can now, from your home computer, enter everything from your employers W-2 form and follow an easy step by step process to file your taxes. It takes very little time and effort and you can file your taxes online from your house without having to mail anything in.Every year people dread doing their tax returns, they have to go to a professional, in some cases they charge too much and the process is too complicated. TurboTax simplifies this by offering specific deductions and having a step by step guide with all of the information a user needs to file their taxes. There are many deductions people can take advantage of if they qualify. TurboTax will ask questions of you and based on how you answer it determines if you qualify for a deduction of that type. TurboTax even has a section for good will donations where you can type in what you gave away, say clothing for example, and it estimates a price for you. You can type in what clothes you gave away for instance a pair of pants, you then enter the condition of the pants and it comes up with a price figure for your contribution.&lt;ref name=Differentiation1&gt; http://www.turbotax.com/lp/ty11/ppc/blkbrd-dlx-nav.jsp?cid=ppc_gg_b_stan_dk_us_lv-trbtx-hw-mch&amp;adid=21654800388&amp;skw=how%20much%20is%20TurboTax&amp;kw=turbotax+costs&amp;ven=gg&amp;srqs=1&amp; &lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Administrative and Scheduling'''

WhenToManage software is made for the restaurant industry. It includes a cost saving and time saving way to put all the restaurants essentials in one place. In terms of scheduling WhenToManage allows for the managers and employees to take everything online. Managers and employees will each have login accounts for WhenToManage and managers can post schedules and also send time off requests to managers. A message can be sent out to notify all employees of their new schedule thus eliminating the need to go check the schedule or to swing by the restaurant to check when you are working. This software also allows employers to put up training and informational manuals for employees to have at their disposal. Instead of going into the store to pick up a physical copy or ask questions about different aspects of their job everything is online and readily accessible. &lt;ref name=Differentiation2&gt; http://www.saasdir.com/profile/whentomanage/&lt;/ref&gt; Many companies such as Del Friscos Restaurant Group have implemented this software. Del Friscos Restaurant Group has over 161 restaurants in the union and has benefited from having a way to track everything happening at all their restaurants. As a national chain it was hard to monitor financial figures on every store but implementing WhenToManage changed all of that. As a national company this helps them to keep track of everything easier and when going from store to store it allows for uniformity. According to research done by the Iternational Data Corporation employees spend on average over a quarter of their time looking for information and they only find what they are looking for half the time. Del Friscos Restaurant Group benefits greatly from having WhenToManage software. Information is now more readily available and less time is wasted. &lt;ref name=Differentiation3&gt;http://smartersoftware.whentomanage.com/lone-star-steakhouse/&lt;/ref&gt;

These are just a couple of examples of how Software as a Service is revolutionizing the way we do things. It provides a time and in many ways a cost saving. Time is a valuable commodity and many companies are developing SaaS that can save people and businesses a lot of time and energy.

==Market for SaaS==

Technology companies who have realized the potential for automating certain aspects of business are now benefiting from it. Starting in the 1960s with IBM firms have looked toward computing for business solutions. Now there are many firms in the market for Software as a Service. Market leaders such as Netsuite are profiting off of offering businesses services which have never existed before the technology and computing era. Microsoft did not take advantage of offering Software as a Service in many categories and has since paid for it. The success of smaller firms such as Intact, Netsuite, and Salesforce has hurt Microsoft as they are not a part of the SaaS market.&lt;ref name=MarketSaaS&gt; Defelice, A. &quot;Software As a Service.&quot; Accounting Technology. 23.6 (2007): 37-41. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Microsoft has fallen behind on SaaS as other smaller companies have taken market share right from under its feet. Microsoft has many software applications, typically sold in a bundle. This business does not have a large exposure in commercials but presentations are made every day to businesses offering them On-Demand software solutions. Between restaurants having SaaS has given them a competitive advantage and has streamlined the business. This can also be said for small businesses who have implemented software to reduce the amount of work or people they need to spend money on. 

==Implications==

Software as a Service has created a new market which, in the last ten years alone has ballooned in size. SaaS has created a new market which has positive economic benefits. In terms of networks more users will benefit from the existence of these services. This is true for all of On-Demand software. Companies also benefit from more users of their product. The existence of software such as WhenToManage, mentioned above, will allow companies to save money and streamline the ways that they make money. Salesforce will allow companies a competitive advantage in managing client relationships through having everything at their fingertips. This will allow Financial Advisors to take on more clients and increase their bottom line through expanding clientele and money managed. 

TurboTax will have slightly different implications. Companies such as H&amp;R Block are now forced to compete with a product that does not require a user or consumer to go to a physical location and sit down with a tax consultant. H&amp;R Block has come out with its own software and continues to compete for market share in the market for personal tax returns. 

It is expected that in the long term SaaS will be even more competitive as many technology and software companies will take advantage of a new way to make money by streamlining business operations. This industry will be more competitive because in the long term the cost of owning a particular software solution will increase. This increase will cause companies to compete in terms of prices and services offered. If users and businesses are billed at a flat rate it will be different than if they are paid per use and so on. Companies enjoy supply chain economies of scale by having copies upon copies of each product for nothing. They will also enjoy smaller costs associated with upkeep of their product. &lt;ref name=Implications1&gt;http://www.formtek.com/blog/?p=1481 &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What a Good Chiropractor Can Provide You ==

Are you looking to find a treatment for your neck and back pain? Do you get migraines and headaches often? Does your body ache from a sports injury or a pinched nerve that does not seem to go away? You might find this article relevant in helping you find a solution to your problems through chiropractic care, and choose the right chiropractor North Sydney. 

Chiropractic is basically a physical therapy that focuses on the treatment of the central nervous system and the spine, and one of the best chiropractic services available today is at St. Leonards, North Shore. [http://wiki.monroe.edu/index.php/North_Sydney_Chiropractic Chiropractor North Shore] experts are responsible for helping you keep a healthy lifestyle, through working with the power of the body to naturally heal itself. 

The Chiropractor North Sydney has studied the relationship between the human spine structure and how that influences your health. They can spot and correct the source of your health issues that occur, caused by the misalignment of the spine’s vertebrae. 

While there are a number of North Shore Chiropractic clinics that are recommended, those in St. Leonards prove to be one of the most prominent. If you want to make sure that the chiropractic clinic you are going to provides quality services, you could ask them these queries:

-	Are the services covered by the Australian health fund? If they are, how much? 
-	Have they ever had a patient with the same case as mine?
-	The sessions, how much does each cost?
-	If availing for multiple sessions, will there be discounts?
-	Are they aiming to treat the main cause of the condition and put a patient onto the course of greater wellness?

All these questions, particularly the last one, are extremely important, as any professional, like the chiropractor St. Leonards, aims to not solely adjust your spine and relieve your neck and back pain, they also have to assist you in achieving an improved wellbeing. Below are some ways that can get you on the said path.

-	Frequent visits to your chiropractor North Sydney are crucial. This is to help your nervous system and spine function well.
-	Following a healthy eating regime will give your body the right amount of nutrients it needs to work and thrive every day.
-	To avoid dehydration and eliminate toxins, drinking plenty of pure water is needed.
-	Working out regularly will also keep your body healthy and in shape. 
-	Get enough rest and sleep, so your body can restore energy.
-	Keeping an optimistic view in everything also helps. 

A proficient North Shore chiropractor should assist you in these processes. The therapy is not going to heal your condition overnight; it will take more than one session, depending on the seriousness of your situation. Also, you will need a continuous treatment to keep your body in top shape.</text>

If you don't understand this, don't worry. Just skip it and move on.

Python is an [[w:interpreted programming language|interpreted programming language]]. For those who don't know, a programming language is what you write down to tell a computer what to do. However, the computer doesn't read the language directly—there are hundreds of programming languages, and it couldn't understand them all. So, when someone writes a program, they will write it in their language of choice, and then [[w:compiler|compile]] it—that is, turn it into lots of 0s and 1s, that the computer can easily and quickly understand. A Windows program that you buy is already compiled for Windows—if you opened the program file up, you'd just get a mass of weird characters and rectangles. Give it a go—find a small Windows program, and open it up in Notepad or Wordpad. See what garbled mess you get.

But that Windows program is compiled for Windows—no other machine can run that program, unless it has Windows. What Python is, is a language which is never actually compiled in full—instead, an interpreter turns each line of code into 0s and 1s that your computer can understand. And it is done on the fly—it compiles the bits of the program you are using as you are using them. If you were to quit the program and come back another day, it would compile the bits you are using, as you are using them, again. Seems a waste of time? Maybe, but the fact is that when you come back another day, you might be using a Windows PC instead of a Mac. You might send the program to a friend, who uses another type of computer. Or you might post your program on the internet, where everyone using all different types of systems might download it. That is the wonder of an interpreted programming language—it is like a language that ''everyone'' can understand.

== How to install Python ==
For Python programming you need a working Python installation and a text editor. Python comes with its own editor ''IDLE'', which is quite nice and totally sufficient for the beginning. As you get more into programming, you will probably switch to some other editor like ''emacs'', ''vi'' or another.

The Python download page is [https://www.python.org/downloads/ https://www.python.org/downloads/]. The most recent version is 3.4.1, but any ''Python 2.x'' version since 2.2 will work for this tutorial. Be careful with ''Python 3'', though, as some significant details have changed, and hence this tutorial's examples will not work with it. A version of this tutorial for Python 3 is at [[Non-Programmer's Tutorial for Python 3]]. There are various different installation files for different computer platforms available on the download site. Here are some specific instructions for the most common operating systems:

==== Linux, BSD and Unix users ====
You are probably lucky and Python is already installed on your machine. To test it type &lt;tt&gt;python&lt;/tt&gt; on a command line. If you see something like that in the following section, you are set.

If you have to install Python, just use the operating system's package manager or go to the repository where your packages are available and get Python. Alternatively, you can compile Python from scratch after downloading the source code. If you get the source code make sure you compile in the Tk extension if you want to use IDLE.&lt;!-- Is this realistic for people who don't know how to program??? --&gt;

==== Mac users ====
Starting from Mac OS X (Tiger), Python ships by default with the operating system, but you  might want to update to the newer version (check the version by starting &lt;tt&gt;python&lt;/tt&gt; in a command line terminal). Also IDLE (the Python editor) might be missing in the standard installation. If you want to (re-)install Python, you can get it from the [https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/ Mac download page] on the Python site.

==== Windows users ====
Some computer manufacturers pre-install Python. To check if you already have it installed, open command prompt (Windows Key+R and type cmd) or MS-DOS and type python. If it says &quot;Bad command or file name&quot; you will need to download the appropriate Windows installer from [https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.7.8/ the Windows download page].  If you do not have a 64-bit AMD or Intel chip processor, you will need the '''Windows x86 MSI Installer'''; otherwise the '''Windows x86-64 MSI Installer''' is the correct one (they are very similarly named, so check carefully which one you are downloading).  Start the installer by double-clicking it and follow the prompts.

After installing you will need to add the installation path to the PATH system variable if you wish to use it from the command prompt instead of the IDLE editor.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

OK! We have Python installed, now what? Well, we program!

And it is that simple (at least for now!). Python makes it easy to run single lines of code—one-liner programs. Let's give it a go.

== Opening IDLE ==

Run the program labelled IDLE (Stands for Integrated Development Environment).

Now you are in the IDLE environment. This is the place you will be spending most time in. Here you can open a new window to write a program, or you can simply mess around with single lines of code, which is what we are going to do. Type the following and press enter (don't type '&gt;&gt;&gt;' as it should already be there but yes in python 3.0 you have to add(&quot; sin to start after using print command and &quot;) for closing or it will show an error message...

;Code Example 1 : Hello, world!

&gt;&gt;&gt; print (&quot;Hello, world!&quot;)

What happened? You just created a program, that prints the words 'Hello, world'. The IDLE environment that you are in immediately compiles whatever you have typed in. This is useful for testing things, e.g., defining a few variables, and then testing to see if a certain line will work. That will come in a later lesson though.

== Math in Python ==

Now try the following examples. I've given explanations in parentheses.

;Code Example 2 – Maths
&lt;pre&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 + 1
2

&gt;&gt;&gt; 20 + 80
100

&gt;&gt;&gt; 18294 + 449566
467860
(These are additions.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; 6 - 5
1
(Subtraction)

&gt;&gt;&gt; 2 * 5
10
(Multiplication)

&gt;&gt;&gt; 5 ** 2
25
(Exponentials; e.g., this one is 5 squared)

&gt;&gt;&gt; print (&quot;1 + 2 is an addition&quot;)
1 + 2 is an addition
(The print statement, which writes something onscreen. Notice that 1 + 2 is left unevaluated.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; print (&quot;One kilobyte is 2^10 bytes, or&quot;, 2 ** 10, &quot;bytes.&quot;)
One kilobyte is 2^10 bytes, or 1024 bytes.
(You can print sums and variables in a sentence.
	The commas separating each section are a way of
	separating clearly different things that you are printing.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; 21 / 3
7

&gt;&gt;&gt; 23 / 3
7
(Division; note that Python ignores remainders/decimals.)

&gt;&gt;&gt; 23.0 / 3.0
7.666666666666667
(This time, since the numbers are decimals themselves, the answer
	will be a decimal.

&gt;&gt;&gt; 23 % 3
2

&gt;&gt;&gt; 49 % 10
9
(The remainder from a division)
&lt;/pre&gt;

As you see, there is the code, then the result of that code. I then explain them in brackets. These are the basic commands of Python, and what they do. Here is a table to clarify them (because tables look cool, and make you feel smarter ;) ):

{| width=40% border=1
  |+ Table 1 – Python operators
|-
  ! Command
  ! Name
  ! Example
  ! Output
|-
|&lt;nowiki&gt;+&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|Addition
|4 + 5
|9
|-
|&lt;nowiki&gt;-&lt;/nowiki&gt;
|Subtraction
|8 - 5
|3
|-
|*
|Multiplication
|4 * 5
|20
|-
|/
|Division
|19 / 3
|6
|-
|%
|Remainder ([[w:modulous|modulo]])
|19 % 3
|1
|-
|**
|Exponent
|2 ** 4
|16
|}

Remember that thing called [[w:order of operations|order of operations]] that they taught in maths? Well, it applies in Python, too. Here it is, if you need reminding:

# parentheses ()
# exponents **
# multiplication *, division \, and remainder %
# addition + and subtraction -

== Order of Operations ==

Here are some examples that you might want to try, if you're rusty on this:

;Code Example 3 – Order of operations
&lt;pre lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; 1 + 2 * 3
7
&gt;&gt;&gt; (1 + 2) * 3
9
&lt;/pre&gt;

In the first example, the computer calculates 2 * 3 first, then adds 1 to it. This is because multiplication has the higher priority (at 3) and addition is below that (at a lowly 4).

In the second example, the computer calculates 1 + 2 first, then multiplies it by 3. This is because parentheses (brackets, like the ones that are surrounding this interluding text ;) ) have the higher priority (at 1), and addition comes in later than that.

Also remember that the math is calculated from left to right, ''unless'' you put in parentheses. The innermost parentheses are calculated first. Watch these examples:

;Code Example 4 – Parentheses
&lt;pre lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; 4 - 40 - 3
-39
&gt;&gt;&gt; 4 - (40 - 3)
-33
&lt;/pre&gt;

In the first example, 4 - 40 is calculated,then - 3 is done.

In the second example, 40 - 3 is calculated, then it is subtracted from 4.

== Comments, Please ==

The final thing you'll need to know to move on to multi-line programs is the [[w:comment (computer programming)|comment]]. You should always add comments to code to show others who might be reading your code what you've done and why. Type the following (and yes, the output is shown):

;Code Example 5 – Comments
&lt;pre lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; #I am a comment. Fear my wrath!

&gt;&gt;&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

A comment is a piece of code that is not run. In Python, you make something a comment by putting a hash (#) in front of it. A hash comments everything after it in the line, and nothing before it. So you could type this:

;Code Example 6 – Comment examples
&lt;pre&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt; print (&quot;food is very nice&quot;) #eat me
food is very nice
(A normal output, without the smutty comment,
thank you very much)

&gt;&gt;&gt;# print &quot;food is very nice&quot;

(Nothing happens, because the code was after a comment)

&gt;&gt;&gt; print &quot;food is very nice&quot; eat me

(You'll get a fairly harmless error message,
because you didn't put your comment after a hash)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Comments are important for adding necessary information for another programmer to read, but not the computer; for example, an explanation of a section of code, saying what it does, or what is wrong with it. You can also comment out bits of code if you don't want them to compile, but can't delete them because you might need them later.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

Well, we can make one-liner programs. So what? You want to send programs to other people, so that they can use them, without knowing how to write them.

== Editing in Notepad ==

Writing programs in Python to a file is ''very'' easy. Python programs are simply text documents—you can open them up in Notepad (or another [[w:text editor|text editor]]), and have a look at them, just like that. So, go and open Notepad. Type the following:

;Code Example 1 – mary.py
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#A simple program.
print(&quot;Mary had a little lamb,&quot;)
print(&quot;its fleece was white as snow;&quot;)
print(&quot;and everywhere that Mary went&quot;),
print(&quot;her lamb was sure to go.&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

Keep this exactly the same, down to where the commas are placed. Save the file as &lt;tt&gt;mary.py&lt;/tt&gt;—and make sure Notepad doesn't add &lt;tt&gt;.txt&lt;/tt&gt; to the end of the filename (you will have to tell it to save as any file to avoid this). Turn off 'Hide known file extensions' in Windows Explorer, if it makes it easier.

== Using the IDLE environment ==

Now, open up the Python IDLE program (should be in your start menu). Click 'File &gt; Open' and find &lt;tt&gt;mary.py&lt;/tt&gt; and open it. If you can't find &lt;tt&gt;mary.py&lt;/tt&gt;, set the open dialogue to 'Files of type: All Files (*)'. A new window will open, showing the program you just wrote. To run your program, click 'Run &gt; Run Module' (or just press {{key press|F5}}). Your program will now run in the main Python screen (titled 'Python Shell') and will look like this:

;Code Example 2 – &lt;tt&gt;mary.py&lt;/tt&gt; output
&lt;pre&gt;
Mary had a little lamb,
its fleece was white as snow;
and everywhere that Mary went her lamb was sure to go.
&lt;/pre&gt;

You can also use IDLE to create Python programs, like what you did in Notepad. Simply click 'File &gt; New'. We will be writing all of our programs now in the Python IDLE program—the Notepad thing is just a demonstration to tell you that a &lt;tt&gt;.py&lt;/tt&gt; file is just a simple text file, which anyone can see.

There are a couple of things to notice here:

First of all, the comment wasn't shown. That is good, because remember—comments aren't compiled. (Try compiling it after removing the #—it comes out messy.)

Second, is that the 3rd and 4th line got joined. This is because there is a comma just outside the inverted commas that surround the text. In the &lt;tt&gt;print&lt;/tt&gt; command, this stops the program from starting a new line on the screen when showing text.

You can also run the program from your command line program (e.g., &lt;tt&gt;cmd&lt;/tt&gt;). Open the prompt up, type &lt;code&gt;cd path\to\your\file&lt;/code&gt; then type &lt;code&gt;python mary.py&lt;/code&gt;. Your program will now execute in the command line.

== Variables ==

Now let's start introducing variables. Variables store a value, that can be looked at or changed at a later time. Let's make a program that uses variables. Open up IDLE and click 'File &gt; New Window'. A new window now appears, and it is easy to type in programs. Type the following (or just copy and paste—just read very carefully, and compare the code to the output that the program will make):

;Code Example 3 – Variables
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#Variables demonstrated
print (&quot;This program is a demo of variables.&quot;)
v = 1
print(&quot;The value of v is now&quot;, v)
v = v + 1
print(&quot;v now equals itself plus one, making it worth&quot;, v)
v = 51
print(&quot;v can store any numerical value, to be used elsewhere.&quot;)
print(&quot;For example, in a sentence. v is now worth&quot;, v)
print(&quot;v times 5 equals&quot;, v * 5)
print(&quot;But v still only remains&quot;, v)
print(&quot;To make v five times bigger, you would have to type v = v * 5&quot;)
v = v * 5
print(&quot;There you go, now v equals&quot;, v, &quot;and not&quot;, v / 5)
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that if you just want to modify a variable's value with respect to itself, there are shortcuts. These are called [[w:augmented assignment|augmented assignment operators]]:

{| width=40% border=1
  |+ Table 1 – Augmented operators
|-
  ! Standard form
  ! Augmented
|-
|v = v + 5
|v += 5
|-
|v = v - 5
|v -= 5
|-
|v = v * 5
|v *= 5
|-
|v = v / 5
|v /= 5
|}

== Strings ==

As you can see, variables store values, for use at a later time. You can change them at any time. You can put in more than numbers, though. Variables can hold things like text. A variable that holds text is called a string. Try this program:

;Code Example 4 – Strings
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#Giving variables text, and adding text.
word1 = &quot;Good&quot;
word2 = &quot;morning&quot;
word3 = &quot;to you too!&quot;
print(word1, word2)
sentence = word1 + &quot; &quot; + word2 + &quot; &quot; + word3
print(sentence)
&lt;/source&gt;

The output will be:

;Code Example 5 – String output
&lt;pre&gt;
Good morning
Good morning to you too!
&lt;/pre&gt;

As you see, the variables above were holding text. Variable names can also be longer than one letter—here, we had word1, word2, and word3. As you can also see, strings can be added together to make longer words or sentences. However, spaces aren't added in between the words—hence me putting in the &quot; &quot; things (there is one space between those).

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{rfd}}

The queen, at home, went in front of the glass and said:

&quot;Looking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall,
Who in this land is the fairest of all?&quot;
Then it answered as before:

&quot;Well, you are fairest of all I see,
But over the hills, where the seven dwarfs dwell,
Snow-white is still alive and well,
And none is so fair as she.&quot;
When she heard the glass speak like that she trembled and shook with rage. &quot;Snow-white shall die,&quot; she cried, &quot;even if it costs me my life!&quot;

Then she went into a quite secret, lonely room where no one ever came, and made a very poisonous apple. Outside it looked pretty white with a red cheek, but whoever ate a piece of it must surely die.

When the apple was ready, she painted her face and dressed herself up as a country-woman. Then she went over the seven mountains to the seven dwarfs again and knocked at the door. Snow-white put her head out of the window and said, &quot;I cannot let anyone in; the seven dwarfs have forbidden me to do so.&quot;

&quot;It's all the same to me,&quot; answered the woman, &quot;I shall soon get rid of my apples. There, I'll give you one.&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; said Snow-white, &quot;I dare not take anything.&quot;

&quot;Are you afraid of poison?&quot; said the old woman; &quot;look, I will cut the apple in two pieces; you eat the red cheek, and I will eat the white.&quot;

The apple was so cunningly made that only the red cheek was poisoned. Snow-white longed for the fine apple, and when she saw that the woman ate part of it she could resist no longer. She stretched out her hand and took the poisonous half. But hardly had she got a bit of it in her mouth than she fell down dead. Then the queen looked at her with a dreadful look, laughed aloud and said, &quot;White as snow, red as blood, black as ebony-wood! this time the dwarfs cannot wake you up.&quot;

And when she asked of the looking-glass at home:

&quot;Looking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall,
Who in this land is the fairest of all?&quot;
it answered at last:

&quot;Hm, in this land you are still the fairest of all
As long as it lasts.
But age is wont to take its toll, you know.&quot;
Then her envious heart had slightly more rest.

The dwarfs, when they came home in the evening, found Snow-white lying on the ground, without breathing, as far as they could tell. They lifted her up, looked to see whether they could find anything poisonous, unlaced her, combed her hair, washed her with water and wine, but it was all of no use; the poor child lay still and unmoving. They laid her on a bier, and all seven of them sat round it and wept for her, and wept two days long.

She still looked as if she was alive, and still had her pretty red cheeks, so they said, &quot;We cannot bury her in the dark ground.&quot; So they had a transparent coffin of glass made, so that she could be seen from all sides. There were many small, round holes in the coffin too, just in case Snow-white was alive. They had been mistaken many times before already. Then they laid Snow-white in it and wrote her name on it in golden letters, and that she was a king's daughter. They put the coffin out on the mountain, and one of them was to stay by it and keep guard. Birds came too and wept for Snow-white; first an owl, then a raven, and last a dove.

Now Snow-white lay for many hours in the glass coffin. She did not change, but looked as if she were asleep - as white as snow, as red as blood, and with hair as black as ebony.

 (***start rewrite***)

Now a king's son came into the forest. He saw the coffin on the mountain, and the beautiful Snow-white within it, and read what was written on it in golden letters. Then he said to the dwarf who stood on guard, &quot;Let me have the coffin, I will give you whatever you want for it.&quot;

The guardian dwarf summoned the others, and they answered, &quot;We will not part with it for all the gold in the world.&quot;

Then he said, &quot;Let me have it as a gift, then, for I cannot live without seeing Snow-white. I will honour and prize her.&quot;

As he spoke in this way the good dwarfs took pity on him, and gave him the coffin. Now the king's son had it carried away by his servants on their shoulders. As they walked along with it, they chanced to stumble over a tree-stump and lose the coffin on the ground. The thump made the poisonous piece of apple that Snow-white had bitten off come out of her throat. Before long she opened her eyes, lifted up the lid of the coffin, sat up, and was alive!

&quot;Oh, heavens, where am I?&quot; she cried. The king's son, full of joy, said, &quot;You are with me.&quot; He told her what had happened, and said, &quot;I love you more than everything in the world; come with me to my father's palace and be my wife.&quot;

Snow-white was willing and went with him, and their wedding was held with great show and splendour. Snow-white's wicked step-mother was also bidden to the feast. When she had arrayed herself in beautiful clothes she went before the looking-glass, and said:

&quot;Looking-glass, looking-glass, on the wall,
Who in this land is the fairest of all?&quot;
The glass answered:

&quot;Well, queen, of all here the fairest you are,
But the young queen is fairer by far.&quot;
Then the wicked woman cursed and was so wretched that she did not know what to do. At first she would not go to the wedding at all, but she had no peace, and must go to see the young queen. When she went in she saw it was Snow-white; and the queen stood still with rage and fear and could not stir. But iron slippers were brought in and set before her. She was forced to put them on and dance and dance. She got so embarrassed of the iron footwear that she dropped dead.</text>

Made a few edits
*Wasn't sure why there were two sections (&quot;Pricing complements generally&quot; and &quot;Prices of zero, or negative&quot;), so I deleted these. 
*Made some formatting fixes.
*Why no mention of 3rd degree price discrimination, or market segmentation, in the [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/w/index.php?title=Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Monopoly&amp;action=submit#Price_discrimination Price discrimination] section?
*Some words (such as Marginal Cost) were arbitrarily capitalized, while other words that should have been capitalized weren't (windows 7, etc).
*There should not be spaces between a parenthesis symbol and the text inside it, like &quot;( Bell Telephone)&quot;.
*Be careful when you mention that consumers do not benefit from price discrimination. In some instances groups of consumers are better off than they would have been with a uniform price. I wouldn't say it &quot;only&quot; benefits the seller, although it probably does ''most'' of the time.

== Knowledge Advantage ==
In that section if mentions 3 major causes for the thwart monopoly formation. Patents, Intellectual property law may serve to strategically prevent (if not issued or respected) or enable monopolistic practices, mostly it enables since a patent provides the right to exclude others.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 23:56, 28 April 2012 (UTC)

== TDang review April 2012 ==

I'm reviewing [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/w/index.php?title=Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Monopoly&amp;diff=2314360&amp;oldid=2314355 this version]. I'll likely be more critical than complimentary, because (a) that's the way I am and (b) that's what will help improve things. Please don't take the criticism-over-compliments to mean I have a wholly negative view.

Make sure to check the [[Talk:Strategy_for_Information_Markets#review_thoughts_April_2012|all-purpose review thoughts]] as well.

* ''&quot;a business has the market power to set any price it wants for a certain product&quot;''--This is an overly strong statement. A monopolist is not a price-taker, but it doesn't have the ability to set &quot;any price it wants&quot;, at least not if it wants to sell anything.
* ''Natural monopoly''--The formalities and graph are very good, and should definitely stay, but a little more story to go with them would be good. Just ''a little'', and as long as this is a book on information economics, making the story about some kind of information good would make sense.
* ''Government monopolies''--There are other kinds of monopolies which are ''government granted'' monopolies, where the government gives a person or organization monopoly rights, but the government itself does not hold the monopoly. For the purposes of this book, these government-granted monopolies are probably more important than the other kind of government monopoly. For instance, intellectual property (including ''both patents and copyrights'') is a government-granted monopoly (for our purposes, we should ignore trademarks, though).
* ''Knowledge advantage''--This section doesn't talk about what it's header says it will talk about!
* ''Mergers and acquisitions''--This is probably tangential to the focus of this textbook. Unless it can be made more directly applicable, it's a distraction which should be cut out.
* ''Monopoly pricing''--This section should be much more developed. In fact, it probably should be the main part of the page.
** ''MR = MC''--Remember that this is true of monopolists, but also of firms in competitive markets, so that doesn't help unless it's elaborated on. What's different than in a competitive market?
** Graphics would help tremendously for all this.
** Definitely this should include the calculus and formal analysis of a monopolist maximizing profit.
** What about elasticity conditions for maximizing monopoly profit?
** While it's interesting to think about various marginal-cost shapes in general, for the focus of this text, it might be worthwhile to stick to constant marginal cost.
* ''Price discrimination''--This is interesting, but doesn't quite fit into this page, since this page is &quot;background&quot;. I've moved [[Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Price_Discrimination|price discrimination to its own page]] where it needs cleanup.
* ''Penetration pricing'' and ''Pricing both sides of two-sided platform''--I ''have not'' moved these, but ideally they should be moved, I'm just not positive where to. Possibly the best thing to do is develop them further here and move them later. If so, they need to be developed with a great deal more detail. We have not covered the detail for pricing both sides of a two-sided platform (but if you'd like to do the research to fill it in, that's great). We have covered the detail for penetration pricing.
** ''&quot;after time passes and demand increases&quot;'' remember there's a difference between demand increasing and quantity demanded increasing, and that holds here as well. This should be phrased in terms of what equilibrium the market is going to not &quot;demand increases&quot;.
** ''&quot;the optimal level''&quot;--What does &quot;optimal&quot; mean?
** ''&quot;When a company does this, their competitors may fail because they cannot keep up the with low prices they are charging.&quot;''--No, that's [[w:predatory pricing|predatory pricing]]
** ''&quot;use the product and hopefully market it''&quot;--why is the company hoping the customers will market the product? I think this is mis-phrased.
** ''&quot;sure that the product or service is elastic enough''&quot;--elasticity isn't the best way to think about this.
** The second paragraph (disadvatnages) of the penetration pricing section seems like speculation. All of that could be argued with unless it's referenced or more carefully analyzed.
** The fourth and fifth paragraphs (on discount stores and hook-bait) don't really match what we mean when we talk about penetration pricing. They probably should come out.
** The section on pricing for two-sided platforms is understandably sparse, since we haven't covered that much and it's not in your book. However, it's a little bit wrong right now. I'm not sure how to recommend making it right, except doing more research on it. Otherwise, it can be pulled out and wait for someone else (possibly me) to fill it in later.

* ''References''--Most of the three references currently in the article aren't good enough. &quot;fundamentalfinance.com&quot; and &quot;digitaleconomist.org&quot; both appear to be blogs (albeit sophisticated ones). About.com is not an adequate source, it should be treated like a blog or Wikipedia. The reference to ATT is worthwhile for it's limited use.[[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/TDang|contribs]]) 03:43, 29 April 2012 (UTC)</text>

== Proposal for making interwiki links a different color ==

I am restating this proposal here in a clearer way at the suggestion of [[User:Panic2k4]].

The proposal is to make links on Wikibooks to other Wikimedia projects (notably Wikipedia) a (slightly) different color then internal links, in much the same way as links you have already followed look different then links to pages you haven't visited. My original proposal was this:

{{hidden|header=Original proposal (click to show)|headerstyle=background:#ccccff|content= {{quote|
I have noticed that quite a lot of [[w:Wikibooks|Wikibooks]] use links to [[Wikipedia]] regularly. At the same time however, they link to other [[m:Wikibooks|Wikibooks]] and other chapters of the same book. It is, of course, impossible to tell wether the link is internal, to another book, or to [[commons:category:Wikipedia|Wikipedia]] without clicking on it or hovering over it. This can be extremely bothersome to a reader, who may want to read a Wikibook or chapter on the subject, but not a Wikipedia article. The reader can not tell until he or she has clicked on it where it is going. An example from [[C++ Programming]]:

{{quote|[[w:Bjarne Stroustrup|Bjarne Stroustrup]], a Computer Scientist from [[w:Bell Labs|Bell Labs]], was the designer and original implementer of '''C++''' (originally named &quot;C with Classes&quot;) during the 1980s as an enhancement to the [[Subject:C programming language|C programming language]]. Enhancements started with the addition [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/Paradigms#Object-oriented_programming|object-oriented]] concepts like [[C++ Programming/Classes|classes]], followed by, among many features, [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/Paradigms/Polymorphism|virtual functions]], [[C++ Programming/Operators/Operator Overloading|operator overloading]], [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/Paradigms/Inheritance|multiple inheritance]], [[C++ Programming/Templates|templates]], and [[C++ Programming/Exception Handling|exception handling]]. These and other features are covered in detail along this book.}}

The first two links link to Wikipedia pages, the second links to a Wikibooks subject page, and the rest link to other chapters of the same book. Wikipedia links are useful, of course, because they can link to related pages that the Wikibook does not deal with. For example, a Wikibook about the French language may say that French is also spoken in Monaco, but a reader might like to know where Monaco is and the book does not want to waste time explaining it, as it is not directly relevant. A link to Wikipedia becomes very useful in cases like this. But Wikibooks should try not to rely on Wikipedia too much, and so a link to it should appear different than one to a chapter within the Wikibook or another Wikibook. After all, books should be encased within themselves and not need to rely on the explanation of an encyclopedia or another book. Can you imagine how annoying it would be to have a math text book that makes you go look up what a quadratic function is? 

So my proposal here is to use the project-wide CSS page to make ''all links to other projects look different'' than inter-chapter and inter-book links. This could be done with a slightly different color or font, or something similar to (but different than) the way external links appear (with the arrow thing like this - [http://www.wikibooks.org external link]). 

This would really facilitate the reading experience, and make this project less dependent on Wikipedia. After all, Wikibooks [[WB:NOTWP|is not an encylopedia]], and so does not have to conform to the formatting standards of Wikipedia. [[User:Liam987|'''&lt;span style=&quot;color:#808000;border:1px solid;background:#0055A4;text-shadow:0 5px 8px #850000&quot;&gt;Liam987]]&lt;/span&gt;''' 14:31, 29 March 2012 (UTC)
}}}}

My reasons for proposing this are explained in there. The exact color of the links would have to be decided based on readability and the effect on color blind people. I would suggest #336600 &lt;span style=&quot;background:#336600&quot;&gt;{{spaces|5}}&lt;/span&gt; ([[w:|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#336600;&quot;&gt;link&lt;/span&gt;]]) or #808000 &lt;span style=&quot;background:#808000&quot;&gt;{{spaces|5}}&lt;/span&gt; ([[w:|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#808000;&quot;&gt;link&lt;/span&gt;]]). Another shade of blue may be better, though. [[User:Liam987|'''&lt;span style=&quot;color:#808000;border:1px solid;background:#0055A4;text-shadow:0 5px 8px #850000&quot;&gt;Liam987]]&lt;/span&gt;''' 07:24, 3 April 2012 (UTC)
:My comment is that wikipedia does not typically use plain links for any site outside of the project itself. They make it known that you are leaving their site by using things like &quot;Related media on Wikimedia Commons.&quot; and so on. Wikisource has adopted the same practice, in that most links ''only'' link internally to wikisource. Maybe it might be better to leave all interwiki links in a &quot;Further reading&quot; section or something? - [[User:Theornamentalist|Theornamentalist]] ([[User talk:Theornamentalist|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Theornamentalist|contribs]]) 10:18, 3 April 2012 (UTC)

::Wikipedia is an encyclopedia it would defeat its purpose to rely on other sources to explain the subject matter on Wikisource the issue is probably resumed by most content not being wiki formated on the source material and intended to be static (not open to improvements).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 12:24, 3 April 2012 (UTC)

::Wikibooks also has and uses templates that let the reader know they are leaving the website ({{tl|wikipedia}} for example). I think Wikibooks best practice is already considered to only list external links in a further reading page or to make use of templates that distinctly separate an external link from the content, just as Wikipedia either uses templates or places external links in either a see also, references or external links section.
:: I think inline templates can just as easily be made and used in books where the contributors want to make a distinction in some other way like with color differences or adding an icon after the link. Other options include the use of the per-book stylesheet to effect just one book, make a Gadget so the choice is up to people, or make use of the personal stylesheet at [[Special:MyPage/common.css]]. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 13:13, 3 April 2012 (UTC)

:I do not support nor object the proposal (because I do not see it as necessary my browser does all the differentiation I require). I only ask that the changes take in account the themes colors and mobility of content and do not become too prominent.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 12:24, 3 April 2012 (UTC)
::I too am not too concerned about whichever route this takes, and wouldnt stand in the way of those who wish to have it stylized this way. However, I think the colors might be confusing; sister sites plus internal would mean 9 Wikimedia links, and thus, 9 different colors. Wikipedia would be the most often linked, but I could easily imagine someone linking to wiktionary, wikisource and commons almost as easily, just less frequent. 
::The purpose (I believe) is to let users simply know when they are leaving, but a green or grey link on a wikibook may not convey that until learned or explained somewhere prior. Using an icon after the word works well in that it keeps the color scheme the same and can let someone know where they are going because of it, but it also assumes that they know our icons.
::Either way, the worst thing that happens is they have to hit back in their browser. Personally, I prefer the template boxes for any linking. - [[User:Theornamentalist|Theornamentalist]] ([[User talk:Theornamentalist|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Theornamentalist|contribs]]) 16:16, 3 April 2012 (UTC)

:::Of course there wouldn't be a different link style for each Wikimedia project, just one style that means &quot;interwiki link&quot;. (I think gray is a good color for that.) Also, those templates are not inline. The irritation of a different color of link really is not that annoying. And, when you are reading a book, you really don't want to go to a page with out knowing wether it is a chapter on the topic or an article on Wikipedia.

== Wikipedia links ==

I have noticed that quite a lot of [[w:Wikibooks|Wikibooks]] use links to [[Wikipedia]] regularly. At the same time however, they link to other [[m:Wikibooks|Wikibooks]] and other chapters of the same book. It is, of course, impossible to tell wether the link is internal, to another book, or to [[commons:category:Wikipedia|Wikipedia]] without clicking on it or hovering over it. This can be extremely bothersome to a reader, who may want to read a Wikibook or chapter on the subject, but not a Wikipedia article. The reader can not tell until he or she has clicked on it where it is going. An example from [[C++ Programming]]:

{{quote|[[w:Bjarne Stroustrup|Bjarne Stroustrup]], a Computer Scientist from [[w:Bell Labs|Bell Labs]], was the designer and original implementer of '''C++''' (originally named &quot;C with Classes&quot;) during the 1980s as an enhancement to the [[Subject:C programming language|C programming language]]. Enhancements started with the addition [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/Paradigms#Object-oriented_programming|object-oriented]] concepts like [[C++ Programming/Classes|classes]], followed by, among many features, [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/Paradigms/Polymorphism|virtual functions]], [[C++ Programming/Operators/Operator Overloading|operator overloading]], [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/Paradigms/Inheritance|multiple inheritance]], [[C++ Programming/Templates|templates]], and [[C++ Programming/Exception Handling|exception handling]]. These and other features are covered in detail along this book.}}

The first two links link to Wikipedia pages, the second links to a Wikibooks subject page, and the rest link to other chapters of the same book. Wikipedia links are useful, of course, because they can link to related pages that the Wikibook does not deal with. For example, a Wikibook about the French language may say that French is also spoken in Monaco, but a reader might like to know where Monaco is and the book does not want to waste time explaining it, as it is not directly relevant. A link to Wikipedia becomes very useful in cases like this. But Wikibooks should try not to rely on Wikipedia too much, and so a link to it should appear different than one to a chapter within the Wikibook or another Wikibook. After all, books should be encased within themselves and not need to rely on the explanation of an encyclopedia or another book. Can you imagine how annoying it would be to have a math text book that makes you go look up what a quadratic function is? 

So my proposal here is to use the project-wide CSS page to make ''all links to other projects look different'' than inter-chapter and inter-book links. This could be done with a slightly different color or font, or something similar to (but different than) the way external links appear (with the arrow thing like this - [http://www.wikibooks.org external link]). 

This would really facilitate the reading experience, and make this project less dependent on Wikipedia. After all, Wikibooks [[WB:NOTWP|is not an encylopedia]], and so does not have to conform to the formatting standards of Wikipedia.

::Possibly, then, a variant of the external link arrow ([http://en.wikibooks.org like this]) that appears next to the external link. Is that possible?

::: I don't think this will help reduce at all the visual clutter, most pages here are edited by a single editor and those rarely have that issue but in project with a few editors or in works that use tranwiki culling down the replication is extremely hard another issue is that works can become extremely extensive and when fragmenting the page in smaller sections what was a duplication becomes a useful link again, this and the high volatility of any wiki content makes delimiting visual clutter from useful metadata an extremely hard task...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 09:38, 30 March 2012 (UTC)

:: As well as the browser status bar (or similar) the links already are formatted in a subtly different shade of blue (on Vector, no custom CSS) - the link to [[w:Bell Labs|Bell Labs]] is colour 3366bb, while the link to [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/Paradigms/Inheritance|multiple inheritance]] is 0645ad.  This is done using CSS, and Vector is the default skin, isn't it?

:::Another alternative would be relax the auto-promotion of reviewers and attribute it to the Autoreviewed user and start requiring a formal request for reviewers (more or less what QU proposes without the simple administrative nod), in that case reviewers after 1 year in the project should be auto-tapped (well admins will have to do it) for the flag of admin (a good alternative location to process the removal of the review flag if the user is inactive). This is something that was lost since people stopped doing the old vandalizing patrol, bulk RfDs (or similar tasks) to get acknowledgment from the active community for a nomination.

:::: Do you perceive that it's too ''easy'' to get the Reviewer bit?  I don't.  Nor do I think the current autopromotion criteria particularly far off, in either direction; I doubt any appropriate adjustment would be large enough to be worth the trouble of effecting it.  I do think we get too many requests for manual granting of Reviewer as it is, and my instinct is, no good would come of routinely substituting individual admin judgement for autopromotion.

:::: As I remarked earlier, I see no point in granting Autoreviewed to someone we wouldn't grant Reviewer to (automatically or otherwise), and therefore no point in having Autoreviewed as a separate group.  I'd add, I see no benefit in removing Reviewer for inactivity (though I also suspect it wouldn't be at all easy to make that happen automatically).

::::: My understanding is that auto-reviewed user only gets the pages the he works on reviewed (I expect at the lowest degree, that doesn't seem to have been made clear above). Auto-reviewers (I believe) will not be able to do rollback. So they seem distinct enough, trusting someone to have his edits reviewed automatically is not the same as letting him review the edits of others (less chance of making mistakes or having an impact on the project, especially with the sneaky vandalism that I see increasing, as I have already pointed out). Isn't there also a benefit in having bots use the flag in place of the reviewer (with rights that they should not use) ?
::::: I perceive that the requirements for reviewer are OK, if it was up to me I would only increase the «10 or more unique pages are edited ''at least'' once» to at least the double. With auto-reviewed users the requests for reviewer will surely decrease (by history of the requests made). The requests for reviewer are also affected by &quot;us&quot; being permissive in providing shortcuts to the agreed requirements.
::::: I was thinking because of a recent edit by Adrignola on one page of the &quot;validated&quot; groups that is a duplication (and is not used), do we have a groups specifically for users that have the emails verified ?

::::A couple of points here - the idea of simplicity seems sensible - i.e. not having an extra set of rights just for the sake of it.  As proposed above, with a similar but slightly smaller set of requirements to Reviewer, this doesn't seem all that useful - OK, I'd probably have autoreview by now, which would be nice as a lot of my edits are awaiting review, but as we present the latest version by default that's not so bad.  A question though - that number of unique pages criterion (I presume &quot;pages&quot; in this context refers to subpages e.g. an edit to each of [[LaTeX/Mathematics]] and [[LaTeX/Advanced Mathematics]] would count as 2 pages) may be onerous for someone working on a small book, who could potentially have a lot to contribute - would the aim of this proposal be to make it easier for them? I'm not sure of the background behind this criterion - it seems to discriminate against someone who works hard with attention to the details of a small group of pages, a useful contribution.

Will the auto-reviewed group automatically reviewed edits have a minimal quality review ? Since it was automatically added to bots will it signify that bots will now upon editing a page that was previously non-reviewed get the reviewed status by the bot actions ? If so why have the bots been granted the flag without any discussion or at least without some more time to ponder the implications, who made the decision for the community ?   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 06:28, 21 March 2012 (UTC)
: Afaik:  The software can be configured to select which usergroups will have the autosight property.  The autosight property is presumably the only property associated with the autoreview group, and is one of the properties associated with the bot and pseudo-bot groups.  Autosight means that '''if''' the current revision of the page is sighted, the new revision will be too.  The new revision will '''not''' be sighted if the preexisting revision wasn't itself already sighted.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 14:31, 21 March 2012 (UTC)

:::I think this proposal makes a lot of sense. Just an idea, but what if this was implemented for ''just specific books''? What I mean is, what if a user could be granted autoreviewed rights for individual books, but not Wikibooks as a whole. For example, a user who had been shown to have a clear knowledge of C programming and who had made good edits to the [[C Programming]] book could have their edits to ''just that book'' autoreviewed, but not there edits to other books. This may be overly complicated, and I don't know how that would be implemented, but I think it would be good. A lot of people come to Wikibooks ''just to right one book'', and this would make it much easier for them, while not endangering the whole project with vandalism.

::::This seems like it would be a good idea if feasible, however I would hope that an editor who could be trusted with autoreview on one book would not vandalise another (especially as wikibooks has less politically sensitive content than some other projects) - misguided edits going against the aims of a book (e.g. adding lots of very basic material to an advanced text or vice versa) may still be an issue.

::::::I'm afraid it doesn't work on a per book basis. The admins in general aren't wary of granting the right - we can always take it away again - as it is always obvious if someone is a vandal or not. We're also allowed to grant it on request. The issue is rather that some members of the community feel that editors should wait for the autopromote and so we respect their opinion and refrain frome exercising our &quot;right&quot; to grant the flag except for cases where it really isn't possible for the editor to be auto-promoted. I say &quot;we&quot; but each admin has a different view on this and some will grant before the auto-promote more often &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 13:29, 23 March 2012 (UTC)

So just to &lt;s&gt;resume&lt;/s&gt; summarize and restate what we have discussed and help reformulate the proposal.&lt;br&gt;
This discussion of the proposal seems to:&lt;br&gt;
a) Auto-reviewed user right have a useful function and their implementation, the primary subject of the discussion, seems to have no lingering opposition.&lt;br&gt;
b) There is a strong support of moving auto-reviewer flag to a relaxed auto-promotion system as a way to solve the major reason some Wikibookians request prematurely the reviewer right, since there has not ever been a request focusing in the rest of the functions available to reviewers.&lt;br&gt;
c) The relaxation of requirements and attribution of auto-reviewer permits an alteration of the requirements for the auto-promotion for reviewer that can reflects more the multiple project activity and permanency on the project (for instance an auto-reviewer may not have a registered email). My conclusion  from the discussion.&lt;br&gt;
Some questions must still be examined. Will auto-reviewer be able to change the review status of edits (like the reviewer can select that the edit be made as reviewed can an auto-reviewer change force it to un-reviewed ? (it seems contradictory but forcing edits to keep the previous status may be seen as forcing a level of quality on the Wikibookian, of course this can be counterbalanced by reseting of the flag in errors are detected, but in that case can the reset be made as to put the Wikibookians again in the auto-reviewer group ?&lt;br&gt;
What alterations or requirements should be set to auto-reviewers and reviewers auto-promotions ?
Unrelated to the proposal but a question based on what was previously said. Since bots got the auto-reviewer flag does the CommonsDelinker bot have it on (it seems not)?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 01:23, 5 April 2012 (UTC)

: Huh?  You appear to me to be describing a consensus that does not exist.  We don't seem to have actually resolved anything; various ideas have been tossed about.

: a) Nothing said here has made me think autoreviewer useful.  I haven't been repeating myself ''much'', though looking back I see I did a little.  I made it clear my assessment hadn't changed; I thought it would be understood thereafter that it would continue to not have changed unless I said it ''had'' changed.

: b) I did observe that some newcomers misperceive that they are somehow inconvenienced by not getting the bit earlier.  If we could, say, cause them to not see the 'pending' status until they get the reviewer right, that would probably help.  But I don't consider their misperceptions a justification for a watered-down autoreviewer right.

::Again I'm not claiming consensus only my read of the discussion so far as a &lt;s&gt;resume&lt;/s&gt; summarize. You are free to object to it (that was the purpose) but please clarify your objection if not already addressed as I thought they were. Did you read about the bots, does it not seem a good thing to have that possibility? Are you really backing the view that the group should be removed ?&lt;br&gt;
::Since there is still not auto-reviewer right and an auto-promotion to water down, are you talking the reviewer right? I have indeed proposed and been supported to relaxing some of the aspects of the reviewer (and opened the possibly of increase other requirements), since that group would become more specialized in its quality control and rollback capabilities (auto-reviewer would, depending on the answers to the questions I make, reduce the repetitive task of validating the  edits of safer contributors).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 05:21, 5 April 2012 (UTC)

::: Well, no, you ''did'' claim consensus: &quot;no lingering objections&quot;, &quot;strong support&quot;.  Not worth a big meta-argument, but, just pointing this out.

::: Bots have nothing to do with this.  You seem to have misunderstood something about bots, but I'm not sure what.

::: If reviewer became more specialized, it ought if anything to have ''stricter'' requirements; but I stated at the outset why I didn't see a useful purpose in having an autoreviewer right separate from reviewer, and I've seen nothing said that invalidates that reasoning.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 06:29, 5 April 2012 (UTC)

:::: I attempt to be clear and am very sorry if you misunderstood me. To me a call for consensus only made sense if the issue was fully publicized since it constitutes a high impact decisions. For instance it may impact bot actions and operators should be aware of the decision, and why I was surprised when I found you still objection of keeping the new user group (not the initial proposal by QU), since to me the new flag is indisputable useful in that function.
:::: One thing that may have indeed escaped me, and that I now realize is a possibility, is that the user group and flag may not be interlinked (this depends on how Wikimedia implements things and I confess to not have any experience or knowledge about that subject) since the flag and function may still be attributed without a specific access group. Now that I think about it and looking to the existing usergroups makes perfect sense, but then the discussion was going in reverse. Is this deduction correct ? Can bots still get the flag even if the access group is removed ?
:::: The initial proposal by QU was about the use of the new user group and its attribution process, then Adrignola raised the option to remove the new user group (to me in reverse, since there was no consensus for the adoption, the correct approach would have been to gather consensus for keeping it). This would also reinforce your position of objection.
:::: Disregarding any confusion on my part since it only decreases some of the importance I was giving to the group existence, there seems to be support for keeping the new groups and restructure the auto-promotions around it so as to have those actively contributing to stop getting the pages set to un-reviewed (and having the community validating simple edits by these active editors, that by continuing on that pat will get auto-promoted to reviewer) as several Wikibookians stated that to be somewhat demoralizing (even for those reviewing, for instance I'm incapable of quickly examining alterations to source code or formulas if the edit is not in a continued block, meaning I rarely do it). As for what changes to the reviewer I have expressed myself badly as I state on my post from (23:14, 24 February) I intended to state that auto-reviewers should be auto-promoted with a relaxed auto-promoting setting equal to the existing reviewer.     
:::: Since you are still objecting to the new user group existence then it becomes a moot point unless you see the above expressed remarks and take the historical points raised by those attempting to bypass the automation in consideration and change your position. I see some benefits and support the move. I point to you that you may lack the right perspective unless you did not have the flag and intended to do a large number of edits.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 03:44, 6 April 2012 (UTC)
:::: I also took the chance to look into the page review logs and you seem not to me amongst the most active reviewers (at least on the last 5k reviews) that also may explain some lack of understanding and probably one of the factors that prompted QU request for community approval for the attribution (since he does a lot of reviews).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 10:19, 6 April 2012 (UTC)
&lt;!--- add above this line--&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
|}

&lt;s&gt;
As to resume the discussion, now extremely long of the primary proposal that has suffered several changes, themselves independent proposals that retroactively would affect the principal.&lt;br&gt;
In accordance to what was previous discussed (read above), the first item that needs consensus is if the new &quot;Autoreviewed users&quot; access group (see [[Special:ListGroupRights]] for the permissions ), should be adopted on Wikibooks (answering the issue raised by Adrignola above). Because this would alter the rest of the proposals and so this item is given primacy.&lt;br&gt;
Maintaining &quot;Autoreviewed users&quot; access group would permit a distinct access group whose edits will not change the review status of a page and no access to the rollback function of the reviewer groups.&lt;br&gt;
As to address the issues discussed and close or continue addressing the dependent proposals, the community is therefore called to express opposition to keeping the &quot;Autoreviewed users&quot; access group. This discussion will last for &lt;u&gt;7 days after the last post on this thread&lt;/u&gt;. '''No opposition (or their restatement) will mean keeping the &quot;Autoreviewed users&quot; access group'''. The group will then have the community's support and we will proceed in giving it a function (as previously discussed) and the necessary requirements for attribution (the primary primary proposal by QuiteUnusual).&lt;br&gt;
Please attempt to focus only on the specific topic and/or the viability of alternative approaches that would resolve most of the problems the community feels that having pages showing a pending reviewed status seems to cause. It would not only be welcomed but necessary to understand the real possibility of such solutions and how they may impact the use of the group.&lt;br&gt;
Any issues not related with the discussion of this item, I (and I believe others) will gladly address on our own talk pages (but please read the previous posts above first).&lt;/s&gt;  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 04:40, 18 April 2012 (UTC)

&lt;s&gt;
Since no opposition was expressed we shall consider the existing [[Special:ListGroupRights]] validated by the community, a concern raised by Adrignola (the creation of the user group in itself is not specifically a high-impact decision but the next points regarding function and attribution will need to be properly announced).&lt;br&gt;
We will now  move on to the next point on the table regarding what use shall be given to the new usergroups. As advanced in the previous discussion some voiced opinions in defense of giving use to the &quot;Autoreviewed users&quot; usergroups as a stepping stone to reviewers and to better characterize the community confidence in those that do contribute content but do not wish to be auto-confirmed. That is we recognize a confidence that the content contributed is safe and within our project definitions and changes made by those users do not require a third person verification.&lt;br&gt;
This of course permits to auto-promote to  &quot;Autoreviewed users&quot; probably using a relaxed criteria based on what is now used for [[Wikibooks:Reviewers]] but this is not in discussion for now as there may be other proposal regarding the group function to be expressed.&lt;br&gt;
This discussion will last for &lt;u&gt;7 days after the last post on this thread&lt;/u&gt;. '''No opposition (or their restatement) will mean using the &quot;Autoreviewed users&quot; access group as an intermediary access group in relation to the Reviewers''' (as proposed by myself). This is a discussion regarding appropriate function not the criteria granting &quot;Autoreviewed users&quot;, if you have a better/different function for the usergroup put it forward.&lt;/s&gt;  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 01:22, 30 April 2012 (UTC)

: Panic, historically I have worked '''very''' hard at being polite in discussions, but, operating in that mode, it seems some messages here haven't been getting through to you.

: Your strategy here seems to be to flood the thread with words until everyone is sick of the thread and boycotts it, and then claim that what you want has &quot;consensus&quot;.  Seems like you may even have ''twice'' presented a biased &quot;summary&quot; of what had come before and then claimed consensus (I haven't got the stomach to go back to check exactly how it went down before).  This is &amp;mdash;sorry&amp;mdash; bullshit.  I see no consensus here, except perhaps consensus that this thread is no longer useful, that consensus being expressed by people staying away from the thread.  I hadn't even noticed the &quot;unless there is opposition within seven days&quot; clause you'd unilaterally imposed, until just now.  (Wait, didn't I say something earlier about assuming my position was unchanged until-and-unless I retracted it?  Wouldn't that mean that the opposition you wanted within seven days ''already existed at the start of the seven days''?  I'm not even going to go wading back through this to find out exactly what who said when.  You can likely produce these claims far, far more easily than anyone could possibly work out exactly which of your words are specifically false.

::I agree that I shouldn't have been the one calling the consensus on the previous stage but, things need to be resolved toward a conclusion (initiated in 24 February). I'm not imposing that we should consider it closed but I feel we couldn't have excluded what was previously discussed (biased or not) and discard it to initiate a new process for the several proposals that have been made.
::I will apply delegate in you the run of the proceeding as to respond to all concerns that have been expressed. I expressly requested a restatement because I would not want to assume again your position. The 7 days stated count after the post that indicates a proposal and a discussion limit (not that I'm enforcing the closing, because I was the initiator and I agree that ethically I shouldn't have called its closing, but more that the stipulated time had gone by and no one acted.

I still do not understand your position fully, and several questions have not gotten an answer, not only mine, but even when you asked for other groups that should be removed, and other issues, ultimately proposals tend to derail into issues not directly involved with the initial proposal, this one is no exception.

There are books written mainly by 1 or several authors. These authors normally create an 'authors' page for their book and put their names there. But how can it be sure that this page is protected? In other words, how can these main authors keep their names credited?

I suggest we should have another namespace, call it 'Author' or something like that, together with namespace 'Main' and 'Talk'. Pages of this namespace should be protected, only administrators or ones with enough privilege can edit. Once having enough evidence, the administrator can list the main authors of that book on the page. &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/123.21.198.153|123.21.198.153]] ([[User talk:123.21.198.153|discuss]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt;

:You'd be best advised to suggest this at [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Proposals]], so that others can voice their opinions on it.  That said, any page in any namespace can be protected such that only administrators can edit it, including authors pages within books in the main namespace.

::Hi Adrignola, I understand what you mean. Normally, the authors make a subpage named 'Authors' to their book and put its link in the first page (for example, in the Table of Contents). Of course the first page of that book is not protected, so anyone can ''delete'' that link (delete a link, not a page), make a new subpage and link to that! A new namespace next to the Talk namespace of the book can achieve 2 goals: its 'link' to the book can not be deleted, and its content can not be changed, until the administrators think there's enough evidence to do so. &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/123.21.39.228|123.21.39.228]] ([[User talk:123.21.39.228|discuss]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt;

::: Two thoughts, for what they're worth.
:::* Once a name is (legitimately) on an authors subpage, the same counter-vandalism techniques that suffice elsewhere should suffice there.
:::* There is a complete and indelible record of contributors to a book in its pages' revision histories.  Authors subpages are generally less complete, as not all contributors sign the authors page &amp;mdash; even if they contribute significantly; I generally don't, for example, because authors subpages seem to have a mild flavor of ownership about them.

:::: If I had a penny for each time that argument &quot;There is a complete and indelible record of contributors to a book in its pages' revision histories&quot; is thrown around as quick way to address the issue of authorship I would be a very rich man. Edit histories are useful but not by any means a complete, comprehensible and indelible record. I have discussed this endlessly and you as an administrator know that it is a failed argument, it could be hard to make contributions indelible but by intention or by a unforeseeable sequence of mishaps it can happen.
:::: There is a intrinsic usefulness to know those that have rights over the works, the rational is the same for instance on why patents can only be signed by their inventors. There is much to hate around the issue of copyright and intellectual property in general but it is a disservice to all and even a possible reason why the project does not attract more authors the way the issue is constantly dismissed and not properly addressed by Wikimedia. Ultimately only the copyright holders can enforce the licenses and relicense the works, signing one's own work is a mater of responsibility and pride for the work done, that becomes even of primal importance in this intangible medium we use for our creations.

:::: Hi Pi zero, ones editing the book are not necessarily its author, so the revision history has no help. For example, I obtain permission to publish a book from its author, my work is simply copying and reformatting the book so that it appears well on Wikibooks. I am not its author. If I make an author subpage, there's no guarantee that the name of the original author remains unchanged. And if I make a link to that page, there's no guarantee that it will not be deleted and replaced by someone. &lt;span style=&quot;font-size: smaller;&quot; class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[Special:Contributions/123.21.213.250|123.21.213.250]] ([[User talk:123.21.213.250|discuss]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;!-- Template:UnsignedIP --&gt;

As noted on every edit, people must agree that a hyperlink or URL is sufficient attribution. I think attributions in the form of a hyperlink or URL in the bibliography or further reading section of a book should be all that is done. I think all Author pages should then be deleted. I think books must be deleted if the authors of a prior work in which the book is based does not agree that a hyperlink or URL is sufficient attribution. An even stricter interpretation is possible where authors of prior works must agree that a hyperlink or URL back to the book on Wikibooks is sufficient attribution. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:22, 31 March 2012 (UTC)

::''Chiming in like I've been here for awhile''.. Interesting topic, but I think the largest problem with this is that a wikibook can never in theory be completed. This is a stark difference with books here versus a published work appearing at Wikisource, where there is clear attribution. Another problem is determining how much contribution to a book constitutes authorship.

:::Not to mention that the copyright of contributions and over the global work also varies from the origin of the contributor, there are significant differences between jurisdictions. On the project the location of the servers guides the legal requirements for compliance but works are not created only to reside on the server. Books that are usable (even if I fully agree with you that the objective is ultimately toward never-ending perfectionism and mutation), if properly published that version/revision can be moved to Wikisource.
:::As for the how much contribution constitutes authorship is also another interesting subject, I have had several discussions about it in the past, but since there are those that still defend views like Darklama, that I blame Wikimedia because it fails to properly address the subject. I do not think at this time one could properly address it by ourselves. I wonder how does Commons deal with the copyright attribution of derivative works, in particular of works they also hold the &quot;original&quot;...
:::More than  legal matters, these issues are about expectations, the expectations of those contributing to the project.
:::I had a very hard time making clear the distinction between ownership and control, and I fully understand that there is a minority that would like to make all content public domain. But they fail to comprehend that in that way no one can defend the freedom of the content, that is also part of the interests of the authors/copyright holders next to the right of acknowledgment. These people often are not creators themselves or have not a long term view regarding the works, only seeing the works as existing on this project right now.

:: Copyright and license for books is defended by complaining to [[m:OTRS|OTRS]]. I think any work or license is incompatible with Wikibooks if attributions beyond a hyperlink or URL is necessary for text contributions. In the more stricter interpretation any work or license is incompatible with Wikibooks if attribution beyond a hyperlink or URL to the book on Wikibooks for text contributions is necessary. People would probably have to deal with the jurisdiction issues if they tried to defend the copyright and license for books on their own. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 14:59, 31 March 2012 (UTC)

::: The OTRS serves to protect Wikimedia ([[meta:OTRS/info-en mission]]) not the works and in regards to copyright not even the users (a copyright infringer can be legally persecuted by actions on the Wikimedia projects, Wikimedia has no responsibility and will even be able to provide logs of the activity). In the requirements of attribution, and this is something we already discussed, the works license requires express agreement to it (some defend that a simple click-trough suffices) some like myself doubt this view, especially when using third party content and because of the volatility of not only the identity of users, but of the records themselves. Only copyright holders can relicense their content (USA with exception to Public Domain works). Copyright relinquishing has to be done by writing or terminus of copyright protection (USA).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 15:49, 31 March 2012 (UTC)

This comment is a little unrelated to the last part of this discussion regarding copyright laws, but I'm going to write it anyway:
I think Wikibooks should be clearly attributed to their author(s) on Wikibooks. You can expect people to fix a typo or right something to an encyclopedia without wanting attribution, but a book, even a Wikibook, is different. Writing a book is ''a lot of work'', and many more writers will be attracted to this project if they are attributed on the main page of the book in an obvious way. The point of Wikibooks it to make available books that are free to use and can be edited by anyone. But why shouldn't the writer be attributed, even if he or she does not own the copyright? For that matter, why shouldn't opinionated or non-neutral books be allowed? Wikibooks seems to me to be operating too much on the standards of Wikipedia, i.e. the standards of an encyclopedia.

As long as the authors are attributed in a clear way on the front page, why not have the book express opinions, as long as the book is marked as a non-neutral book and you know who wrote it? A new namespace could even be created calle either &quot;Essay&quot; or &quot;Opinion&quot; or something similar, and leave the main namespace for text books. The main thing I'm saying here is that for people to want to write full-fledged books that they have no control over and do not profit from, this project will have to make some concessions to them (the writers) and give them credit and freedom in writing, and maybe even limited control over the Wikibook they write.

:The issue with having authors signing their work has two main problems. The one that was raised above by the proponent, the lack of protection for the information and the general lack of guidelines from Wikimedia linked to the unpreparedness of the administration to deal with the subject (verify claims, this is also observable when we deal for instance with claims of copyright violations, almost always we put the burden of prof on the contributor not on the copyright holder this is a fragility that can lead to preemptive deletion of valid content, since in case of doubt the path is deletion.) and having the required tools it would be an astronomical mess going through the history logs to verify that information (I think [[User:Robert Horning]] opened a ticked on that). 
:As you stated Wikibooks and Wikipedia are very distinct (the best match is indeed as I think someone said above Wikisource) in this regard, of legal protection of works and authors. But even on Wikipedia the aggregation is copyrightable. I would go as far a stating that some articles go beyond simple factual information and probably also copyrightable, but that is something that is up for that project to handle. In any case I would expect that someone has to be listed as the owner of the rights over the work if not I do not see how they could actively enforce the project licensing...
:On the issue of attribution every contributor the history logs do indeed satisfy it and are easier to maintain accurate (of course it would be extremely interesting to have a better listing of all edits on all pages of a work centralized) and the fact that the work is not simply a result of the authors should be stressed as recognition from all. This distinction is that authors must by legal requirements be listed in the work in whatever medium it is presented (IIRC the GFDL asks for the top 5 and the CCBYSA for 3) and it would be impractical to list all the names/ips of all editors to a work in that case a simply link to the Wikibook project could serve (and in the author pages I created this is done).
:Regarding the changing of the scope of Wikibooks that is a distinct discussion that could be extended in the talk page of [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks?]] policy (this is valid also for the issue of Essays), but I note that non-neutral books can be created and the non-neutrality (POV) can be some what protected by stating it clearly on the scope of the book what and how it will cover the issue.
:I also take the chance to clarify that authors (even Wikimedia and users) can profit from Wikibooks. Authors have a larger degree of freedom since they can relicense the works, this permits to mix other type of content that is not license compatible, for instance an author may start a project on Wikibooks, at a later date use that content and add to it outside of the project (even licensing other content from other copyright holders, for instance photos) and sell it.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 12:22, 1 April 2012 (UTC)

Removing a hyperlink or URL on the author subpage, which links to the original author, clearly infringes Attribution Condition of Creative Commons license. When there are a lot of books on Wikibooks, no one can be sure that those links will be left intact. So we must protect those pages. The best way to do that is creating a new namespace protected by default accompanying with each book. As I mentioned previously, the anti-vandalism tool is not enough, because one could remove the link to the author page (without changing its content), created a new 'author' subpage and then on the book (s)he linked to his/her version. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:113.172.237.128|113.172.237.128]] ([[User talk:113.172.237.128|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/113.172.237.128|contribs]]) &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

:Not so, the only URL protected is for the copy of the license if not included in the work. Only the name of the author (or pseudonym, if applicable) is required and protected by the license. Note also that there is limitations on the USA law to anonymous authors, that if IIRC have subtle changes from state to state.
:As for the importance of the page and the need for protection of the information I'm in fully agreement with you but think that a namespace is not a realistic solution, maybe pages could be edit protected to the level of auto-reviewer/reviewer (since most people dedicated to a work will get that right sooner or later as they add themselves to the author page they can request the protection) as a side note I think that such author pages as a simple courtesy and recognition for all other collaborators should also link to the book project and point out the history logs.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 12:22, 1 April 2012 (UTC)

::Clear authorship is an undoubtedly a great way to entice editors, but I am unsure if the dynamics of wikibooks allows for ease of this. A few days ago I noticed a featured book, [[Speech-Language Pathology/Stuttering|Stuttering]] became a subpage of a larger scoped wikibook &quot;project&quot;. Was this the intent of the original author(s), to have their book become essentially a chapter in a larger book? I think that creating an environment which promotes ownership of a given work might be damaging to the &quot;wiki&quot; way of cooperation. But that is just my opinion; don't have any evidence.
::Among the various wikis I've worked at, I've found it best to promote ideas like this at an ''as-needed'' basis. Is this something which is an ongoing problem? If so, then I agree that we should address it. If it is only theoretical, that someone ''could'' do this, then I would hold off until we have a reason to. - [[User:Theornamentalist|Theornamentalist]] ([[User talk:Theornamentalist|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Theornamentalist|contribs]]) 12:38, 1 April 2012 (UTC)

:::Having right over one's creation is not by itself ownership in the concept of control, especially since the USA copyright law does not provide for moral rights over works, that is as to prevent the use of a work withing its license for purposes that the copyright holder opposes. In case of a merge if the source is destroyed on Wikibooks the authors page should also be merged, in case that a copy exists elsewhere a simple attribution to the original work suffices (in case of public domain the attribution is not obligatory but should be made). Owning rights over a work does not equate to owning control, especially using the licenses we use on Wikibooks, that are very clear in what rights/freedoms have been licensed. 
:::The issue of the alteration of these pages is common, mostly not outright malicious but by simple lack of understanding of the subject.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 13:16, 1 April 2012 (UTC)

::::I do not think there are any real copyright problems here, but I think the important thing is that Wikibooks needs more authors willing to start and ''finish'' a book. I have seen countless books on WIkibooks that have never got past the starting stages, but still exist. Wikibooks ''really'' needs writers willing to go through the whole process of writing a Wikibook, and I think a good way to try to attract these kinds of people into coming and staying here is by giving them more attribution, regardless of what copyright laws require. As I mentioned before, it would also help users identify who's point of view they are reading. A possible solution is to have a regulated, possibly protected &quot;Authors&quot; page for each book, maybe even each chapter, and to transclude these pages in some way to the top of each page in a small font.

:If we're going to do this then a fully protected author page for the book is the most sensible approach. An author namespace provides no added benefits because the issues raised (e.g., deleting a link and then adding a new author page) apply equally to the namespace. Indeed there is no functional difference between a page in a &quot;protected&quot; namespace and a protected page in another namespace. There is sufficient oversight of vandalism on this project to prevent attempts to &quot;hijack&quot; an author sub-page in the way described not least because the original author page cannot be deleted by the vandal, would still exist within the book's structure and would pre-date the &quot;new&quot; author page. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 13:56, 1 April 2012 (UTC)

::As far as I know there are only 3 protecting methods on Wikibooks: move, edit and upload. Which one will be sufficient to ensure that the link of the author subpage remains on the first page of the book?

:::There's no requirement for the link to the author subpage to be on the first page of the book. If you understand the structure of Wikibooks (not sure if you do as you are editing anonymously so I don't know who you are) but every page in the book sits as a subpage below the main page. That means that the author subpage is there, in the book, even if the link on the main page is removed. The only way you could &quot;remove&quot; it from the book would be to move every other page in the book to a new name leaving it behind. There is no way this kind of page move vandalism would not be spotted. In any case, the redirects left behind would make it clear what had happened. Personally I think the &quot;someone may hijack the work&quot; concerns are a distraction because they are possible but so unlikely that they aren't worth considering. The real issue appears to be is the current level of attribution to the authors discouraging people from contributing and, if it is, what methods can improve this without discouraging other new editors &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 08:06, 2 April 2012 (UTC)
:::: Wikibooks are not closed, in the sense of an author or group author having the right to tell everyone to &quot;back off, it's ''mine/ours!&amp;thinsp;''&quot;.  Any expression of authorship must make clear that others are welcome to contribute; so protecting an authorship page would send exactly the wrong kind of message.

:::: And &amp;mdash;I'm not sure how to make this crystal clear&amp;mdash; there is ''nothing different'' about assuring that author information isn't vandalized, than about assuring that any other information isn't vandalized.  Vandalism is vandalism, and we have means to detect and correct it.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 01:16, 2 April 2012 (UTC)

::::: In the general terms I agree with you, but the question is if the administration or anyone that is not directly involved with the projects can easily determine and detect that type of vandalism (in this case a copyright violation). That after an author leaves a work (lets take it to the extreme and consider that the project will run for a few decades from now) that his copyright is respected (I see this as the main point of the initial proponent). 
::::: Note also that the authors page is not only about authors but serves to legally bind the creator and his work with the license and to comply with third party acknowledgments, some obligatory. I do not recognize as a valid the assumption that volunteers would actively protect the &quot;rights&quot; ownership of others (a situation very similar to how public domain or public interests are generally treated), this becomes even more evidently an issue since historically there are those that actively defend an antagonistic policy view in regards to these aspect, even before I joined the project there was an attempt to remove all authors pages as defended above by Darklama (this was related on a discussion with [[User:Robert Horning]] I don't remember if he was talking to me, Whiteknight or Darklama), as told IIRC the view was championed by someone that held a high place on the Wikimedia structure.
::::: I have myself corrected some of those types of vandalism but in cases of aggravated complexity (large works or works with a large amount of edits) I would not venture to do so and in case of altering third party acknowledgments I wouldn't be able to validate them. This also relates to solution advanced by [[user:QU]] of a full edit protection, author pages should not be so broadly protected because those editing them are not obligatory authors. For instance, one can merge works and need to do the required attribution to the source. I do not see a benefit on having the administration be the gatekeepers but would be satisfied that if restricted to auto-reviewers/reviewers that the more common type of vandalism would be addressed and anyone with auto-reviewers/reviewers would have passed at least a minimum amount of scrutiny, in fact I agree with you that a full edit protection violated common practice of assuming good faith.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 02:35, 2 April 2012 (UTC)

I think if you want to transclude an author page onto books you've contributed to you should just go ahead and do it - there's no need for a policy. However, doing the same for every book here is a big job, would required vetting and verification of the authors (or identification of them if they haven't created an author page alread) and is therefore unlikely to actually get done even if we all think it is a good idea. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 08:11, 2 April 2012 (UTC)

::::::::I think that the only request that would be important to make is that the information is part of the print version (or any method offered to move the work) and linked directly from the cover page.

I happen to agree that there is no benefit to having administrators be gatekeepers because people in general (including administrators) can have a difficult time validating changes. I also agree that volunteers don't actively protect the &quot;rights&quot; of others. I think there is only a limited need to protect the &quot;rights&quot; of third-parties, because anyone who contributes directly has given permission to use their contributions freely by clicking save. Third-parties are likely to be unaware of Wikibooks' practices and how their work might be used, unless someone has informed them, but at the same time any third-party claim is difficult to validate. I oppose obligating anyone, including administrators, to do anything involving authors, until there is a consensus on how to address, validate, and acknowledge third-party claims. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:26, 2 April 2012 (UTC)

:::::::::: This is something that I have attempted to explain to you many times. I will give yet again another go. The click-through is merely for the protection of the project (and only that) and is mostly an informative tool (no one after that may state that they did not have the information) but as a legal binding transaction it is very flimsy. I even dispute any worth on the last bit &quot;You agree that a hyperlink or URL is sufficient attribution under the Creative Commons license.&quot; it is simply nonsensical. Another problem is that the notification has been changed many times without any say of the community nor even a site wise notice regarding the change or its implications and that is extremely sad, even a bit disturbing because it becomes an imposition.
:::::::::: Then there is the issue that if we where to recognize any legal validity it only would bind the submitter of the content and would only be valid while part of the history edit log, but those logs are not part of the work (nor protected in any way by the licenses) beyond the copy on Wikibooks. It is expected and almost undeniable that at least some books will outlast the project and so it is clear that the notice makes no sense beyond what I said, as a protective measure and informative tool. Then there are more complex subjects, like we have also discusses about; Wikibooks being an aggregate of independent works, each work (not contribution) has its own copyright status and license (not a site wide license like the click-through implies).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 19:07, 2 April 2012 (UTC)

So just to &lt;s&gt;resume&lt;/s&gt; summarize and restate what we have discussed and help reformulate the proposal.&lt;br&gt;
This discussion of the proposal seems to:&lt;br&gt;
a) Not contradict or invalidate any of the views as expressed by Darklama (and in the past others), are not an opposition to the proposal but to the existence of the author pages, something that goes beyond what is being discussed, but has been objected above.&lt;br&gt;
b) Since author pages exist and do, whatever view is defended, have a legal validity and serve a function, special consideration regarding their protection may be warranted. No one objected specifically to that.&lt;br&gt;
c) It can be concluded that only those involved in the work (especially those making claims authorship/copyright ownership or using the pages to give the necessary legal or moral attributions to third parties or sources) have the capacity to fully respond or validate those edits. Putting the pages beyond the normal review process for accuracy or in works covering a large number of pages or activity a creating a great burden for anyone determining copyright ownership claims. My conclusion from the previous discussion.&lt;br&gt;
d) That any decision resulting from the alteration of common practice should not be retroactive, generalized or be imposing beyond establishing a new set of guidelines regarding the handling of the type of content under discussion and validating administrative action to protect their content. My conclusion from the previous discussion.&lt;br&gt;
e) That the commonly agreed solution, from all the proposals made on how to handle the issue, would be to protect editing of these pages upon administrative request by anyone with the reviewer flag to only Wikibookians with that same flag.&lt;br&gt;
I further add a request that [[Wikibooks:Ownership]] be updated at the end of the discussion (and its edit history be revised) as to reflect this procedure, since some subjects had and are already been discussed there and that Wikibooks:Ownership page be moved to the Help namespace (since we will not be defining a policy or a guideline) but establishing a common community understanding of the subject matter regarding the function of the these types of pages (copyright information). It should continue to maintain a well written distinction between copyright ownership and editorial/content control and a clarification of author/copyright holder versus contributor. Any objection or alteration to this request does not invalidate the proposal but I feel that it would help Wikibookians to have a clear source of understanding regarding the subject. This of course can be proposed independently if people find that it needs further discussion.&lt;br&gt;
Another request, that also does not impact the proposal if opposed is that any pages regarding copyright should in the future, and retroactively as detected, be put in a specific category, possibly a subcategory of Wikibooks copyright. I believe that there will not be any objection to the categorization but possibly to the name or location. I hope no one gets distracted on this as the label/location in not as important as the functionality to ease the identification of those type of pages.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 00:59, 5 April 2012 (UTC)

: Here again, I do not perceive a consensus where you appear to be claiming such exists.  This discussion has gotten way too long to read, frankly; I look at the very top, where I see &quot;There are books written mainly by 1 or several authors. These authors normally create an 'authors' page for their book and put their names there. But how can it be sure that this page is protected? In other words, how can these main authors keep their names credited?&quot;, and my basic answer is still that there is no reason to protect this page in any manner it isn't already protected by our counter-vandalism measures (specifically flaggedrevs, though there's a simultaneous proposal here that could interfere with the efficacy of flaggedrevs).  If there were a reason to give it extra protection in some cases (unlikely, but ''if''), there would be no reason to create a whole namespace for the purpose.  I do find it somewhat bizarre that there's been a great deal of discussion of copyright here, as I do not consider authors pages at all relevant to copyright.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 04:17, 5 April 2012 (UTC)

::I did not claim a consensus existed only no expressed opposition was visible (except as noted). Because as you said the discussion was lengthy I &lt;s&gt;resumed&lt;/s&gt; summarized in, what seemed to me, the points that have been addressed.
::As for the page protection requirements this has been covered above and arguments put forward demonstrate that simple counter-vandalism measures do not suffice (that is even the core of the proposal as it was initially put forward). Flaggedrevs does not protect content, it protects what is displayed (and arguably provides some quality indication). So it has no special bearing on the issue, unless you are claiming that it provides visibility, but that was also already covered above. Those pages are even harder to review that simple content changes. If you still object to that notion please see if you have read all of what has been said and state why you disagree. Note that in &lt;s&gt;my resume&lt;/s&gt; the summary, as in the previous discussion, I clearly state that the creation of the  namespace is unpractical, no one objected to that observation, just the opposite...
::Regarding the relevancy of the authors pages, they are not only legally relevant (licenses and copyright law) but to the works and contributors (again this is exposed at length above). If you disagree with any please state your objections so they can be addressed (note that what is on the table is extending the protection of these pages, their relevancy or irrelevancy in relation to the proposal is only on this matter).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 04:46, 5 April 2012 (UTC)

::: I agree that the core of the proposal as initially put forward was that simple counter-vandalism meausres do not suffice.  This however is false.  I see no valid arguments above that refute this.  If you believe there is a valid argument that does refute it, I invite you to ''briefly state'' that argument here.  (Your use of ''resume'', btw, is not at all common in modern English usage.  I do understand what you mean by it, but I don't think I've ever encountered that usage before; Wiktionary, I see, calls it &quot;now rare&quot;.)

::: &quot;Flaggedrevs does not protect content, it protects what is displayed&quot;.  That's backwards.  Flaggedrevs protects only content, having no direct effect at all on what is displayed (except on Wikijunior).  Its function is to facilitate content quality control, by keeping track of which revisions have and have not been checked by someone in whose ability the community has sufficient confidence.

::: Authors pages, ''of the sort described at the top of this thread'', are utterly irrelevant to copyright.  Those sorts of authors pages are simply vanity pages for the editors who have put a lot of work into the book; just because somebody put their name there doesn't mean they actually did put a lot of effort into the book, just because someone didn't put their name there doens't mean they didn't put a lot of effort into the book, and just because someone didn't do a lot on the book, ''and'' didn't put their name on the authors page, doesn't mean they aren't one of the copyright holders for the pages the did edit.  It does seem from time to time that you ''might'' be talking about some entirely different kind of page, but if so it has not been readily apparent what other kind of page you were talking about.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 06:12, 5 April 2012 (UTC)

So I'm the one defending the point of a proposal that I didn't advance but since I consider the core point valid and worth pursuing I will again restate something that I've many times spoken about (and others).
:::: I can't briefly state a complex issue, and I know I tend to be verbose so bear with me... 
:::: 1) Regarding the argument that counter-vandalism measures do not suffice. - It would be obvious by previous copyvio discussions the issues we have in defining authors and obtaining the right information most of the time. I'm here since 2004 and have probably seen more discussions than you. You can check them out easily or even look at the RfD for the C++ Programming (in regards to how the copyright issue was dealt). There are also few copyvios  lingering in the backlog of deletions that supports the issue of how hard it is to determine and verify copyright ownership.
:::: Regarding the maintenance of the Copyright notices on books it would be instructive for you to do a search on the project, and simply consider their validity, we have works that still have the GFDL as their license (not that a book's license is specific for the aggregation). One task of the administration upon the conversion to the dual licensing should have been the examination of this notices if a) no copyright owners was directly licensing the work they should be removed (with care to any acknowledgments that would be required to be maintained) b) determine the date of the GFDL use (published revision of the work) and if done before the date limit, simply update to the CCBYSA30. c) if the date is after the GFDL examination contact the copyright owners or editors and get the authorization to change to the CCBYSA30 and risk of having to delete the work if some content was imported that was licensed only under the GFDL (with limitations) since the license was not compatible. To my knowledge none of this was ever done. I mention this to demonstrate that the subject of copyright and licensing is not dealt seriously or with consistency and the required Wikimedia supervision.
:::: It is also extremely difficult if not impossible to verify copyright ownership claims, that is those that add themselves (or others) as authors, copyright owners and to lists of acknowledgments. There is not only a general lack of knowledge by Wikibookians about the requirements or distinctions but as discussed these pages are left open to even to unregistered users (I would even see a need for Autoconfirmation to be able to create and edit such legal notices), and so the information that should be more valuably protected that the edit history logs is often corrupted or misused, possibly creating problems in the long run. Having as was proposed during the thread a greater requirement on creating these pages can only be of benefit to the project.
:::: Who polices this pages/type of information I rarely see anyone really taking interest in them besides the most dedicated contributors to the project. This information is not only legally useful, but has historical interest. Authors and those that donate works or permit us to reuse should rest assured that their rights are protected. I do not see how the project can evolve if we continue on the path to indifference of this matters.
:::: As a practical example consider the issue of [[Communication Networks]] and how can you verify that the information is correct (it is possible but the amount of work required is not something that the project can or should bear). Ultimately any dispute about copyrights can have tree outcomes a legal litigation between those making the claims, or with a contributor or result in removal of the work because ultimately every contributor is anonymous to a vast degree.
:::: We have to acknowledge that this pages are indeed special, more important that the disclaimers we put in some work and more that most would like to admit that the history logs, so what is the issue in granting them better protection?
:::: 2) Regarding Authors pages, ''of the sort described at the top of this thread'', being irrelevant to copyright. - By making that remark you show that you have little to no knowledge on the issue. Any phrasing that invokes rights, establish procedures or rules and invokes the law in writing constitutes a legal document. A legal instrument is simply a legal document that is unequivocally attributed to its author(s). Both our licensees require a written statement agreeing to them as to become a legal instrument. Without entering the discussion of the click-through, the use of the direct subscription of the license(s) is important to protect the work, making it clear that the work is subject to copyright, and deter infringement or plagiarism. Also to provide a means of identifying the copyright owner(s); for instance for relicensing purposes and validation of the content.
:::: These statements are not only useful (to the project, to the work and to those that claim it) but a right of those that contribute copyrightable content. If you have done the search I indicated you will have noticed a large variety of examples of people that have used this right. Ultimately having them make the statement does not infringe on anyone else's rights unless they are in violation of copyright and then a problem that we have to handle. 
:::: These legal document are not required to be in a specific page or section (like the disclaimers we normally use) but only for convenience they should be listed together.
:::: As your view that it is a matter of vanity pages, this is false by the reasons above but because people should be proud and take responsibility for their actions. The claim of ownership makes the content safer, to be valid and not a copyvio (since those making false claims could indeed get into legal trouble). In fact not defining copyright ownership is the shameful option as you are abdicating to give protection to it, in that case it would be better to give your copyrights to Wikimedia so they can in the future defend the work or relicense it. (Similar to how some people give their rights to the FSF when releasing Open Source software).
:::: Some interesting examples [[Scouting/BSA/First Aid Merit Badge]], [[Marijuana Cultivation/Introduction]], [[Linter SQL RDBMS]] (this one is extremely confusing since it is unclear if it is a replication of the software license or if it covers the work), [[Engineering Acoustics]] (redundant but not wrong), [[Strengths-Based Social Work Practice/Copyleft]] (confusing Copyleft in the name of the page, then he is both copyright owner and contributor) and [[General Engineering Introduction/Communication/Ground rules]] (I leave this one as an exercise to you...)  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 04:52, 20 April 2012 (UTC)

I have no doubts that copyright and licenses are taken seriously by Administrators. Fortunately Wikibooks has pages that address most copyright and license concerns. Unfortunately Wikibooks does not for Authorship. Compared with copyright lawyers, Wikibooks Administrators are amateurs on the subject of copyright, licenses, and authorship. Even when people think they know whats what, things can go wrong. [http://www.informationweek.com/news/development/java/232900594 Oracle vs Google over whether programming languages and APIs can be copyrighted] or [http://tap.usf.edu/news/major-textbook-publishers-file-copyright-lawsuit-against-open-education-resource-provider/ Major Textbook Publishers vs Open Education Startup claiming copyright violations over similarities], for example.

I agree that a formal position by the community about Authorship would be very useful and helpful at encouraging people to contribute. I doubt whether Author pages in any location makes sense when neither a policy or guideline exists for people to follow or be guided by, and no community decision exists that mandates their use, how and when they are to be used, when and if its appropriate or inappropriate for anyone who contributes to Wikibooks to claim Authorship for a book, when and if its appropriate or inappropriate to add Acknowledgments for Authors who contribute directly to Wikibooks, what forms of acknowledgments/attribution for third-party works are acceptable and unacceptable, when a third-party work is used who must prove or verify permission or lack of permission and what are acceptable and unacceptable ways to do so, whether all Contributors are Authors, and where acknowledgments/attributions should be placed. I think Author pages effectively discourage people from contributing because there is no policy or guideline that describe what it means to Author a book at Wikibooks, so some people assume the ramifications are that Authors have total and complete control over the development of books. I think Wikibooks will continue to see decreased activity if an Author namespace is created without addressing the core issues first. I agree that Author pages are vanity pages because anyone may use them for any purpose since the core issues haven't been addressed yet. I think by addressing the core issues, whether to move forward with an Authors namespace will become clear. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:39, 20 April 2012 (UTC)

:Don't get it. I do not see this as an administration only issue, it is not expected that administrators know more about what is what in legal matters than any other Wikibookian. Then you classify admins as amateurs on the subject of copyright, note that these amateurs are required to, in isolation and without logs delete works they judge as violating copyright law (something that I've been extremely vocal against in the past, requesting a log keeping, but that is another discussion). This is just to point out that Wikibookians are expected to exert and interpret the law (even as to be able to contribute) and it is a special requirement for adminship to be able to enforce legal dictates.
:Then you propose that the community, that is, the active community (mostly constituted by the above mentioned amateurs) establish a position. This clearly is not possible, especially as an enforcible policy, in not wanted (by your own recognition of lack of full understanding of the subject or even an ability to consensually decide on it) not or even legal (we can't locally, rewrite the law or go against it). Legal matters should be decided by Wikimedia's legal department, the community has no power to rewrite the law and should be extremely carefully when providing their own interpretations of the law. Note that those that do not understand the legal matters should restrain themselves to act on this subjects (like in any aspect that one find oneself out-of-depth, in particular you proposal that the copyright statements should just be deleted put you on that boat).
:The claim of ownership of copyrights (not particularly authorship) is a legal right, the notice is itself not a legal required (debatable, due to the wording of the licenses, particularly the GFDL, but I tend to agree). Even if copyright law as abolished the use of the copyright statement, in this case it is useful for users, contributors (in particular required for attribution purposes) and ultimately Wikimedia. The only possible way to resolve the issue would be to force granting all the rights to Wikimedia, and this would be damaging to the project or move all works into the public domain, but by the decision of Wikimedia to use specific licensing, the copyright issues has to some point been considered, and the licenses establishes some guidelines (even if not completely clear and in view of our format).
:This of course does not invalidate that the community provides some clarifications, like you propose, we can however inform of best procedures and on disparate views, without establishing a legal interpretation. This has been attempted in the past.
:As for your statement that Author pages effectively discourage people from contributing, I accept it as your personal view, not as a fact, personally I do not know but I note that most books that have a copyright statement tend to be more complete and mature that others that people contributing have not taken responsibility over. 
:I oppose the idea of an Author namespace, the possibility to grant copyright and other legal statements and disclaimers statements a specific location and protection (page protection) seem however a simple, rational and non intrusive thing to do. With no negative implications and solving some problems and eases maintenance work. I also do not see as positive an out of proportion treatment to this issue, because most less knowledgeable Wikibookians would indeed see it as a sort of special recognition of their pears, like adminiship was seen in the past. This is not what we should aim for nor for an increase on claims of copyright ownership by those that do not fully understand the implications. Just an extra proper protection and a consistency in dealing with them is what the proponent seems to be aiming, and that I support.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 13:04, 22 April 2012 (UTC)
&lt;/div&gt;
|}

As to resume and conclude the discussion, now extremely long of the primary proposal regarding the creation of an Author namespace to protect copyright claims and attributions made by an unsigned or unregistered user and taking in consideration the opinions expressed on the subject. I move that the proposal as initially state should be negated as not gathering the consensus.&lt;br&gt;
A subsequent alternative proposal, taking in consideration what has been said, will occur afterwards as to provide communal validation for requests of page protection regarding copyright and legal sensitive notices, that will address partially the concerns of the initial proponent.&lt;br&gt;
This request will be open for participation until &lt;u&gt;7 days after the last post on this thread&lt;/u&gt;. '''No opposition (or their restatement) will mean that the community does not support the creation of a new Author namespace''' (as initial proposed).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 01:50, 30 April 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">A Kexi database can hold 5 types of objects: tables, queries, forms, reports, and scripts.

A table is a grid that holds data (for instance, the patrons of a library.) The horizontal rows of the grid are called &quot;records&quot;, and contain information on a single entity (e.g. one patron). The vertical columns hold a piece data of a certain ''type'' (e.g. a patron's phone number), and are called &quot;fields&quot;.

A query creates sets of data pulled from one or more tables. Various operators and functions may be used to manipulate the data. For instance, in a library database, you could take the &quot;patrons&quot; table (which also has data on which books are checked out), and correlate it with the &quot;books&quot; table (which has book titles and due dates), to form a new table that holds information on all patrons that still have overdue books.

Forms provide a simple, familiar interface for editing and viewing the database.

Kexi scripts can be written in JavaScript, Python, or any other scripting language supported by Kross (the KDE scripting framework).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Casual gaming==
The rise of casual gaming, or relatively cheaper pc games has grown quickly with casual games representing 2.25 billion dollars in revenue in 2008. Casual games include hits such as [[w:Diner Dash|Diner Dash]] , [[w:Feeding Frenzy (video game)|Feeding Frenzy]] , and
[[w:Bejeweled|Bejeweled]] and have a demographic which is 74% female. Social and casual gaming is expanding rapidly. In 2011 Social and casual gaming received about half of all game related investments.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/162929/Social_casual_market_dominated_game_investments_in_2011_report_says.php&lt;/ref&gt; casual games however oftern operate under the try before you buy business model. Users download a game then purchase a code to unlock the entirety of it's features. There is however especially in the PC arena, the problem of online piracy eroding profits. The game Ricochet:Infinity, had a player base in which 92% of users pirated the game. The piracy problem has lead to a revenue model which derives much of it's revenue from in-game ads and microtransactions in freemium games rather than from initial purchase price.

== FarmVille ==
Farmville, is a farming simulations social network game released in 2009 by Zynga. It surpassed 80 million monthly active users making it the most actively played game in world wide, until it was later surpassed by similar Zynga game CityVille. The farmville user base has since deflated, in large part due to spam curbing efforts by Facebook reducing notifications to invite friends to participate. The revenue model for farmville comes from the purchasing of ingame items for Farmville cash, which can be bought using currency which can either be attained in game or instantaneously for cash. The strong network externalities, free entry and ease of access and automatic advertising brought about its rapid success. By integrating with facebook, it became much easier to establish a social relations in farmville. It also exhibits several psychological hooks which help engage the user base to the level where people start paying for in-game assets. For one many of the ways in which items are required are random and require a very intensive use of farm cash. You get between 5-6 farmville dollars for a U.S. dollar depending on the number purchased. They are used to buy decorative items for a farm. There is a slot machine as well as several other methods which give random rewards. They can also be used to purchase in came coins in order to speed progress through the game and customization. Farmville requires that you add a certain number of neighbors in order to expand, this provides strong network externalities making the desire to expand great. Neighbors can tend each others crops and send gifts to one another. The player base of Farmville is largely nonpaying however, and a small fraction generate most of the revenue from Farmville.

==ZT online==
The advantage of freemium model is that it enables free entry, but the micro-transaction model
can allow users to spend extreme amounts in order to maintain their standing in a game. One notorious
instance of this is in the Chinese MMORPG ZT(ZhengThu) online. ZT Online was the most popular
Chinese online game in 2007-2008{{cn}}&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZT_Online&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;. While there is not fee ofr entry, all items are gained by opening chests
with keys that cost money real world money. Once chests are opened a roulette style 
indicator randomly selects the items from a an alluring list containing items of varying degrees.
The rarest items having a very low probabilities of selection. This creates gambling mechanic for 
virtual goods, and an addicting and stratified power structure. Rewards for opening the most chests in a day further spur on
users to spend large amounts on the game.

In the third quarter of 2007 ZT online had an average revenue per user of an impressive RMB 305.2 48.41 dollars&lt;ref&gt;http://investorshub.advfn.com/boards/board.aspx?board_id=11228#&lt;/ref&gt; This is particularly high for a freemium game and represents the fact that micro-transactions are an integral  part of playing the game, woven in with the addicting psychology of gambling.

==League of Legends==
League of legends is an action strategy game released by Riot games in 2009. While matches take place between teams of 5(sometimes 3) in independent instances, there are several persistent elements to the game, such as summoner level runes and accumulated champions. Customizable character skins which can only be bought for the games virtual currency. AS with many virtual currencies, the appeal is twofold, not only does it add a small degree of separation from real world money, but virtual currency is generally purchased in denominations that differ from the prices of in-game assets. This results in an increased desire to spend with the sometimes perpetually left over money. The System is setup so runes, which raise the statistics of in-game characters, are purchased via influence points, a currency gained solely through in game play(Although boosts which multiply the amount gained from play can be purchased for riot points). There is also a second in game currency, riot  points which can be only be purchased using real money. For each match the player selects a champion with which to play, they can either select from one of 10 free champions, rotated randomly on a weekly basis, or from a champion they have purchased. Champions can be purchased either through riot points or influence points. Purchasing them through influence points however is extremely time consuming and detracts from one's ability to purchase stat raising runes. This inspires players to spend money to permanently unlock champions they desire to play, as well as skins to customize the champions their favorites. Since skins can only be bought using riot points, players are paying to express their identity, sometimes $10 or more per skin. This along with a constant stream of new champions allows for some players to pay large amounts of money while others can buy few or no champions.
==Zynga==
The company behind farmville, CityVille is one of the largest social gaming companies. In Feb 2012 they reported a revenue of $311 million with an average of $2 per user. With only about 3% of the users paying,&lt;ref&gt;http://mashable.com/2012/03/23/zynga-economics/&lt;/ref&gt; Zynga relies on a small segment of large spenders to generate the it's revenue while the rest of the users provide the competitive environment will take place.
==Riot games==
In order to foster a more competitive atmosphere as well as increase the overall play base, Riot games has invested heavily in the competitive scene. With a $5million dollar prize pool announced for the second season of League of legends, including a $2 million dollar finals. This move is designed to grow the userbase for league of legends as well as increase the number of hardcore users as they contribute largely per user in order to remain competitive. In February of 2011 Riot games was purchased by Tencent, a Chinese internet holdings company for $400 million dollars.

==The stigma of paying for success==
The important aspect of League of Legends is that while many trappings of success can be bought it has avoided the stigma associated with too much influence from money in the game. Stat changes from runes are only influenced marginally by the spending of money, and champions in the free rotation come from the list of buyable one's so there's no inherent disadvantage in paying for progress. This has prevented a mass disuasion of free users as one would see in games such as Zt online. The important part is to balance the act of encouraging payment while still providing incentives for free users to say on board, since a large player base is necessary to sustain itself in the tippy online market.

Another way is to use (again) an interposition library:

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The output is a bit rough but it can be refined down to file and line by replacing &lt;tt&gt;backtrace_symbols_fd()&lt;/tt&gt; with appropriate code:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
*** pthread_create:
./libhook.so(pthread_create+0x8c)[0x400215d3]
./plock[0x8048a7f]
/lib/i686/cmov/libc.so.6(__libc_start_main+0xe0)[0x4006f450]
./plock[0x8048791]
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== File descriptors ===

As just about anything is a file (folders, sockets, pipes, etc, etc...), just about anything can result in a file descriptor that needs to be closed. &lt;tt&gt;/proc&lt;/tt&gt; can help:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
# tree /proc/26041
/proc/26041
...
|-- fd                  # Open files descriptors
|   |-- 0 -&gt; /dev/pts/21
|   |-- 1 -&gt; /dev/pts/21
|   |-- 2 -&gt; /dev/pts/21
|   `-- 3 -&gt; socket:[113497835]
|-- fdinfo
|   |-- 0
|   |-- 1
|   |-- 2
|   `-- 3
...
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The &lt;tt&gt;trace_call&lt;/tt&gt; command for &lt;tt&gt;gdb&lt;/tt&gt; can help with the call stack.

If gdb is not available on the machine, an interposition library hooking &lt;tt&gt;open()&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;pipe()&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;socket()&lt;/tt&gt;, etc. can be built.

Other tools that can be used:
* &lt;tt&gt;lsof&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;fuser&lt;/tt&gt;

=== Ports ===

Which process is using a port? As root:

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
# netstat -tlnp
Active Internet connections (only servers)
Proto Recv-Q Send-Q Local Address               Foreign Address             State       PID/Program name

...
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;

COMMAND  PID USER   FD   TYPE DEVICE SIZE NODE NAME
python  3438 root    4u  IPv4  11416       TCP localhost.localdomain:2207 (LISTEN)
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Other tools:
* &lt;tt&gt;fuser&lt;/tt&gt;

=== IPC ===

For semaphores, shared memory and message queues.

* &lt;tt&gt;ipcs&lt;/tt&gt;
* &lt;tt&gt;ipcrm&lt;/tt&gt;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
# ipcs -spt
------ Semaphore Operation/Change Times --------
semid    owner      last-op                    last-changed

&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

=== DYI: an interposition resource counter ===

[[Linux_Applications_Debugging_Techniques/Leaks#DIY:libmemleak|libmemleak]] can be easily modified to keep track of whatever resources are leaking. Hook the right API (e.g. &lt;tt&gt;open()/close()&lt;/tt&gt;).

      <comment>/* Building and installing megafont */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">This page provides advice on how to install the MediaWiki-to-LaTeX converter wb2pdf in Fedora. It is wholly based in [[en:User:Duplode|my]] own experience with F16, so take it with a grain of salt and adapt the details to your system if need be. You will likely want to check [[:de:Benutzer:Dirk_Huenniger/wb2pdf|the main wb2pdf page]], with download links and usage instructions, and in particular [[:de:Benutzer:Dirk_Huenniger/wb2pdf/ubuntu|the installation guide for Ubuntu]], from which this page was originally derived.

== The TeXLive 2011 repository ==

The default Fedora 16 repositories carry an outdated set of TeXLive packages which lacks many things we will need for wb2pdf. Before installing the packages, it is necessary to install the test repository for TeXLive 2011 (see this [http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/TeXLive Fedora Project page] for details and instructions for Fedora versions other than 16). In Fedora 16, run:

 su -c 'rpm -i http://jnovy.fedorapeople.org/texlive/2011/packages.fc16/texlive-release.noarch.rpm'
 su -c 'yum clean all'

If you already have the older TeXLive installed, you will also need to

 su -c 'yum update'

== Installing packages ==

Next, we will install all packages needed for building and running wb2pdf, including the TexLive ones. Here is the yum command, in one shot:

 su -c 'yum install subversion python3 python3-tkinter ImageMagick librsvg2 fontforge-devel ghc ghc-regex-compat-devel ghc-HTTP-devel ghc-split-devel ghc-MissingH-devel cabal-install texlive-scheme-basic texlive-collection-latexrecommended texlive-collection-latexextra texlive-collection-fontsrecommended texlive-collection-fontsextra texlive-collection-games texlive-collection-humanities texlive-collection-science texlive-arabtex texlive-cjk texlive-collection-langcjk texlive-collection-langcyrillic texlive-collection-langgreek texlive-collection-langvietnamese texlive-cm-super texlive-gnu-freefont wqy-zenhei-fonts'

The same packages, in a more readable presentation: 

 su -c 'yum install subversion python3 python3-tkinter ImageMagick librsvg2 fontforge-devel'
 su -c 'yum install ghc ghc-regex-compat-devel ghc-HTTP-devel ghc-split-devel ghc-MissingH-devel cabal-install'
 su -c 'yum install texlive-scheme-basic texlive-collection-latexrecommended texlive-collection-latexextra'
 su -c 'yum install texlive-collection-fontsrecommended texlive-collection-fontsextra texlive-collection-games'
 su -c 'yum install texlive-collection-humanities texlive-collection-science texlive-arabtex texlive-cjk'
 su -c 'yum install texlive-collection-langcjk texlive-collection-langcyrillic texlive-collection-langgreek'
 su -c 'yum install texlive-collection-langvietnamese texlive-cm-super texlive-gnu-freefont wqy-zenhei-fonts'

(This list was inferred from the [[:de:Benutzer:Dirk_Huenniger/wb2pdf/ubuntu|Ubuntu instructions]]; compare with that one if you find some package is missing - and if so I kindly ask you to correct the commands here.)

There are two packages which are not in the Fedora repositories. ghc-hxt will be automatically installed by Cabal (the Haskell package system) when you build wb2pdf; there is also unifont, which will be dealt with in a later step.

== Building wb2pdf ==

Next, we will get the sources and build wb2pdf:

 svn co https://wb2pdf.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/wb2pdf wb2pdf
 cd wb2pdf/trunk
 cabal update
 cabal install
 cd src
 python3 makelinuxbins.py

Note that I am assuming a per-user (as opposed to global) installation of wb2pdf by cabal.

== Building and installing megafont ==

wb2pdf requires a set of fonts, called megafont, which is a combination of the unifont, FreeSerif ans wqy-zenhei fonts. We need to build and install megafont to the LaTeX tree. wb2pdf comes with a python script which help building megafont. First, however, you will need to download unifont, which is not in the Fedora repositories. You can get it from [http://unifoundry.com/unifont.html this page] (the first link to a ttf.gz file). Extract it to the &lt;tt&gt;font&lt;/tt&gt; sudirectory of the svn trunk and rename the ttf file to unifont.ttf .

The script for installing megafont is in the same &lt;tt&gt;font&lt;/tt&gt; subdirectory. To run it, then, do: 

 cd ../font
 su -c 'python3 installunifont_fedora.py'

The script will install the fonts to the LaTeX tree for local additions, as set in your system by the file /usr/share/texlive/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf . You can find it with:

 kpsewhich --var-value TEXMFLOCAL

== Updating the TeX tree ==

(This section is based in information from [http://www.tug.org/fonts/fontinstall.html this page from the TeX Users Group].)

Finally, we need to register the megafont fonts in the TeX tree. To do that, run the following commands:

 su -c 'texhash'
 updmap --enable Map=megafont.map
 su -c 'texhash'

Again, note that the updmap step is being performed locally, and not globally.

wb2pdf is now ready to run:

 cd ../src/
 python3 gui.py

And that's it - for further instructions, see the [[:de:Benutzer:Dirk Huenniger/wb2pdf/manual|wb2pdf manual]].</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Dear Wikibookians,&lt;br /&gt;

No doubt some of you are familiar with the free college courses available on [http://Saylor.org Saylor.org]. Much like the Wikimedia community, we are committed to providing free and accessible education for everyone with internet access. At Saylor, we combine some of our custom-created educational materials with materials that are already available throughout the internet. However, because we sometimes use links to third party materials, those sections of our courses are not entirely sustainable. The Saylor Wikibooks Project is a way for you to help minimize that threat. We’ve uploaded a number of our course outlines to Wikibooks in the hope that you all will contribute to our effort. Our course outlines have been developed by our consultant professors by studying a collection of syllabi of relevant courses from various traditional brick and mortar institutions. This guarantees that our students will be provided the same learning opportunity as a student enrolled in a traditional institution. We believe that we have created the best structure for our courses, which optimizes the information that students would be expected to know. By creating openly licensed content that fits in with Saylor’s established course outlines, (in the form of Wikibooks’ textbooks), you can add to the ever-expanding body of wiki material, while simultaneously improving the sustainability of our courses.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Thanks for your help, &lt;br /&gt;

The Saylor Team

'''&lt;big&gt;Summary&lt;/big&gt;'''

[[File:Onion Cells.jpg|thumb|right]]
The cell is the fundamental unit of life; in fact, the smallest living organisms are composed of a single cell.  Despite their small size, cells are far from simple, and we have only recently begun to understand just how complex they are.  This text will present you with a detailed overview of a cell’s main components and functions.  The text is roughly organized into four major areas: the cell membrane, cell nucleus, cell cycle, and cell interior.  We will approach most of these topics straightforwardly, from a molecular and structural point of view.


'''&lt;big&gt;Global Learning Outcomes&lt;/big&gt;'''
* Explain what a eukaryotic cell is, identify the components of the cell, and describe how a cell functions. 
* Explain how cell membranes are formed.
* Identify the general mechanisms of transport across cell membranes.
* List the different ways in which cells communicate with one another—specifically, via signaling pathways. 
* Define what the extracellular matrix is composed of in different cells and how the extracellular matrix is involved in forming structures in specific tissues.
* List the components of the cell’s cytoskeleton and explain how the cytoskeleton is formed and how it directs cell movements.
* Explain the fundamentals of gene expression and describe how gene expression is regulated at the protein level.
* Define and explain the major cellular events involved in mitosis and cytokinesis.
* Identify the major cellular events that occur during meiosis.
* Describe the eukaryotic cell cycle and identify the events that need to occur during each phase of the cell cycle.
* Identify all of the major organelles in eukaryotic cells and their respective major functions.


__TOC__

==[[/Review of Basic Concepts/]]==

Upon successful completion of this unit, students will be able to:
* Identify the functions of major organic molecules.
* Understand hydrophilic and hydrophobic bonds and their respective roles in cells (particularly in terms of cell-membrane structure).
* Understand the four levels of protein structures and be able to identify which structure is referred to in a given example.
* Understand the relationship between free energy and the direction of a reaction.

::1.1.4 [[/ATP/]]
::1.1.5 [[/DNA and RNA/]]
::1.1.6 [[/Free Energy and ATP/]]

==[[/The Cell Membrane/]]==

Upon completion of this unit, students will be able to:
* Know and identify the components of membranes.
* Understand how these components affect membrane properties.
* Identify types of membrane transport (specific pumps and channels) and understand the role of various molecules and ions (e.g. sodium, calcium) in this transport.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You have a collection of HTML tables that you want to convert to PDF.

== Method ==
We will use an XQuery typeswitch transformation that will convert the key table elements (table,thead,tr,th,db,tbody) to the corresponding XSL-FO elements.

== Sample Main Dispatcher ==
We will create an XQuery module with the following functions:

* a main dispater function for starting the transform
* a single function for each table element
* a function to process the class attributes for each element

To transform the table the following will be used:

   let $fo-table := html-2-fo:main($html-table);

:There shouldn't be any difference, the practice of psychiatric rehabilitation should be an activity performed by a psychiatrist. If used in another context it will be a good indicator that the one calling himself a practitioner has no (or incomplete) formation as a psychiatrist.

== Welcome message ==
Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] (global to the system) or in a page on your own userspace.
* Remember to use [[Commons:Main Page|Commons]] project for image uploading.
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks are open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer since things work a little different here.
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to keep a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you have questions, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;(This is not an automated message, I'll be watching during a time for any reply you make to it...)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 22:22, 26 April 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Purpose of this book==

Is this book going to be any more than a copy of the book [http://www.saylor.org/courses/bio301/ BIO301:Cell Biology] published by Saylor.org? A simple copy wouldn't really be in line with our policies (please see [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks?]]). [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Recent Runes|contribs]]) 22:47, 26 April 2012 (UTC)

BIO301 is a course that is hosted on Saylor.org, not a book.  Much of the content in that course is not openly licensed so right now Saylor just links to that material, rather than hosting it themselves.  The purpose of putting the course outline (which doubles as the potential outline for text), on wikibooks, was to allow the wiki community to help write entries for the units.  These entries, (and eventually, hopefully this book) will give Saylor the opportunity to host more of their resources, and provide students with a more sustainable experience.  So in that way, it is much more than a simple copy.

[[User:Scphillips|Scphillips]] ([[User talk:Scphillips|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Scphillips|contribs]]) 21:46, 3 May 2012 (UTC)

:I think that could be OK then, but you need to provide attributions to Saylor.org for the material you have adapted from their course. As they say in their FAQ &quot;...you are free to download, modify, and reproduce our course outlines for any purpose, as long as you provide credit (attribution) to the Saylor Foundation for the source material.&quot;. This can be done by inserting references to the source material in your text.

== What to do next ==

I've worked on a wikijunior book [[Wikijunior:The Little Gardener|The Little Gardener]], and I am pretty much done with it for now, although there is certainly room to expand. My question is, what can I do next with it? Is there a place to ask for the community to review, copyedit or give suggestions? I would love to get feedback and help to &quot;finish&quot; it.

I tried to keep the directions simple, so it is lacking more specifics simply because it acts to help grow the ''seed''. Also, where can I add it to have more visibility? I don't think the title is very searchable, and if that is a problem I will gladly move it. - [[User:Theornamentalist|Theornamentalist]] ([[User talk:Theornamentalist|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Theornamentalist|contribs]]) 02:15, 2 April 2012 (UTC)

: If you haven't encountered our book [[Using Wikibooks]] (which was recently promoted to Featured Book status), you may find it has some quite useful information in it; several chapters in the part &quot;The Wikibooks Writer&quot; pertain to creating a book.  Also, I notice there's some relevant stuff in [[Using Wikibooks/Cleanup and Maintenance#New Books and Organizing]].

: You'll want to add, to your book's landing page, templates {{tl|Subjects}}, {{tl|Alphabetical}}, and {{tl|Status}}.  Take a look at the landing pages of some other Wikijunior books for comparison (say, [[Wikijunior:Big Cats]]).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 02:48, 2 April 2012 (UTC)

:Doesn't it miss the best time for planting information (I understand this changes from location, but since you cover outdoors planting...).
:You could probably also link it to other Wikibooks (see [[Gardening]]) for more detailed information. It would also be interesting to kids to understand seeds and soil a little better, even how to make compost as a recycling activity.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 02:50, 2 April 2012 (UTC)

:: This is a Wikijunior book we're talking about, though.  We generally don't link the books for kids (which have extra protection against vandalism, via flaggedrevs configuration) to the books for adults (where transitory vandalism is instantly visible).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 14:25, 2 April 2012 (UTC)

::: I do not see that as a problem (like linking to Wikipedia), I have done so in the past. If I was a vandal attempting to get minors to view objectionable content that way I would think very about start betting the lottery. Wikibooks vandalism is not that bad, the added content that would be problematic to minors is as very small part of it, mostly done by kids themselves, and I never had to correct anything in the books related to this sort of topic (exception to the Cannabis book that I don't see Theornamentalist using). The idea is for the adult content to provide further explanations or be used as source to extend the subjects at Wikijunior...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 15:53, 2 April 2012 (UTC)

:::: Fwiw, as I recall there'd been an incident in the months leading up to our big push to vandalism-proof the whole of Wikijunior, in which a graphic image of... I think it was some variety of aroused human sexual organ... was put up in a bunch of places.  I no longer remember for sure whether some of them were on Wikijunior, but the point of proofing Wikijunior was that while adults may (as I think I put it at the time) shake their heads at the folly of vandals, clean up the mess, and move on &amp;mdash; kids, or their guardians, should expect they won't be randomly subjected to such things on Wikijunior.  We had a very off-putting warning notice at the top of the Wikijunior main page for a while, to the effect that we can't guarantee your kid won't be subjected to something really perverted, until we'd finished proofing the whole subproject.

:::: I didn't mean to suggest vandals would deliberately plan to catch kids coming from Wikijunior, but rather than kids and their guardians ought to be given a browsing experience on Wikijunior that remains within the protected zone of Wikijunior.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 17:55, 2 April 2012 (UTC)

::::: I understand the preoccupation and intention but it seems that you are attempting to establish a best practice guideline for Wikijunior (I have been a merely sporadic contributor, some spellings or formatting and I think I have linked to wikipedia one time or another. I don't have kids and personally I do not believe in walled gardens of any kind, and I especially dislike self-censuring toward undefined dangers.
::::: Since I'm not a persistent contributor to that project (nor have plans to do any major work there) it is beyond me to attempt to say what people should do or not do. I would not let my kids if below 10 to use the Internet without active guidance by a trusted adult, and I'm extremely open minded and not at all pudic.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 19:30, 2 April 2012 (UTC)         
:::::: Afaik, I'm describing existing best-practice.  Not so much censorship as reasonable precaution; not a walled garden, but a playground with a chain link fence around it, which is pretty unremarkable.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 20:31, 2 April 2012 (UTC)

Thank you for taking the time to respond, I will work on it this week. Regarding linking to wikipedia on each page, I could link it to simple.wp instead, though I initially had reservations in doing so. - [[User:Theornamentalist|Theornamentalist]] ([[User talk:Theornamentalist|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Theornamentalist|contribs]]) 16:05, 2 April 2012 (UTC)
:Thank you all again for the feedback; there is still work I plan on doing this week, but I wanted to know if the main Wikijunior page is reserved for books which are featured or are of a certain assumed level of completeness. As far as the book scope I intended (which was to assist with growing the seeds, I feel it is somewhat complete. However, with there literally being millions of plants to be grown, I don't feel comfortable marking it as complete with the {{tl|status}} template nor even somewhat complete. I think that the tools and engine for this book are mostly complete, but not the breadth of it. 
:I am going to expand a bit on each seed directions, and also the glossary, as well as give some general sources or &quot;see also&quot; links, but for the most part, I am satisfied with it.
:I would love to work with some other users on a new wikijunior book; is anyone interested or have any ideas? - [[User:Theornamentalist|Theornamentalist]] ([[User talk:Theornamentalist|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Theornamentalist|contribs]]) 12:50, 5 April 2012 (UTC)

:: Regardless of whether or not it's complete enough for the Wikijunior main page, your book should be listed at [[WJ:All Books]].  When we get a chance I expect we'll automate [[WJ:All Books]], but for now it's still manual.  Note that where your book goes on that page depends on its status, which it looks like you haven't defined yet.

:: Though we generally wait until a book is useful (ideally, complete) before putting it on the WJ main page, how that translates into &quot;status&quot; may vary.  For example, there's no reasonable doubt (imho) that [[WJ:The Elements]] belongs there, despite the number of elements not covered.

:: I'd say your book should be brushed up just a bit, and then go up on the WJ main page.  Looking at it, there are just one or two purely technical things I'd say really need to be cleaned up (hope I can get to that tonight or tomorrow); and I've got one suggestion for improvement I hope to discuss with you on the book's main talk page (and then if you've no objection we can act on that).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 18:52, 5 April 2012 (UTC)
== Silly question about book subdivisions ==

Hello everybody! It's great to be back here after so long :)

I return with a lingering doubt about what is the better way to name book subdivisions. The ultimate source of my worries is that I would like to make such &quot;meta&quot; terminology uniform within the [[Haskell]] Wikibook, but it has a deeper structure than usual is making things trickier. If you go to its main page, you will see first there are three big coloured blocks in the table of contents. These, in turn, are divided in a few slices; and these slices contain the pages proper. Now, &quot;module&quot;, which is the default Wikibooks term for the individual pages, is objected by contributors because there are things called modules in Haskell, and so it would sound strange to use the same word for the pages. Lately I have used &quot;chapters&quot; to talk about to the pages, so that &quot;sections&quot; can be used to refer to level 2 headers within them. Problem is, there are two other levels in the hierarchy... one of them might be spoken of as &quot;units&quot;, but I'm not sure about what to do with other one. So, what options do I have?

Cheers, --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 06:45, 5 April 2012 (UTC)

: In the [[Conlang]] book, units at all levels are called &quot;sections&quot;, as I recall.

: Commonly, if a book has a small number of major units, they're called &quot;Parts&quot; (e.g. Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced), units below that level are Chapters, which are divided into Sections, which are divided into Subsections, Subsubsections, etc.  I'm actually studying a purchased textbook atm in which the major units, that I'd have called Parts, are called Chapters.  So there's a lot of flexibility in usage.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 11:03, 5 April 2012 (UTC)

:: I had forgotten about two facts about the book. Firstly, two of the three larger divisions are already referred to as &quot;Tracks&quot; (as in &quot;Beginner's Track&quot;), so we could simply extend the nomenclature to the third one. That would leave &quot;Units&quot; for the intermediate divisions and &quot;Chapters&quot; for the pages. However, and secondly, there are several templates (navigation, etc.) which refer to the intermediate divisions as Chapters (just like your textbook). And there seem to be no regular contributors around with which I could discuss any possible changes... :( --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 00:45, 7 April 2012 (UTC)

::: It's not uncommon for a given book to have only one person actively working on it at a given time.  This was so for much of the time I was working most actively on [[Conlang]].  I always announced what I was doing on the talk pages, and if it was something especially significant I generally announced my intention and waited a while before acting on it (sometimes as much as a week, if I had the patience&amp;nbsp;:-).  If someone did come back later, they could read on the talk pages all about what I'd done (and that did, in fact, happen after I'd been working on it for a few months).  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 01:02, 7 April 2012 (UTC)

== Two questions about history merges ==

Assuming no objections are raised I will perform a merge of [[Haskell/Class declarations]] into [[Haskell/Classes and types]] in a few days. In order to avoid link rot, &quot;Class declarations&quot; (which currently has the bulk of the content) will be retained as a redirect. My questions, then, are:

1. Is it necessary/recommended to ask for a history merge in such a situation, or is it simpler to just cross-reference the involved pages in the edit summaries of the merge?

2. Does the history merge procedure imply the deletion of the source page of the merge? (That would mean I would have to recreate &quot;Class declarations&quot; as a redirect afterwards.)

--[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 00:32, 12 April 2012 (UTC)

:It is recommended to ask for history merges if indeed source material is to be deleted. Cross-reference is always welcomed just to make clear that the content that is being moved in bulk is from a merge.
:History merges imply the deletion of the source page(s) unless a request is made not to delete (in this case it is not categorized as a merge but a derivation). This cases are rare and should be carefully considered, since there is no point in Wikibooks hosting duplicated material (see the [[Wikibooks:Forking|fork policy draft]] and discussion for the arguments).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 00:51, 12 April 2012 (UTC)

: I would disagree in this particular case, where you goal is to leave a redirect.  By leaving a link to which ever page your merging from in the edit summary (or perhaps the talk page) your satisfying any copyright requirements that exist.  Then changing &quot;Class declarations&quot; to a redirect requires no special tools and makes life simpler all around. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 03:14, 12 April 2012 (UTC)

::That would imply that the administration would be perfect in checking history logs when deleting redirect page. That a redirect outside of the root namespace has any long lasting usefulness (unless it is included in the navigational structure of the work) and that the one doing the copying would also not make mistakes in referencing in the destination the source page and on the redirect that the content was moved. Overall doable, but highly risky and so the alternatives should be pursued, even if the redirect is what is intended. Easier on the one using the content and on the administration doing the deletions (and any future admin that has to handle the redirect).
::In this cases it is not even specifically about copyright issues but just to maintaining a consistent edit history log. There are many other benefits one is attempting to contact the ones responsible for some action, even helping detection and correction of malfeasance...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 04:21, 12 April 2012 (UTC)

::: Well I think we will have to agree to disagree.  From an administrative point of view I find redirects fairly easy to deal with.  I find history merges often rather difficult.  When done in error (which would not be the case here) they are very difficult to undo.  Links are also more appropriate in many cases, such as one page merged into multiple places,  etc.  As I understand this was a major reason for changing the license so to alleviate the requirement of keeping a complete author list on every page.  But I digress.  [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 14:42, 12 April 2012 (UTC)

:::: I have no problem with that. But since we are discussing methodologies I must confess that I do not know how many merges you performed but as an editor I have done plenty. Never done history merges because I'm not an admin, but think you are over selling the complexity. When done in error merges are not difficult to undo, unless they are done in some sort of convoluted way, like the one you are proposing.
:::: In case you use content, from a single source page, into multiple target pages, you should select the one that closely matches the previous content/function and that, at the time of the merge, has the best chance for stability in the resulting merged project. That would be the best repository for the merged edit history.
:::: As the one performing the merge moves content from the source location he should add on the resulting edits' comment that the content is the result that merge (time of edits will suffice for later correlations).
:::: To undo a merge you must only determine what page was deleted and restore it. Look at it's history, see the time and read the merge comment/edit for the target of the merge. Go into the target look at edits near that time frame revert the content to the nearest possible and check edits from that user on that timeframe on all pages on that namespace (you can probably get a easy match in the user's contribution page). Note also that there are very few cases of complex merges and due to their complexity they are mostly performed by competent editors with some experience, they will often be available to help undo any action.
:::: I've been here since 2004 and never have observed reversing a merge.
:::: If one takes only the requirements of copyright attributions, reversing a merge is simply the splitting up of a work, in that case one should need only to mention that and give any required attributions to the copyright owners if listed, it will constitute a derived work, if both works will rest on the project the source (the merged work) edit history will provide all the edit information.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 18:12, 12 April 2012 (UTC)
::::: Well I will comment first that History Merges are notoriously difficult to undo, in some cases may be not possible.  Let me explain how the merge/unmerge process works, because it is not quite as you describe above.  Suppose we want to merge the history of A into B.  First you delete B, then you rename A to B, then you delete B again, then you undelete all the edits from B.  Then you correct the current version B.  
::::: The  consequence of this is that, no where in the database is there a list of edits that originally belonged to A. From the point of view of the database it is as if A never existed.  So you cannot &quot;determine what page was deleted and restore it&quot;.  Instead to undo a history merge you must first delete B again, then undelete just those edits from B that corresponded original to A.  Since this information doesn't exist anywhere outside of being deduced by the admin, you have to go through and examine every individual edit.  It is very tedious.  Then you move B to A.  Then since there are still deleted edits left at the B page, you can undelete it again.  I am pretty sure I have done this here at WB in the past, because I recall trying to tell two pages apart that were very similar to begin with and I found it very difficult to tell which edits originally belonged to A.  Overall, of the tools available to an admin, history merges are the only bit of maintenance that is actually destructive in terms of preserving information (ie which edits originally belonged to A).  
::::: To preform a history merge, you delete the target page.  Move the old page to the target page name, and undelete everything.  Which means you cannot ever go back to the old page name and undelete to look at it's history.  That information is lost.  You can only look at individual edits and try to decide for yourself what belongs to which page. [[User:Thenub314|Thenub]][[Special:Contributions/Thenub314|314]] ([[User talk:Thenub314|talk]]) 21:05, 12 April 2012 (UTC)
:::::: Yes most people do not know these facts. I have made references to that loss of data when calling attention that edit histories may be corrupted (I have seen and called attention to that effects of those administrative actions on the C++ Programming project).
:::::: I'm of the opinion, and have stated it before, that history merges should not be performed by the same administrator that is doing the content merge (or even working on the same project). This seems to be good ethical rule of thumb.
:::::: That was why I also did not comprehend your approach as described in the posts above, it seemed that you were defending a history merge of the source page with multiple destination pages (in the previous post to the above) and to keep redirects with the edit history (in the first and second reply), that would just complicate tracing back the alterations because it can't be applied consistently. That was why see it as a more convoluted approach...
:::::: I haven't seen a reversal of a merge. I have only noticed that type of actions as attempts correct administrative errors in handling page history logs, if my memory does not fail me, I think that your experience was also due to a mishap.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 23:29, 12 April 2012 (UTC)
::::::: Amidst this conversation about history merges, I feel the key point is in Panic's second reply, which indirectly states that redirects are discouraged. While I found such a position a bit baffling at first, searching project pages led me to [[Wikibooks:Reading_room/Archives/2006/February#Attention:_Speedy_deletion_of_redirects|this illuminating discussion]] which lends support to it. By now I am inclined to ask for the history merge and forget about the redirect. Even though I will not be completely satisfied with the outcome (link breakage is always nasty, even if it is just on a handful of blogs and mailing list posts as in this case), it does seem to be the saner solution. P.S.: thanks for the clear explanation of history merges Thenub! --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 04:02, 13 April 2012 (UTC)
:::::::: If the link is relevant to the work you can ask the acting admin to preserve it after the history merge (add that to the merge request, ultimately it is up to the admin if it is a valid request). If the redirect is only used by links in talk pages you can ignore that if the post is over 30 days (or you can even fix it it you feel it is important), if it is used in other works or in the work you are merging then it is part of the merge process to fix those or the merge shouldn't be considered complete (because it will indeed break things). Looking into [[Special:WhatLinksHere/Haskell/Class_declarations]] that seems part of the merge process and a issue you will need to address (but for instance the links in this discussion become irrelevant after the task is complete).

{{Outdent|::::::::}} A final idea to deal with my redirect &lt;s&gt;paranoia&lt;/s&gt; worries: would it be acceptable if I &quot;cheated&quot; a little by:
* Asking for the history merge;
* Recreating &quot;Class declarations&quot; afterwards as a redirect; and
* Linking to it from a &quot;meta&quot; page such as [[Haskell/Preserved redirects]], so that in the future admins will know it was retained for some reason?

== Publishing book-writing helper scripts ==

Long ago, the Haskell Wikibook print version used to be generated in a semi-automatic way through a [http://eric.kow.free.fr/download/PrintVersion.hs tiny Haskell script]. I am currently working on improving it; and it would be really convenient to publish new versions of the script here, in a talk page of the book or something of that sort. Sounds great, until you think about licensing - as it is widely known, releasing code under CC licenses or GFDL is a Bad Idea. Is there any reasonable workaround in such a case? (Probably not, I guess, but worth asking anyway.)

P.S.: One thing that might, ''in theory'', solve the problem would be myself being granted uploader rights and then uploading the script as a &quot;public domain&quot; file. In practice, that wouldn't work due to the file extension restrictions, however...

P.P.S.: It would be nice to know of similar situations in the past, if any. Also, please warn me if you feel I am being overzealous... --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 05:33, 17 April 2012 (UTC)

:The problem with the GFDL in software is that it really does not apply well and requires a copy of the license to be included. I do not know of any problem with the CC (and would like to ear your issues with it).&lt;br&gt;
:When you contribute source code to Wikibooks it becomes licensed by the project wide coverage as CCSA30 and GFDL (with limitations, not relevant in this case). You can however state in the code that it is licensed with a less restrictive license like BSD, MIT or even as public domain. The GPL license may be more complex to handle (I haven't really looked into that) but it puts some burden on the use of software that can be seen as contradicting our project licenses (that does no posse any restrictions on use, only attribution and relicensing). IIRC there was (and may still be) some source code on the project that was GPL (I doubt that anyone will use it abusively but if they do they can get into copyright issues with the copyright owners of that code). In any case that is going beyond the point here.
:Solutions are as I indicate, ignore the project's licenses if you use a less restrictive license (or it is public domain, but be sure to state the license/copyright status) or upload it to a service that hosts that type of material and provide a link (sourceforce for instance).
:Uploading locally is an interesting concept but not necessary if it is easier to use one of the previous options, even if it could be interesting for incompatible licenses, for example a license that prevents commercial use. It could probably be explored but I don't think that Wikibooks is the right place to host source code. Feel free to explore that as a proposal if you wish, with good enough reasons I would probably support it.
:To my knowledge (I'm here since 2004) there has never been a discussion around this topic in these terms. I did initiate a similar discussion regarding programming books and the licenses of the source code included. Most code does not have a license indicated even if they are intentioned as public domain, they get license within the project with our licenses, making reuse problematic (especially at the time we only used the GFDL). My view, at times, is that near the copyright attribution of a work it should be clearly stated that if source code does not explicitly state a license it should be considered public domain. Of course this is simply for ease of mind, most code we have (or I have seen) is mostly trivial (but there are exceptions, for example the More C++ Idioms has complex examples and implementations that are explicitly copyrighted), then we have ASM books and Embedded System books that a very small code may be commercial relevant. This type of legal matters is one more thing that I get annoyed by Wikimedia's lack of proper guidelines, because what they provide serves only to legally protect them, not the contributors or the final users.
:In any case this is my general view, I'm not a lawyer. But the solutions above will suffice for your purpose.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 06:05, 17 April 2012 (UTC)

:PPS: Since you are using transclusion in the print version. I note that there is a &quot;silent&quot; limit on the number (don't know if you have reached it, but look at the end of it to see if something is missing). I put this here so others became also aware of that limitation...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 06:23, 17 April 2012 (UTC)

:Frankly, I don't see the issue: of course, you can put things under a less restrictive license or into the public domain; see for example Wikimedia Commons. (And I agree with Panic that this should be stated explicitly; I'm doing it on every page of the GLSL Programming book because I know how annoying programming books are that put their code under a license.) I don't know why you would want to upload the Haskell script as a file and not include it as source code in wikitext? Is the typical Haskell programmer not able to use copy&amp;paste? ;) --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 06:25, 17 April 2012 (UTC)

::The only issue, it seems, was that my understanding of multi-licensing in Wikibooks was a bit broken, but you guys set the record straight (the main point being, if I understood it correctly, that the CCSA30/GFDL condition does not exclude redistribution under other compatible licenses). As for the practice of &quot;hosting&quot; code here, I agree that it is not a good idea in most cases. Still, IMO it makes sense for small, single-purpose tools that would be only of interest for contributors to a particular book (or ''readers'' of a book - fun suggestion indeed, Panic!). And conversely, if that tiny script eventually grows into something more general moving it elsewhere will be the sane thing to do. --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 07:08, 17 April 2012 (UTC)

:::Almost. They do not exclude redistribution under other compatible licenses (if they are indicated). In case of public domain (the copyright is terminated), if you do not indicate it is public domain, because of the &quot;not so smart&quot; move to remove the obligation to add copyright notices it will be presumed as licensed under our license (this may seem unimportant, but in a world that no one speaks for public domain it is important that all public domain has an indication of what it is. As soon as anyone has the only copy of a public domain work they can own the copyright (or if scarce and badly documented they can litigate for control over those that object to the new ownership).

== revocation of editing privileges? ==

I was working on an article.  Since I'm an incremental editor, and since wikibooks is moderated, I placed the page contents in my [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:Gzuufy/sandbox sandbox], so the moderator wouldn't be bothered with my flood of incremental edits. This morning I decided to remove all content from my sandbox, seeing how it was supposed to be temporary.  I received the following message: 
:&quot;''Warning: An automated filter has identified this edit as removing all categories from a page, which is potentially unconstructive. Please be aware that vandalism may result in revocation of your editing privileges. If this edit is constructive, please click &quot;Save page&quot; again, and report this error.''&quot;

For a long time I thought no pages were being reviewed by readers.  Because the page: [[Special:RatedPages]] doesn't show any.  But then it was pointed out to me by QU that the main page has something on the order of 160 reviews in the past month.  So the question becomes why is this not showing up as a rated page, and why is there not Page Rating system claim there is not enough data to graph?

Notice, that the extension we are now using is considered obsolete, and has been replaced by the Article Feedback Extension.

If it is on Wikipedia then why is it a copyright violation to put it in Wikibooks?

:By default, when you upload an image on Wikibooks, it is really uploaded at Wikimedia Commons.

However, they do not allow non-free (i.e., fair use) media at WM Commons, which is why they deleted it (according to the WP page, the USPS holds the copyright).  We ''do'' allow fair use materials at WB (as does WP), but we control access to the upload feature.  You can either request the upload capability at [[WB:RFP]] (but you'll have to demonstrate an understanding of the issues involved), or you can request that the image be uploaded for you.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Remember [[Wikijunior:Introduction_to_Mathematics/Numbers#More,_less,_and_equal|this lesson]] from Introduction to Mathematics? The equal signs displayed there ''&lt;u&gt;is algebra&lt;/u&gt;''. YES, you don't realize it, but you are trained to solve algebraic equations since Kindergarten or 1st grade, if you are lucky! However, sometimes algebra can be hard, especially with multiple variable algebraic equations.

When is algebra hard?&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;{5*8 \over 10} = x+2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
In this example, x is 2. However, this is complicated algebra.

&lt;math&gt;1+1=x+1&lt;/math&gt;
Now, if we want to find out x's value, we must equally subtract or add something to both sides. Let's subtract one from both sides, so now we have... &lt;math&gt;{1+1-1=x+1-1}&lt;/math&gt;, which equals &lt;math&gt;{1=x}&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;br /&gt;
Here, 1 is x, so x equals 1.

=BitTorrent &amp; Bitcoin=

Are engineers responsible for how people utilize their inventions? History is full of cases that can shed light on this question; however, two recent technologies have made it particularly salient. BitTorrent and Bitcoin have very different uses and technical underpinnings; however, both have been condemned for their illegal uses. Neither is inherently bad, but what responsibility falls on the engineer for those who are abusing these technologies?

==BitTorrent==

[[File:The Pirate Bay logo.svg|thumb|right|The Pirate Bay provided links to torrents of copyrighted material.]]
The BitTorrent protocol was created by Bram Cohen in 2001 &lt;ref Name=&quot;TPBtrial&quot; /&gt;. Designed to decentralize information so that data can be distributed more quickly, the protocol breaks each file up into multiple pieces and sends different pieces to each user. The users then share the pieces with each other, reducing the load on the file's original distributor. This technique has been used to solve a number of different engineering problems. Both [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook Facebook] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blizzard Blizzard] have leveraged it to deal with the problems that arise from working on a massive scale. Facebook needs to update thousands of servers all over the world with the latest code, so they use BitTorrent to speed up the process. Similarly, Blizzard uses it to send their game updates to the millions of players who want to download them on the update's release day. 

These cases show the benefits of using Bittorrent in a legal way. However, BitTorrent has become more notorious for its illegal uses, primarily the sharing of copyrighted material. Expanding on the success of previous file sharing solutions [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napster Napster] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kazaa Kazaa], BitTorrent quickly became one of the most popular ways to share copyrighted material on the internet. A recent study found that BitTorrent traffic once accounted for almost 60% of all internet traffic &lt;ref Name=&quot;InfringingContent&quot; /&gt;.    

However, while many people love the ability to quickly download movies, music, and TV shows, some have taken issue with file sharing. In recent years, the movie and music industries have actively lobbied in Congress on issue of copyright infringement. And while BitTorrent does have many legal uses, one study found that of the 1,000 most popular torrent files, only three were non-infringing content &lt;ref Name=&quot;InfringingContent&quot; /&gt;.
   
Much of the controversy over BitTorrent has centered around [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pirate_Bay The Pirate Bay], a Sweden-based BitTorrent search engine. While it does not create the illegal material, The Pirate Bay distributes links to torrents, most of which are of copyrighted content. Still, the website does not take down links to illegal material and flaunts its illegal nature. During the Beijing Olympics, The International Olympic Committee (IOC) asked the Swedish government to prevent clips from being distributed via the Pirate Bay &lt;ref Name=&quot;TPBtrial&quot; /&gt;. In response, not only did the Pirate Bay continue distributing Olympic content, they mockingly changed their logo to “The Beijing Bay” &lt;ref Name=&quot;TPBtrial&quot; /&gt;. In 2009, the case came to a head when they were sued for copyright infringement on a variety of movies, shows, and games &lt;ref Name=&quot;TPBtrial&quot; /&gt;. The founders of Pirate Bay were sentenced to one year in prison and fined 30 million Swedish kronor, which is $4.4 million &lt;ref Name=&quot;TPBtrial&quot; /&gt;. They appealed the decision to the Swedish Supreme Court but were ultimately found guilty in February 2012 &lt;ref Name=&quot;supremecourt&quot; /&gt;. 
     
In contrast to the founders of The Pirate Bay, Bram Cohen never faced legal issues, because his company never distributed links to unlicensed material. In response to a question about copyright issues, he stated
{{Quote|text=It’s completely legal to create technical solutions. The reason people get dragged into legal proceedings is that they break copyright laws, which I have never done.|sign=Bram Cohen&lt;ref Name=&quot;quote&quot; /&gt;}}

==Bitcoin==
[[File:Bitcoin_logo.svg|right]]
Bitcoin, released as [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software open-source software] on January 3, 2009, is a distributed electronic currency designed and developed by Satoshi Nakamoto. Nakamoto is very likely a pseudonym, and his true identity is unknown &lt;ref Name=&quot;Nakamoto&quot; /&gt;. He left the project in 2010; however, even in his absence, Bitcoin has become a real currency that is used for a variety of purposes, both legal and illegal &lt;ref Name=&quot;Nakamoto_IRC&quot; /&gt;.

[[File:total bitcoins over time.png|thumb|right|Expected number of Bitcoins over time.]]
Bitcoin utilizes a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system proof-of-work system] to mathematically ensure the scarcity of the currency. Computers &quot;mine&quot; Bitcoins by solving a series of increasingly hard problems. The first computer to solve the problem sends out a solution, which is exchanged for Bitcoins. This exchange rate varies over time. As more solutions are found, less Bitcoins are granted for each solution. These two constraints cap the total number of Bitcoins that can ever exist at 21 million &lt;ref Name=&quot;ArsTechnica&quot;/&gt;. As of 2012, almost 9 million Bitcoins have been mined &lt;ref Name=&quot;BitcoinCount&quot;/&gt;. The scarcity of Bitcoins stems from the expense of processing power. Not only does mining Bitcoins require powerful computers, those computers consume large amounts of energy. In fact, in Canada, the homes of several people mining Bitcoins were searched because they were consuming so much electricity that the police thought they must have been growing marijuana &lt;ref Name=&quot;CanadaArrests&quot;/&gt;.

The biggest advantage of Bitcoin is that is decentralized; no authority can issue more Bitcoins &lt;ref Name=&quot;ArsTechnica&quot;/&gt;. This makes inflation difficult, because the supply of Bitcoins in the market cannot arbitrarily be increased. This kind of certainty appeals to many people as it removes the control of governments from the currency. Unlike when using a bank, there are no service fees associated with Bitcoin, making it more profitable for businesses. Some brick-and-mortar stores have begun accepting Bitcoins for purchases &lt;ref Name=&quot;TechFortune&quot; /&gt; &lt;ref Name=&quot;BitcoinTravel&quot; /&gt;.

All Bitcoin transactions are inherently public. However, there is no information about why a transaction was made or who the transaction was made between. This anonymity makes Bitcoin the first untraceable electronic currency &lt;ref Name=&quot;Guardian&quot; /&gt;. [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk_Road_(anonymous_marketplace) The Silk Road] is an anonymous marketplace which, much like eBay, allows users to buy and sell basically anything from each other. However, the Silk Road only accepts exchanges in Bitcoin and is hidden behind the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tor_(anonymity_network) Tor] network &lt;ref Name=&quot;UsingTheSilkRoad&quot; /&gt;. This means buyers and sellers can market illegal goods without the fear of being discovered by federal agencies. This has made the site very popular, and has allowed the sale of illegal drugs over the internet &lt;ref Name=&quot;NPR&quot; /&gt;. Even if law enforcement agencies were to make fake postings to lure out buyers, because the transactions are anonymous and untraceable, it would be impossible to know who placed the order, regardless of the address to which it was sent.

In June 2011, senators [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charles_Schumer Charles Schumer] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joe_Manchin Joe Manchin] asked the Drug Enforcement Administration to launch a full-scale investigation into The Silk Road &lt;ref Name=&quot;NPR&quot; /&gt;. Around the same time, [http://gawker.com/5805928/the-underground-website-where-you-can-buy-any-drug-imaginable a Gawker article in 2011] received over 175,000 Facebook likes and further brought attention to this issue, causing the exchange rate of Bitcoin to skyrocket &lt;ref Name=&quot;BitcoinCharts&quot; /&gt;. However, the distributed and antonymous nature of Bitcoin has made it difficult for the government to take any action against The Silk Road. During the summer of 2011, the exchange rate on Bitcoin skyrocketed to $30 per BTC &lt;ref Name=&quot;BitcoinCharts&quot; /&gt;. As of 2012, it has come down to be relatively stable at around $5 per BTC &lt;ref Name=&quot;BitcoinCharts&quot; /&gt;.

==Professionalism and Ethics==
These two cases expose a core question in engineering ethics: are professional engineers responsible for what others do with their inventions? In the case of both BitTorrent and Bitcoin, the law comes down fairly clearly. Bram Cohen, the creator of BitTorrent, continues to run his company completely legally in the United States. He has never been accused of copyright infringement, and probably will never be. Cohen's company simply provides the BitTorrent technology and assists other companies in implementing it to legally solve engineering problems. On the other hand, the creators of The Pirate Bay received prison sentences and a massive fine from the Swedish government. The Pirate Bay crossed a legal line when they encouraged users to pirate copyrighted content by knowingly allowing them to post these illegal torrents. As we saw with the footage of the Beijing Olympics, even when asked to remove this content, they refused. 

Similarly to Cohen, Nakamoto would likely not face legal action, even if his identity were known. However, the US government has publicly condemned The Silk Road, and, were it possible to do so, would certainly bring legal action against both its creators and users. Here we see the same legal line. Creating, mining, and transferring Bitcoin is thus far legal; however, knowingly allowing users to sell illegal goods with Bitcoin is a crime. However, the law is not the only guide for ethics, and it may sometimes be necessary to take a stronger stance than law requires.

It is difficult to fully condemn Cohen or Nakamoto, as they did not directly do any harm. These two cases also have a high amount of gray area; many would argue that neither piracy nor recreational drug use should be illegal. However, technology is very multipurpose and it would benefit engineers to consider in advance how their creations will be used. Ultimately, our guiding question, are professional engineers responsible for what others do with their inventions, is a personal one and must be answered individually. Hopefully these two cases can provide a starting point for that introspection.

== '''Choose a “Fruit of the Spirit” from Galatians 5:22-23''' ==


The fruits are:  love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, faithfulness, gentleness and self-control. N.I.V.

You might use this Objective Lesson to show the difference between a good fruit and a bad fruit [http://www.kidssundayschool.com/Gradeschool/Objects/1object04.php Known By Our Fruits]

==== KNOWN BY OUR FRUITS ====

What would you rather eat a rotten banana or one that is nice and ripe?

''Materials:'' 

* One rotten banana 
* One good banana

''What you will do during class:''

You will show the children the bad banana first and get their reaction. Then you will display the good banana and get a different reaction. This Object Talk will help the children know the difference between producing good fruit and bad fruit in their daily walk with Christ.

''What you will say:'' 

As you show everyone the bad rotten banana ask, &quot;Who would like to eat this banana? Why would you choose not to eat it? How can you tell this banana will not taste very good?&quot; Then show everyone the good banana and ask, &quot;Now who would like to eat this banana? Why would you choose to eat it? How can you tell this banana will taste good? Our lives are like one of these two pieces of fruit. People will know who we are by the type of fruit we produce. Matthew 7:20 say 'Thus by their fruit you will recognize them'. What kind of fruit do you want to produce? Will the fruit of your life be good, like this good banana, or not so good, like this rotten banana?&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Pythagorean.svg|400px|right]]
The '''Pythagorean theorem''' is the theory that the sum of the square areas of sides A and B add up to the hypotenuse, or C's square area. It's formula is described as:&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;a^2 + b^2 = c^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
There are many reasons to prove this correct; you may find them on [[wikipedia:Pythagorean_theorem|Wikipedia]]. However, there is more than just this equation, called the ''Pythagorean equation''.

== Pythagorean triples ==
Pythagorean triples are three sets of positive whole numbers that can make a perfect triangle.

Take the image on the right. Pretend (A) is 3 and (B) is 4. What is (C)? (Hint: C is the hypotenuse; the longest side on the picture.) Use the Pythagorean equation to figure it out! (Click on the reference link to see the answer!)&lt;ref name=&quot;PythTriple3-4-5&quot;&gt;Please highlight to your right: &lt;span style=&quot;color:white;&quot;&gt;(C) is 5.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Now, let's try the Pythagorean equation backwards! Now, (B) is 12 and (C) is 13. Please figure out (A).&lt;ref name=&quot;PythTriple5-12-13&quot;&gt;Please highlight to your right: &lt;span style=&quot;color:white;&quot;&gt;(A) is 5. AGAIN?! Oh man, this is cheap! (Actually, no it's not.)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">SPM has a DICOM conversion utility that works with many different variations of the DICOM format. It is accessible via the button &quot;DICOM Import&quot; that will redirect you to the batch interface:
 SPM -&gt; Util -&gt; DICOM Import
You will then have access to a number of options such as the choice of single file ('.nii') or dual files ('.img/.hdr') NIfTI output format.

If you encounter problems with your DICOM data, please email the [http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm/support/ SPM mailing list] with details about your scanner and acquisition settings (an example of a DICOM file might be useful). This will contribute to make the DICOM conversion utility even more robust.

==Other software==

If you have problems with SPM's DICOM Import, popular alternatives include:

At the bottom of the webpage for [http://www.mccauslandcenter.sc.edu/mricro/mricron/dcm2nii.html dcm2nii] there is a longer list of alternative DICOM conversion tools.

&lt;!-- Categories and interwikis go at the bottom of this page. --&gt;

=== Usage ===
*1st parameter is the Mongolian (Todo, Manchu, Sibe) text to display
*2nd parameter is optional; if it is 'h' then the text is laid out horizontally; if it is any other value (e.g. 'v'), or if it is omitted then the text is laid out vertically (if the browser supports vertical layout)

=== Examples ===
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{MongolUnicode|ᠮᠣᠩᠭᠣᠯ ᠪᠢᠴᠢᠭ}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; produces: {{MongolUnicode|ᠮᠣᠩᠭᠣᠯ ᠪᠢᠴᠢᠭ}}
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{MongolUnicode|ᠮᠣᠩᠭᠣᠯ ᠪᠢᠴᠢᠭ|v}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; produces: {{MongolUnicode|ᠮᠣᠩᠭᠣᠯ ᠪᠢᠴᠢᠭ|v}}
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{MongolUnicode|ᠮᠣᠩᠭᠣᠯ ᠪᠢᠴᠢᠭ|h}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; produces: {{MongolUnicode|ᠮᠣᠩᠭᠣᠯ ᠪᠢᠴᠢᠭ|h}}
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{MongolUnicode|ᠮᠣᠩᠭᠣᠯ&lt;br/&gt;ᠪᠢᠴᠢᠭ|v}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; produces: {{MongolUnicode|ᠮᠣᠩᠭᠣᠯ&lt;br/&gt;ᠪᠢᠴᠢᠭ|v}}

=== Issues ===
Currently only IE8 and above and Chrome version 17 and later support rendering the text in top-to-bottom, left-to-right format. The browsers Firefox, Opera and Safari will render the text as left-to-right, top-to-bottom. See also
* http://dev.w3.org/csswg/css3-writing-modes/
* https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=145503

For Webkit and Firefox nightlies, it seems &lt;pre&gt;-webkit-writing-mode:vertical-lr;-moz-writing-mode:vertical-lr;&lt;/pre&gt; works, but there are so many rendering issues, that they are probably better off not being enabled yet.

For MediaWiki issues regarding this: [[bugzilla:9436]]

==== Non-Font ====
When Daicing font set to be the EUDC, 
* ZERO WIDTH JOINER at the head-place does not work. 
* NIRUGU does not work.t
* NARROW NO-BREAK SPACE deos not work.

==== Font issues ====
:* &lt;tt&gt;MB&lt;/tt&gt;=Founder's &lt;tt&gt;Mongolian Baiti&lt;/tt&gt;, is a font for Hudum, Todo, Manchu and Sibe;
:* &lt;tt&gt;MU&lt;/tt&gt;=Monotype Drawing Office's &lt;tt&gt;Mongol Usug&lt;/tt&gt;, is a font for Hudum and Todo;
:* &lt;tt&gt;MS&lt;/tt&gt;=Myatav Erdenechimeg's &lt;tt&gt;MongolianScript&lt;/tt&gt;, is a font for Hudum only;
:* &lt;tt&gt;DW&lt;/tt&gt;=&lt;tt&gt;Daicing White&lt;/tt&gt;, is a font for Manchu, Sibe and Daur.
# &lt;tt&gt;MB&lt;/tt&gt; 5.00 does not match Unicode Standard, please upgrade it to &lt;tt&gt;MB&lt;/tt&gt; 5.01 (KB929763);
# Under certain situations {{MongolUnicode|‍ᠶ‍}} is incorrectly rendered as {{MongolUnicode|‍ᠢ‍}}&lt;!--Middle form--&gt; or {{MongolUnicode|ᠵ‍}}&lt;!--Head form--&gt; in &lt;tt&gt;MB&lt;/tt&gt; 5.01 and &lt;tt&gt;MU&lt;/tt&gt; 2.37;
# {{MongolUnicode|ᡓ‍}} is incorrectly rendered as {{MongolUnicode|ᠴ‍}} in &lt;tt&gt;MU&lt;/tt&gt; 2.37;
# &lt;tt&gt;MB&lt;/tt&gt; 5.01 does not render {{MongolUnicode|ᡯᡳ}} correctly (we may use {{MongolUnicode|ᡯᡳ᠌}} instead in &lt;tt&gt;MB&lt;/tt&gt;).

When thinking about computers in health care, the first things that come to mind are usually the positive benefits of electronic patient charts and speedy prescription delivery. But there are some disadvantages to being around computers all day. Repetitive stress injuries are injuries in which hand, wrist, shoulder, or neck pain is caused by performing the same physical movements over and over again. So by using the computers keyboard at the inappropriate angle or using the wrong technique will cause RSI’s or carpal tunnel syndrome. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a painful and crippling condition affecting the hands and wrists. A computer users eyes can also be affected and they could develop something called computer vision syndrome. Some common symptoms of CVS are eyestrain or fatigue, dry eyes, burning eyes, light sensitivity, blurred vision, headaches, and pain in the shoulders neck and back. All of these problems can be alleviated by the correct use of ergonomics. Ergonomics is the science of fitting a work environment to the people who work there. For instance, to prevent RSI’s, the computer user should make sure the computer and wrists are held at the right angle to prevent injuries. They should also take breaks from working on the computer and do wrist, hand, neck and back exercises. CVS injuries can be prevented by taking frequent breaks form looking at a computer screen.  
{{BookCat}}&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;Computers in a medical field area such as Nursing, is now a much needed device. Most hospitals are up and running off of computers that help nurses and doctors enter patient history. Because there is such a need, there are now requirements that have been set forth by OSHA to protect medical staff. The irony of working in a hospital, is that the staff may also be the patient. In such cases where this may occur do to a computer related injury for example are carpal tunnel syndrome and back issues. Standards have been put into place to ease into proper usage of computer based hardware. OSHA requires that all medical staff have training for usage of hardware such as computers that will fit in the field with proper body alignment. OSHA has a software based training option that will teach medical staff for proper ergonomics. OSHA also has specific rights for an employee. According to The Online Journal of Nursing Informatics &lt;ref name=&quot;test&quot;&gt;[http://ojni.org/12_3/elkind.pdf], Online Journal of Nursing Informatics.&lt;/ref&gt;, the following rights were created specifically for nurses and medical staff.&lt;br /&gt;

1) the right number of computers &lt;br /&gt; 
2) available at the right locations &lt;br /&gt;
3) viewable at the right height &lt;br /&gt;
4) with the right size monitor &lt;br /&gt;
5) set to the right resolution &lt;br /&gt;

If you're wondering what horizon A is, here's your answer: horizon A refers to the upper layer of soil, nearest the surface. It is commonly known as topsoil. In the woods or other areas that have not been plowed or tilled, this layer would probably include organic litter, such as fallen leaves and twigs . The litter helps prevent erosion, holds moisture, and decays to form a very rich soil known as humus. Horizon A provides plants with nutrients they need for a great life.

The layer below horizon A, of course, has to be horizon B. Litter is not present in horizon B and therefore there is much less humus. Horizon B does contain some elements from horizon A because of the process of leaching. Leaching resembles what happens in a coffee pot as the water drips through the coffee grounds. Leaching may also bring some minerals from horizon B down to horizon C.

If horizon B is below horizon A, then horizon C must be below horizon B. Horizon C consists mostly of weatherized big rocks. This solid rock, as you discovered in Soil Formation, gave rise to the horizons above it.

Soil profiles look different in different areas of the world. They are affected by climate and other things. Click here to see three different soil profiles.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Anonymous Sources and the Public Sphere==

The media is essential to the public sphere, informing people who cannot remain constantly active in discussion. Journalism acts as a watchdog force to help the people regulate the government and any other force that threatens the well-being of the whole. Journalists are often the subject of scrutiny from the public, and the pressure to tell the truth weighs heavily on their shoulders. Burdened with this truth, members of the press often fight to release truth and take all necessary measures to uncover it. Occasionally, a journalist will receive information or a tip from a source that wants to remain anonymous. Approached with this dilemma, there are many steps that can be taken to ensure that the information is truthful and still serve the public sphere properly without deception. While some argue that the use of anonymous sources is detrimental to the public sphere, they ignore the benefits and how, when conducted in a proper manner, anonymous sources have proved to be worth the secrecy. 

===Anonymity Allowed===
[[File:Associated Press logo 2012.svg|thumb|Associated Press logo 2012]] Anonymity, when granted, is not granted without careful deliberation. Sources that remained anonymous are reviewed by not only the writer, but also multiple editors within the publication. The Associated Press Style Book, which all major news sources follow and adhere to, dedicates an entire [page length] to the use of anonymous sources. “Use anonymous sources on when essential and even then provide the most specific identification of the source”&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press. Associated Press Style Book. 2004 and 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; (AP Style book 2004). With the increasing development of web sources and online news outlets, AP amended the entry on anonymous sources in 2009, elimitolnating evident loop holes. The new guideline specifies that the source must go through the approval of the news manager, must provide fact not opinion, be reliable and in a position to give accurate information and finally the information is only available through that source. Journalists also have the obligation to look deeply at the sources motives for revealing information and why they are so adamant about remaining anonymous. These changes mirror the shift mood in society, where people want to know where their news is coming from and have become more skeptical of those who wish to remain anonymous.

The benefits of remaining anonymous are wide spread, benefiting both the public and the source. In terms of the source, anonymity allows them to say what is necessary without fear of admonishment or penalty. This is often the case when a government employee steps forward to reveal a scandal or a terrible thing that is happening behind closed doors. Whistle-blowers, like Deep Throat in the Watergate Scandal, are rare and should be valued for their courage to approach the media with such vital information.  Other sources conceal their identities for fear of retaliation from their employers or the people they revealed stuff about.

===Reason to Remain Anonymous===
Clark Hoyt, a public editor (or ombudsman) for the New York Times, offered some comments on how a reporter used an anonymous source in providing a character reference for a suspected killer. ”Washington… is a city steeped in the culture of anonymity”&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt, Clark. “No Comment. But You Didn’t Hear it from Me”  New York Times. 28 Mar 2009. www.nytimes.com. 25 April 2013. http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/29/opinion/29pubed.html?ref=anonymoussources&amp;_r=0&lt;/ref&gt;. Hoyt describes how official spokesmen have asked to be on background or off the record to add information but will formally be presented on that they had no comment.  He offers an insight to why employees or government officials will ask to be off the record:[[File:The New York Times.svg|thumb|The New York Times]]
* All glory is supposed to go to the boss
* They disagree with the boss and are afraid of getting fired; they are talking about classified information and could be prosecuted
* They want to promote a policy, or kill it, by getting it out before it is officially announced
* They believe the public has a right to know about something that is being suppressed.
These are the reasons why anonymous sources should remain anonymous, when they are serving a positive purpose to the public. The Society of Professional Journalist has a widely published and used ethics code. Similar to the AP Style book, it is a source of reference in all types of news outlets. While not mandated, it is the ethics code that is most commonly followed. The code leads with the title Seek Truth and Report it, the overarching role of journalism in the public sphere is also encompassed in this simple title.  In regards to anonymity, the code states “Identify sources whenever feasible. The public is entitled to as much information as possible on a sources’ reliability.”&lt;ref&gt;Society of Professional Journalist. SPJ Code of Ethics. 1996. http://www.spj.org/ethicscode.asp?mobile=no&lt;/ref&gt;  The news industry was built to expose truths and keep the public informed and involved in the public sphere. SPJ upholds these values to this day, instilling the accountability in being a journalist. SPJ also encourages the deeper search into what prompted the request for anonymity; “Always question sources’ motives before promising anonymity. Clarify conditions attached to any promise made in exchange for information. Keep promises.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Society of Professional Journalist. SPJ Code of Ethics. 1996. http://www.spj.org/ethicscode.asp?mobile=no&lt;/ref&gt; This boils down to knowing before the interview that the source wants to remain anonymous and to delve into the background of the source, eliminating any who could personal vendettas against a company or person. This responsibility is solely on the shoulders of the journalist and their editors, if they unknowingly release falsified information to the public there are repercussions.

===Anonymous Submissions===
In newspapers and website, there are often published anonymous submissions and questions. While the internet is free-ranging and often almost anyone can publish things to an open forum blog, the newspapers hold the responsibility for what they send to the presses. An example in a smaller scaled public sphere is The Breeze at JMU. The Darts and Pats portion of the paper are comments submitted by anybody through an anonymous message. Through this, students have bravely voiced their opinions about anything on campus. Often these Darts and Pats are the talk of the school, while the sources remain securely anonymous. The difference between the publishing online and in the paper is the rigorous editing process that comments go through to filter out inappropriate or highly inflammatory submission. The internet often has no specific filter to prevent those types of messages. Also the quality of the postings weigh on the newspaper (or any other media that allows this type of publishing), forming a type of accountability for the release of statement.
Anonymous Source is a website dedicated to “examining the merits of unnamed sourcing in journalism and anonymity in public discourse.”&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, Matt J.  Anonymous Sources. http://www.anonymoussources.org/?p=37&lt;/ref&gt; Author and creator, Matt Duffy, runs the blog to actively discuss the use and misuse of unnamed sources in journalism.  He reviews the effect of keeping sources anonymous. Blogger Glenn Greenwald wrote “Unjustified anonymity — especially when mindlessly repeating what shielded government sources claim in secret — is the single greatest enabler of false and deceitful ‘reporting.’”&lt;ref&gt;Greenwald, Glenn. “The fundamental unreliability of America’s media: the proliferation of anonymity ensures pervasive falsehoods.” Salon. 12, Jan. 2010. http://www.salon.com/2010/01/12/media_254/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism on Anonymity===
Anonymous source, while not having to worry about the retaliation of bosses or peers, also do not have to take responsibility for their words. In the blog sphere, comments on news stories or candidates are not monitored; therefore someone could go about [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Troll_(Internet) trolling] various stories or sites, instigating arguments and harming feelings while experiencing none of the repercussions associated with announcing it in public. This type of anonymity is more detrimental than that which is regulated through writers and editors who have an obligation to report misdoings in the government and other public sectors that contribute to the public sphere.
The journalist obligation often gets twisted when news sources prescribe to a specific partisan group, as many news sources are accused of doing now. The lack of bias in the news makes the use of anonymous source even more perilous. The sources could be used to push a political agenda without attributing the actions or words to a specific person. The viewer/reader does not have the verification that this was said by a trusted official or if it was simply manipulated to forward debates in a particular topic. If there is no objective sense of journalism presenting the truth to the public, than anonymous sources are just a piece of the deception.

There are times in this country’s history when anonymous sources have burst the bubble and opened America’s eyes to terrible things happening in our society. Not all the sources have amounted to this type of servitude to the public, most have hinder the public in ways that have caused several news organizations to ban the use of unnamed sources from their publications. “Major news organizations--including USA Today, the New York Times and the Washington Post--have tightened their anonymous sources policies.”&lt;ref&gt;Shepard, Alicia C. “Anonymous Sources” American Journalism Review (1994). ajr.org. Web. 25. Apr. 2013. http://www.ajr.org/Article.asp?id=1596.&lt;/ref&gt; Cases where journalist have used anonymous sources and refuse to break the confidentiality agreement have been fined or jailed.

===Conclusion===
The public sphere uses journalism as a watchdog for the government and other harmful corporations.  While people grow skeptical about it’s ability to present fact equally and without bias, they still rely on the media to present them with the discussion topics and the news daily. Being the watchdog does not come easy, especially when there is limited access to information and sources. While people often fear what can’t be verified and what is not known, the use of anonymous sources often open’s the public’s eyes about problems that are happening right under their noses. Anonymity can breed negative things, like trolling and the ability to lie without consequence.  Farhad Manjooo talks about truth and how it is a relative matter in the modern era. People see anonymity as untrustworthy and secretive, but it can be helpful and the only way to discover the truth under a mountain of government deceit. However, with proper vetting and researching, journalist can provide valuable

==Rupert Murdoch==

Transparency in an open government is often credited with generating government accountability.  In a democracy, transparency allows citizens to control their government, reducing government corruption and bribery.  However, when transparency and accountability are placed in powerful hands, a society can become astray.  In Rupert Murdoch’s case, too much power with little accountability led to illegal telephone hacking that exposed the private lives of citizens, soldiers, celebrities, and the Royal Family.  In our world of advanced media technology, how much is too much information?  How can our [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_sphere public sphere] continue to influence political action with unethical probes from media conglomerates?  As Murdoch recently demonstrated, and continues to illustrate, too much power in one hand can cause massive disturbances in the public sphere.

===Murdoch and News Corporation===

[[File:Rupert Murdoch - World Economic Forum Annual Meeting Davos 2009.jpg|thumb|Rupert Murdoch - World Economic Forum Annual Meeting Davos 2009]]Rupert Murdoch was born in Australia in 1931.  After years of owning newspapers and one music label in Australia, Murdoch turned his sights to Britain.  After acquiring ''News of the World'' in 1968 he also bought the failing newspaper ''The Sun''.  Moving to the United States in 1979, Murdoch created and launched News Corporation.  In 1981, he bought the struggling ''Times'' and ''Sunday Times'' from a Canadian newspaper publisher &lt;ref name=&quot;The Week&quot;/&gt;.  On September 4 1985, Murdoch became a naturalized citizen to satisfy the legal requirement that only United States citizens could own American television stations.  In 1986, the Fox Broadcasting Station was launched, and venturing into new publishing technologies, Murdoch bought Twentieth Century Fox, Harper Collins in 1989, and ''The Wall Street Journal'' in 2007 &lt;ref name=&quot;The Week&quot;/&gt;.  Now as an 81-year-old, Murdoch owns the second largest media conglomerate, News Corporation.  By 2000, Murdoch’s News Corporation owned over 800 companies in more than 50 countries with a net worth of over five billion dollars &lt;ref name=&quot;News Corp&quot;&gt;&quot;News Corporation.&quot; . Wikipedia, 02 May 2012. Web. 28 April 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;.


As one of the most powerful and influential media companies in the world, News Corporation has the responsibility to abide by the rules of ethics and to be as fair and balanced with their information as possible.  NewsCorp produces books, cable programming, films, magazines, newspapers, television, websites, and sporting events &lt;ref name=&quot;News Corp&quot;/&gt;.  NewsCorp affects the entire media world and because of this influence, accountability for illegal actions is crucial in a company as powerful as NewsCorp.  One of the first purchases Murdoch made was ''News of the World'', and NewsCorp continued to own and run the newspaper in Britain for more than 30 years until its last publication in 2011 &lt;ref name=&quot;News Corp&quot;/&gt;.  ''News of the World'', once a credible newspaper, was turned into a tabloid newspaper once controlled by NewsCorp &lt;ref name=&quot;News of the World&quot;&gt;&quot;News of the world.&quot; . Wikipedia, 2012. Web. 29 April 2012. &lt;/ref&gt; .  Most of the newspaper consists of minimal writing, with large images that aim to capture celebrity and political scandals.  This aggressive journalism, along with the goal to expose shocking stories first, led to the demise and legal troubles of the historic newspaper.

===Political Influence of News Corporation===

[[File:Rupert Murdoch apology letter.jpg|thumb|Rupert Murdoch's apology letter to victims of the ''News of the World'''s hacking scandal]]

Murdoch built his media empire on newspapers and now one, with increasing evidence against ''News of the World'', could lead to his eternal downfall.  With a scandal as complicated as phone hacking, and a company as large as NewsCorp, new doors of corruption are being opened as soon as one has been shut.  The developing scandal is quite entertaining, but to fully understand the impact of this treachery, one must dive deeper into the affect it has had on our world politics and police control.  Only then, when we see the full extent of NewsCorp’s influence, will we understand how dangerous powerful media can be to our everyday lives.  

At the beginning of the year 2003, Andrew Coulson became the editor of ''News of the World'' &lt;ref name=&quot;Brooks&quot;&gt;Walters, Simon. &quot;Rebekah vetoed BBC man and told Cameron he should give No10 job to Andy Coulson .&quot; Mail Online. (2011): n. page. Web. 29 April. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; .  Two years later, in November of 2005, a story was published regarding confidential information about Prince William and due to the personal nature of the story, the Royal Family launched a police investigation of ''News of the World'', and the illegal tactics they had used to retrieve the information.  In 2007, Glenn Mulcaire, a private investigator for ''News of the World'' and Clive Goodman, the royal-family editor at ''News of the World'' are jailed for four and six months on counts of phone-hacking &lt;ref name=&quot;Brooks&quot;/&gt;.  Later, Coulson resigns as editor, claiming full responsibility for the hacking, but denying any knowledge of it.  A few months later, Coulson is hired as communications director for the Conservative Party and its leader, David Cameron &lt;ref name=&quot;Brooks&quot;/&gt;.  

The hiring of Coulson to Cameron’s campaign was no coincidence.  Rebekah Brooks, former boss of News International and subsidiary of News Corporation, highly recommended Coulson for the job because he was “acceptable” to News International &lt;ref name=&quot;The Week&quot;/&gt;.  Although Cameron was leaning toward BBC senior journalist Guto Harri as his media director, Brooks ultimately helped make the decision to hire Coulson &lt;ref name=&quot;Brooks&quot;/&gt;.  Brooks said, “If you find something for Andy we will return the favour.”  In 2009, after continuing investigations into the phone hacking scandal, and Coulson still on the chopping block, News Corporation’s ''The Sun'' and ''News of the World'' abandoned support for Gordon Brown and switched to David Cameron &lt;ref name=&quot;Brooks&quot;/&gt;.  

Many people questioned the sudden move from Brown to Cameron.  Were political party leaders being swayed to hire individuals for support from the top media conglomerates?  Coulson, although he was arrested in April of 2012 for phone hacking, was Cameron’s media director for more than three years.  After his arrest, it was found that News International was paying Coulson while he was part of the Cameron campaign.  The interference and persuasion of media moguls in the political sphere is dangerous.  Powerful individuals are only looking to benefit themselves and their companies, not the countries needs.

===Police Corruption and Operation Weeting===
Although the political persuasion seems corrupt enough, during the investigations of the phone hacking scandal, it was found that ''News of the World'' was paying off and bribing police officers to silence investigations of phone and computer hacking while also using corrupt police officers to gain private information for articles &lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;&gt;Staff and Agencies, . &quot;Phone-hacking scandal: arrest timeline.&quot; Guardian. N.p., 2012.	Web. 29 April 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;.  Operation Weeting was launched through the Metropolitan Police Service regarding the accusations of phone hacking, and the operation is being conducted alongside Operation Elveden &lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt;.  The operation is an investigation into allegations of inappropriate payments to the police by those involved with phone hacking.  With 90 police officers involved with Operation Weeting, it was found that around 3,000 people had their phones hacked &lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;/&gt;.  During the investigations, documentation provided to Operation Weeting suggested that some police personnel might have accepted &quot;inappropriate payments&quot; from news organizations in return for classified information.  In total, as of March 13, 2012, a total of 23 people have been arrested as part of Operation Weeting &lt;ref name=&quot;The Week&quot;&gt;&quot;Rupert Murdoch's phone hacking scandal: A timeline.&quot; The Week. (2012): 1-3. Web.	April. 2012. &lt;/ref&gt;.  

The investigation continues today, with Rupert Murdoch, James Murdoch (his son), and Rebekah Brooks as main targets of the investigation.  In July of 2011, amidst the phone hacking scandal, Murdoch announced that ''News of the World'' would end its 128 yearlong publication &lt;ref name=&quot;The Week&quot;/&gt;.  Although many found this change positive for Britain, less than a year later, Murdoch announced he was creating ''The Sun on Sunday'', widely seen as the successor of ''News of the World''.

===News Corporation and the Public Sphere===
Everyday there are new updates on the controversy and Murdoch continues to be the center of attention in media news.  Although the focus is centered on British media, News Corporation owns many influential outlets in America.  One of the most prominent and conservative is Fox News.  Before we believe everything we hear in the news, we need to check the sources and the power and money behind those sources.  Rupert Murdoch is at the top of the food chain and by getting an inside look at the inner workings of his companies, we can begin to identify his agendas as a top media mogul.  

The public sphere is affected by the media, and it is our job as educated and enlightened citizens to control what our government and media does.  How much longer will we stand by while media conglomerates sway our politics for their own personal agendas?  How have we allowed one corporation to gain so much power over our media, and consequently gain power over our everyday lives?

==Whistleblowers==
An increased discussion of government transparency in recent years has led to the creation of various laws and agencies seeking to decrease abuse of power and increase honesty about political action. These laws and agencies serve to protect individuals who seek to bring to light misinformation, scandals, or cover-ups. These individuals, referred to as “whistleblowers,” are typically members of organizations, corporations, or governments which the individual in question sees as guilty of some crime or wrongdoing. In a functioning democracy, it is necessary for citizens to be able to report these wrongdoings without fear of undue retribution. However, though whistleblowing is protected under United States law, the actions of these alarmists are rarely without consequence. The United States Office of Special Counsel (OSC), which serves to protect the rights of whistleblowers who speak out specifically against certain members or bureaus of the government, has been involved in multiple investigations and scandals. This has led to a decreased ability of the OSC to protect American citizens and an increased amount of wrongly punished civil servants. 

===Protection under U.S. Law===
In 1989, the US government passed the Whistleblower Protection Act, seeking to protect workers of federal agencies who decide to expose misconduct. If any employee discloses evidence of “a violation of a law, rule or regulation; gross mismanagement; gross waste of funds; an abuse of authority; or a substantial and specific danger to public health or safety,” the federal agency employing them is unable to threaten them with termination of employment, wage garnishment, or other penalties&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sec.gov/eeoinfo/ whistleblowers.htm&lt;/ref&gt;.  This process is overseen by the Office of Special Counsel (OSC), which was formed in 1979 as an independent agency responsible for investigating and prosecuting federal misconduct.  The OSC serves to uphold three other statutes as well as the Whistleblower Protection Act, which include the Civil Service Reform Act, the Hatch Act, and the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act. The Hatch Act, specifically, serves to prevent civil servants from engaging in partisan political activity. The Whistleblower Protection Act, therefore, is often intertwined in cases regarding the Hatch Act, as many cases of whistleblowing concern partisan activity.

===Scott Bloch Controversy===
[[File:Scott-Bloch.jpg|frame|right|Scott J. Bloch, former United States Special Counsel]]
Scott J. Bloch was appointed as United States Special Counsel (overseeing the OSC) by George W. Bush in late 2003. However, his term as U.S. Special Counsel was marred by multiple acts of wrongdoing, partially involving the silencing of the very act of whistleblowing which he was supposed to protect. 
	In one of his first motions as U. S. Special Counsel, Bloch ordered the removal of all mentions of sexual orientation nondiscrimination from all OSC materials, claiming the OSC had no authority to ban this type of discrimination&lt;ref&gt;Chibbaro Jr., Lou. &quot;Gay federal workers fear for jobs.&quot; New York Blade 20 Feb. 2004: 22. EDS Foundation Index. Web. 29 Apr. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Bloch’s reputation as anti-gay was deepened when gay whistleblower Michael Levine’s case against a coworker at the U.S. Forest Service was dropped without investigation. Levine reported his case to the OSC after he had been falsely accused of possessing child pornography and was suspended for fourteen days. According to Levine, this retaliation was caused by his whistleblowing when he reported a coworker for running a sporting goods business from the government property where they worked&lt;ref&gt;Kuhr, Fred. &quot;A Blind Eye To Discrimination.&quot; Advocate (Los Angeles, Calif.) (2005): 32-33. OmniFile Full Text Mega (H.W. Wilson). Web. 29 Apr. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;.  Levine, expecting the OSC to  protect his right to expose government abuse under the Whistleblower Protection Act of 1989, was shocked to see his case dismissed after a year of inaction by the OSC. 
The media and Congress officials, most notably Congressmen Barney Frank and Tammy Baldwin, were quick to draw a connection between the dismissal of Levine’s case and Bloch’s preceding elimination of anti-discrimination rules applying to homosexual employees &lt;ref&gt;Kuhr, Fred. &quot;A Blind Eye To Discrimination.&quot; Advocate (Los Angeles, Calif.) (2005): 32-33. OmniFile Full Text Mega (H.W. Wilson). Web. 29 Apr. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;. However, the major complaint against Bloch was that his obvious agenda destroyed the non-partisan nature of the OSC, making it difficult (or, in Levine’s case, impossible) for workers to blow the whistle on their supervisors or fellow employees.

===Whistleblowing within Corporations===
The Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 is somewhat of a corporation version of the 1989 Whistleblower Protection Act. Under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, also known as SOX, sought to decrease scandals and abuses of power within corporations. The act was triggered by the Enron scandal, which involved systematic fraud and intense corporate corruption&lt;ref&gt;Lucci, John Paul. &quot;Enron-The Bankruptcy Heard Around The World And The International Ricochet Of Sarbanes-Oxley.&quot; Albany Law Review 67.1 (2003): 211-249. Academic Search Complete. Web. 1 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;.  
Interestingly, SOX Section 1107 specifically lists criminal penalties for those who are found to obstruct the act of whistleblowing within a corporation. Specifically, any individual who “knowingly, with the intent to retaliate, takes any action harmful to any person, including interference with the lawful employment or livelihood of any person, for providing to a law enforcement officer any truthful information relating to the commission or possible commission of any federal offense, shall be fined under this title, imprisoned not more than 10 years, or both.” In other words, no corporation is allowed to retaliate against an employee who rightfully reports abuses, scandals, or violations of federal law within a corporation. Naturally, many corporations spoke out against the SOX, claiming that the implementation of a government channel for reporting abuse would unfairly increase the volume of whistleblowing. This, of course, would have the potential to increase the volume of government prosecutions of corporations&lt;ref&gt;HOFMANN, MARK A. &quot;Whistle-Blower Rewards Add To Corporate Woes.&quot; Business Insurance 45.25 (2011): 6-20. Business Source Complete. Web. 1 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;. 
Though there was initially backlash from many major corporations about the implementation of this whistleblower protection law, it has already become a valuable addition to America’s corporate landscape. In 2011, Bank of America was found to have violated Section 1107 of SOX when an employee who reported abuse was fired&lt;ref&gt;&quot;Osha Says Bofa Broke Whistleblower Law.&quot; Pratt's Bank Law &amp; Regulatory Report 17.10 (2011): 14-15. Business Source Complete. Web. 1 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;.  The employee was terminated from her position at Countrywide Financial Corporation (part of Bank of America) after reporting wire, mail, and bank fraud to the employee relations department&lt;ref&gt;15&lt;/ref&gt;.  The case was taken up by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which deals with violations of SOX provisions. The employee was reimbursed for “back wages, interest, compensatory damages, and attorney fees”&lt;ref&gt;14&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Importance of Whistleblowing in the Public Sphere===
In a time of large governments and even larger corporations, it becomes difficult (if not impossible) to examine and analyze the motives and actions of all powerful individuals. Therefore, it is absolutely crucial that individuals within powerful entities have the ability to report on abuses of power without fear of retribution. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) has consistently backed laws like the Whistleblower Protection Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, noting the importance of transparency in any society striving for democracy. According to ACLU Senior Counsel for Legislative Strategy Lisa Graves, “transparency is vital to American democracy, and whistle-blowers are those brave federal employees who bring hidden truths to light.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;&quot;ACLU Backs Bill To Protect Whistleblowers.&quot; UPI Security &amp; Terrorism (2006): Newspaper Source Plus. Web. 1 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 
	However, there are obvious issues with the protection of whistleblowers in the current United States system. As demonstrated by the Scott Bloch controversy over the Michael Levine case, not even the government office responsible for overseeing whistleblowing claims is without corruption. In fact, Scott Bloch was repeatedly called to resign by various members of Congress after individuals working under him at the OSC became whistleblowers. A group of employees claimed Bloch acted in a hostile fashion toward them after they disagreed with his use of government power to promote an extreme religious agenda (which included Bloch’s removal of anti-sexual orientation discrimination mentions within OSC documents, as mentioned earlier)&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, ELizabeth. &quot;Special Counsel Accused Of Intimidation in Probe.&quot; Washington Post, The n.d.: Newspaper Source Plus. Web. 1 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;.  If the body responsible for protecting whistleblowers actively silences would-be whistleblowers within its own ranks, how can it be trusted to handle complaints from other government entities?
	Reform is slow and necessary within the protection of whistleblowers. The Whistleblower Protection Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley were positive steps to decrease silencing abilities of powerful bodies. However, these actions are necessary but not sufficient. Reform is still needed within the OSC, though a step in the right direction was taken in 2008 when Scott J. Bloch left his post in the office. However, one of the most crucial reforms needed is widespread knowledge of employee rights. If employees (both of government agencies and of large corporations) are aware and confident of their rights under the Whistleblower Protection Act and the Sarbanes-Oxley act, they may be less fearful of upper-level intimidation or retaliation. Reform necessarily begins with education, and our nation stands only to gain greater transparency and accountability through better enforcement of these measures.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Digital manipulation can be used to misquote individuals, repeat comments out of context, retouch photographs, even create false or misleading photographs and so is an ethical concern as well. While there are some beneficial, ethical, noncontroversial applications of digital manipulation, the matter of altering photos for publication purposes is the subject of debate. Some publications and photographers see no harm in altering photographs to remove an offending item., to make someone look a little more attractive, to illustrate a point, or to increase circulation. Although manipulation of photographs has occurred for quite some time in tabloids and other publications not known as being reputable new sources, there have been several incidents of more reputable news publications using digitally altered photographs in recent years.

* Only one postage meter is known to have been used in the Maldives. It was probably located at a window in the main post office.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Mali Federation=

* &lt;font size=3&gt;The Mali Federation was a union between Senegal and the Sudanese Republic (formerly French Sudan). It was founded on 4 April 1959 as a French Colony and gained independence from France on 20 June 1960. After only two months of independence the Federation collapsed with the two members becoming the independent Republics of Mali and Senegal.
* The first meter was used in 1959. For issues before that date, see FRENCH WEST AFRICA and SUDANESE REPUBLIC. For issues after August 1960 see MALI and SENEGAL.
* All stamps are inscribed “FEDERATION DU MALI&quot;.

==Introduction==

In Part 1 we described the fundamentals of physics and engineering that apply to any complex project.  This includes Systems Engineering, which is concerned with managing the whole of a complex system across its entire life cycle, the design engineering tools and specialty areas of knowledge, and the organization and economics of projects.  Finally we looked at what projects and programs already exist, and the categories of future projects which might be pursued.  In Part 2 we began covering the particulars of space systems with the most characteristic element, the transport methods.   Since humans are starting from the Earth, then transportation is a prerequisite to doing any other tasks in space, and so we discussed that first.  Additionally, the very large number of possible transport methods justifies devoting a large section of the book to it.

In this Part 3 we will cover the particular design factors that apply to space systems, and the remaining subsystem elements besides transport methods.  Combinations of subsystem elements then form complete end items or products which execute designed functions and missions.  We will review these end functions and the methods available to perform them in a logical sequence by time, starting with exploration and ending with recycling.  The final major part of the book with then treat combinations of multiple end items and systems - how they grow, interact, and evolve.

==Overview==

:* '''[[Space_Transport_and_Engineering_Methods/Design_Factors|Design Factors]]'''

Design factors are those which influence the whole of a design, across different subsystems.  These include input requirements, technology level and availability of materials and suppliers, physical design such as margins and wear, and the limits imposed by humans as part of a system and the operating environment.

:* '''[[Space_Transport_and_Engineering_Methods/Subsystem_Design|Subsystem Design]]'''

There are numerous other systems besides propulsion required for most end items.  These include structures, mechanical, power, thermal, data, communications, sensors, and environmental protection.  When humans interact with an end item, you additionally need displays and controls, internal environment control, and crew support such as furniture, food, and clothing.  Items with an extended life require maintenance and repair in the form of tools and spares, and supplies such as fuel.

 
* '''Resource Exploration''' - This includes the methods of finding and characterizing resources located in space, as far as their location, composition, and other physical properties.  We only give a summary inventory of the known resources.  Full details comprise the entire fields of space science and astronomy, which are both large and ever growing.

* '''Resource Uses''' - There are as many possible end uses for the available resources in space as there are things to do on Earth. We list the major applications in terms of what we want to do first.  Later sections discuss how we can do them.

* '''Resource Extraction''' - Physical extraction is the task of removing materials from their native location, which is called '''Mining''', along with preliminary processing and transport for further processing and production.  Since you can only extract a physical material once from it's source, mining is typically mobile, where chemical processing and manufacturing tend to be fixed, since the equipment and connected power supply are often massive.  Energy extraction involves converting a primary source of energy into more useful forms such as electricity.

* '''Processing and Production''' - These tasks combine a multitude of simpler operations into one or more complete process flows.  The process flows convert extracted materials and energy into final bulk materials and finished components.

* '''Assembly and Construction''' - Assembly combines components to create a working device or machine. Construction first prepares a location, then assembles larger structures and outfits them with internal and external systems at fixed locations or orbits.  The distinction between assembling mobile machines and fixed construction is somewhat arbitrary in space, since even the largest orbital constructions can be moved.

* '''Operation and Maintenance''' - Once items are assembled or constructed, they must be operated according to their intended use, and normally will require periodic maintenance to keep functioning.  The overall concepts for operations and maintenance should be developed during design, so that necessary design features will be included.  If a part will need replacing, for example, a way to access it and remove it should be part of the design.

* '''Recycling Methods''' - Most engineered items eventually reach the end of their useful life.  Many methods and processes generate waste products, especially living things like humans. On Earth, disposal of scrap and waste has been left as a casual issue, and much of recycling, such as converting CO2 back to Oxygen, happens by natural processes. In space, recycling has to be more deliberate. In many locations there are not surplus resources that can be used, you are floating in a vacuum. You also cannot just dump wastes, as they would end up being a debris hazard. Thus efficient recycling will be both necessary, and less expensive than extracting and delivering new resources in many cases.  Thus recycling also needs to be planned for and designed in from the start.

While the topics arise more or less in this order, they need to be designed for in parallel, and will be performed in parallel, and in a connected network with transportation elements.  The following pages will discuss these topics in more detail.

==The Transport Challenge==

An ideal transport system has an infinite life and minimal operating cost when delivering a desired payload.  Real systems never reach that goal, and the designer's job is to approach it as closely as possible given the level of technology and other program limits.

====The Historical Problem====

The difficult job of the mid-to-late 20th century rocket designer was to find the best compromise between high cost and small payload when going to Earth orbit.  This compromise was forced by three factors conspired to produce a small payload fraction, and therefore high relative cost:
 
* The depth of the Earth's gravity well, which determines the velocity needed to reach orbit,
* The energy contained in chemical rocket propellants, which determines how much of them you need, and
* The strength and other properties of the materials used to build the rocket, which determines how much the hardware itself weighs.

It happens that the combination of these three factors conspire to produce a small, or even negative payload in an ideal one piece, long life rocket.  The total launch mass of such a rocket consists of 3 main parts: Propellant, Vehicle, and Payload.  Payload is what is left after accounting for the first two, and in 20th century designs that remainder could be negative, or at best a few percent.  For example, a single stage LO2/LH2 vehicle with a mission velocity of 9000 m/s and an exhaust velocity of 4500 m/s might be 86.5% fuel, 10-15% vehicle hardware depending on operating life, and thus -1.5 to +3.5% payload. The lower hardware weight was associated with more flimsy single use construction, and the higher weight with thicker long life design. The large ratio of rocket to payload weight led to high launch cost measured in $/kg. 

Various compromises had to be made from the ideal concept of a vehicle you could just refuel and launch again like an airplane.  One was to make the hardware last just a single flight, thus allowing lighter structures than ones built to last many flights.  Another is to drop parts of the vehicle during flight (staging). As fuel is used up less thrust is required to maintain acceleration, so fewer or smaller engines. Tanks also get emptied, so you can drop the excess engines and tanks once you don't need them any more. The remainder of the vehicle starts anew to accelerate towards orbit, but has the benefit of the velocity gained with the previous stage, and less vehicle weight. Low service life and staging are are expensive - you have to replace or re-assemble the hardware, but were necessary given the state of technology. The designer had to find the best balance between high cost due to small payload, or high cost due to discarding or rebuilding a complete rocket.

====The Modern Solution====

To reach a better result, the modern approach is to break one or more of the last century's limiting factors.  For example:

* You can build large structures that span part of the Earth's gravity well. This reduces the velocity the vehicle needs to reach. Even a small reduction shifts the near-zero payload into positive territory. Past systems have implicitly assumed chemical rockets to do the whole job of reaching orbit, because it was the only type of propulsion considered useful for that job.  There is no physical law that demands using one type of propulsion for the entire job, and using multiple methods often gets better total performance.

* There are now a multitude of alternatives to traditional chemical rockets.  This Part 2 of the book attempts to list all the known ones, of which there are 83 listed so far, not including variations.  Many of them have better performance, thus reducing the fuel required and increasing the net payload.

* Since the late 20th century materials with improved properties have emerged, which allows for longer service life or lighter weight.

Although having more options is more complex, the modern designer should consider the full range of available propulsion methods, and apply them where they function best.  The potential gain in going from short life, low payload transport to long life, high payload designs more than justifies the extra work. 

====Beyond Low Orbit====

'''Low Earth Orbit''', or LEO is the altitude range above significant atmosphere and below the Radiation Belts, or about 200 to 1,000 km altitude.  The above design challenge was to get from the ground into this orbit range.  Travel beyond LEO has not been as constrained to chemical rockets as initial launch.  That is because for vertical launch you need to be able to accelerate the whole vehicle at more than one gravity (9.8 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in order to take off, and maintain a relatively high thrust to prevent hitting the ground again while still below orbital speed. One of the key features of chemical rockets is their very high thrust to mass ratio.  This made them attractive despite their low absolute efficiency. 

Once in a stable orbit, lower thrust levels can be used to travel further, since you are not in danger of immediate re-entry. Thus alternatives to chemical rockets have been examined for those missions, and some of them even put into use in past decades.  There are now more alternatives for going beyond LEO, which give better performance or wider design choices. The larger change, however, is in the first step of getting to LEO, which was entirely by one relatively low performance method until recently.


==Transport Method Tables==

As a starting point for designers, the following table lists the 83 main space transport methods known to the book's authors. They are detailed in the following pages and are organized into logical categories by type.  The order listed here and later in the book is by similarity of type, and not by feasibility or development status.  Those factors are considered later.  Many of these methods also have variations in the concept or application.  From this list, the designer can then narrow the choices to the relevant options for a particular project, and eventually the final selection.  By starting with all of them, you can be sure no viable option was missed.

[[File:Table_of_Space_Transport_Methods.PNG|771x927px]]

This second table shows the same transport methods only by their numbers, since including the names makes the table too large.  They are sorted in two dimensions by (1) the energy source and (2) the method that force is applied.  This is an aid to organizing and thinking about them.  Some of the theoretical methods are not shown on this table since we do not have definite designs for implementing them. Some of the methods indicated could span more than one box if all the possible variations are considered, but we have assigned them to single boxes in this version.  Empty boxes can stimulate thought about whether there are possible transport methods which are still unknown, or whether that particular combination truly lacks possible use.

These tables represent the state of knowledge in mid-2012.  There are likely some additional methods not yet known to the authors, and new ones will likely be devised in the future.  If a serious project is contemplated, designers should survey the relevant specialists and literature to include the latest concepts.

== TDang review April 2012 ==

I'm reviewing [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/w/index.php?title=Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Oligopoly&amp;diff=2313885&amp;oldid=2313378]. I'll likely be more critical than complimentary, because (a) that's the way I am and (b) that's what will help improve things. Please don't take the criticism-over-compliments to mean I have a wholly negative view.

Make sure to check the [[Talk:Strategy_for_Information_Markets#review_thoughts_April_2012|all-purpose review thoughts]] as well.

* This should be &quot;background&quot; for the book--in fact, I'm not sure how often this course would get to oligopoly, but having a basic oligopoly section as background couldn't hurt.
* There is already some messy material on oligopoly in the background:
** [[Strategy for Information Markets/Background/Cournot competition|Cournot competition]]
** [[Strategy for Information Markets/Background/Bertrand competition|Bertrand competition]]
* So, the best thing to do would be to merge this page with those. Those pages are probably too long right now, as well as messy.
* ''Concentration Ratios''--That won't be necessary as part of this background.
* Not much to review, given that this should be merged. The writing here is good. The mathematical (and even better graphical) handling of the ideas would make it all better.

=== Usage ===

This template is a wrapper the usual &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;== Notes ==&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;references/&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; combo used to insert footnotes. Its purpose is to allow the notes to be hidden from the [[:de:Benutzer:Dirk_Huenniger/wb2pdf|wb2pdf]] PDF generator, which places the notes in the footers of PDF pages, making a separate &quot;Notes&quot; section pointless.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The study of economics is essentially the study of goods in markets. Goods come in many different forms and in order to study each one well, one must be able to differentiate and classify goods. One of the most common ways to distinguish the type of goods is showed in the table below. This table highlights two main concepts on which goods are classified: excludability and rivalry. The dictionary defines excluding as ''to shut or keep out''.&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster&quot;&gt;Merriam-Webster [[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rival|Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore an excludable good is a good that one can prevent another from owning and using by owning it themselves. So if person A owns the excludable good, then person B can be prevented from owning it. If anyone could not be prevented from getting benefits from a good or service, then this good or service is called &quot;non-excludable.&quot; Now taking a look at the way rivalry impacts goods, the definition of &quot;rival&quot; is that ''one of two or more striving to reach or obtain something that only one can possess.''&lt;ref name=&quot;Webster&quot; /&gt; That means a &quot;rival good&quot; is a limited resource to be consumed. In other words, the amount of the good is finite, and therefore if person A were to acquire more of the good, it would mean that person B has less of the good.

If the good is both excludable and rival, it is a ''[[w:Private good|Private Good]]''. If the good is non-excludable but rival, it is a ''[[w:Common good (economics)|Common Good]]''. If the good is excludable but non-rival, it is a ''[[w:Club good|Club Good]]''. If the good is non-excludable and non-rival, it is a ''[[w:Public good|Public Good]]''.
[[File:Features of goods.jpg|600px|none]]

== Private good ==
'''[[w:Private good|Private Goods]]''' are excludable and rival. Comparing to the &quot;[[w:Public good|public goods]]&quot;, private goods usually require payments to be consumed, so they are less likely to have the problems of &quot;[[w:Free rider problem|free-rider]].&quot;

The classic examples of the private goods are the &quot;typical goods&quot; around us in daily life, such as food, clothes and flowers. There are usually limited amounts of these typical goods and as a result, the sellers and owners of these goods could prevent or exclude non-payers from having and enjoying the benefits of the goods. Because of their relative scarcity, most private goods are sold for profits.

== Common good ==
'''[[w:Common good|Common Goods]]''' are often called '''[[w:Common-pool resource|Common-pool Resource]]''' as well, since the typical examples of common goods are natural resources. These goods are non-excludable and rival.

Due to the features of common goods, they are easily over-consumed or abused. With no excludability, it is in the rational interest of individuals to consume and gather as much of the good for themselves as the rivalry factor means that their will be less for them if they do not consume it. This phenomenon spawned the term &quot;'''[[w:Tragedy of the commons|Tragedy of the Commons]]'''&quot;, which refers to the problem of depleting limited resources of common goods.

== Club good ==
'''[[w:Club good|Club Goods]]''' are also called &quot;Artificially Scarce Goods&quot; which are excludable but non-rival. This type of goods often requires certain &quot;membership&quot; in order to enjoy the benefits of goods. There are usually efficient ways to prevent non-payers to access the goods. One of the most classic examples of club goods is Cable TV, which requires a monthly fee but is non-rival after the payment.

== Public good ==
'''[[w:Public good|Public Goods]]''' (also as Collective Goods) are non-excludable and non-rival. Most of the information goods can be categorized as public goods. The other typical examples of public goods include the air we breath, public parks and street lights.

The biggest problem usually associated with public goods is the '''&quot;[[w:Free rider problem|Free Rider Problem]]&quot;'''. The characteristics of the public goods determine that they are easily to be consumed without payment. 

== Features of information goods ==
Most of the information goods naturally have the characteristics of public goods. In a summary, they have the features of non-rival goods, possibly excludable goods, discrete choices, experience goods and durable goods, etc. 

The laws to protect '''[[w:Intellectual property|Intellectual Property]] (IP)'''such as [[w:Copyright|copyrights]] and [[w:Patent|patents]] can make the information goods more excludable, by implementing penalties on the free riders.

      <comment>On GHCi</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Merge ==

I just merged this page with [[Haskell/Debugging/]]. There were significant amounts of copyediting; the only paragraph actually removed, however, was the one quoted below, which seemed a bit overzealous. I guess it might be reincorporated to the text in a milder tone, which does not confuse &quot;order specified in the program&quot; with the order of the source code tokens in the text editor:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It should be remembered, that &lt;code&gt;trace&lt;/code&gt; differs from debug print statements in imperative languages - &lt;code&gt;trace&lt;/code&gt; doesn't causes specified string to be printed immediately at point of program where &lt;code&gt;trace&lt;/code&gt; appears, but it attaches string to value passed as second argument so that string will be printed when that value will be evaluated by the program.
So trace statements may be printed in order that differs from the one specified in program.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
By the way, it costs nothing to mention that the stub header &quot;Incremental development with GHCi&quot; might fit very well in [[Haskell/Using GHCi effectively]]...

      <text xml:space="preserve">== TDang review April 2012 ==

I'm reviewing [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/w/index.php?title=Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Remixing&amp;diff=2312276&amp;oldid=2312274 this version]. I'll likely be more critical than complimentary, because (a) that's the way I am and (b) that's what will help improve things. Please don't take the criticism-over-compliments to mean I have a wholly negative view.

Make sure to check the [[Talk:Strategy_for_Information_Markets#review_thoughts_April_2012|all-purpose review thoughts]] as well.

* Have an introduction which appears at the top--do this by not giving the first chunk of text any section header.
* Your signature should be reserved for the talk pages, not the main book text.
* ''&quot;software such as the program Maya, uses 3-d modeling to create new and different versions of an original copy. This program was actually used to create animation in films such as Spiderman and Lord of the Rings&quot;''--That sounds like original animation rather than remixing. You should come up with a better example.
* ''&quot;By using a program such as Web 2.0&quot;''--Web 2.0 isn't a program. (Or is it? If there is a piece of software called Web 2.0, that's a less common use of the term than [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0 this one].)
* Don't make this a personal essay (most clearly this means don't refer to &quot;I&quot; or &quot;me&quot;).
* This is interesting material about music remixing. Now it needs to become more relevant to the subject matter of this course. Here's some random thoughts:
*# Connect remixing to &quot;cumulative innovation&quot; in general
*# Does intellectual property law encourage or discourage this kind of art (or non-art remixing)?
*# What are the economic efficiency impacts, good or bad, of IP law encouraging or discouraging it?
*# How is remixing similar to or different from other forms of synthesis? (Like an engineer taking insights from separate scientists to create an invention.)
*# What about much older remixing?
*** This probably isn't a good '''reference''', but maybe partial inspiration: http://sydney.edu.au/arts/media_communications/salience/student_work/ferrari/remixhistory.html
*** Possibly: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsay_Wood
* ''References''--You're too reliant on one reference source. Try to find stuff related to what you already have but in different sources, maybe with different perspectives.
** For instance, I bet there are other reputable sources talking about the legal issues around &quot;No Protection&quot;.
** You also risk crossing the line into plagiarism. If you paraphrase a small piece of one artical and then connect it to a paraphrase of a small piece of a different article, you're on safer ground than if you paraphrase a lot from a single article.
** In fact, based on [https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C1AFAB_enUS448US448&amp;ix=acb&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8&amp;q=The+principle+of+the+Regenerative+Remix+is+to+subvert%2C+not+to+recognize+but+to+be+of+practical+use.+In+this+regard+Google+news+is+a+basic+Regenerative+Remix this search] you have crossed the line. Since you're referencing your source, I'm sure it's an honest mistake, but I'm going to pull out the last paragraph just in case. If you want to put it back, do it '''much more carefully'''.

I'm reviewing [https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Glossary&amp;diff=2314435&amp;oldid=2314428 this version]. I'll likely be more critical than complimentary, because (a) that's the way I am and (b) that's what will help improve things. Please don't take the criticism-over-compliments to mean I have a wholly negative view.

Make sure to check the [[Talk:Strategy_for_Information_Markets#review_thoughts_April_2012|all-purpose review thoughts]] as well.

* I made a formatting change to &quot;vaporware&quot;, you can see it [https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Strategy_for_Information_Markets%2FGlossary&amp;diff=2314435&amp;oldid=2311083 here]. That did two things:
*# It put it into a more-formalized definition-list kind of format.
*# It added an &quot;anchor&quot;, which will allow other pages to link directly to that glossary entry. For instance, you can see that I changed the link to &quot;vaporware&quot; to go to the glossary instead of Wikipedia, [https://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Network_Externalities/Expectations_Management&amp;diff=2314727&amp;oldid=2312702 here's the change].
* Doing similar for the other entries would be good--do it here first before worrying about linking other things here, but once you've done all of the entries here, linking from the other pages (only within this book) would be worthwhile.
* Check your alphabetical order. It's mostly right, but there are some things out of place.
* Fleshing out the glossary entries, two things per entry would be good, getting as far as you can:
*# A link to the best place in the book to see more detailed discussion of that topic
*# A reference ''outside of the book'' to a good definition/discussion of the topic.
* The above should give you plenty to work on. I think having this glossary is good for the book. If you notice things in the book which are missing from the glossary, do add them. (I noticed &quot;monopoly&quot; is missing.)

The following is a list of notable easy to learn TV Theme songs to be played on the guitar. Some of the items link to the different informal chords to specific songs which represent many different authors' own interpretations of the original songs. Most of the chords on the list are relatively easy to learn, and would be a great start for novice guitar players whom are interested in improving their playing abilities.

The technical difficulty and skill level required to play each of the songs is defined with a star rating system:

*  [[Image:Star_full.svg|11px]][[Image:Star_empty.svg|11px]][[Image:Star_empty.svg|11px]] - Easy Songs
*  [[Image:Star_full.svg|11px]][[Image:Star_full.svg|11px]][[Image:Star_empty.svg|11px]] - Intermediate Songs
*  [[Image:Star_full.svg|11px]][[Image:Star_full.svg|11px]][[Image:Star_full.svg|11px]] - Difficult Songs

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] (global to the system) or in a page on your own userspace.
* Remember to use [[Commons:Main Page|Commons]] project for image uploading.
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks are open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer since things work a little different here.
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to keep a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you have questions, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;(This is not an automated message, I'll be watching during a time for any reply you make to it...)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 09:08, 30 April 2012 (UTC)</text>

During the preliminary sections we introduced two important constructions on sets: the direct product and the disjoint union. In this section we will construct the analogous constructions for groups.

== Product Groups ==

'''Definition 1:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be groups. Then we can define a group structure on the direct product &lt;math&gt;G\times H&lt;/math&gt; of the ''sets'' &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; as follows. Let &lt;math&gt;(g_1,h_1),(g_2,h_2)\in G\times H&lt;/math&gt;. Then we define the multiplication componentwise: &lt;math&gt;(g_1,h_1)(g_2,h_2)=(g_1g_2,h_1h_2)&lt;/math&gt;. This structure is called the ''direct product'' of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Remark 2:''' The product group ''is'' a group, with identity &lt;math&gt;(e_G,e_H)&lt;/math&gt; and inverses &lt;math&gt;(g,h)^{-1}=(g^{-1},h^{-1})&lt;/math&gt;. The order of &lt;math&gt;G\times H&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;|G\times H|=|G||H|&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Theorem 3:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be groups. Then we have homomorphisms &lt;math&gt;\pi_1\,:\, G\times H \rightarrow G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi_2\,:\, G\times H \rightarrow H&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(g,h)=g&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi_2(g,h)=h&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;(g,h)\in G\times H&lt;/math&gt;. These are called the ''projections'' on the first and second factor, respectively.

''Proof'': The projections are obviously homomorphisms since they are the identity on one factor and the trivial homomorphism on the other. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Corollary 4:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be groups. Then &lt;math&gt;\frac{G\times H}{H}\approx G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\frac{G\times H}{G}\approx H&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': This follows immediately from plying the first isomorphism theorem to Theorem 3 and using that &lt;math&gt;G\times\{e_H\}\approx G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{e_G\}\times H\approx H&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 5:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be groups. Then &lt;math&gt;G\times\{e_H\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\{e_G\}\times H&lt;/math&gt; are normal subgroups of &lt;math&gt;G\times H&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': We prove the theorem for &lt;math&gt;G\times\{e_H\}&lt;/math&gt;. The case for &lt;math&gt;\{e_G\}\times H&lt;/math&gt; is similar. Let &lt;math&gt;g,g^\prime\in G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h\in H&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;(g,h)(g^\prime,e_H)(g,h)^{-1}=(gg^\prime g^{-1},hh^{-1})=(gg^\prime g^{-1},e_H)\in G\times\{e_H\}&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


[[File:ProdGrp.png|thumb|Commutative diagram showing the universal property satisfied by the direct product.]]
We stated that this is an analogous construction to the direct product of sets. By that we mean that it satiesfies the same universal property as the direct product. Indeed, to be called a &quot;product&quot;, a construction should have to satisfy this universal property.


'''Theorem 6:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be groups. Then if &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a group with homomorphisms &lt;math&gt;\phi_1\,:\, K\rightarrow G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi_2\,:\, K\rightarrow H&lt;/math&gt;, then there exists a unique homomorphism &lt;math&gt;u\,:\,K\rightarrow G\times H&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\phi_1=\pi_1\circ u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi_2=\pi_2\circ u&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': By the construction of the direct product, &lt;math&gt;u\,:\, K\rightarrow G\times H&lt;/math&gt; is a homomorphism if and only if &lt;math&gt;\pi_1\circ u&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi_2\circ u&lt;/math&gt; are homomorphisms. Thus &lt;math&gt;u\,:\, K\rightarrow G\times H&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;u((g,h))=(\phi_1(g),\phi_2(h))&lt;/math&gt; is one homomorphism satisfying the theorem, proving existence. By the commutativity condition this is the only such homomorphism, proving uniqueness. {{Unicode|∎}}


=== Products of Cyclic Groups ===


'''Theorem 7:''' The order of an element &lt;math&gt;(a,b)\in\mathbb{Z}_m\times\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;|(a,b)|=\mathrm{lcm}(|a|,|b|)&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': The lowest positive number &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;(a,b)^c=(ac,bc)=(0,0)&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest number such that &lt;math&gt;ac=rm&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;bc=sn&lt;/math&gt; for integers &lt;math&gt;r,s&lt;/math&gt;. It follows that &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; divides both &lt;math&gt;|a|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|b|&lt;/math&gt; and is the smallest such number. This is the definition of the least common divider. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 8:''' &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_m\times \mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_{mn}&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are relatively prime.

''Proof'': We begin with the left implication. Assume &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_m\times\mathbb{Z}_n\approx \mathbb{Z}_{mn}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_m\times\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt; is cyclic, and so there must exist an element with order &lt;math&gt;mn&lt;/math&gt;. By Theorem 7 we there must then exist a generator &lt;math&gt;(a,b)\neq (0,0)&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_m\times\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{lcm}(|a|,|b|)=mn&lt;/math&gt;. Since each factor of the generator must generate its group, this implies &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{lcm}(m,n)=mn&lt;/math&gt;, and so &lt;math&gt;\gcd(m,n)=1&lt;/math&gt;, meaning that &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are relatively prime. Now assume that &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; are relatively prime and that we have generators &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_m&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt;. Then  since &lt;math&gt;\gcd(m,n)=1&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{lcm}(m,n)=mn&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;|(a,b)|=mn&lt;/math&gt;. this implies that &lt;math&gt;(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; generates &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_m\times\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt;, which must then be isomorphic to a cyclic group of order &lt;math&gt;mn&lt;/math&gt;, im particular &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_{mn}&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 9 (Characterization of finite abelian groups):''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be an abelian group. Then there exists prime numbers &lt;math&gt;p_1,...,p_n&lt;/math&gt; and positive integers &lt;math&gt;r_1,...,r_n&lt;/math&gt;, unique up to order, such that

:&lt;math&gt;G\approx \mathbb{Z}_{p_1^{r_1}}\times ... \times \mathbb{Z}_{p_n^{r_n}}&lt;/math&gt;

''Proof'': A proof of this theorem is currenly beyond our reach. However, we will address it during the chapter on modules. {{Unicode|∎}}


=== Subdirect Products and Fibered Products ===


'''Definition 10:''' A ''subdirect product'' of two groups &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a proper subgroup &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G\times H&lt;/math&gt; such that the projection homomorphisms are surjective. That is, &lt;math&gt;\pi_1(K)=G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\pi_2(K)=H&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Example 11:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group. Then the diagonal &lt;math&gt;\Delta=\{(g,g)\mid g\in G\}\subseteq G\times G&lt;/math&gt; is a subdirect product of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; with itself.


'''Definition 12:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt; be groups, and let the homomorphisms &lt;math&gt;\phi\,:\, G\rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\psi\,:\, H\rightarrow Q&lt;/math&gt; be epimorphisms. The ''fiber product'' of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; ''over'' &lt;math&gt;Q&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;G\times_Q H&lt;/math&gt;, is the subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G\times H&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;G\times_Q H=\{(g,h)\in G\times H\mid \phi(g)=\psi(h)\}&lt;/math&gt;.


In this subsection, we will prove the equivalence between subdirect products and fiber products. Specifically, every subdirect product is a fiber product and vice versa. For this we need ''Goursat's lemma''.


'''Theorem 13 (Goursat's lemma):''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G^\prime&lt;/math&gt; be groups, and &lt;math&gt;H\subseteq G\times G^\prime&lt;/math&gt; a subdirect product of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G^\prime&lt;/math&gt;. Now let &lt;math&gt;N=\ker \,\pi_2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;N^\prime=\ker\,\pi_1&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; can be identified with a normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;N^\prime&lt;/math&gt; with a normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G^\prime&lt;/math&gt;, and the image of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; when projecting on &lt;math&gt;G/N\times G^\prime /N^\prime&lt;/math&gt; is the graph of an isomorphism &lt;math&gt;G/N\approx G^\prime/N^\prime&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'':

=== Semidirect Products ===


=== Further Reading ===


More on the automorphism groups of finite abelian groups. Some results require theory of group actions and ring theory, which is developed in a later section.

http://arxiv.org/pdf/math/0605185v1.pdf

== Free Groups ==

In order to properly define the free group, and thereafter the free product, we need some preliminary definitions.


'''Definition 10:''' Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be a set. Then a ''word'' of elements in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is a finite sequence &lt;math&gt;a_1a_2...a_n&lt;/math&gt; of elements of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, where the positive integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the ''word length''.


'''Definition 11:''' Let &lt;math&gt;x=a_1...a_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y=a_{n+1}...a_{n+k}&lt;/math&gt; be two words of elements in &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. Define the ''concatenation'' of the two words as the word &lt;math&gt;xy=a_1...a_na_{n+1}...a_{n+k}&lt;/math&gt;.


Now, we want to make a group consisting of the words of a given set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;, and we want this group to be the most general group of this kind. However, if we are to use the concatenation operation, which is the only obvious operation on two words, we are immediately faced with a problem. Namely, deciding when two words are equal. According to the above, the length of a product is the sum of the lengths of the factors. In other words, the length cannot decrease. Thus, a word of length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; multiplied with its inverse has length at least &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, while the identity word, which is the empty word, has length &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. The solution is an algorithm to ''reduce'' words into ''irreducible'' ones. These terms are defined below.


'''Definition 12:''' Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be any set. Define the set &lt;math&gt;W(A)&lt;/math&gt; as the set of words of ''powers'' of elements of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. That is, if &lt;math&gt;a_1,...,a_n\in A&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r_1,...,r_n\in\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;a_1^{r_1}...a_n^{r_n}\in F(A)&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Definition 13:''' Let &lt;math&gt;x=a_1^{r_1}...a_n^{r_n}\in W(A)&lt;/math&gt;. Then we define a ''reduction'' of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; as follows. Scan the word from the left until the first pair of indices &lt;math&gt;j,j+1&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a_j=a_{j+1}&lt;/math&gt; is encountered, if such a pair exists. Then replace &lt;math&gt;a_j^{r_j}a_{j+1}^{r_{j+1}}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;a_j^{r_j+r_{j+1}}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the resulting word is &lt;math&gt;x_{(1)}=a_1^{r_1}...a_{j-1}^{r_{j-1}}a_j^{r_j+r_{j+1}}a_{j+2}^{r_{j+2}}...a_n^{r_n}&lt;/math&gt;. If no such pair exists, then &lt;math&gt;x=x_{(1)}&lt;/math&gt; and the word is called ''irreducible''.


It should be obvious if &lt;math&gt;x\in W(A)&lt;/math&gt; with length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;x_{(n)}&lt;/math&gt; will be irreducible. The details of the proof is left to the reader.


'''Definition 14:''' Define the ''free group'' &lt;math&gt;F(A)&lt;/math&gt; on a set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; as follows. For each word &lt;math&gt;x\in W(A)&lt;/math&gt; of length &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;, let the  reduced word &lt;math&gt;x_{(n)}\in F(A)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;F(A)\subseteq W(A)&lt;/math&gt; is the subset of irreducible words. As for the binary operation on &lt;math&gt;F(A)&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;x,y\in F(A)&lt;/math&gt; have lengths &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt; respectively, define &lt;math&gt;x*y&lt;/math&gt; as the completely reduced concatenation &lt;math&gt;(xy)_{(n+m)}&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Theorem 15:''' &lt;math&gt;F(A)&lt;/math&gt; ''is'' a group.

''Proof'':


'''Example 16:''' We will concider free groups on 1 and 2 letters. Let &lt;math&gt;A_1=\{a\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;A_2=\{a,b\}&lt;/math&gt;. Then

: &lt;math&gt;F(A_1)=\{a^n\mid n\in \mathbb{Z}\}&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;a^na^m=a^{n+m}&lt;/math&gt;.

: &lt;math&gt;F(A_2)=\{\prod_{i=1}^n a_{i}b_{i}\mid a_{i}\in F(\{a\}),b_{i}\in F(\{b\})\}&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a_i\neq e&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;i&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b_i\neq e&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;i&lt;n&lt;/math&gt;. Example product: &lt;math&gt;(a^2b^{-3}a)(a^{-1}ba)=a^2b^{-3}aa^{-1}ba=a^2b^{-3}ba=a^2b^{-2}a&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Group Presentations ===

In this subsection we will breifly introduce another method used for defining groups. This is by prescribing a ''group presentation''.


'''Definition 17:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; a subgroup. Then define the ''normal closure'' of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; as the intersection of all normal subgroups in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; containing H. That is, if &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is the normal closure of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, then
:&lt;math&gt;N=\bigcap_{\stackrel{K\trianglelefteq G}{H\subseteq K}}K&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Definition 18:''' Let &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be a set and &lt;math&gt;R\subseteq F(S)&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; be the normal closure of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;F(S)&lt;/math&gt; and define the group &lt;math&gt;\langle S\mid R\rangle=F(S)/N&lt;/math&gt;. The elements of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; are called ''generators'' and the elements of &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; are called ''relators''. If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a group such that &lt;math&gt;G\approx \langle S\mid R\rangle&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\langle S\mid R \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is said to be a ''presentation'' of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

== The Free Product ==

Using the previously defined notion of a group presentation, we can now define another type of group product.

'''Defintion :''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G^\prime&lt;/math&gt; be groups with presentations &lt;math&gt;\langle S\mid R\rangle&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\langle S^\prime \mid R^\prime\rangle&lt;/math&gt;. Define the ''free product'' of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G^\prime&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;G*G^\prime&lt;/math&gt;, as the group with the presentation &lt;math&gt;\langle S\cup S^\prime \mid R\cup R^\prime\rangle&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Remark :''' Depending on the context, spesifically if we only deal with abelian groups, we may require the free product of abelian groups to be abelian. In that case, the free product equals the direct product. This is another example of abelian groups being better behaved than nonabelian groups.


'''Lemma :''' The free product includes the component groups as subgroups.


'''Remark :''' The free product is not a product in the sense discussed previously. It does not satifsy the universal property other products do. Instead, it satisfies the &quot;opposide&quot;, or ''dual'' property, obtained by reversing the direction of all the arrows in the commutative diagram. We usually call a construction satisfying this universal property a ''coproduct''.

== Problems ==

'''Problem 1:''' Let &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; be groups of relatively prime orders. Show that any subgroup of &lt;math&gt;H\times K&lt;/math&gt; is the product of a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; with a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt;.

Stateful computations are very common operations, but the way they are usually implemented in procedural or object-oriented languages cannot be replicated in Haskell. A &lt;code&gt;State&lt;/code&gt; monad is introduced to allow states of any complexity to be represented.

== The Problem with Haskell and State ==
If you programmed in any language before, chances are you wrote some functions that &quot;kept state&quot;. In case you did not encounter the concept before, a ''state'' is one or more variables that are required to perform some computation, but are not among the arguments of the relevant function. In fact, object-oriented languages like C++ make extensive usage of state variables in objects in the form of member variables. Procedural languages like C use variables outside the current scope to keep track of  state.

In Haskell we can very often keep track of state by passing parameters or by pattern matching of various sorts, but in some cases it is appropriate to find a more general solution. We will consider the common example of generation of pseudo-random numbers in pure functions.

=== Pseudo-Random Numbers ===
[[:wikipedia:Random number generation|Generating actually random numbers]] is a very complicated subject; we will consider [[:wikipedia:Pseudorandom number generator|''pseudo''-random numbers]].
They are called &quot;pseudo&quot; because they are not really random, they only look like it. Starting from an initial state (commonly called the ''seed''), they produce a sequence of numbers that have the appearance of being random.

Every time a pseudo-random number is requested, a global state is updated: that's the part we have problems with in Haskell, since it is a side effect from the point of view of the function requesting the number.
Sequences of pseudo-random numbers can be replicated exactly if the initial seed and the algorithm is known.

=== Implementation in Haskell ===
Producing a pseudo-random number in most programming languages is very simple: there is usually a function, such as C or C++'s &lt;code&gt;rand()&lt;/code&gt;, that provides a pseudo-random value (or a random one, depending on the implementation). Haskell has a similar one in the &lt;code&gt;System.Random&lt;/code&gt; module:

 &gt; :module System.Random
 &gt; :type randomIO
 randomIO :: (Random a) =&gt; IO a
 &gt; randomIO
 -1557093684

Obviously, save eerie coincidences, the value you will obtain will be different. A disadvantage of &lt;code&gt;randomIO&lt;/code&gt; is that it requires us to utilise the &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; monad, which breaks purity requirements.
Usage of the &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; monad is dictated by the process of updating the global generator state, so that the next time we call &lt;code&gt;randomIO&lt;/code&gt; the value will be different.

=== Implementation with Functional Purity ===
In general, we do not want to use the &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; monad if we can help it, because of the loss of guarantees on no side effects and functional purity.
Indeed, we can build a ''local'' generator (as opposed to the global generator, invisible to us, that &lt;code&gt;randomIO&lt;/code&gt; uses) using &lt;code&gt;mkStdGen&lt;/code&gt;, and use it as seed for the &lt;code&gt;random&lt;/code&gt; function, which in turn returns a tuple with the pseudo-random number that we want and the generator to use the next time:
 
 &gt; :module System.Random
 &gt; let generator = mkStdGen 0 -- &quot;0&quot; is our seed
 &gt; random generator :: (Int, StdGen)
 (2092838931,1601120196 1655838864)

And in this case, since we are using exactly the same generator, you will obtain the same value &lt;tt&gt;2092838931&lt;/tt&gt;, always the same no matter how many times you call &lt;code&gt;random&lt;/code&gt;.
We have now regained functional purity, but a function supposed to provide pseudo-random numbers that generates always the same value is not very helpful: what we need is a way to
automate the extraction of the second member of the tuple (i.e. the new generator) and feed it to a new call to &lt;code&gt;random&lt;/code&gt;; and that is where the &lt;code&gt;State&lt;/code&gt; monad comes into the picture.

== Definition of the State Monad ==
:''Note: in some package systems used for GHC, the &lt;code&gt;Control.Monad.State&lt;/code&gt; module is in a separate package, usually indicated by MTL (Monad Transformer Library).''

The Haskell type &lt;code&gt;State&lt;/code&gt; is defined as a function that consumes state, and produces a result and the state after the result has been extracted.
The definition is wrapped inside a &lt;code&gt;newtype&lt;/code&gt; to avoid pattern matching, so that no one can explicitly pattern-match and extract state unless we allow it.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
newtype State state result = State { runState :: state -&gt; (result, state) }
&lt;/source&gt;

The name &lt;code&gt;State&lt;/code&gt; is actually a misnomer: it is not the state itself, but rather a ''state processor''.

=== Instantiating the Monad ===
Note also that &lt;code&gt;State&lt;/code&gt; has ''two'' type parameters, one for the state and one for the result: all other main types of monads have only one (&lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt;, lists, &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt;).
This means that, when we instantiate the monad, we are actually leaving the parameter for the state type:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
instance Monad (State state_type)
&lt;/source&gt;
This means that the &quot;real&quot; monad will be &lt;code&gt;State String&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;State Int&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;State SomeLargeDataStructure&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code&gt;State&lt;/code&gt; itself.

The &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; function is implemented as:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
return :: result -&gt; State state result
return r = State ( \s -&gt; (r, s) )
&lt;/source&gt;
In words, giving a value to &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; produces a function, wrapped in the &lt;code&gt;State&lt;/code&gt; constructor: this function takes a state value, and returns it unchanged as the second member of a tuple, together with the specified result value.

Binding is a bit intricate:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
(&gt;&gt;=) :: State state result_a -&gt; (result_a -&gt; State state result_b) -&gt; State state result_b
processor &gt;&gt;= processorGenerator = State $ \state -&gt; 
                                   let (result, state') = runState processor state
                                   in runState (processorGenerator result) state'
&lt;/source&gt;

The idea is that, given a state processor and a function that can generate another processor given the result of the first one, these two processors are combined to obtain a function that takes the ''initial'' state, and returns the ''second'' result and state (i.e. after the second function has processed them).

=== Setting and Accessing the State ===
The monad instantiation allows us to manipulate various state processors, but you may at this point wonder where exactly the state comes from in the first place.
&lt;code&gt;State state_type&lt;/code&gt; is also an instance of the &lt;code&gt;MonadState&lt;/code&gt; class, which provides two additional functions:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
put newState = State $ \_ -&gt; ((), newState)
&lt;/source&gt;
This function will generate a state processor given a state. The processor's input will be disregarded, and the output will be a tuple carrying the state we provided. Since we do not care about the result (we are discarding the input, after all), the first element of the tuple will be null.

The specular operation is to read the state. This is accomplished by &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
get = State $ \state -&gt; (state, state)
&lt;/source&gt;
The resulting state processor is going to produce the input &lt;code&gt;state&lt;/code&gt; in both positions of the output tuple, as a result and as a state, so that it may be bound to other processors.

=== Getting Values and State ===
From the definition of &lt;code&gt;State&lt;/code&gt;, we know that &lt;code&gt;runState&lt;/code&gt; is an accessor to apply to a &lt;code&gt;State a b&lt;/code&gt; value to get the state-processing function; this function, given an initial state, will return the extracted value and the new state.
Other similar, useful functions are &lt;code&gt;evalState&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;execState&lt;/code&gt;, which work in a very similar fashion.

Function &lt;code&gt;evalState&lt;/code&gt;, given a &lt;code&gt;State a b&lt;/code&gt; and an initial state, will return the extracted value only, whereas &lt;code&gt;execState&lt;/code&gt; will return only the new state; it is possibly easiest to remember them as defined as:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
evalState stateMonad value = fst ( runState stateMonad value )
execState stateMonad value = snd ( runState stateMonad value )
&lt;/source&gt;

== Example: Rolling Dice ==
[[File:Dice.jpg|thumb|&lt;code&gt;randomRIO (1,6)&lt;/code&gt;]]
Suppose we are coding a game in which at some point we need an element of chance. In real-life games that is often obtained by means of dice, which we will now try to simulate with Haskell code. For starters, we will consider the result of throwing two dice: to do that, we resort to the function &lt;code&gt;randomR&lt;/code&gt;, which allows to specify an interval from which the pseudo-random values will be taken; in the case of a die, it is &lt;code&gt;randomR (1,6)&lt;/code&gt;.

In case we are willing to use the &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; monad, the implementation is quite simple, using the &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; version of &lt;code&gt;randomR&lt;/code&gt;:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
import Control.Monad
import System.Random

rollDiceIO :: IO (Int, Int)
rollDiceIO = liftM2 (,) (randomRIO (1,6)) (randomRIO (1,6))
&lt;/source&gt;
The two numbers will be returned as a tuple.

{{Exercises|1=
#Implement a function &lt;code&gt;rollNDiceIO :: Int -&gt; IO [Int]&lt;/code&gt; that, given an integer, returns a list with that number of pseudo-random integers between 1 and 6.}}

=== Getting Rid of the &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; Monad ===
Suppose that for some reason we do not want to use the &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; monad: we may want the function to stay pure, or we may want a sequence of numbers that is the same in every run, for repeatability.

To do that, we can produce a generator using the &lt;code&gt;mkStdGen&lt;/code&gt; function in the &lt;code&gt;System.Random&lt;/code&gt; library:

 &gt; mkStdGen 0
 1 1
The argument to &lt;code&gt;mkStdGen&lt;/code&gt; is an &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt; that functions as a seed.
With that, we can generate a pseudo-random integer number in the interval between 1 and 6 with:

 &gt; randomR (1,6) (mkStdGen 0)
 (6,40014 40692)

We obtained a tuple with the result of the dice throw (6) and the new generator (40014 40692).
A simple implementation that produces a tuple of two pseudo-random integers is then:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
clumsyRollDice :: (Int, Int)
clumsyRollDice = (n, m)
        where
        (n, g) = randomR (1,6) (mkStdGen 0)
        (m, _) = randomR (1,6) g
&lt;/source&gt;

[[File:Stone Dice 17.JPG|thumb|[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boxcars_%28slang%29 Boxcars!]]]
When we run the function, we get:

 &gt; clumsyRollDice
 (6, 6)

The implementation of &lt;code&gt;clumsyRollDice&lt;/code&gt; works, but we have to manually write the passing of generator &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; from one &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; clause to the other. This is pretty easy now, but will become increasingly cumbersome if we want to produce large sets of pseudo-random numbers. It is also error-prone: what if we pass one of the middle generators to the wrong line in the &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; clause?

{{Exercises|1=
#Implement a function &lt;code&gt;rollDice :: StdGen -&gt; ((Int, Int), StdGen)&lt;/code&gt; that, given a generator, return a tuple with our random numbers as first element and the last generator as the second.}}

=== Introducing &lt;code&gt;State&lt;/code&gt; ===
We will now try to solve the clumsiness of the previous approach introducing the &lt;code&gt;State StdGen&lt;/code&gt; monad. For convenience, we give it a name with a type synonym:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
type GeneratorState = State StdGen
&lt;/source&gt;

Remember, however, that the type of &lt;code&gt;GeneratorState Int&lt;/code&gt; is really &lt;code&gt;StdGen -&gt; (Int, StdGen)&lt;/code&gt;, so it is not really the generator state, but a processor of the generator state. The generator state itself is produced by the &lt;code&gt;mkStdGen&lt;/code&gt; function. Note that &lt;code&gt;GeneratorState&lt;/code&gt; does not specify what type of values we are going to extract, only the type of the state.

We can now produce a function that, given a &lt;code&gt;StdGen&lt;/code&gt; generator, outputs a number between 1 and 6:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
rollDie :: GeneratorState Int
rollDie = do generator &lt;- get
             let (value, newGenerator) = randomR (1,6) generator
             put newGenerator
             return value
&lt;/source&gt;

The &lt;code&gt;do&lt;/code&gt; notation is in this case much more readable; let's go through each of the steps:
# First, we take out the pseudo-random generator with &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt;: the &lt;code&gt;&lt;-&lt;/code&gt; notation extracts the ''value'' from the &lt;code&gt;GeneratorState&lt;/code&gt; monad, not the ''state''; since it is the state we want, we use &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt;, that extracts the state and outputs it as the value (look again at the definition of &lt;code&gt;get&lt;/code&gt; above, if you have doubts).
# Then, we use the &lt;code&gt;randomR&lt;/code&gt; function to produce an integer between 1 and 6 using the generator we took; we also store the new generator graciously returned by &lt;code&gt;randomR&lt;/code&gt;.
# We then set the state to be the &lt;code&gt;newGenerator&lt;/code&gt; using the &lt;code&gt;put&lt;/code&gt; function, so that the next call will use a different pseudo-random generator;
# Finally, we inject the result into the &lt;code&gt;GeneratorState&lt;/code&gt; monad using &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt;.

We can finally use our monadic die:
 &gt; evalState rollDie (mkStdGen 0)
 6

At this point, a legitimate question is why we have involved monads and built such an intricate framework only to do exactly what &lt;code&gt;fst $ randomR (1,6)&lt;/code&gt; does. The answer is illustrated by the following function:
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
rollDice :: GeneratorState (Int, Int)
rollDice = liftM2 (,) rollDie rollDie
&lt;/source&gt;

We obtain a function producing ''two'' pseudo-random numbers in a tuple. Note that these are in general different:
 &gt; evalState rollDice (mkStdGen 666)
 (6,1)

That is because, under the hood, the monads are passing state to each other. This used to be very clunky using &lt;code&gt;randomR (1,6)&lt;/code&gt;, because we had to pass state manually; now, the monad is taking care of that for us. Assuming we know how to use the lifting functions, constructing intricate combinations of pseudo-random numbers (tuples, lists, whatever) has suddenly become much easier.

{{Exercises|1=
#Similarly to what was done for &lt;code&gt;rollNDiceIO&lt;/code&gt;, implement a function &lt;code&gt;rollNDice :: Int -&gt; GeneratorState [Int]&lt;/code&gt; that, given an integer, returns a list with that number of pseudo-random integers between 1 and 6.}}

== Producing Pseudo-Random Values of Different Types: the &lt;code&gt;Random&lt;/code&gt; class ==
Until now, absorbed in the die example, we considered only &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt; as the type of the produced pseudo-random number. However, already when we defined the &lt;code&gt;GeneratorState&lt;/code&gt; monad, we noticed that it did not specify anything about the type of the returned value. In fact, there is one implicit assumption about it, and that is that we can produce values of such a type with a call to &lt;code&gt;random&lt;/code&gt;.

Values that can be produced by &lt;code&gt;random&lt;/code&gt; and similar function are of types that are instances of the &lt;code&gt;Random&lt;/code&gt; class (capitalised). There are default implementations for &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Char&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Integer&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Bool&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Double&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Float&lt;/code&gt;, so you can immediately generate any of those.

Since we noticed already that the &lt;code&gt;GeneratorState&lt;/code&gt; is &quot;agnostic&quot; in regard to the type of the pseudo-random value it produces, we can write down a similarly &quot;agnostic&quot; function, analogous to &lt;code&gt;rollDie&lt;/code&gt;, that provides a pseudo-random value of unspecified type (as long as it is an instance of &lt;code&gt;Random&lt;/code&gt;):

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
getRandom :: Random a =&gt; GeneratorState a
getRandom = do generator &lt;- get
               let (value, newGenerator) = random generator
               put newGenerator
               return value
&lt;/source&gt;

Compared to &lt;code&gt;rollDie&lt;/code&gt;, this function does not specify the &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt; type in its signature and uses &lt;code&gt;random&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;randomR&lt;/code&gt;; otherwise, it is just the same. What is notable is that &lt;code&gt;getRandom&lt;/code&gt; can be used for any instance of &lt;code&gt;Random&lt;/code&gt;:

 &gt; evalState getRandom (mkStdGen 0) :: Bool
 True
 &gt; evalState getRandom (mkStdGen 0) :: Char
 '\64685'
 &gt; evalState getRandom (mkStdGen 0) :: Double
 0.9872770354820595
 &gt; evalState getRandom (mkStdGen 0) :: Integer
 2092838931

Indeed, it becomes quite easy to conjure all these at once:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
allTypes :: GeneratorState (Int, Float, Char, Integer, Double, Bool, Int)
allTypes = liftM (,,,,,,) getRandom
                     `ap` getRandom
                     `ap` getRandom
                     `ap` getRandom
                     `ap` getRandom
                     `ap` getRandom
                     `ap` getRandom
&lt;/source&gt;
Here we are forced to used the &lt;code&gt;ap&lt;/code&gt; function, defined in &lt;code&gt;Control.Monad&lt;/code&gt;, since there exists no &lt;code&gt;liftM7&lt;/code&gt;. As you can see, its effect is to concatenate multiple monads into a lifting operation of the 7-element-tuple operator, &lt;code&gt;(,,,,,,)&lt;/code&gt;. To understand what &lt;code&gt;ap&lt;/code&gt; does, look at its signature:
 &gt;:type ap
 ap :: (Monad m) =&gt; m (a -&gt; b) -&gt; m a -&gt; m b
remember then that type &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; in Haskell can be a function as well as a value, and compare to:
 &gt;:type liftM (,,,,,,) getRandom
 liftM (,,,,,) getRandom :: (Random a1) =&gt;
                           State StdGen (b -&gt; c -&gt; d -&gt; e -&gt; f -&gt; (a1, b, c, d, e, f))
The monad &lt;code&gt;m&lt;/code&gt; is obviously &lt;code&gt;State StdGen&lt;/code&gt; (which we &quot;nicknamed&quot; &lt;code&gt;GeneratorState&lt;/code&gt;), while &lt;code&gt;ap&lt;/code&gt;'s first argument is function &lt;code&gt;b -&gt; c -&gt; d -&gt; e -&gt; f -&gt; (a1, b, c, d, e, f)&lt;/code&gt;. Applying &lt;code&gt;ap&lt;/code&gt; over and over (in this case 6 times), we finally get to the point where &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; is an actual value (in our case, a 7-element tuple), not another function.

So much for understanding the implementation. Function &lt;code&gt;allTypes&lt;/code&gt; provides pseudo-random values for all default instances of &lt;code&gt;Random&lt;/code&gt;; an additional &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt; is inserted at the end to prove that the generator is not the same, as the two &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt;s will be different.

== The State monad ==

The State monad actually makes a lot more sense when viewed as a computation, rather than a container. Computations in State represents computations that ''depend on and modify some internal state''. For example, say you were writing a program to model the [[w:Three body problem#Three-body problem|three body problem]]. The internal state would be the positions, masses and velocities of all three bodies. Then a function, to, say, get the acceleration of a specific body would need to reference this state as part of its calculations.

The other important aspect of computations in State is that they can modify the internal state. Again, in the three-body problem, you could write a function that, given an acceleration for a specific body, updates its position.

The State monad is quite different from the Maybe and the list monads, in that it doesn't represent the ''result'' of a computation, but rather a certain property of the computation itself.

What we do is model computations that depend on some internal state as functions which take a state parameter. For example, if you had a function &lt;code&gt;f :: String -&gt; Int -&gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt;, and we want to modify it to make it depend on some internal state of type &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;, then the function becomes &lt;code&gt;f :: String -&gt; Int -&gt; s -&gt; Bool&lt;/code&gt;. To allow the function to change the internal state, the function returns a pair of (return value, new state). So our function becomes &lt;code&gt;f :: String -&gt; Int -&gt; s -&gt; (Bool, s)&lt;/code&gt;

It should be clear that this method is a bit cumbersome. However, the types aren't the worst of it: what would happen if we wanted to run two stateful computations, call them &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt;, one after another, passing the result of &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; into &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt;? The second would need to be passed the new state from running the first computation, so we end up 'threading the state':

 fThenG :: (s -&gt; (a, s)) -&gt; (a -&gt; s -&gt; (b, s)) -&gt; s -&gt; (b, s)
 fThenG f g s =
   let (v,  s' ) = f s    -- run f with our initial state s.
       (v', s&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;) = g v s' -- run g with the new state s' and the result of f, v.
   in (v', s&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt;)           -- return the latest state and the result of g

All this 'plumbing' can be nicely hidden by using the State monad. The type constructor &lt;code&gt;State&lt;/code&gt; takes two type parameters: the type of its environment (internal state), and the type of its output. (Even though the new state comes ''last'' in the result pair, the state type must come ''first'' in the type parameters, since the 'real' monad is bound to some particular type of state but lets the result type vary.) So &lt;code&gt;State s a&lt;/code&gt; indicates a stateful computation which depends on, and can modify, some internal state of type &lt;code&gt;s&lt;/code&gt;, and has a result of type &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt;. How is it defined? Well, simply as a function that takes some state and returns a pair of (value, new state):

 newtype State s a = State (s -&gt; (a, s))

The above example of &lt;code&gt;fThenG&lt;/code&gt; is, in fact, the definition of &lt;code&gt;&gt;&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; for the State monad, which you probably remember from the first monads chapter.

=== The meaning of return ===
We mentioned earlier that &lt;code&gt;return x&lt;/code&gt; was the computation that 'did nothing' and just returned &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;. This idea only really starts to take on any meaning in monads with side-effects, like State. That is, computations in State have the opportunity to change the outcome of later computations by modifying the internal state. It's a similar situation with IO (because, of course, IO is just a special case of State). 

&lt;code&gt;return x&lt;/code&gt; doesn't do this. A computation produced by &lt;code&gt;return&lt;/code&gt; generally won't have any side-effects. The monad law &lt;tt&gt;return x &gt;&gt;= f == f x&lt;tt&gt; basically guarantees this, for most uses of the term 'side-effect'.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Shorthand is an abbreviated symbolic writing method that increases speed or brevity of writing as compared to a normal method of writing a language. Shorthand was used widely in the past, before the invention of recording and dictation machines. The advent of personal computers and laptop computers has dealt another blow to shorthand writing; it is not uncommon for students to take notes directly on their tablet PCs these days.

Surprisingly, though, shorthand hasn’t vanished altogether. A steady number of people still enjoy writing shorthand. With the “professionals” moving on to more high-tech means of note-taking, Shorthand is used more and more by “amateurs”: all kinds of people, often with a fancy for personal efficiency, use shorthand for incidental note-taking during classes, meetings, or any other situation. This shift from professional to amateur use is reflected by a shift in popularity, from systems that give the maximum number of words-per-minute (WPM), to systems with a more gentle learning curve that still yield fair performance with little training.

== Contemporary Shorthand Systems ==
Many systems of shorthand exist. A lot of information on various systems and their history can be found on the Internet, for example on [[wikipedia:Shorthand|wikipedia]], so we won’t go into much detail here. However, I feel that no book on shorthand is complete without mentioning at least the following systems:

;Pitman Shorthand: [[wikipedia:Pitman shorthand|Pitman Shorthand]] was first introduced in 1837 by [[wikipedia:Sir Isaac Pitman|Sir Isaac Pitman]], and has been improved many times since. It is mentioned here because it was, for a long time, the most commonly used shorthand system in the English speaking world, and it’s the basis of many modern shorthand systems. With its rich history, Pitman has a loyal group of practitioners, and much information about the system can be found on the Internet.
:Pitman uses the thickness of a stroke to indicate voicing (voiced consonants such as /b/ and /d/ are written with heavier lines than unvoiced ones such as /p/ and /t/). While line thickness can readily be varied when writing with a fountain pen or goose feather, modern writing tools, such as pencils, fineliners and ballpoints can only vary line thickness with more difficulty.
:Pitman Shorthand is a [[wikipedia:Phonetic|phonetic]] system; the symbols do not represent letters, but rather sounds, and words are, for the most part, written as they are spoken.
;Gregg Shorthand: [[wikipedia:Gregg shorthand|Gregg Shorthand]] was invented by [[wikipedia:John Robert Gregg|John Robert Gregg]] in 1888, and is the most popular form of pen stenography in the United States and its Spanish adaptation is fairly popular in Latin America. It’s partly phonetic, partly alphabetical. It has been revised countless times, with each revision being simpler and easier to learn than its predecessor, with the exception of the most recent revision in the year 2000.
;Teeline Shorthand: [[wikipedia:Teeline shorthand|Teeline Shorthand]] was developed in 1968 by [[wikipedia:James Hill|James Hill]], a teacher of Pitman Shorthand. It’s the most commonly used system within the Commonwealth, and is gaining popularity in the United States and Canada. It’s a purely alphabetical system. Teeline is a typical example of the modern trend towards systems that, while less efficient, are much easier to learn than the “classical” 19th century systems.

== Phonetic versus Alphabetic ==
{{RightHalf|'''Intermezzo: Spelling Reforms'''&lt;br /&gt;
In some languages there’s a very strict correspondence between spelling and pronunciation. Finnish, Turkish and Spanish are examples of languages with very close correspondence between written characters and pronounced phonemes. Even French, with its many silent letters and elision, has rules on pronunciation which allow pronunciation be inferred from spelling fairly accurately. Other languages, notably logographic languages such as Chinese, lack all correspondance between orthography and pronunciation.&lt;br /&gt;
After the invention of the printing press in the 1440s, most European languages have undergone one or more spelling reforms, often with the goal of making the spelling more consistent, more phonetic, and easier to learn. English spelling, by contrast, has been mostly fixed since the 1440s, i.e before most of the [[wikipedia:Great Vowel Shift|Great Vowel Shift]] which was never incorporated in English spelling. This has resulted in a spelling that is currently only about 40% phonetic.}}

If you’re just starting to learn Shorthand, and haven’t decided upon which system to learn yet, you probably can’t go wrong with either Gregg or Teeline. If you were to browse the Internet for a comparison of these two systems, you’d soon find out that the question “Which one’s better?” is subject of furious debate among the last shorthand evangelists, fueled by the fact that these two systems are so fundamentally different: Teeline is strictly alphabetic, while Gregg is (mostly) phonetic. Why is this such a big deal?

In contrast to what teachers may have told you, English spelling is neither logical or consistent. Just think about how the words ''straight'', ''streight'', ''strait'' and ''strate'' all sound the same, or how ''tough'', ''through'' and ''dough'' all sound completely different. It has been argued that when designing a new orthography (as many shorthand systems do), there’s no need to maintain a one-on-one correspondence between the new orthography and orthodox spelling with its classical 26-character Roman alphabet. In fact, the convoluted and often superfluous orthodox spelling is in direct conflict with shorthand’s goals of speed and economy of writing. In consequence, many shorthand systems are more or less phonetic.

Unfortunately, phonetic orthography comes with its own set of problems.&lt;br/&gt;
First, Modern English is pronounced in various ways; there are important differences between General American, British Received Pronunciation and Australian English. At least four major dialects are spoken in the United States alone. So if spelling were to follow pronunciation, the question arises: ''whose'' pronunciation? For personal note-taking, a sufficient answer would be: ''my'' pronunciation. But such a system rids itself of all claims to uniform spelling.&lt;br/&gt;
Second, Modern English dialects have over 40 different sounds (closer to 50 according to some linguists), which would require an alphabet of as many characters. QuickScript, with its 43 characters, is an example of such an alphabet. Writing phonetically feels awkward at first, and requires training. Having 40+ characters only adds to the learning curve.

System Groote is “mostly phonetic”: it's definitely more phonetic than alphabetic, but it cuts a few corners to overcome some of the problems inherent to a strictly phonetic approach.

== Target Audience ==
System Groote is originally a Dutch shorthand system, invented in 1899 by A.W. Groote. It was adapted by Groote himself to English, German and French, but in my opinion too “Dutch-centric”. Native speakers of the target language would be confused by many peculiarities in the system, that only make sense in a Dutch context.

Learning shorthand requires the investment of a time and energy. To people fluent with Dutch Groote, it’s a big investment to adopt a completely different system, such as Gregg or Teeline, to take notes in English efficiently. The primary target audience of this text are people who’d like to learn a single shorthand system to take notes in both Dutch and English efficiently.

I think, however, that system Groote is a worthy alternative to the Gregg and Teeline shorthand systems. With that in mind, this book is written for anyone who’d like to learn how to write English shorthand.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==French pronunciation consistency?==
I wonder where this claim of French having consistent prononciation comes from. As far as I can tell, there are plenty of exceptions to any rules you might think of. 

e.g. What rule explains the difference in the first vowel sounds between mauvais (/mɔvɛ/), mauve (/mov/) and mauviette (/movjɛt/)? The pronunciation of &quot;os&quot; is also something of a one-off, being /ɔs/ or /o/ for the singular and plural forms respectively. [[User:Recent Runes|Recent Runes]] ([[User talk:Recent Runes|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Recent Runes|contribs]]) 20:41, 30 April 2012 (UTC)

:Thanks for this comment. I think the original claim was too strong. I’ve tuned it down a bit:

:Would you feel more comfortable with this phrasing? Thanks again for taking the time to review my text, it’s much appreciated. [[User:Pietervanbeek|Pietervanbeek]] ([[User talk:Pietervanbeek|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pietervanbeek|contribs]]) 20:50, 30 April 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Most traits are not mendelian (due to the influence of a single gene), but are multifactorial

'''Multifactorial inheritance''' definition from genereviews.org: The combined contribution of one or more often unspecified genes and environmental factors, often unknown, in the causation of a particular trait or disease.

Many people use the term &quot;complex&quot; to refer to multifactorial inheritance. People also use the terms &quot;polygenic&quot; and &quot;multifactorial&quot; synonymously when really, they are not. Polygenic refers to a trait that is due to multiple genetic factors (many genes). Although it usually does, by definition &quot;polygenic&quot; traits may not have an environmental component. An example of this is eye color. Multifactorial traits, on the other hand, may be due to only one gene but always are influenced by environmental factors as well as (the) inherited factor(s). 

The definition of &quot;'''polygenic'''&quot; by genereview.org: A condition caused by the additive contributions of mutations in multiple genes at different loci. Loci are locations on a chromosome.

Multifactorial inheritance is an important and fundamental concept. Other variations from Mendelian inheritance are:

'''Codominance'''

When both alleles are equally represented and neither overpowers the other; two different alleles are both expressed in a heterozygote. The phenotypes mix in a way that both appear at the same time, intact, and are not blended. An example of this is the ABO blood antigens.

'''Codominance vs incomplete dominance:''' if mixing black fur with white fur makes pups with gray fur, it is incomplete dominance. If mixing black fur with white fur creates pups that have mottled black and white fur, it is codominance (like black and white cows). Complete dominance: One allele is expressed while the other isn't expressed at all. At the level of the body, Tay-Sachs disease is completely dominant. Heterozygotes (&quot;Tt&quot; genotype) have no symptoms of Tay-Sachs disease. The TSD gene codes for an enzyme. Heterozygous TSD carriers (&quot;Tt&quot; genotype) have half the normal level of enzyme activity. At the level of the enzyme activity, carriers of Tay-Sachs show incomplete dominance. Since this half level of enzyme activity has no effect on health, at the level of the body Tay-Sachs disease shows complete dominance.
Epistasis

One gene masks or otherwise effects the phenotype of another gene. Note, this involves 2 different genes, not 2 allele of the same gene. The expression of one gene is modified or blocked by the product of a different gene. An example of this is the Bombay Phenotype. Also, if a person has achondroplasia, then the mutant allele that causes dwarfism alters the height genes that would have been expressed. If a person has albinism, that alters the effects of the pigment genes that would have been expressed. The genome is a complex system and epistasis is not actually an exception but it is the rule. Many different genes are turned on and off by products of other genes to enable to cells to express the proteins we need to in a particular cell at a particular time. Epistasis leads to variability in phenotypes, even in a family where 2 people affected with a disease have the same mutation. Those 2 relatives may have the same disease - causing mutation but have or not have other alleles of different genes that exacerbate or reduce the effect of the mutant allele.
Genetic Heterogeneity

'''Genetic Heterogeneity''' is when different genes produce the same phenotype (not different alleles but different GENES). Individuals with identical phenotypes may reflect different genetic causes. In this case, a person who is genotype &quot;AAbb&quot; could have the same phenotype as a person who is genotype &quot;aaBB.&quot; Example: Hearing loss (deafness) There are 132 different forms of hearing loss. Many different genes, which code for different parts of hearing, can cause deafness.
Incomplete Dominance

'''Incomplete dominance''' occurs when one allele is not completely dominant over the other. The phenotype of heterozygotes (&quot;Aa&quot;) is intermediate between that of either homozygote (&quot;AA&quot; and &quot;aa&quot;). The heterozygote phenotype is a blend of the two homozygous phenotypes. Familial Hypercholestrolemia (FH) is an example of a disease with incomplete dominance. This is because individuals who have no mutant allele of the FH gene are unaffected, heterozygotes with one mutation are moderately affected, and people with 2 mutant alleles are severely affected. The heterozygote phenotype is a blending of the two homozygous phenotypes.
Genomic Imprinting

Some regions of DNA are expressed differently when they are inherited from the mother versus the father. These regions of DNA are &quot;imprinted.&quot; I think of it as &quot;programming.&quot; The genes are expressed one way if they arrived in the fetus from the egg and the exact same genes are expressed a different way if they arrived in the fetus from the sperm. Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome is an example of a disease that can result from genomic imprinting.
Lethal allele combinations

'''Lethal allele combinations''' is when having the homozygous genotype is lethal. The ratio of affected to unaffected is skewed because one of the genotype possibilities does not survive.

    Parent's genotypes: Aa X Aa
        Offspring genotypes: AA, Aa, aA, and aa
    If the &quot;AA&quot; genotype is lethal then the offspring phenotype ratio is:
        2/3 phenotype of Aa or aA genotype
        1/3 recessive (&quot;aa&quot;) genotype
    If the &quot;aa&quot; genotype is lethal, then the offspring phenotype ratio is:
        1/3 dominant (&quot;AA&quot;) genotype, 2/3 phenotype of Aa or aA genotype

'''Mitochondrial Inheritance'''

The mitochondria is unique. It is an organelle that converts energy to a form the cell can use. The mitochondria has its own DNA! Most DNA is in the nucleus (in chromosomes). The mitochondrial DNA is in the mitochondria. People can have mutations in the DNA in their mitochondria. These mutations can interfere with the function of the mitochondria and cause diseases. &quot;Mitochondrial diseases&quot; are a category with many different diseases that are due to abnormalities of the mitochondria, many of which are due to mutations in mtDNA. mtDNA disease pedigrees: passed to ALL of the children of the affected mother and NONE of the children of the affected son. This is b/c the mitochondria in the zygote (fertilized egg) are all from the egg and none are from the sperm. In other words, mitochondrial Genes are maternally inherited. This is very useful for ancestry studies. Mitochondrial DNA has a higher mutation rate than nuclear DNA; the repair mechanisms the nuclear DNA uses are not present in the mitochondria. There are many mitochondria per cell, therefore you see heteroplasmy (some mitochondria in a cell have a mutation and others do not). An example of this is Leber's Optic Atrophy. A defect in the gene can produce other symptoms such as vision impairments, which can begin in early adulthood.
Multiple Alleles Specifying One Trait

Each person has 2 alleles for any autosomal gene: one is inherited from their mother and the other is inherited from their father. There are 2 alleles per gene per person, but there are many more alleles per gene in gene pool. Recall that the &quot;gene pool&quot; consists of the alleles for a gene in an entire population. For many genes, there are over 1000 different alleles in a gene pool. There are many different alleles that are just &quot;polymorphisms&quot; and do not affect the function of a protein. In other words, there is not just one &quot;normal&quot; allele but actually many varieties of &quot;normal&quot; alleles. Of the mutations that are not benign, not all are equally harmful. Some alleles cause mild changes in the protein, others cause moderate or severe changes in the protein, and some alleles make the protein completely non-functional or absent. The fact that there are many different allele combinations means that a person can have 2 mild mutations and have mild disease, and another person can have severe mutations in the same gene and have severe disease. Most diseases have multiple alleles.
Phenocopies

A &quot;'''phenocopy'''&quot; is when a phenotype mimics a genetic disease but actually has an environmental cause. A person who is deaf due to exposure to the rubella virus in utero is a phenocopy of genetic deafness. Another example: phocomelia (a limb deformity translation &quot;flipper-like limbs&quot;) due thalidomide exposure in utero looks like the genetic disease Roberts syndrome.
Phenocopies- environmental trait that appears to be inherited. Example is birth defect from the drug thalidomide. Infection:AIDS that was acquired from mother. Someone who has failure to thrive due to malnutrition may look a lot like a child who has cystic fibrosis and does not have access to medical care to treat digestive dysfunction.
Pleitropy

'''Pleitropy''' is when a single gene disorder effects more than one organ/organ system and leads to various different symptoms. (at times these symptoms seem to be distinct conditions rather than symptoms for a single disorder). This happens because a gene that controls several functions will have more than one effect. The product of that gene may play a role in many different organs. Example: Osteogenesis Imperfecta. People with OI have multiple fractures. The gene at fault codes for collagen, a major component of connect tissue. However, people with OI may also have a blue tint to the whites of their eyes and hearing loss. Many single gene disorders demonstrate pleiotropy, leading to a &quot;syndrome.&quot; The &quot;syndrome&quot; refers to many manifestations all stemming from the same underlying cause.
Reduced / Incomplete Penetrance

'''Penetrance and expressitivity''' describe degrees of expression of a single gene. Incomplete Penetrance: A gene that is not phenotypically represented by all family members who have the mutation in that gene. Penetrance is ALL OR NONE expression, not DEGREE. In incomplete penetrance, some people who have the genotype have NO expression of the expected phenotype. An example would be Polydactyly. Not all affected individuals with polydactyly genotype have extra digits. Another example is Von Hippel-Lindau Disease, a disease that greatly increases the chance of developing cancer. Not everyone with the mutation that causes VHL gets cancer. Those that don't show non-penetrance. Complete penetrance is less common that incomplete penetrance. Huntingtons disease shows complete penetrance. HD is an autosomal dominant adult-onset neurological disorder. If you die before you are 40 years it LOOKS like incomplete penetrance b/c you didn't live long enough to develop symptoms. BUT if you live to be 80 y of age and are genotype &quot;Hh,&quot; you WILL get the disease. It has complete penetrance.
Uniparental Disomy

When a child inherits two copies of the same gene from one parent and none from the other parent. Means &quot;two bodies from one parent&quot;. Prader Willi syndrome and Angelman syndrome are examples of diseases that can result from UPD.
Variable Expressivity
'''
Variable Expressivity''' is when symptoms and severity vary between affected individuals. &quot;Expressivity&quot; refers to the severity or extent of symptoms. The expression of a mutant allele may vary due to multiple different mutations with different severities, and also doe to genetic background -- the influence of all the other genes that individual has influencing the phenotype--, and also environmental influences modifying the effects of the mutation. Example: Polydactyly (again). Some affected individuals may have one extra finger while others have multiple extra fingers and toes.

&lt;noinclude&gt;{{TOC right}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
=== Flood ===
A flood is a natural disaster caused by too much [[w:rain|rain]] or [[w:water|water]] in a location, and could be caused by many different sets of conditions. Floods can be caused by prolonged rainfall from a [[w:storm|storm]], including [[w:thunderstorm|thunderstorm]]s, rapid melting of large amounts of [[w:snow|snow]], or [[w:river|river]]s which swell from excess precipitation upstream and cause widespread damage to areas downstream, or less frequently the bursting of man-made dams. A [[w:river|river]] which floods particularly often is the [[w:Huang He|Huang He]] in [[w:China|China]], and a particularly damaging flood was the [[w:Great Flood of 1993|Great Flood of 1993]].

==== Flash flood ====

=== Drowning ===
[[w:Drowning|Drowning]] is caused by suffocation when a liquid causes interruption of the body's absorption of oxygen from the air leading to asphyxia. The primary cause of death is hypoxia and acidosis leading to cardiac arrest.

[[Image:Drowning child warning.jpg|thumb|200px|Children have drowned in buckets and toilets]]
Drowning is one of the major causes of death for children under 14 years old. Children have drowned in wading pools and even bath tubs. There is also a correlation of the rate of drowning in populations around the world and their access to water, the climate and the national swimming culture. For example, typically the United Kingdom suffers 450 drownings per annum or 1 per 150,000. Of population whereas the United States suffers 6,500 drownings or around 1 per 50,000 of population. 

So the risk or drowning seems related to the situation and awareness of the danger allied to the capacity correctly ascertain one's capacity to extrude oneself from the danger of drowning.

==== Prevention ====
The reduction of drowning through education has become a significant element of school curricula and is integrated into most water sports training. The elements incorporated into this training vary according to the particular context. 

Most current training emphasizes the need to: 
* Learn to [[w:swimming|swim]]
* Learn and practice water rescue.
* Know personal strengths and limitations in the water.
* Stay within one's depth unless a strong swimmer. 
* Keep a watch out for others.
* Swim with company, finding a buddy, children to swim with a responsible adult.
* Ensure that children have competent supervision in or near water.
* Swim in areas supervised by [[w:lifeguard|lifeguard]]s in preference to areas without. 
* Be cautious and very conservative when swimming at  night.
* Ensure that boats are reliable, properly loaded and that functional emergency equipment is onboard.
* Wear a properly fitting [[w:lifejacket|lifejacket]] while enjoying water sports such as [[w:sailing|sailing]], [[w:surfing|surfing]] or [[w:canoeing|canoeing]].
* Pay attention to the weather, tides and water conditions, especially currents. Currents always look weaker from the outside!
* Have a [[w:Pool fence|fence]] around swimming pools.
* Consider cold-acclimatisation training for swimming in very cold water, by joining a [[w:Ice swimming|winter swimming]] club.

Most current training emphasizes the need to avoid: 
* Swimming while drunk or on drugs.
* Using [[w:hyperventilation|hyperventilate]] to extend a breath-hold dive, see [[w:deep water blackout|deep]] and [[w:shallow water blackout|shallow water blackout]]
* Relying on swimming aids as they may fail.
* Playing games that will put your life, or others', at risk. 
* Pretending to be a drowning victim, unless '''ALL''' bystanders are informed that this is an exercise.
* Diving into water where the bottom cannot clearly be seen or depth determined.
* Walking on ice unless it is known absolutely that the ice is thick enough over the entire route.
* Handling electrical devices in or near the water.
* Exceeding personal limits.
* Swimming in cold water unless first, fully cold-acclimatised and experienced winter swimmer.

==== Drowning risk situations ====
[[Image:Hanakapiai Beach Warning Sign Only.jpg|thumb|200px|A sign with 83 [[w:tally mark|tally mark]]s warns hikers on the trail to [[w:Hanakapiai Beach|Hanakapiai Beach]], Hawaii.]]
Most drownings occur in water, freshwater (rivers and lakes, pools, etc) or in [[w:seawater|seawater]], drownings in other fluids are rare and are often industrial accidents.

Common conditions that may lead to drowning include but are not limited to:
* Water conditions exceed the swimmer's ability; - turbulent or fast water, water out of depth, falling through ice, [[w:rip current|rip current]]s, undertows, [[w:Current (water)|currents]], [[w:wave|wave]]s and [[w:Eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddies]].
* Entrapment; - physically unable to get out of the situation because of a lack of an escape route, snagging or by being hampered by clothing or equipment.
* Impaired judgment and physical incapacitation arising from the use of drugs, principally alcohol.
* Incapacitation arising from the conditions; - cold ([[w:hypothermia|hypothermia]]), [[w:Shock (medical)|shock]], [[w:injury|injury]] or [[w:exhaustion|exhaustion]].
* Incapacitation arising from acute illness while swimming; - [[w:myocardial infarction|heart attack]], [[w:seizure|seizure]] or [[w:stroke|stroke]].
* Forcible submersion by another person; - [[w:murder|murder]] or misguided children's play.
* Blackout underwater after rapid breathing to extend a breath-hold dive; - [[w:shallow water blackout|shallow water blackout]].
* Blackout on ascent from a deep breath-hold dive due to latent hypoxia; - [[w:deep water blackout|deep water blackout]].

People have drowned in as little as 30mm of water lying face down, in one case in a wheel rut. Children have drowned in baths, buckets and toilets; inebriates or those under the influence of drugs have died in puddles. For a more detailed list of causes see [[w:swimming|swimming]].

==== Rescue and treatment ====

Many pools and designated bathing areas either have lifeguards, a [[w:pool safety camera|pool safety camera]] system for local or remote monitoring, or computer aided drowning detection. However, bystanders play an important role in drowning detection and either intervention or the notification of authorities by phone or alarm. No person should attempt a rescue that is beyond his or her ability or level of training.

If a drowning occurs or a swimmer becomes missing, bystanders should immediately call for help. The [[w:lifeguard|lifeguard]] should be called if present. If not, [[w:emergency medical services|emergency medical services]] and [[w:paramedics|paramedics]] should be contacted as soon as possible. 

The first step in rescuing a drowning victim is to ensure your own safety. Then bring the victim's mouth and nose above the water surface. For further treatment it is advisable to remove the victim from the water. Conscious victims may [[w:panic|panic]] and thus hinder rescue efforts. Often, a victim will cling to the rescuer and try to pull himself out of the water, submerging the rescuer in the process. To avoid this, it is recommended that the rescuer approach the panicking victim with a [[w:buoyancy|buoyant]] object, or from behind, twisting the victim's arm on the back to restrict movement. If the victim pushes the rescuer under water, the rescuer should dive downwards to escape the victim.

Actively drowning victims do not usually call out for help simply because they lack the air to do so. It is necessary to breathe to yell. Human physiology does not allow the body to waste any air when starving for it. They rarely raise their hands out of the water. They use the surface of the water to push themselves up in an attempt to get their mouths out of the water. Lifting arms out of the water always pushes the head down. Head low in the water, occasionally bobbing up and down is another common sign of active drowning. 

There can be splashing involved during drowning, usually a butterfly like stroke where the hands barely clear the waters surface, and sometimes victims can look like they are climbing an invisible ladder in the water.

Extenuating factors such as increased levels of stress, secondary injuries, and environmental factors can increase the likelihood of distress and/or drowning in persons who end up overboard. It is important that you recognize the behaviors associated with aquatic distress and drowning, so you can make informed decisions during emergencies.

Signs or behaviors associated with drowning or near-drowning:
* Head low in the water, mouth at water level
* Head tilted back with mouth open
* Eyes glassy and empty, unable to focus
* Eyes closed
* Hair over forehead or eyes
* Hyperventilating or gasping
* Trying to swim in a particular direction but not making headway
* Trying to roll over on the back to float
* Uncontrollable movement of arms and legs, rarely out of the water.

After successfully approaching the victim, negatively buoyant objects such as a weight belt are removed. The priority is then to transport the victim to the water's edge in preparation for removal from the water. The victim is turned on his or her back. A secure grip is used to tow panicking victims from behind, with both rescuer and victim laying on their back, and the rescuer swimming a [[w:breaststroke|breaststroke]] kick. A cooperative victim may be towed in a similar fashion held at the armpits, and the victim may assist with a breaststroke kick. An unconscious victim may be pulled in a similar fashion held at the chin and cheeks, ensuring that the mouth and nose is well above the water. 

There is also the option of pushing a cooperative victim lying on his or her back with the rescuer swimming on his or her belly and pushing the feet of the victim, or both victim and rescuer lying on the belly, with the victim hanging from the shoulders of the rescuers. This has the advantage that the rescuer can use both arms and legs to swim breaststroke, but if the victim pushes his or her head above the water, the rescuer may get pushed down. This method is often used to retrieve tired swimmers. If the victim wears [[w:lifejacket|lifejacket]], [[w:buoyancy compensator|buoyancy compensator]], or other flotation device that stabilizes his or her position with the face up, only one hand of the rescuer is needed to pull the victim, and the other hand may provide forward movement or may help in rescue breathing while swimming, using for example a snorkel. 

Special care has to be taken for victims with suspected spinal injuries, and a back board (spinal board) may be needed for the rescue. In water, [[w:cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] is ineffective, and the goal should be to bring the victim to a stable ground quickly and then to start CPR.

If the approach to a stable ground includes the edge of a pool without steps or the edge of a boat, special techniques have been developed for moving the victim over the obstacle. For pools, the rescuer stands outside, holds the victim by his or her hands, with the victim's back to the edge. The rescuer then dips the victim into the water quickly to achieve an upward speed of the body, aiding with the lifting of the body over the edge. Lifting a victim over the side of a boat may require more than one person. Special techniques are also used by the [[w:coast guard|coast guard]] and military for helicopter rescues.

After reaching dry ground, all victims should be referred to medical assistance, especially if unconscious or if even small amounts of water have entered the lungs. An unconscious victim may need [[w:artificial respiration|artificial respiration]] or CPR. 

The [[w:abdominal thrusts|Heimlich maneuver]] is not recommended; the technique may have relevance in situations where airways are obstructed by solids but not fluids. Performing the maneuver on drowning victims not only delays ventilation but may induce vomiting, which if [http://www.thefreedictionary.com/dict.asp?Word=aspirated aspirated] will place the patient in a far worse situation. Moreover, the use of the Heimlich maneuver in any choking situation, involving solids or fluids, has become controversial and is generally no longer taught. For more information on this debate refer to the article [[w:Henry Heimlich|Henry Heimlich]].

100% oxygen is highly recommended, including intubation if necessary. Treatment for [[w:hypothermia|hypothermia]] may also be necessary. Water in the stomach need not be removed, except in the case of pediatric drownings as a gastric distension can limit movement of the lungs. Other injuries should also be treated (see '''[[w:first aid|first aid]]'''). Victims that are alert, awake, and intact have  nearly a 100% survival rate.

Drowning victims should be treated even if they have been submerged for a long time. The rule &quot;no patient should be pronounced dead until warm and dead&quot; applies. Children in particular have a good chance of survival in water up to 3 minutes, or 10 minutes in cold water (10 to 15 °C or 50 to 60 °F). Submersion in cold water can slow the [[w:metabolism|metabolism]] drastically. There are rare but documented cases of survivable submersion for extreme lengths of time. In one case a child named Michelle Funk survived drowning after being submerged in cold water for 70 minutes. In another, an 18 year old man survived 38 minutes under water. This is known as ''cold water drowning''.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Control.Monad ==

Note to self, and to anyone interested: this is potentially a great place to introduce the &quot;control structure&quot; functions like &lt;code&gt;sequence&lt;/code&gt; (cf. SPJ's Awkward Squad paper). --[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 05:40, 1 May 2012 (UTC)
: Now done. It is a really brief introduction, but at least it will ensure readers are aware of &lt;code&gt;sequence&lt;/code&gt; and friends sooner rather than later. [[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 04:15, 14 October 2013 (UTC)

== Stop it with the impurity / side-effects talk ==

I stripped out all that junk in my recent rewrite. Monads are ''not'' impure and IO is ''not'' about side-effects. It's silly to say that running a program causes side-effects. Nothing in Haskell is impure or causes side-effects. Monads don't help us do side-effects. Monads allow pure mathematical manipulations of bits of Haskell that create actions in what the program actually does. Nobody ever claims that the entire program itself is a pure function. The program itself is a program that is compiled into machine code. It's the internal Haskell stuff (including the Monads) that is purely functional. I'm not an expert, and I'd be happy to see others improve on my writing (please!), but don't put in confusing and erroneous junk about impurity. Thanks.
[[User:Backfromquadrangle|Backfromquadrangle]] ([[User talk:Backfromquadrangle|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Backfromquadrangle|contribs]]) 02:49, 10 May 2014 (UTC)

:I think we have to be careful not to go overboard. Monads are clearly not impure, and framing &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; in terms of the impure/pure dichotomy is probably not wise pedagogically. However, proscribing talk of side-effects is a step too far, as &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; is definitely about side-effects. After such a strong claim I need to argue my case properly, so please forgive my usual long-windedness.

:Talking about &quot;effects&quot; in Haskell is unproblematic if by that we refer to the effects of applying a function in an applicative and/or monadic context which do not show up in the underlying (&quot;contained&quot;, &quot;wrapped&quot;, etc.) values of the functor. Now, a ''side-effect'' is something quite different; namely, something that can't be observed in Haskell at all. As far as the Haskell code is concerned, it doesn't matter what &lt;code&gt;putStrLn&lt;/code&gt; displays; the effect is not detectable. Similarly, that &lt;code&gt;getLine&lt;/code&gt; affects the state of the terminal is not observable; also, the further consequence of a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; being delivered, seemingly out of thin air, is entirely opaque.

:Effects and side-effects, as defined here, are quite different concepts; however, there is a parallel in that both involve things that are not directly observable. &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; is a fruit of that parallel. Notionally, &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; actions involve functorial effects, in a way that is captured by the state-of-the-world interpretation (even though, as you point out in the text, that interpretation should not be taken too seriously). Beyond that, however, an &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; action brings forth actual side-effects. We will find them if we look not only above the purely functional implementation (we compose actions so that things happen in the real world) but also below it (when the actions are evaluated by the running program, things will happen in the real world); the Haskell implementation itself, however, has no access to them. &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; allows the sleight of hand of using functorial, purely functional effects to model and specify side-effects.

:Once again, we are faced with many overlapping levels of implementation and interpretation, leading to the ambivalence that allows us to talk of side-effects in a purely functional language. The same happens we try to contrast &quot;pure&quot; and &quot;impure&quot;. {{nowrap|&lt;code&gt;fmap toUpper getLine&lt;/code&gt;}} is certainly a referentially transparent value; however, when we use it we aim at a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt; which is not referentially transparent at all, and that matters in practice. From a very useful point of view, &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; is just another abstract, closed functor; and yet, it ''also'' makes sense to say that &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; is a means to taint impurity. A curious, in-the-wild example of that ambivalence can be found at the [http://hackage.haskell.org/package/pipes-4.1.0/docs/Pipes-Tutorial.html official Pipes tutorial]. It begins &quot;Conventional Haskell stream programming forces you to choose only two of the following three features: (*) Effects (*) Streaming (*) Composability&quot;. By &quot;effects&quot;, Gabriel Gonzalez means purely functional monadic effects, as Pipes is meant to provide a robust alternative to &lt;code&gt;mapM&lt;/code&gt;-like functions. However, given that I/O streaming is one of the main use cases of the library, he also means side-effects, as can be seen a few sentences later: &quot;If you sacrifice ''Composability'' you write a tightly coupled read, transform, and write loop in IO, which is streaming and effectful, but is not modular or separable.&quot; The ambiguity is not bothersome because both meanings are reasonable, and also because they meet in &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt;.

:The notion of side-effects is part of everyday talk about Haskell, and not just due to hand-waving of the sort you removed from the chapter. The &lt;code&gt;base&lt;/code&gt; documentation talks about them ({{Haskell lib|p=base|v=4.7.0.0|System|IO|Unsafe}}: &quot;For this to be safe, the IO computation should be free of side effects and independent of its environment.&quot;); so do Eugenio Moggi ([http://www.disi.unige.it/person/MoggiE/ftp/ic91.pdf Notions of computation as monads]: &quot;We give few notions of computation in the category of sets: [...] side effects &lt;math&gt;T A = (A \times S)^{S}&lt;/math&gt;, where [...]&quot;) and Simon Peyton Jones ([http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/simonpj/papers/marktoberdorf/mark.pdf Awkward Squad]: &quot;The action &lt;code&gt;(return v)&lt;/code&gt; is an action that does no I/O, and immediately returns &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; without having any side effects.&quot;). While I agree with a move towards emphasising the similarities between monads and &lt;code&gt;IO&lt;/code&gt; and the rest of Haskell rather than the differences, I do not think eliminating all mention of side-effects and impurity is a good thing, as those terms point clearly to a real aspect of programming in Haskell.

:P.S.: The wall of text just above is not meant as criticism of your rewrite; overall I think the chapter is a lot better now. I just found that the point about terminology was important enough to be discussed at length.

::Thanks, I think your explanation is great. I really never meant that the idea of &quot;side-effects&quot; (or the term, for that matter) was inherently a problem. So I retract my hard view. I'm not opposed to talking about side-effects. I ''oppose'' talking about them as though they challenge Haskell's claims of pure functions or anything. In other words, they are mundane. The framing that associates &quot;side-effects&quot; with weird hand-waving interpretations about the magic of Monads or something is the problem. It's certainly fine to talk about side-effects in the sense that obviously the IO actions doing stuff out in the world are obviously side-effects. But besides stating that, so what? I.e. I don't like the phrasing that was like &quot;oh! But ''this'' is a side-effect! Golly wow!&quot;. But sure, fine to actually just talk about them plainly for what they are. Thanks for your help clarifying!

Dear professor Dang,
My last edits will probably be tonight so let me know if parts need explaination or improvement.

== Style == 

Isn't it bad style to write
do bd0 &lt;- return bd
Instead of
do let bd0 = bd
?

:: I can't see any reason to put in these redundant return clauses that have no effect. I talked with others about this even. I'm removing them from here and already removed the same clutter from  other monad examples in the previous chapters. [[User:Backfromquadrangle|Backfromquadrangle]] ([[User talk:Backfromquadrangle|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Backfromquadrangle|contribs]]) 06:43, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

== Removing regressive examples of pre-monad approaches ==

It seems awfully confusing to me to be learning about monads and have long sections that go on about how to achieve things with clunky code that is redundant to monads. We spent the time to learn how monads work, now is the time to understand and use them. I don't want to see how to make do without them. I'm removing the extraneous stuff and sticking to explaining how to actually use monads. It is fair at this point to assume that readers understand something about what monads are and why they work. They just need to keep experiencing them to get comfortable. Avoiding them and then re-explaining them is mostly confusing. [[User:Backfromquadrangle|Backfromquadrangle]] ([[User talk:Backfromquadrangle|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Backfromquadrangle|contribs]]) 06:43, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

:That is the right thing to do. The issues were due to historical accident: those chapters about common monads came into being when the old Understanding Monads and its deprecated follow-up [[Haskell/Advanced monads|Advanced Monads]] were exploded, and they were never fully tuned to the new surrounding text. Until now, that is :)--[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 15:30, 2 May 2014 (UTC)

== Lousy word problems ==

The word problems were too specific and too contrived and even innacurate and the code then basically avoided addressing them in any real way. I simplified them but left in the gist.

== Better explanation needed for how do notation does binding ==

I get that do notation does binding, but where the variable assignment fits in confuses me. The variable must be non-monadic (not a list in this case), but yet there must be able to be multiple items (given a list with many elements) that the same placeholder variable stands for. Somehow this should be made more clear and explicit to understand how do is syntactic sugar for bind.[[User:Backfromquadrangle|Backfromquadrangle]] ([[User talk:Backfromquadrangle|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Backfromquadrangle|contribs]]) 06:41, 5 May 2014 (UTC)

:The gist of it is that when you use the left arrow you are actually defining a lambda to be used with &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt;, with the variable standing for the argument and the rest of the do-block being the result value. For the list monad, the magic is at &lt;code&gt;(&gt;&gt;=)&lt;/code&gt; being (flipped) &lt;code&gt;concatMap&lt;/code&gt;, which implies the lambda will be mapped over the list at the right of the arrow (from which the multiple items come from).--[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 07:28, 5 May 2014 (UTC)

:: I get that now, but I wonder if there's a way to explain it in the page. Maybe not in a way that's worth the hassle though. [[User:Backfromquadrangle|Backfromquadrangle]] ([[User talk:Backfromquadrangle|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Backfromquadrangle|contribs]]) 08:15, 6 May 2014 (UTC)

:::On being &quot;worth the hassle&quot;, would it be simpler if we just shown the function with explicit binds alongside the do-block version? That might make things clear without needing a meticulous explanation.--[[User:Duplode|Duplode]] ([[User talk:Duplode|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Duplode|contribs]]) 12:54, 6 May 2014 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>add workaround for editing DOB</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">There are at least two ways to edit a subject's date of birth and fields such as enrollment date (see the [https://mailman.openclinica.com/pipermail/users/2012-May/007065.html OpenClinica Users mailing list thread]).
#At study level you can click &quot;View&quot; for the subject in question, then click &quot;Global Subject Record&quot; below the Visits table and then the &quot;Edit Record&quot; link. The DOB is listed there.
# Via the administration/subjects task menu (click the edit button)

If the date of birth edit does not seem to save (issue seen in 3.1.3.1 and 3.1.4), try the following workaround from this [https://mailman.openclinica.com/pipermail/users/2013-August/008649.html OpenClinica Users mailing list thread]:

{{Quote|text=There actually is a workaround: setting the PersonID as optional in your StudyParameters. Strange thing is that you do not have to fill it in: there will be just a box and even if you leave it empty, you can modify the DoB and then go to the next screen with a Submit-button and all.

Some guidelines:
* if you want to collect DoB on Subject-level, set PersonID to optional
* if you want to use web-services, set gender to required
* if you want to do any validations on DoB or gender, or if yu want to use them in validations of other items, collect them in a CRF}}

Once the date of birth edit is made, the PersonID StudyParameter can be re-set to Not Used.

=== Description ===

In order to improve operationalization and psychometric properties, a market orientation scale (MARKOR) taken from Kohli et al. (1993) is modified. The resulting market orientation scale (MO) has three dimensions: [[Handbook of Management Scales/Intelligence generation|intelligence generation]], intelligence dissemination, and [[Handbook of Management Scales/Responsiveness|responsiveness]].

=== Items ===

*Marketing personnel in our business unit spend time discussing customers' future needs with other functional departments.
*Our business unit periodically circulates documents (e.g., reports, newsletters) that provide information on our customers.
*We have cross-functional meetings very often to discuss market trends and developments (e.g., customers, competition, suppliers).
*We regularly have interdepartmental meetings to update our knowledge of regulatory requirements.
*Technical people in the business unit spend a lot of time sharing information about technology for new products with other departments.
*Market information spreads quickly through all levels in this business unit.

*We poll end users at least once a year to assess the quality of our products and services.
*In our business unit, intelligence on our competitors is generated independently by several departments.
*We periodically review the likely effect of changes in our business environment (e.g., regulation) on customers.
*In this business unit, we frequently collect and evaluate general macro-economic information (e.g., interest rate, exchange rate, GDP, industry growth rate, inflation rate).
*In this business unit, we maintain contacts with ifficials of government and regulatory bodies (e.g., Department of Agriculture, FDA, FTC, Congress) in order to collect and evaluate pertinent information.
*In this business unit, we collect and evaluate information concerning general social trends (e.g., environmental consciousness, emerging lifestyles) that might affect our business.
*In the business unit, we spend time with our suppliers to learn more about various aspects of their business (e.g., manufacturing process, industry practices, clientele).
*In our business unit, only a few people are collecting competitor information. (reverse coded)

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Vowel “a” and half-height consonants =
The title of this chapter mentions ''half-height consonants''. “Half of what height?”, the intelligent reader might wonder.

Well, shorthand is normally written on lined paper. For example, the text “Our Father in heaven, hallowed be thy name” would be written like this: [[Image:{{FULLBOOKNAME}}-Lords Prayer.svg|none]]

Each writing line is divided into four imaginary “quarter-height” parts: [[Image:{{FULLBOOKNAME}}-Lords Prayer w Lines.svg|none]]

All symbols introduced in this chapter are half a line-height tall. And here they are: [[Image:{{FULLBOOKNAME}}-Half Height Symbols.svg|none]]

The first two symbols are written upward, and roughly correspond to character “a”. The first symbol is used for two different sounds:
* '''/ɑː/''' as in '''p&lt;u&gt;al&lt;/u&gt;m, f&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;ther, st&lt;u&gt;ar&lt;/u&gt;.'''
* '''/æ/''' as in '''tr&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;p, b&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;d, c&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;t.'''

All the other symbols are written downward. The first

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Does your major determine your career?==
There are some professions where what you major in really does make a difference, like accounting, engineering, and education. But many careers are not tied directly to a major.&lt;ref name=&quot;pollak2011&quot;&gt;http://www.lindseypollak.com/archives/why-your-college-major-doesn%E2%80%99t-matter&lt;/ref&gt; Employers will be more interested if you have experience in the field. While majoring in that area is helpful, that experience can also come from part-time jobs, extracurricular activities, internships, or volunteering. Employers primarily want to see that a prospective employee knows what he/she is doing. They are also interested in how skilled one is at a certain task or set of tasks. For example, if you want to become a computer programmer but majored in English, it is possible to illustrate to a potential employer that you know how to program by writing some software, passing certifications, and taking various programming tests. Passion, grades, and connections aren't as important as majoring in a specific area, but they are all important.  Your major does not have to determine your career.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==When a Guilty Plea Can be Offered==
A guilty plea should not be entered where the accused denies guilt.&lt;ref&gt;R v Denis [http://canlii.ca/t/1m02j#par38 2005 QCCA 1089 at 38]&lt;/ref&gt;

If the accused does not remember or recall the incident, the judge may still accept the guilty plea so long as the accused is capable to accept the allegation as correct.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Jawbone, [http://canlii.ca/t/1flh4 1998 CanLII 6104 (MB CA)]
&lt;/ref&gt;

A judge may accept a plea to an included offence only where there is consent of the crown.&lt;ref&gt;s. [http://www.canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec606 606(4)]&lt;/reF&gt;


{{reflist|2}}
==Acceptance of a guilty plea==
A conviction or finding of guilt is not entered until such time as the court accepts the plea. A plea by itself is not enough.&lt;reF&gt;
R v Senior [http://canlii.ca/t/2ddb8 1996 ABCA 71], 1996 116 CCC 3d 152 (ABCA)&lt;br&gt; 
R v Shrupka [http://canlii.ca/t/1fl9s 2000 MBCA 112], 2000 149 CCC 3d 410 (MBCA) at 24&lt;/ref&gt;

A plea of guilty can only be accepted by the Court if the requirements of s. 606(1.1) are satisfied. The provision states: 
{{quotation|
:606(1.1) A court may accept a plea of guilty only if it is satisfied that the accused
::(a) is making the plea voluntarily; and
::(b) understands
:::(i)that the plea is an admission of the essential elements of the offence,
:::(ii)the nature and consequences of the plea, and
:::(iii)that the court is not bound by any agreement made between the accused and the prosecutor.|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec606]
}}

A plea must be taken in the presence of an accused “unless the court orders otherwise”.&lt;ref&gt;see s.650.01(3)(c)&lt;/ref&gt; This would potentially include acceptance of pleas through the use of video links.&lt;ref&gt;see 606(1.2); 650(1.1); 650(1.2)&lt;/ref&gt;

For a guilty plea to be valid it must possess the following attributes:&lt;REf&gt;
R. v. Hector [http://canlii.ca/t/1fb50 2000 CanLII 5725]&lt;br&gt;
see also:
R v Lyons [1987] [http://canlii.ca/t/1ftlw 2 SCR 309] at p 371&lt;bR&gt;
R v Claveau [http://canlii.ca/t/57c0#par7 2003 NBCA 52 at 7]
R. v. Pottie, [http://canlii.ca/t/1mpvm 1996 CanLII 5604], (1996) NSR 2d 56 (NSCA)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
* voluntary, 
* unequivocal, 
* informed of the nature of the allegations, 
* informed of the consequences of a plea


{{reflist|2}}

==Inquiry into guilty plea==
The judge has discretion to inquire into whether the accused meets these criteria. &lt;ref&gt;
See  Brosseau v. The Queen, [1969] S.C.R. 181, [1969] 3 C.C.C. 129 [http://canlii.ca/t/1xcgb]&lt;br&gt; 
Thibodeau v. The Queen, [1955] S.C.R. 646;[http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1955/1955canlii57/1955canlii57.html] &lt;br&gt;
Adgey v. The Queen, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 426, 13 C.C.C. (2d) 177 [http://canlii.ca/t/1twzm]&lt;br&gt;
See:  R. v. Lamoureux, (1984), 13 C.C.C. (3d) 101 (Que. C.A.)&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Antoine (1984) 40 C.R. (3d) 375 (Que. C.A.)&lt;Br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

A judge need not “fully inquire” into whether 606(1.1) is met before accepting a guilty plea.&lt;Ref&gt; 
see 606(1.2)&lt;br&gt; Eizenga [http://canlii.ca/t/2fmpr#par47 2011 ONCA 113 at 47]&lt;Br&gt; 
Messervey [http://canlii.ca/t/2b612 2010 NSCA 55]&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Walsh [http://canlii.ca/t/1mssx 2006 CanLII 7393] (ON CA), (2006), 206 C.C.C. (3d) 543 at 28&lt;br&gt;
R. v. G.T.(J.), [http://canlii.ca/t/5fhs#par19 2003 BCCA 1 at 19]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the plea is entered in open court it is presumed valid.

When entered with counsel it is presumed that the accused was &quot;fully familiar with the circumstances surrounding the offence and to have been aware of the consequences of entering a guilty plea.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Paiero, (1986), 71 N.S.R. (2d) 268 (C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;
The presumption is stronger where it is done after consulting with experienced counsel.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Swanson [http://canlii.ca/t/53zp#par24 2000 BCCA 177 at 24]&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}

==Procedural Effect of a Guilty Plea==
Once a plea has been made it is considered formal proof of the offence committed. There is no burden on the Crown to prove the charge beyond a reasonable doubt.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. C.(W.B.) 2000, 142 CCC 3d 490 (Ont.C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt; However, a plea is not formal proof of the underlying facts. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Berry (1957) 118 CCC 55 (Ont.CA)&lt;/ref&gt;

A guilty plea is considered the end of the challenge to the criminal charge against the accused.
&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Bowman, [http://canlii.ca/t/21863 2008 BCCA 410]&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Duong, [http://canlii.ca/t/1nq1g 2006 BCCA 325]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; 
This also means that the guilty plea will extinguish any procedural rights, rights of appeal or ability to challenge the ruling of guilt.&lt;ref&gt;
Korponay v Canada (Attorney General), [http://canlii.ca/t/1lpbj 1982 CanLII 12] (SCC), [1982] 1 SCR 41 at p. 49&lt;Br&gt;
Brady v US, 397 US 742 (1970) at p. 748&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
There can only be a re-opening of the issue of admissibility of the evidence if the accused was not aware of the effect of the guilty plea.&lt;ref&gt;
See R. v. Duong, [http://canlii.ca/t/1nq1g 2006 BCCA 325]
&lt;/ref&gt; 

Where a Charter application fails and there remains no further defence, the proper procedure to preserve the right of appeal is to admit the facts allegecd and invite the judge to convict.&lt;ref&gt;See 
R v Duong [http://canlii.ca/t/1nq1g#par8 2006 BCCA 325 at para.8]&lt;br&gt;
Carter, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fw4s 2003 BCCA 632] at para. 6&lt;Br&gt; 
Webster, [http://canlii.ca/t/21ls8 2008 BCCA 458] at paras. 19-22 &lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Validity and Withdraw of Guilty Plea==
A guilty plea can be withdrawn any time before sentencing at the discretion of the trial judge. Where a withdraw is requested the trial judge is to inquire into the validity of the guilty plea. He may withdraw the plea at their discretion.&lt;Ref&gt; 
R. v. Atlay [http://canlii.ca/t/1d9lc 1992 CanLII 1081 (BCCA)], (1992), 70 C.C.C. (3d) 553 (BCCA)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; However, the discretion is reviewable by an appellate court.
 
Where the accused has already been sentenced and wishes to withdraw the guilty plea, the trial judge is ''functus'' and has no jurisdiction to consider an application. An appellate court may only interfere with a guilty plea where the plea resulted in a &quot;miscarriage of justice&quot; under s. 686(1)(a)(iii).

If the plea is valid it generally cannot be withdrawn.&lt;Ref&gt; R. v. Arcand, [http://canlii.ca/t/1l719 2000 SKCA 60]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. T.(R) [http://canlii.ca/t/1p793 1992 CanLII 2834] (ON CA), (1992), 17 C.R. (4th) 247 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Hector [http://canlii.ca/t/1fb50 2000 CanLII 5725]
&lt;/ref&gt;

A plea in open court by an accused represented by counsel is presumptively valid.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Eide, [http://canlii.ca/t/fm5rg 2011 SKCA 81]&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Swanson, [http://canlii.ca/t/53zp 2000 BCCA 177]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; Where the accused is represented by counsel there is a stronger presumption of validity.

The burden is upon the accused to establish the guilty plea as invalid.
&lt;ref&gt; 
R v Eizenga [http://canlii.ca/t/2fmpr#par45 2011 ONCA 113], (2011) 270 CCC (3d) 168 (ONCA) at para 45-46&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Djekic [http://canlii.ca/t/1fb9n 2000 CanLII 16822 (ON CA)], (2000), 147 C.C.C. (3d) 572 (Ont C.A.)&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Rajaeefard [http://canlii.ca/t/6j70 1996 CanLII 404 (ON CA)], (1996), 104 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Rubenstein [http://canlii.ca/t/22kn1 1987 CanLII 2834 (ON CA)], (1988), 41 C.C.C. (3d) 91 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;Br&gt;
R v Morris 1994 BCCA&lt;br&gt; 
R v Cloutier [http://canlii.ca/t/1mq2j 2006 QCCA 277]&lt;br&gt;
R v R.T. (1992) 10 OR (3d) 514 at p. 519&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/reF&gt;

An ''appellate court'' has the ability to remove a guilty plea and quash a conviction where there are &quot;valid grounds&quot; to do so. What constitutes valid grounds is open-ended and can include a variety of situations.&lt;reF&gt; 
R. v. Taillefer, Duguay, [http://canlii.ca/t/1g992 2003 SCC 70] (CanLII), [2003] S.C.J. No. 75 at 431 &lt;br&gt;
R. v . Adgey, [http://canlii.ca/t/1twzm 1973 CanLII 37] (SCC), [1975] 2 S.C.R. 426 (S.C.C.) &lt;br&gt;
Queen v. Bamsey [http://canlii.ca/t/21vc2 1960 CanLII 35 (SCC)], (1960), S.C.R. 294 at p. 298[http://canlii.ca/t/21vc2]&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Porter [1994] [http://canlii.ca/t/1mqmv#par25 N.S.J. No.304 at para 25]&lt;Br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;  


&quot;Valid grounds&quot; to withdraw a guilty plea can be in situations where the plea was not validly.
&lt;ref&gt; 
see R. v. Hoang, [http://canlii.ca/t/1g4b9#par30 2003 ABCA 251 at 30] - &quot;the appellant did not appreciate the nature of the charge, or the appellant did not intend to admit that he was guilty of it; or where upon the admitted facts, the appellant could not in law have been convicted of the offence charged&quot;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
This includes where there is:
* a misunderstanding by the accused of the nature of the charge 
* a misunderstanding by the accused of the effect of his plea, such as where
** the accused never intended to admit guilt &lt;Ref&gt;e.g. R. v. S.K., [http://canlii.ca/t/231v4 1995 CanLII 8926 (ONCA)]&lt;/ref&gt;
** there was a serious question as to the accused's mental state at the time of entering the plea
* improper inducements or threats by the police, defence counsel, or the trial judge&lt;ref&gt;
see R. v. Nevin, [http://canlii.ca/t/1nx31 2006 NSCA 72] &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Lamoureux, (1984), 13 C.C.C. (3d) 101 (Que.C.A.)&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Laperrière [http://canlii.ca/t/1nk99 1995 CanLII 4706 (QC CA)], (1995), 101 C.C.C. (3d) 462, [1996] 2 S.C.R. 284&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Djekic [http://canlii.ca/t/1fb9n 2000 CanLII 16822 (ON CA)], (2000), 147 C.C.C. (3d) 572 (Ont.C.A.)&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Rajaeefard [http://canlii.ca/t/6j70 1996 CanLII 404 (ON CA)], (1996), 104 C.C.C. (3d) 225 (Ont.C.A.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
* the accused did not fully appreciate the nature of the charge or the effect of the plea.&lt;Ref&gt;
see R. v. Melanson (1983), 59 N.S.R. (2d) 54 (C.A.)
&lt;/ref&gt;

A further situation where the plea can be withdrawn is where there is a miscarriage of justice.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Gates, 2010 BCCA 378, 293 B.C.A.C. 243 at para. 2&lt;/ref&gt; This includes where:
* the accused has been given wrong legal advice&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Armstrong, [http://canlii.ca/t/6hqg 1997 CanLII 1487] (ON CA), (1997) 33 WCB 2d 254 (ONCA) - lawyer gave advice that D was able to get discharge when it was not available
&lt;/ref&gt;
*  if on the admitted facts, he could not be convicted of the offence&lt;reF&gt;
R. v. Melanson (1983), 59 N.S.R. (2d) 54 (C.A.) at para. 6&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Factors to consider include &lt;Ref&gt; R. v. Joseph, [2000] B.C.J. No. 2850 (Q.L.)(B.C.S.C.) at 48&lt;Br&gt;
R. v.  Stockley, [http://canlii.ca/t/2467r 2009 NLCA 38] at para. 7
&lt;/ref&gt;
# whether the accused was represented by (experienced) counsel&lt;ref&gt;Joseph at 48&lt;/ref&gt;
# whether the accused was apprised of his position&lt;ref&gt;Joseph at 48&lt;/ref&gt; 
# did the accused have a valid defence&lt;ref&gt;Joseph at 48&lt;/ref&gt;
# was the plea given while under pressure and did he have enough time to contemplate the decision&lt;ref&gt;Joseph at 48&lt;/ref&gt;
# whether the accused had experience in the criminal justice system (usually shown by a criminal record)&lt;ref&gt;Joseph at 48&lt;/ref&gt;

If a judge performs the inquiry under s. 606(1.1) then it is unlikely that a judge should set aside the guilty plea.&lt;Ref&gt; R v Brun [http://canlii.ca/t/1mlbx 2006 NBCA 17]&lt;/ref&gt; 

A change of plea is rarely granted, first, because of the mischief it could cause and the lack of certainly in plea deals, second, need to ensure fairness to the victims, complainants and witnesses involved.
&lt;ReF&gt;
R v Hallam, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fw7p 2003 BCPC 333], [2003] BCJ No 2176&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Murphy, [http://canlii.ca/t/1mqdm 1995 CanLII 4329], [1995] N.S.J. No.41 at 10
&lt;/ref&gt;

Representation by counsel is a significant factor.&lt;ReF&gt; R v McCollum 2008 NSCA 36 at 10&lt;/ref&gt;

A co-accused who is acquitted does not change the validity of the guilty plea.&lt;ref&gt; R v Hicks [1991] 3 SCR 383&lt;/ref&gt;

Guilty plea are more likely be struck where there are english language problems.&lt;ReF&gt;R v Meers [http://canlii.ca/t/1d96w 1991 CanLII 311] (BC CA)&lt;br&gt;
R v Golubev [http://canlii.ca/t/23826 2009 ONCA 333]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Where there was no meeting between the lawyer and the accused there will be a tendancy to lean towards revoking the guilty plea.&lt;ref&gt;R v Golubev [http://canlii.ca/t/23826 2009 ONCA 333]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}
===Voluntariness===
An accused who feels under pressure to plead guilty is not generally enough to vitiate voluntariness. It is expected that a persons facing serious charges will feel pressure at the time of plea.&lt;reF&gt;R. v. Carty, [http://canlii.ca/t/290vf 2010 ONCA 237] -- Accused states &quot;I think it is the best way.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

Death threats is sufficient to vitiate voluntariness on a guilty plea.&lt;REf&gt;R v Easterbrook [http://canlii.ca/t/1k6vk 2005 CanLII 12676 (ON CA)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Guilty plea motivated by a desire to avoid tougher sentence will not be grounds of striking the plea.&lt;Ref&gt; 
R v Burden [http://canlii.ca/t/6jcz 1996 CanLII 558 (ON CA)] - accused plead guilty on suggestion of a dangerous offender application post trial
&lt;/ref&gt; 
Similarly, it is permissible for crown to suggest that if a guilty plea is entered, bail will not be opposed prior to sentence. &lt;reF&gt;R v Temple 1995 B.C.J. No. 331&lt;/ref&gt;


{{Reflist|2}}

===Equivocation===
Any conditional guilty plea, such as admission of guilt only where a particular outcome be granted, is not a guilty plea at all.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Lucas, (1983), 9 C.C.C. (3d) 71 at 75: &quot;A conditional plea of guilty is unknown to our law&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

A guilty plea is considered conditional where the plea was done on advice of the lawyer who was mistaken to believe that an appeal of conviction and ruling would be possible after the plea was entered.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Fegan (1993) 80 CCC 3d 356&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also conditional where the crown offers to allow a withdraw of a guilty plea if the judge does not adopt the joint recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Kleinsteuber, [http://canlii.ca/t/1dzrd#par4 1997 CanLII 3567] (BC CA) at 4-6&lt;/ref&gt;

A withdraw could be supported where the accused asserts a potential valid defence.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Hunt [http://canlii.ca/t/1glq3#par15 2004 ABCA 88 at 15]&lt;/ref&gt;

A guilty plea made merely to gain some sort of perceived advantage is not enough to invalidate the plea.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Hughes, (1987), 76 A.R. 294 (C.A.)&lt;Br&gt; 
R. v. Burden [http://canlii.ca/t/6jcz 1996 CanLII 558 (ON CA)], (1996), 90 O.A.C. 169 (Ont.C.A.)&lt;Br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

===Understands Admissions===
The accused must have suffient information regarding the nature of the charges against him.&lt;reF&gt;R v Henry [http://canlii.ca/t/fl10b 2011 ONCA 289] - accused not able to listen to recordings making up allegations before plea, guilty plea invalidated&lt;/ref&gt;

The accused need only be aware of the “essential facts” to make out the charge and not the full extent of the details to plea guilty.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Raymond, [http://canlii.ca/t/2dvfs#par100 2009 QCCA 808 at 100 and 114]
&lt;/ref&gt;
This follows the principle that guilty plea is only a bare admission and not acceptance of all surrounding circumstances.&lt;ref&gt; 
See s. 655 which states &quot;Where an accused is on trial for an indictable offence, he or his counsel may admit any fact alleged against him for the purpose of dispensing with proof thereof.&quot;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the accused was not aware of what he was pleading guilty to, then it will struck.&lt;ref&gt;R v .Halvorsen [http://canlii.ca/t/1dcqw 1994 CanLII 1748 (BC CA)]&lt;/ref&gt;


{{Reflist|2}}

===Understand Consequences===
The accused has a right to know the immediate consequence of the gulity plea. This includes the nature of the potential penalties.&lt;reF&gt;
R. v. T. (R.), [http://canlii.ca/t/1p793 1992 CanLII 2834 (ON CA)]
&lt;/ref&gt;This does not include all possible consequences.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Hoang 2003 ABCA at 36&lt;br&gt; R v Raymond, [http://canlii.ca/t/2dvfs#par114 2009 QCCA 808 at 114]&lt;/ref&gt;

Lack of knowledge of the consequences of pleading guilty is not necessarily determinative.&lt;ref&gt;
see R. v. Slobodan, [1993] A.J. No. 11 (C.A.)
R. v. Tyler, 2007 BCCA 142 &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Hunt, 2004 ABCA 88 &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Hoang, 2003 ABCA 251 &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Fegan, (1993), 80 C.C.C. (3d) 356 (Ont.C.A.)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Claveau, 2003 NBCA 52 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;Instead, more seems to rely upon the impact on the decision, if the accused had been informed.&lt;ref&gt;R v Riley 2010 NSCA at 45&lt;/ref&gt;

“Consequences” of the plea does not include knowledge of the long-term or external consequences to a guilty plea&lt;ref&gt;R v Hunt 2004 ABCA 88 at 15, 16&lt;/ref&gt;, including the impact on their immigration status.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Tyler [http://canlii.ca/t/1qrd4 2007 BCCA 142]&lt;br&gt;
R v Nersysyan [http://canlii.ca/t/1l0bh 2005 QCCA 606]&lt;bR&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

The courts can take into account the overall impact of the gulity plea when deciding whether they understood the consequence.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Riley, [http://canlii.ca/t/flqv9#par45 2011 NSCA 52 at 45]&lt;/reF&gt;


{{Reflist|2}}

===Miscarriage of Justice===
Valid grounds include where there is an appearance of unfairness.&lt;ref&gt;R v Stork (1975) 24 CCC 210 and R v Adgey 1975 at p 431&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfairness would include where the accused was pressured or extorted into pleading guilty.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Lamoureux, (1984) 13 CCC (3d) 101 (QCCA)&lt;br&gt;
R v Temple [1995] BCJ No 331 (BCCA)&lt;Br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

===Procedure for Appeal===

Proving the invalidity of a guilty plea may be established by the record. However, if it is not apparent from the record, the court must have the appellant file his &quot;own affidavit and any other affidavit that might be relevant to the issue&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Wiebe, [http://canlii.ca/t/fvfd0 2012 BCCA 519] (CanLII) at para. 22&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

If the grounds includes an allegation of misconduct or incompetence of previous defence counsel, the Crown may get a affidavit from the previous defence counsel to respond to the allegations.&lt;ref&gt;
Wiebe at para. 22&lt;/ref&gt; The previous defence counsel is still bound by solicitor-client privilege unless waived.

Under [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec683 s. 683], either side may apply to cross-examine the affiant.&lt;ref&gt;
e.g. Wiebe at para. 22&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Hannon, 1999 BCCA 56 (CanLII)
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Plea to Lesser Offences==
A judge can accept a guilty plea to an offence listed in the charge ''or'' any other charge arising from the same transaction where the Crown consents. 
Under s. 606(4), a guilty plea to a lesser included offence in permissible as stated:

{{quotation|
s. 606...&lt;p&gt;
'''Included or other offence'''&lt;br&gt;
(4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, where an accused or defendant pleads not guilty of the offence charged but guilty of any other offence arising out of the same transaction, whether or not it is an included offence, the court may, with the consent of the prosecutor, accept that plea of guilty and, if the plea is accepted, the court shall find the accused or defendant not guilty of the offence charged and find him guilty of the offence in respect of which the plea of guilty was accepted and enter those findings in the record of the court.
&lt;P&gt;
...&lt;P&gt;
R.S., 1985, c. C-46, s. 606; R.S., 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 125; 2002, c. 13, s. 49.|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec606]
}}

Even where the crown consents to accepting a guilty plea for a lesser offence, the judge has discretion to reject it.&lt;ref&gt; R v Naraindeen (1990), 75 O.R. (2d) 120 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== TDang review April 2012 ==

I'm reviewing [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/w/index.php?title=Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Social_Games&amp;diff=2313000&amp;oldid=2312999 this version]. I'll likely be more critical than complimentary, because (a) that's the way I am and (b) that's what will help improve things. Please don't take the criticism-over-compliments to mean I have a wholly negative view.

Make sure to check the [[Talk:Strategy_for_Information_Markets#review_thoughts_April_2012|all-purpose review thoughts]] as well.

* Have an introduction section up top--you do that by having the first section of the page have no section header.
* ''&quot;and have a demographic which is 74% female&quot;''--This is interesting. Without dwelling on it too much, compare that to other gaming niches and provide references.
* ''&quot;Social and casual gaming is expanding rapidly.&quot;''--This is redundant
* ''&quot;Ricochet:Infinity, had a player base in which 92% of users pirated the game&quot;''--This needs a reference.
* ''FarmVille''--Any statistics on distribution of who pays how much?
* ''League of Legends''--This reads a bit confusing.
* ''Zynga''--Combine this section with the FarmVille section.
* ''Riot games''--Combine this section with the League of Legends section.
* ''The stigma of paying for success''--This section needs references.
* Overall:
** This reads like a draft, there are mis-capitalizations mis-spellings and blatant grammar errors. Try to clean it up.
** Try to get at the issues of network externalities: Does a game need a large audience (of non-paying customers) in order to make the game attractive to paying customers? Or is it just like a casino where they want to draw in as many people as possible, hoping to find the few who will pay lots of money?
** Talk more about the &quot;viral&quot; nature of some of the games, where the game mechanic encourages recruiting friends to play.
* ''References''
** Try to format your references so they have useful information/titles, etc. 
** Wikipedia is not a good reference.

==The Moon==
The Earth itself is very interesting, however, so is its moon. The Moon or Luna is 384,000 kilometers from the Earth. It has a radius of 1,738 kilometer and weighs 7.35 x1022 kilograms. The moon is 1/80th the mass of the earth and 1/4th its diameter. An interesting thing about the moon is that it slows the Earth’s rotation by two milliseconds every century. This means that 900 million years ago, there were 481 days and 18 hours in an Earth year. The moon’s orbit is very nearly circular and one lunar day and night is almost fifteen Earth days. The temperature on the moon changes drastically depending on whether it is day or night. At night, the temperature can drop to almost -113° Celsius. During the day, temperatures can reach 100° Celsius. This is all because the moon does not have surface water or an atmosphere.

==The Sun==

When looking at our solar system, it is first important to look at the sun, which makes up 98% of the mass in the solar system. The gravity of the sun is so powerful that it attracts everything else in the solar system, which is why we orbit it. The sun has lived for approximately 4.5 billion years and is expected to live for another 5 billion years or so. The sun is very large, 109 Earths would make up the diameter and 1.3 million Earths would fit inside of it. The visible layer of the sun is called the photosphere. Photosphere means light sphere therefore we can see it. Temperatures in the photosphere can reach 6,000° Celsius. All of the energy powering the sun is created in the core where temperatures are up to 15 million° Celsius. From the core, the energy will take almost a million years to reach the surface. The actual composition of the sun is mostly hydrogen and helium. 

The sun, like the planets, has an atmosphere. The outer part of the atmosphere is called the corona and is where prominences occur. Prominences are immense clouds of glowing gas. They erupt from the upper chromospheres and can only be seen during total solar eclipses. Solar winds are also a part of the Sun’s atmosphere. They are atomic particles that are blown outward from the Sun. They stretch across a lot of the solar system and are deflected by the magnetic fields of planets. When the solar winds aren’t deflected, auroras can be seen.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Strategy in the PC vs. Console Market ===

For PC games: because with the technology going so fast. More and more new PC games are coming out which makes PC’s hardware need to update more frequently. The PC users need to spend more and more money to make their PC’s quality better to play the newest game. However, video game console doesn’t have that kind of problem. Usually a video game console like XBOX has at least more than two years service life. The user never needs to worry about change the hardware to a better one. All they need to do is just buy the game. It makes for both game console producer and game developer cost a lot less money for changing new equipments. And which makes the game console cheaper more competitive. 

The market for the development of online PC Games differs from that of the console game market in several ways:

•  Developers can avoid manufacturers' licensing fees. PC Games can generally be run on any PC related hardware, whereas console games are limited strictly to the technology associated with the platform for which the game is released.

•  Low overall development costs, including the avoidance of expensive development packages, allow the break-even quantity for high-quality a computer game produced in 2002 to be around 90,000 units, compared to the 500,000 break-even quantity required for license-laden Nintendo games &lt;ref&gt; Structure and Competition in the U.S. Home Video Game Industry, by Dmitri Williams, University of Michigan, USA &lt;/ref&gt;

•  PC games can be developed by small groups of individuals, whereas console games are generally developed by large corporations who are able to cover the costs of development packages. This allows for a much broader array of games, across many genres, to be produced. One of the most popular online first-person shooter games of all time, [[w:Counter-Strike|Counter-Strike]], was originally created by Minh &quot;Gooseman&quot; Le and Jess &quot;Cliffe&quot; Cliffe, two individuals who developed the game by modifying code from the game [[w:Half-Life (series)|Half-Life]]. &lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Counter-Strike &lt;/ref&gt; Although their creation was eventually published and distributed through [[w:Valve Corporation|Valve]], Gooseman and Cliffe were responsible for its initial creation.

=== Success in video game production ===

[[w:Activision|Activision]] owns the rights to many of the most popular games available.  They are responsible for bestselling games on various different consoles.  Activision has recently acquired 7 more game development studios and has assigned to each of those studios the task of creating a single game.  Assuming the games are a success, the studio will continue to make the sequels to each game.  Activision’s motto is “one game per studio.” This allows for the creation of a single game to be the sole focus of the studio, contributing to better continuity, communication, consistency, and attention to detail, as well as response to consumer demand.  Activision has repeatedly released top selling games and sequels.  This is due in part to the focused allocation of time and money that goes into producing a single game title and subsequent iterations.  Activison’s Executive Vice President David Stohl said, &quot;I think we have done a really good job, in fact, we have done probably the best in the industry ... But you've gotta anticipate things -- things like new hardware, hardware transitions, the cycles of it all, that kind of stuff -- and then anticipate, and try to be smart about it.&quot;  Their “one game strategy” is promising for the short run, but Stohl knows that it is vital to be aware of technological advancements that will continue to improve and transform gaming and game developing.  Activision’s strategy will likely continue to change. &lt;ref&gt; http://www.joystiq.com/2010/07/07/activision-studios-head-brings-development-strategy-into-focus/ &lt;/ref&gt;

[[w:Electronic Arts|Electronic Arts]], also known as EA games, were once only marketed to computer and software companies for stock computers when the company was founded in 1982. Today, they are the world's largest video game production studio and own more game series than any other studio. &lt;ref&gt; http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Arts&lt;/ref&gt; EA's success is largely due to the mergers and acquisitions the company has acquired over its existence. Many critics feel the company is harsh to its employees due to its drastic measures to cut staff and game productions as well as working their teams long hours to meet sales goals and to keep their profit margins green. EA believes it is beginning to cut old patterns of management but wants to ensure that quality in product development will not be sacrificed.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

(Our final lesson before we get into interacting with human input. Can't wait, can you?)

Just imagine you needed a program to do something 20 times. What would you do? You could copy and paste the code 20 times, and have a virtually unreadable program. Or, you could tell the computer to repeat a bit of code between point A and point B, until the time comes that you need it to stop. Such a thing is called a loop.

== The &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; loop ==

The following are examples of a type of loop, called the &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; loop:

;Code Example 1 – The &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; loop
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = 0
while a &lt; 10:
    a = a + 1
    print(a)
&lt;/source&gt;
How does this program work? Let's go through it in English (this is called [[w:pseudocode|pseudocode]]):

;Code Example 2 – Plain-language &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; loop
&lt;pre&gt;
'a' now equals 0
As long as 'a' is less than 10, do the following:
    Make 'a' one larger than what it already is.
    print on-screen what 'a' is now worth.
&lt;/pre&gt;
What does this do? Let's go through what the computer would be 'thinking' when it is in the &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; loop:

;Code Example 3 – &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; loop process
&lt;pre&gt;
#JUST GLANCE OVER THIS QUICKLY
#(It looks fancy, but is really simple.)
Is 'a' less than 10? YES (it's 0)
Make 'a' one larger (now 1)
print on-screen what 'a' is (1)

Is 'a' less than 10? YES (it's 1)
Make 'a' one larger (now 2)
print on-screen what 'a' is (2)

Is 'a' less than 10? YES (it's 2)
Make 'a' one larger (now 3)
print on-screen what 'a' is (3)

Is 'a' less than 10? YES (it's 3)
Make 'a' one larger (now 4)
print on-screen what 'a' is (4)

Is 'a' less than 10? YES (it's 4)
Make 'a' one larger (now 5)
print on-screen what 'a' is (5)

Is 'a' less than 10? YES (it's 5)
Make 'a' one larger (now 6)
print on-screen what 'a' is (6)

Is 'a' less than 10? YES (it's 6)
Make 'a' one larger (now 7)
print on-screen what 'a' is (7)

Is 'a' less than 10? YES (are you still here?)
Make 'a' one larger (now 8)
print on-screen what 'a' is (8)

Is 'a' less than 10? YES (it's 8)
Make 'a' one larger (now 9)
print on-screen what 'a' is (9)

Is 'a' less than 10? YES (it's 9)
Make 'a' one larger (now 10)
print on-screen what 'a' is (10)

Is 'a' less than 10? NO (it's 10, therefore isn't less than 10)
Don't do the loop
There's no code left to do, so the program ends.
&lt;/pre&gt;
So in short, try to think of it that way when you write &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; loops. This is how you write them, by the way:

;Code Example 4 – &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; loop form
&lt;pre&gt;
while {condition that the loop continues}:
    {what to do in the loop}
    {have it indented, usually four spaces}
{the code here is not looped}
{because it isn't indented}
&lt;/pre&gt;

An example:

;Code Example 5 – &lt;tt&gt;while&lt;/tt&gt; loop example
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#EXAMPLE
#Type this in and see what it does.
x = 10
while x != 0:
    print(x)
    x = x - 1
    print(&quot;Wow, we've counted x down, and now it equals&quot;, x)
print &quot;And now the loop has ended.&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
Remember, to make a program, you open IDLE, click 'File &gt; New Window', type your program in the new window, then press {{key press|F5}} to run.

== Boolean Expressions (Boolean... what?!?) ==

What do you type in the area marked {conditions that the loop continues}? The answer is a boolean expression.

What? A forgotten concept for the non-math people here. Never mind, boolean expression just means a question that can be answered with a TRUE or FALSE response. For example, if you wanted to say your age is the same as the person next to you, you would type:

My age == the age of the person next to me

And the statement would be TRUE. If you were younger than the person opposite, you'd say:

My age &lt; the age of the person opposite me

And the statement would be TRUE. If, however, you were to say the following, and the person opposite of you was younger than you:

My age &lt; the age of the person opposite me

The statement would be FALSE - the truth is that it is the other way around. This is how a loop thinks - if the expression is true, keep looping. If it is false, don't loop. With this in mind, lets have a look at the operators (symbols that represent an action) that are involved in boolean expressions:

{| width=40% border=1
  |+ Table 1 - Boolean operators
|-
  ! Expression
  ! Function
|-
|&lt;
|less than
|-
|&lt;=
|less than or equal to
|-
|&gt;
|greater than
|-
|&gt;=
|greater than or equal to
|-
|!=
|not equal to
|-
|&lt;&gt;
|not equal to (alternate, != preferred)
|-
|==
|equal to
|}

Dont get '=' and '==' mixed up - the '=' operator makes what is on the left equal to what is on the right. the '==' operator says whether the thing on the left is the same as what is on the right, and returns true or false.

== Conditional Statements ==

OK! We've (hopefully) covered 'while' loops. Now let's look at something a little different - conditionals.

Conditionals are where a section of code is only run if certain conditions are met. This is similar to the 'while' loop you just wrote, which only runs when x doesn't equal 0. However, Conditionals are only run once. The most common conditional in any program language, is the 'if' statement. Here is how it works:

;Code Example 6 - if statement and example
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
'''
if {conditions to be met}:
    {do this}
    {and this}
    {and this}
{but this happens regardless}
{because it isn't indented}
'''

#EXAMPLE 1
y = 1
if y == 1:
    print &quot;y still equals 1, I was just checking&quot;

#EXAMPLE 2
print &quot;We will show the even numbers up to 20&quot;
n = 1
while n &lt;= 20:
    n = n + 1
    if n % 2 == 0:    
           print(n)
print(&quot;there, done.&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

Example 2 there looks tricky. But all we have done is run an 'if' statement every time the 'while' loop runs. Remember that the % just means the remainder from a division - just checking that there is nothing left over if the number is divided by two - showing it is even. If it is even, it prints what 'n' is.

== 'else' and 'elif' - When it Ain't True ==

There are many ways you can use the 'if' statement, to deal with situations where your boolean expression ends up FALSE. They are 'else' and 'elif'.

'else' simply tells the computer what to do if the conditions of 'if' aren't met. For example, read the following:

;Code Example 7 - the else statement
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = 1
if a &gt; 5:
    print(&quot;This shouldn't happen.&quot;)
else:
    print(&quot;This should happen.&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;
'a' is not greater than five, therefore what is under 'else' is done.

'elif' is just a shortened way of saying 'else if'. When the 'if' statement fails to be true, 'elif' will do what is under it IF the conditions are met. For example:

;Code Example 8 - The elif statement
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
z = 4
if z &gt; 70:
    print(&quot;Something is very wrong&quot;)
elif z &lt; 7:
    print(&quot;This is normal&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;
The 'if' statement, along with 'else' and 'elif' follow this form:

;Code Example 9 - the complete if syntax
&lt;pre&gt;
if {conditions}:
    {run this code}
elif {conditions}:
    {run this code}
elif {conditions}:
    {run this code}
else:
    {run this code}

#You can have as many or as few elif statements as you need
#anywhere from zero to the sky.
#You can have at most one else statement
#and only after all other ifs and elifs.
&lt;/pre&gt;
One of the most important points to remember is that you MUST have a colon (:) at the end of every line with an 'if', 'elif', 'else' or 'while' in it. I forgot that, and as a result a stack of people got stumped at this lesson (sorry ;)).

== Indentation ==

One other point is that the code to be executed if the conditions are met, MUST BE INDENTED. That means that if you want to loop the next five lines with a 'while' loop, you must put a set number of spaces at the beginning of each of the next five lines. This is good programming practice in any language, but python requires that you do it. Here is an example of both of the above points:

;Code Example 10 - Indentation
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = 10
while a &gt; 0:
    print(a)
    if a &gt; 5:
        print(&quot;Big number!&quot;)
    elif a % 2 != 0:
        print(&quot;This is an odd number&quot;)
        print(&quot;It isn't greater than five, either&quot;)
    else:
        print(&quot;this number isn't greater than 5&quot;)
        print(&quot;nor is it odd&quot;)
        print(&quot;feeling special?&quot;)
    a = a - 1
    print(&quot;we just made 'a' one less than what it was!&quot;)
    print(&quot;and unless a is not greater than 0, we'll do the loop again.&quot;)
print(&quot;well, it seems as if 'a' is now no bigger than 0!&quot;)
print(&quot;the loop is now over, and without furthur ado, so is this program!&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;
Notice the three levels of indents there:

Each line in the first level starts with no spaces. It is the main program, and will always execute.
Each line in the second level starts with four spaces. When there is an 'if' or loop on the first level, everything on the second level after that will be looped/'ifed', until a new line starts back on the first level again.
Each line in the third level starts with eight spaces. When there is an 'if' or loop on the second level, everything on the third level after that will be looped/'ifed', until a new line starts back on the second level again.
This goes on infinitely, until the person writing the program has an internal brain explosion, and cannot understand anything he/she has written.
There is another loop, called the 'for' loop, but we will cover that in a later lesson, after we have learnt about lists.

==The Moon==
The Earth itself is very interesting, however, so is its moon. The Moon or Luna is 384,000 kilometers from the Earth. It has a radius of 1,738 kilometer and weighs 7.35 x 10^22 kilograms. The moon is 1/80th the mass of the earth and 1/4th its diameter. An interesting thing about the moon is that it slows the Earth’s rotation by two milliseconds every century. This means that 900 million years ago, there were 481 days and 18 hours in an Earth year. The moon’s orbit is very nearly circular and one lunar day and night is almost fifteen Earth days. The temperature on the moon changes drastically depending on whether it is day or night. At night, the temperature can drop to almost -113° Celsius. During the day, temperatures can reach 100° Celsius. This is all because the moon does not have surface water or an atmosphere.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Mercury==

The first planet orbiting the sun travelling outwards is Mercury. Since it is the closest plant to the sun, Mercury orbits around the Sun at a faster pace than any other planet. It only takes 88 Earth days for Mercury to orbit the Sun. However one day on Mercury lasts 176 Earth days. During the day, the temperature on Mercury reaches 450° C but at night it drops down to negative 170° C. The sunlight that reaches the surface of Mercury is six times brighter and more intense than that on the Earth. 

Mercury is the second densest major body in the solar system after the Earth. But an object that weighs 100 pounds on Earth would only way 38 pounds on Mercury. The interior of Mercury resembles that of the Earth and consists of a large iron core. The surface has cratered terrains, smooth plains, and is mostly made of rock and metal. There are many deep craters like those on the Moon’s surface. Scientists have proven that the floors of craters at the poles contain ice because they are permanently shielded from the Sun and thus never melt. Mercury’s atmosphere is dry, extremely hot, and almost airless. The gravity on Mercury is too weak to maintain a significant atmosphere for long periods of time and thus too weak to contain any moons in orbit. The magnetic field is about one percent as strong as that of the Earth.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Venus==

The next planet on our journey outwards is Venus, the 6th largest planet. Venus’ orbit is nearly circular. It is the brightest object in the sky from Earth except for the Sun and the Moon. One Venus day is equivalent to 243 Earth days. However Venus is very similar to Earth and regarded as Earth’s sister planet. It is 95% of Earth’s diameter and 80% of its mass. 

The physical makeup of Venus used to consist of large amounts of water which have since boiled away. The surface is made of gently rolling plains, several broad depressions as well as two large highland areas. Much of the surface is covered in lava flow. Venus also has several large shield volcanoes on its surface. The oldest terrain on Venus is 800 million years old because volcanism has erased all the previous surfaces. The interior is similar of Venus is similar to that of the Earth. The atmosphere is mostly made of carbon dioxide with several layers of clouds many kilometers thick made of sulfuric acid. There is no magnetic field and no moons.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Mars==

Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and is referred to as the red planet. Mars has half the diameter of the Earth. On the surface there are signs of ancient floods. The average temperature on Mars’ surface is negative 55° C but there are seasons and weather. 

Astronomers have proof of permanent polar ice caps on Mars. The surface is very old and cratered but there are young valleys, ridges and plains. There is evidence of erosion on the surface due to some type of fluid. However the surface of Mars is very cold with very strong winds and vast dust storms. These dust storms have been known to engulf the entire planet for months. The atmosphere on Mars is too thin for liquid water to exist for long on the surface. The atmosphere consists of 95% carbon dioxide, 3% nitrogen and 2% argon. The magnetic fields are large but not global. They are probably remnants of a larger global field that has since disappeared. Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Jupiter==

Jupiter follows Mars. Jupiter has high velocity winds confined in wide bands of latitude. It is most known for the great red spot which has been seen for 300 years. Its oval shape is big enough to fit two earths. The rotation of Jupiter is gradual slowing down due to the tidal drag produced by the satellites. A little known fact about Jupiter is that it has rings like Saturn’s but much thinner. They are dark and composed of very small grains of rocky material. In the grand scheme of things, the rings will most likely not last much longer. 

Jupiter does not have a solid surface. It instead consists of gaseous material which just becomes denser with depth. It is essentially 90% hydrogen and 10% helium. The composition is similar to that of Saturn. However not much is known about the interior. It is most likely a rocky core with liquid metallic hydrogen above the care. The interior does have a temperature of 20,000° K. The magnetic field is much stronger than that of Earth’s. Jupiter has 4 large moons, discovered by Galileo. They are referred to as Galilean moons and are Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto. There are also 59 other, smaller, moons in orbit around Jupiter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Saturn==

Saturn has 2 prominent rings and one faint ring that can be seen from Earth. They are known as A, B, and C, where C is the faintest ring seen. Each is composed of very small objects, and each in an independent orbit. The rings are about 250,000 km in diameter but only one km thick. They contain very little material, mostly water and ice. The rings of Saturn are not stable but continuously regenerated in an ongoing process. The current set of rings is only a few hundred million years old. Saturn itself is oblate, visibly flattened due to its rotation and fluid state. It is the least dense of all of the planets and has a gravity of .7. 

Saturn is made up of 75% hydrogen and 25% helium. The interior of Saturn is similar to Jupiter and thus not much about it is known. The core temperature is 12,000° K. Saturn does have a magnetic field which is very large.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Uranus==

Uranus is the first planet that was discovered in modern times. It was previously disregarded as another star in the sky. A unique feature about Uranus is that the axis is nearly parallel to the ecliptic so the South Pole points almost directly at the sun. However the equator is hotter than at the poles. The blue color of the planet is the result of the absorption of red light. Uranus has 13 known rings which are dark and composed of large particles. 

Uranus is made up of rock and various ices. The core is the same as Jupiter and Saturn, and thus similar to other gas planets. Uranus has bands of clouds that blow around rapidly. The atmosphere is 83% hydrogen, 15% helium and 2% methane. The magnetic field is titled almost 60° in respect to the axis of rotation. Uranus has 27 named moons and for respect to the length of this paper, not all will be named.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Neptune==

Neptune, the last planet on our journey, radiates twice as much energy than what it receives from the Sun. The planet of Neptune has its own great dark spot about half the size of the great red spot. Neptune does have its own set of rings but they appear incomplete. However it’s just that some parts of the rings are brighter than others. Like the rings of Jupiter and Uranus, Neptune’s rings are not easily visible from Earth.

Neptune’s physical makeup is similar to Uranus. Neptune consists of various ices and rock but is less uniform in composition. It most likely has a small core. The winds on the planet are confined bands of latitude. They are the fastest winds in the solar system. The magnetic field of Neptune is similar to Uranus’ in that it is oddly orientated. Neptune has 13 known moons but the main one is Triton.

      <comment>/* A Calculator Program */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

Last lesson I said that we would delve into purposefull programming. That involves user input, and user input requires a thing called functions.

What are functions? Well, in effect, functions are little self-contained programs that perform a specific task, which you can incorporate into your own, larger programs. After you have created a function, you can use it at any time, in any place. This saves you the time and effort of having to retell the computer what to do every time it does a common task, for example getting the user to type something in.

== Using a function ==

Python has lots of pre-made functions, that you can use right now, simply by 'calling' them. 'Calling' a function involves you giving a function input, and it will return a value (like a variable would) as output. Don't understand? Here is the general form that calling a function takes:

;Code Example 1 - How to call a function
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
function_name(parameters)
&lt;/source&gt;

See? Easy.

function_name identifies which function it is you want to use (you'd figure...). For example, the function raw_input, which will be the first function that we will use.
Parameters are the values you pass to the function to tell it what it should do, and how to do it.. for example, if a function multiplied any given number by five, the stuff in parameters tells the function which number it should multiply by five. Put the number 70 into parameters, and the function will do 70×5.

== Parameters and Returned Values - Communicating with Functions ==

Well, that's all well and good that the program can multiply a number by five, but what does it have to show for it? A warm fuzzy feeling? Your program needs to see the results of what happened, to see what 70 x 5 is, or to see if there is a problem somewhere (like you gave it a letter instead of a number). So how does a function show what it does?

Well, in effect, when a computer runs a function, it doesn't actually see the function name, but the result of what the function did. Variables do the exact same thing - the computer doesn't see the variable name, it sees the value that the variable holds. Lets call this program that multiplied any number by five, multiply(). You put the number you want multiplied in the brackets. So if you typed this:

;Code Example 2 - Using a function
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = multiply(70)
&lt;/source&gt;
The computer would actually see this:

;Code Example 3 - What the computer sees
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = 350
&lt;/source&gt;
Note: don't bother typing in this code - multiply() isn't a real function, unless you create it.

The function ran itself, then returned a number to the main program, based on what parameters it was given.

Now let's try this with a real function, and see what it does. The function is called input, and asks the user to type in something. It then turns it into a string of text. Try the code below:

;Code Example 4 - Using raw_input
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# this line makes 'a' equal to whatever you type in
a = input(&quot;Type in something, and it will be repeated on screen:&quot;)
# this line prints what 'a' is now worth
print a
&lt;/source&gt;
Say in the above program, you typed in 'hello' when it asked you to type something in. To the computer, this program would look like this:

;Code Example 5 - What the computer sees
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
a = &quot;hello&quot;
print &quot;hello&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
Remember, a variable is just a stored value. To the computer, the variable 'a' doesn't look like 'a' - it looks like the value that is stored inside it. Functions are similar - to the main program (that is, the program that is running the function), they look like the value of what they give in return of running.

== A Calculator Program ==

Let's write another program, one that will act as a calculator.  This time it will do something more adventurous than what we have done before.  There will be a menu that will ask you whether you want to multiply two numbers together, add two numbers together, divide one number by another, or subtract one number from another.  The only problem is that the &lt;tt&gt;raw_input&lt;/tt&gt; function returns what you type in as a ''string'', whereas we want the ''number'' 1, not the letter 1 (and yes, in Python, there is a difference).

Luckily, somebody wrote the function &lt;tt&gt;input&lt;/tt&gt;, which returns what you typed in to the main program - but crucially, as a number, not a letter.  If you type an ''integer'' (a whole number), what comes out of input is an integer. And if you put that integer into a variable, the variable will be an integer-type variable, which means you can perform addition, subtraction and other mathematical operations on it.

Now, let's design this calculator properly.  We want a menu that is returned to every time you finish adding, subtracting, etc.  In other words, to loop (HINT!!!) while (BIG HINT!!!) you tell it the program should still run.

We want it to perform an option in the menu associated with the number you enter.  That involves you typing in a number (a.k.a. input) and an &lt;tt&gt;if&lt;/tt&gt; loop.

Let's write it out in understandable English first:

;Code Example 6 - human-language example
&lt;pre&gt;
START PROGRAM
print opening message

while we let the program run, do this:
    #Print what options you have
    print Option 1 - add
    print Option 2 - subtract
    print Option 3 - multiply
    print Option 4 - divide
    print Option 5 - quit program
    
    ask the person what option they want and look for an integer
    if it is option 1:
        ask for first number
        ask for second number
        add them together
        display the result on screen
    if it is option 2:
        ask for first number
        ask for second number
        subtract one from the other
        display the result on screen
    if it is option 3:
        ask for first number
        ask for second number
        multiply them
        display the result on screen
    if it is option 4:
        ask for first number
        ask for second number
        divide the first by the second
        display the result on screen
    if it is option 5:
        tell the loop to stop
Display a goodbye message on screen
END PROGRAM
&lt;/pre&gt;
Let's put this in something that Python can understand:

;Code Example 7 - Python version of menu
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#calculator program

#This variable tells the loop whether it should loop or not.
# 1 means loop. Anything else means don't loop.

loop = 1

#this variable holds the user's choice in the menu:

choice = 0

while loop == 1:
    #Display the available options
    print (&quot;Welcome to calculator.py&quot;)

    print (&quot;your options are:&quot;)
    print (&quot; &quot;)
    print (&quot;1) Addition&quot;)
    print (&quot;2) Subtraction&quot;)

    print (&quot;3) Multiplication&quot;)

    print (&quot;4) Division&quot;)
    print (&quot;5) Quit calculator.py&quot;)
    print (&quot; &quot;)

    choice = int(input(&quot;Choose your option: &quot;))
    if choice == 1:
        add1 = int(input(&quot;Add this: &quot;))
        add2 = int(input(&quot;to this: &quot;))
        print (add1, &quot;+&quot;, add2, &quot;=&quot;, add1 + add2)
    elif choice == 2:
        sub2 = int(input(&quot;Subtract this: &quot;))
        sub1 = int(input(&quot;from this: &quot;))
        print (sub1, &quot;-&quot;, sub2, &quot;=&quot;, sub1 - sub2)
    elif choice == 3:
        mul1 = int(input(&quot;Multiply this: &quot;))
        mul2 = int(input(&quot;with this: &quot;))
        print (mul1, &quot;*&quot;, mul2, &quot;=&quot;, mul1 * mul2)
    elif choice == 4:
        div1 = int(input(&quot;Divide this: &quot;))
        div2 = int(input(&quot;by this: &quot;))
        print (div1, &quot;/&quot;, div2, &quot;=&quot;, div1 / div2)
    elif choice == 5:
        loop = 0
	
print (&quot;Thank you for using calculator.py!&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;
Wow! That is an impressive program! Paste it into Python IDLE, save it as 'calculator.py' and run it. Play around with it - try all options, entering in integers (numbers without decimal points), and numbers with stuff after the decimal point (known in programming as a floating point). Try typing in text, and see how the program chucks a minor fit, and stops running (That can be dealt with, using error handling, which we can address later.)

== Define Your Own Functions ==

Well, it is all well and good that you can use other people's functions, but what if you want to write your own functions, to save time, and maybe use them in other programs? This is where the 'def' operator comes in. (An operator is just something that tells python what to do, e.g. the '+' operator tells python to add things, the 'if' operator tells python to do something if conditions are met.)

This is how the 'def' operator works:

;Code Example 8 - The def operator
&lt;pre&gt;
def function_name(parameter_1, parameter_2):
    {this is the code in the function}
    {more code}
    {more code}
    return {value to return to the main program}
{this code isn't in the function}
{because it isn't indented}
#remember to put a colon &quot;:&quot; at the end
#of the line that starts with 'def'
&lt;/pre&gt;
function_name is the name of the function. You write the code that is in the function below that line, and have it indented. (We will worry about parameter_1 and parameter_2 later, for now imagine there is nothing between the parentheses.

Functions run completely independent of the main program. Remember when I said that when the computer comes to a function, it doesn't see the function, but a value, that the function returns? Here's the quote:

Functions run completely independent of the main program. Remember when I said that when the computer comes to a function, it doesn't see the function, but a value, that the function returns? Here's the quote:

To the computer, the variable 'a' doesn't look like 'a' - it looks like the value that is stored inside it. Functions are similar - to the main program (that is, the program that is running the function), they look like the value of what they give in return of running.

A function is like a miniture program that some parameters are given to - it then runs itself, and then returns a value. Your main program sees only the returned value. If that function flew to the moon and back, and then at the end had:

;Code Example 9 - return
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
return &quot;Hello&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
then all your program would see is the string &quot;hello&quot;, where the name of the function was. It would have no idea what else the program did.

Because it is a separate program, a function doesn't see any of the variables that are in your main program, and your main program doesn't see any of the variables that are in a function. For example, here is a function that prints the words &quot;hello&quot; onscreen, and then returns the number '1234' to the main program:

;Code Example 10 - using return
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# Below is the function
def hello():
    print &quot;hello&quot;
    return 1234

# And here is the function being used
print hello()
&lt;/source&gt;
Think about the last line of code above. What did it do? Type in the program (you can skip the comments), and see what it does. The output looks like this:

;Code Example 11 - the output
&lt;pre&gt;
hello
1234
&lt;/pre&gt;
So what happened?

when 'def hello()' was run, a function called 'hello' was created
When the line 'print hello()' was run, the function 'hello' was executed (The code inside it was run)
The function 'hello' printed &quot;hello&quot; onscreen, then returned the number '1234' back to the main program
The main program now sees the line as 'print 1234' and as a result, printed '1234
That accounts for everything that happened. remember, that the main program had NO IDEA that the words &quot;hello&quot; were printed onscreen. All it saw was '1234', and printed that onscreen.

== Passing Parameters to Functions ==

There is one more thing we will cover in this (monsterously huge) lesson - passing parameters to a function. Think back to how we defined functions:

;Code Example 12 - Defining functions with parameters
&lt;pre&gt;
def function_name(parameter_1,parameter_2):
    {this is the code in the function}
    {more code}
    {more code}
    return {value (e.g. text or number) to return to the main program}
&lt;/pre&gt;
Where parameter_1 and parameter_2 are (between the parentheses), you put the names of variables that you want to put the parameters into. Put as many as you need, just have them seperated by commas. When you run a function, the first value you put inside the parentheses would go into the variable where parameter_1 is. The second one (after the first comma) would go to the variable where parameter_2 is. This goes on for however many parameters there are in the function (from zero, to the sky) For example:

;Code Example 13 - how parameters work
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def funny_function(first_word, second_word, third_word):
    print &quot;The word created is: &quot; + first_word + second_word + third_word
    return first_word + second_word + third_word
&lt;/source&gt;
When you run the function above, you would type in something like this: &lt;code&gt;funny_function(&quot;meat&quot;, &quot;eater&quot;, &quot;man&quot;)&lt;/code&gt;. The first value (that is, &quot;meat&quot;) would be put into the variable called first_word. The second value inside the brackets (that is, &quot;eater&quot;) would be put into the variable called second_word, and so on. This is how values are passed from the main program to functions - inside the parentheses, after the function name.

== A Final Program ==

Think back to that calculator program. Did it look a bit messy to you? I think it did, so lets re-write it, with functions.

To design - First we will define all the functions we are going to use with the 'def' operator (still remember what an operator is ;) ). Then we will have the main program, with all that messy code replaced with nice, neat functions. This will make it so much easier to look at again in the future.

;Code Example 14 - Calculator program
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# calculator program

# NO CODE IS REALLY RUN HERE, IT IS ONLY TELLING US WHAT WE WILL DO LATER
# Here we will define our functions
# this prints the main menu, and prompts for a choice
def menu():
    #print what options you have
    print &quot;Welcome to calculator.py&quot;
    print &quot;your options are:&quot;
    print &quot; &quot;
    print &quot;1) Addition&quot;
    print &quot;2) Subtraction&quot;
    print &quot;3) Multiplication&quot;
    print &quot;4) Division&quot;
    print &quot;5) Quit calculator.py&quot;
    print &quot; &quot;
    return input (&quot;Choose your option: &quot;)
    
# this adds two numbers given
def add(a,b):
    print a, &quot;+&quot;, b, &quot;=&quot;, a + b
    
# this subtracts two numbers given
def sub(a,b):
    print b, &quot;-&quot;, a, &quot;=&quot;, b - a
    
# this multiplies two numbers given
def mul(a,b):
    print a, &quot;*&quot;, b, &quot;=&quot;, a * b
    
# this divides two numbers given
def div(a,b):
    print a, &quot;/&quot;, b, &quot;=&quot;, a / b
    
# NOW THE PROGRAM REALLY STARTS, AS CODE IS RUN
loop = 1
choice = 0
while loop == 1:
    choice = menu()
    if choice == 1:
        add(input(&quot;Add this: &quot;),input(&quot;to this: &quot;))
    elif choice == 2:
        sub(input(&quot;Subtract this: &quot;),input(&quot;from this: &quot;))
    elif choice == 3:
        mul(input(&quot;Multiply this: &quot;),input(&quot;by this: &quot;))
    elif choice == 4:
        div(input(&quot;Divide this: &quot;),input(&quot;by this: &quot;))
    elif choice == 5:
        loop = 0

print &quot;Thank you for using calculator.py!&quot;

# NOW THE PROGRAM REALLY FINISHES
&lt;/source&gt;
The initial program had 34 lines of code. The new one actually had 35 lines of code! It is a little longer, but if you look at it the right way, it is actually simpler.

You defined all your functions at the top. This really isn't part of your main program - they are just lots of little programs, that you will call upon later. You could even re-use these in another program if you needed them, and didn't want to tell the computer how to add and subtract again.

If you look at the main part of the program (between the line 'loop = 1' and 'print &quot;Thank you for...&quot;'), it is only 15 lines of code. That means that if you wanted to write this program differently, you would only have to write 15 or so lines, as opposed to the 34 lines you would normally have to without functions.

== Tricky Ways You Can Pass Parameters ==

Finally, as a bit of an interlude, I will explain what the line &lt;code&gt;add(input(&quot;Add this: &quot;), input(&quot;to this: &quot;))&lt;/code&gt; means.

I wanted to fit everything onto one line, with as few variables as possible. Remember what functions look like to the main program? Whatever value they return. If the numbers you passed to the add() function were 2 and 30, the main program would see this:

;Code Example 15 - The results of fancy parameter work
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
        add(2, 30)
&lt;/source&gt;
The add program would then run, adding 2 and 30, then printing the result. The add program has no 'return' operator - it doesn't return anything to the main program. It simply adds two numbers and prints them onscreen, and the main program doesn't see anything of it.

Instead of &lt;code&gt;(input(&quot;Add this: &quot;), input(&quot;to this: &quot;))&lt;/code&gt; as the parameters for the add program, you could have variables. For example,

;Code Example 16 - variables as parameters
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
num1 = 45
num2 = 7
add(num1, num2)
&lt;/source&gt;
For the above, remember that the function you are passing the variables to cannot change the variables themselves - they are simply used as values. You could even put the values straight into the function:

;Code Example 17 - the end result
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
add(45, 7)
&lt;/source&gt;
This is because the only thing the function sees are the values that are passed on as parameters. Those values are put into the variables that are mentioned when 'add' is defined (the line 'def add(a,b)' ). The function then uses those parameters to do its job.

In short:

* the only thing functions see of the main program is the parameters that are passed to it
* the only thing the main program seens of functions is the returned value that it passes back

      <comment>/* The Solution - Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries */  made first sentence order lists, tuples, dictionaries to match rest; removed some repetition about dictionaries</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

Your brain still hurting from the last lesson? Never worry, this one will require a little less thought. We're going back to something simple - variables - but a little more in depth.

Think about it - variables store one bit of information. They may regurgitate (just not on the carpet...) that information at any point, and their bit of information can be changed at any time. Variables are great at what they do - storing a piece of information that may change over time.

But what if you need to store a long list of information, which doesn't change over time? Say, for example, the names of the months of the year. Or maybe a long list of information, that does change over time? Say, for example, the names of all your cats. You might get new cats, some may die, some may become your dinner (we should trade recipes!). What about a phone book? For that you need to do a bit of referencing - you would have a list of names, and attached to each of those names, a phone number. How would you do that?

== The Solution - Lists, Tuples, and Dictionaries ==

For these three problems, Python uses three different solutions - lists, tuples, and dictionaries:

* '''Lists''' are what they seem - a list of values. Each one of them is numbered, starting from zero - the first one is numbered zero, the second 1, the third 2, etc. You can remove values from the list, and add new values to the end. Example: Your many cats' names.
* '''Tuples''' are just like lists, but you can't change their values. The values that you give it first up, are the values that you are stuck with for the rest of the program. Again, each value is numbered starting from zero, for easy reference. Example: the names of the months of the year.
* '''Dictionaries''' are similar to what their name suggests - a dictionary. In a dictionary, you have an 'index' of words, and for each of them a definition. In Python, the word is called a 'key', and the definition a 'value'. The values in a dictionary aren't numbered - they aren't in any specific order, either - the key does the same thing. (Each key must be unique, though!)  You can add, remove, and modify the values in dictionaries. Example: telephone book.

== Tuples ==

Tuples are pretty easy to make. You give your tuple a name, then after that the list of values it will carry. For example, the months of the year:

;Code Example 1 - creating a tuple
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
months = ('January','February','March','April','May','June',\
'July','August','September','October','November','  December')
&lt;/source&gt;
Note that the '\' thingy at the end of the first line carries over that line of code to the next line. It is useful way of making big lines more readable.
Technically, you don't have to put those parentheses there (the '(' and ')' thingies), but it stops Python from getting things confused.
You may have spaces after the commas if you feel it necessary - it doesn't really matter.
Python then organises those values in a handy, numbered index - starting from zero, in the order that you entered them in. It would be organised like this:

{| width=25% border=1
  |+ Table 1 - tuple indicies
|-
  ! Index
  ! Value
|-
|0
|January
|-
|1
|February
|-
|2
|March
|-
|3
|April
|-
|4
|May
|-
|5
|June
|-
|6
|July
|-
|7
|August
|-
|8
|September
|-
|9
|October
|-
|10
|November
|-
|11
|December
|}

And that is tuples! Really easy...

== Lists ==

Lists are extremely similar to tuples. Lists are modifiable (or 'mutable', as a programmer may say), so their values can be changed. Most of the time we use lists, not tuples, because we want to easily change the values of things if we need to.

Lists are defined very similarly to tuples. Say you have FIVE cats, called Tom, Snappy, Kitty, Jessie and Chester. To put them in a list, you would do this:

;Code Example 2 - Creating a list
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
cats = ['Tom', 'Snappy', 'Kitty', 'Jessie', 'Chester']
&lt;/source&gt;
As you see, the code is exactly the same as a tuple, EXCEPT that all the values are put between square brackets, not parentheses. Again, you don't have to have spaces after the comma.

You recall values from lists exactly the same as you do with tuples. For example, to print the name of your 3rd cat you would do this:

;Code Example 3 - Recalling items from a list
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print cats[2]
&lt;/source&gt;
You can also recall a range of examples, like above, for example - &lt;code&gt;cats[0:2]&lt;/code&gt; would recall your 1st and 2nd cats.

Where lists come into their own is how they can be modified. To add a value to a list, you use the &lt;code&gt;append()&lt;/code&gt; function. Let's say you got a new cat called Catherine. To add her to the list you'd do this:

;Code Example 4 - Adding items to a list
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
cats.append('Catherine')
&lt;/source&gt;
That's a little weird, isn't it? I'll explain. That function is in a funny spot - after a period (the '.' kind of period, not otherwise), after the list name. You'll get to see those things more in a later lesson. For the meanwhile, this is the form of the function that adds a new value to a list:

;Code Example 5 - Using the append function
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#add a new value to the end of a list:
list_name.append(value_to_add)

#e.g. to add the number 5038 to the list 'numbers':
numbers.append(5038)
&lt;/source&gt;
Clears things up? Good!

Now to a sad situation - Snappy was shot by a neighbour, and eaten for their dinner (good on 'em!). You need to remove him (or her) from the list. Removing that sorry cat is an easy task, thankfully, so you have to wallow in sadness for as short a time as possible:

;Code Example 6 - Deleting an item
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#Remove your 2nd cat, Snappy. Woe is you.
del cats[1]
&lt;/source&gt;
You've just removed the 2nd cat in your list - poor old Snappy.

And with that morbid message, lets move on to...

== Dictionaries ==

Ok, so there is more to life than the names of your cats. You need to call your sister, mother, son, the fruit man, and anyone else who needs to know that their favourite cat is dead. For that you need a telephone book.

Now, the lists we've used above aren't really suitable for a telephone book. You need to know a number based on someone's name - not the other way around, like what we did with the cats. In the examples of months and cats, we gave the computer a number, and it gave us a name. This time we want to give the computer a name, and it give us a number. For this we need dictionaries.

So how do we make a dictionary? Put away your binding equipment, it isn't that advanced.

Remember, dictionaries have keys, and values. In a phone book, you have people's names, then their numbers. See a similarity?

When you initially create a dictionary, it is very much like making a tuple or list. Tuples have ( and ) things, lists have [ and ] things. Guess what! dictionaries have { and } things - curly braces. Here is an example below, showing a dictionary with four phone numbers in it:

;Code Example 7 - Creating a dictionary
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#Make the phone book:
phonebook = {'Andrew Parson':8806336, \
'Emily Everett':6784346, 'Peter Power':7658344, \
'Lewis Lame':1122345}
&lt;/source&gt;
The program would then print Lewis Lame's number onscreen. Notice how instead of identifying the value by a number, like in the cats and months examples, we identify the value, using another value - in this case the person's name.

Ok, you've created a new phone book. Now you want to add new numbers to the book. What do you do? A very simple line of code:

;Code Example 8 - Adding entries to a dictionary
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#Add the person 'Gingerbread Man' to the phonebook:

phonebook['Gingerbread Man'] = 1234567

# Didn't think I would give you
# my real number now, would I?
&lt;/source&gt;
All that line is saying is that there is a person called Gingerbread Man in the phone book, and his number is 1234567. In other words - the key is 'Gingerbread Man', and the value is 1234567.

You delete entries in a dictionary just like in a list. Let's say Andrew Parson is your neighbour, and shot your cat. You never want to talk to him again, and therefore don't need his number. Just like in a list, you'd do this:

;Code Example 9 - Removing entries from a dictionary
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
del phonebook['Andrew Parson']
&lt;/source&gt;
Again, very easy. the 'del' operator deletes any function, variable, or entry in a list or dictionary (An entry in a dictionary is just a variable with a number or text string as a name. This comes in handy later on.)

Remember that append function that we used with the list? Well, there are quite a few of those that can be used with dictionaries. Below, I will write you a program, and it will incorporate some of those functions in. It will have comments along the way explaining what it does.

Type this program into Python IDLE (you can skip the comments). Experiment as much as you like with it. Type it where you see the lines beginning with &gt;&gt;&gt;

;Code Example 10 - Functions of dictionaries
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#A few examples of a dictionary

#First we define the dictionary
#it will have nothing in it this time
ages = {}

#Add a couple of names to the dictionary
ages['Sue'] = 23
ages['Peter'] = 19
ages['Andrew'] = 78
ages['Karren'] = 45

#Use the function has_key() - 
#This function takes this form:
#function_name.has_key(key-name)
#It returns TRUE
#if the dictionary has key-name in it
#but returns FALSE if it doesn't.
#Remember - this is how 'if' statements work -
#they run if something is true
#and they don't when something is false.
if ages.has_key('Sue'):
    print &quot;Sue is in the dictionary. She is&quot;, \
ages['Sue'], &quot;years old&quot;

else:
    print &quot;Sue is not in the dictionary&quot;

#Use the function keys() - 
#This function returns a list
#of all the names of the keys.
#E.g.
print &quot;The following people are in the dictionary:&quot;
print ages.keys()

#You could use this function to
#put all the key names in a list:
keys = ages.keys()

#You can also get a list
#of all the values in a dictionary.
#You use the values() function:
print &quot;People are aged the following:&quot;, \
ages.values()

#Put it in a list:
values = ages.values()

#You can sort lists, with the sort() function
#It will sort all values in a list
#alphabetically, numerically, etc...
#You can't sort dictionaries - 
#they are in no particular order
print keys
keys.sort()
print keys

print values
values.sort()
print values

#You can find the number of entries
#with the len() function:
print &quot;The dictionary has&quot;, \
len(ages), &quot;entries in it&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Introduction ==

Well, in the first lesson about loops, I said I would put off teaching you the for loop, until we had reached lists. Well, here it is!

== The 'for' Loop ==

Basically, the for loop does something for every value in a list. The way it is set out is a little confusing, but otherwise is very basic. Here is an example of it in code:

;Code Example 1 - The for Loop
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# Example 'for' loop
# First, create a list to loop through:
newList = [45, 'eat me', 90210, &quot;The day has come, the walrus said, \
to speak of many things&quot;, -67]

# create the loop:
# Goes through newList, and seqentially puts each bit of information
# into the variable value, and runs the loop
for value in newList:
    print(value)
&lt;/source&gt;
As you see, when the loop executes, it runs through all of the values in the list mentioned after 'in'. It then puts them into value, and executes through the loop, each time with value being worth something different. Let's see it a again, in a classic cheerleading call that we all know:

;Code Example 2 - A for loop example
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# cheerleading program
word = input(&quot;Who do you go for? &quot;)

for letter in word:
    call = &quot;Gimme a &quot; + letter + &quot;!&quot;
    print(call)
    print(letter + &quot;!&quot;)
print(&quot;What does that spell?&quot;)
print(word + &quot;!&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;
A couple of things you've just learnt:

As you see, strings (remember - strings are lines of text) are just lists with lots of characters.
The program went through each of the letters (or values) in word, and it printed them onscreen.
And that is all there is to the for loop.

== Making a Menu Function ==

Now to the business end of the lesson. Lets start writing programs. So far we have learnt variables, lists, loops, and functions. That is pretty much all we need for quite a bit of programming. So let's set ourselves a task.

;Code Example 3 - A menu function
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# THE MENU FUNCTION
# The program asks for a string with all the menu options in it,
# and a text string asking a question.
# make sure every menu entry is unique.

def menu(list, question):
    for entry in list:
        print(1 + list.index(entry),)
        print (&quot;) &quot; + entry)

    return input(question) - 1

# def menu(list, question): is telling the function to
# ask for two bits of information:
# A list of all the menu entries,
# and the question it will ask when all the options have been printed

# for entry in list: is pretty much saying;
#'for every entry in the list, do the following:'

# print list.index(entry) + 1 uses the .index() function to find
# where in the list the entry is in. print function then prints it
# it adds 1 to make the numbers more intelligable.

# print &quot;) &quot; + entry prints a bracket, and then the entry name

# after the for loop is finished, input(question) - 1 asks the question,
# and returns the value to the main program (minus 1, to turn it back to
# the number the computer will understand).
&lt;/source&gt;
That wasn't very difficult, was it? the actual program only took up five lines - this is the wonder of how much we have learnt so far! All my comments take up sixteen lines - more than three times the program length. It is a good idea to comment your programs extensively. Remember that if you are going to be publishin gyour code open-source, there are going to be a lot of people checking out the code that you have written. We'll see the function we just wrote in our first example program.

== Our First 'Game' ==

What will our first example program be? How about a (very) simple text adventure game? Sounds like fun! It will only encompass one room of a house, and will be extremely simple. There will be five things, and a door. In one of the five things, is a key to the door. You need to find the key, then open the door. I will give a plain-english version first, then do it in python:

;Code Example 4 - Plain-english version of code
&lt;pre&gt;
#Plain-english version of our 'game'

Tell the computer about our menu function

Print a welcoming message, showing a description of the room.
We will give the player six things to look at: pot plant, painting,\
 vase, lampshade, shoe, and the door

Tell the computer that the door is locked
Tell the computer where the key is

present a menu, telling you what things you can 'operate':
    It will give you the six options
    It will ask the question &quot;what will you look at?&quot;

if the user wanted to look at:
    pot plant:
        If the key is here, give the player the key
        otherwise, tell them it isn't here
    painting:
        same as above
    etc.
    door:
        If the player has the key, let them open the door
        Otherwise, tell them to look harder

Give the player a well done message, for completing the game.
&lt;/pre&gt;
From this, we can write a real program. Ready? Here it is (skip typing the comments):

;Code Example 5 - Text Adventure Game
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#TEXT ADVENTURE GAME

#the menu function:
def menu(list, question):
    for entry in list:
        print(1 + list.index(entry),)
        print(&quot;) &quot; + entry)

    return input(question) - 1

#Give the computer some basic information about the room:
items = [&quot;pot plant&quot;,&quot;painting&quot;,&quot;vase&quot;,&quot;lampshade&quot;,&quot;shoe&quot;,&quot;door&quot;]

#The key is in the vase (or entry number 2 in the list above):
keylocation = 2

#You haven't found the key:
keyfound = 0

loop = 1

#Give some introductary text:
print(&quot;Last night you went to sleep in the comfort of your own home.&quot;)

print(&quot;Now, you find yourself locked in a room. You don't know how&quot;)
print(&quot;you got there, or what time it is. In the room you can see&quot;)
print(len(items), &quot;things:&quot;)
for x in items:
    print(x)
print(&quot;&quot;)
print(&quot;The door is locked. Could there be a key somewhere?&quot;)
#Get your menu working, and the program running until you find the key:
while loop == 1:
    choice = menu(items,&quot;What do you want to inspect? &quot;)
    if choice == 0:
        if choice == keylocation:
            print(&quot;You found a small key in the pot plant.&quot;)

            print(&quot;&quot;)
            keyfound = 1
        else:
            print(&quot;You found nothing in the pot plant.&quot;)
            print(&quot;&quot;)
    elif choice == 1:
        if choice == keylocation:
            print(&quot;You found a small key behind the painting.&quot;)
            print(&quot;&quot;)

            keyfound = 1
        else:
            print(&quot;You found nothing behind the painting.&quot;)
            print(&quot;&quot;)
    elif choice == 2:
        if choice == keylocation:
            print(&quot;You found a small key in the vase.&quot;)
            print(&quot;&quot;)
            keyfound = 1
        else:
            print(&quot;You found nothing in the vase.&quot;)

            print &quot;&quot;
    elif choice == 3:
        if choice == keylocation:
            print(&quot;You found a small key in the lampshade.&quot;)
            print(&quot;&quot;)
            keyfound = 1
        else:
            print(&quot;You found nothing in the lampshade.&quot;)
            print(&quot;&quot;)

    elif choice == 4:
        if choice == keylocation:
            print(&quot;You found a small key in the shoe.&quot;)
            print(&quot;&quot;)
            keyfound = 1
        else:
            print(&quot;You found nothing in the shoe.&quot;)
            print(&quot;&quot;)
    elif choice == 5:
        if keyfound == 1:
            loop = 0
            print(&quot;You put in the key, turn it, and hear a click&quot;)

            print(&quot;&quot;)
        else:
            print(&quot;The door is locked, you need to find a key.&quot;)
            print(&quot;&quot;)

# Remember that a backslash continues
# the code on the next line

print &quot;Light floods into the room as \
you open the door to your freedom.&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
Well, a very simple, but fun, game. Don't get daunted by the amount of code there, 53 of the lines are just the 'if' statements, which is the easiest thing to read there. (Once you comprehend all the indentation, you'll be able to make your own game, and you can make it as simple [or as complex] as you like.)

== Making the Game Better ==

The first question you should ask is &quot;does this program work?&quot;. The answer here is yes. Then you should ask &quot;does this program work well?&quot; - not quite. The menu() function is great - it reduces a lot of typing. The 'while' loop that we have, however, is a little messy - four levels of indents, for a simple program. We can do better!

Now, this will become much MUCH more straightforward when we introduce classes. But that will have to wait. Until then, let's make a function that reduces our mess. It we will pass two things to it - the menu choice we made, and the location of the key. It will return one thing - whether or not the key has been found. Lets see it:

;Code Example 6 - Creating an inspect function
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def inspect(choice,location):
    if choice == location:
        print(&quot;&quot;)
        print(&quot;You found a key!&quot;)
        print(&quot;&quot;)
        return 1
    else:
        print(&quot;&quot;)
        print(&quot;Nothing of interest here.&quot;)
        print(&quot;&quot;)
        return 0
&lt;/source&gt;
Now the main program can be a little simpler. Let's take it from the while loop, and change things around:

;Code Example 7 - The new game
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
while loop == 1:
    keyfound = inspect(menu(items,&quot;What do you want to inspect? &quot;), keylocation)
    if keyfound == 1:
        print(&quot;You put the key in the lock of the door, and turn it. It opens!&quot;)
        loop = 0

print(&quot;Light floods into the room, \
as you open the door to your freedom.&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;)
Now the program becomes massively shorter - from a cumbersome 83 lines, to a very shapely 50 lines! Of course, you lose quite a bit of versatility - all the items in the room do the same thing. You automatically open the door when you find the key. The game becomes a little less interesting. It also becomes a little harder to change.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

One thing that you will get to know about programming, is that programmers like to be lazy. If something has been done before, why should you do it again?

That is what functions cover in Python. You've already had your code do something special. Now you want to do it again. You put that special code into a function, and re-use it for all it is worth. You can refer to a function anywhere in your code, and the computer will always know what you are talking about. Handy, eh?

Of course, functions have their limitations. Functions don't store any information like variables do - every time a function is run, it starts afresh. However, certain functions and variables are related to each other very closely, and need to interact with each other a lot. For example, imagine you have a golf club. It has information about it (i.e. variables) like the length of the shaft, the material of the grip, and the material of the head. It also has functions associated with it, like the function of swinging your golf club, or the function of breaking it in pure frustration. For those functions, you need to know the variables of the shaft length, head material, etc.

That can easily be worked around with normal functions. Parameters affect the effect of a function. But what if a function needs to affect variables? What happens if each time you use your golf club, the shaft gets weaker, the grip on the handle wears away a little, you get that little more frustrated, and a new scratch is formed on the head of the club? A function cannot do that. A function only makes one output, not four or five, or five hundred. What is needed is a way to group functions and variables that are closely related into one place so that they can interact with each other.

Chances are that you also have more than one golf club. Without classes, you need to write a whole heap of code for each different golf club. This is a pain, seeing that all clubs share common features, it is just that some have changed properties - like what the shaft is made of, and its weight. The ideal situation would be to have a design of your basic golf club. Each time you create a new club, simply specify its attributes - the length of its shaft, its weight, etc.

Or what if you want a golf club, which has added extra features? Maybe you decide to attach a clock to your golf club (why, I don't know - it was your idea). Does this mean that we have to create this golf club from scratch? We would have to write code first for our basic golf club, plus all of that again, and the code for the clock, for our new design. Wouldn't it be better if we were to just take our existing golf club, and then tack the code for the clock to it?

These problems are what a thing called object-oriented-programming solves. It puts functions and variables together in a way that they can see each other and work together, be replicated, and altered as needed, and not when unneeded. And we use a thing called a 'class' to do this.

== Creating a Class ==

What is a class? Think of a class as a blueprint. It isn't something in itself, it simply describes how to make something. You can create lots of objects from that blueprint - known technically as an instance.

So how do you make these so-called 'classes'? Very easily, with the &lt;tt&gt;class&lt;/tt&gt; operator:

;Code Example 1 - defining a class
&lt;pre&gt;
# Defining a class
class class_name:
    [statement 1]
    [statement 2]
    [statement 3]
    [etc.]
&lt;/pre&gt;
Makes little sense? That's okay, here is an example that creates the definition of a Shape:

;Code Example 2 - Example of a Class
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#An example of a class
class Shape:
    def __init__(self,x,y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
    description = &quot;This shape has not been described yet&quot;
    author = &quot;Nobody has claimed to make this shape yet&quot;
    def area(self):
        return self.x * self.y
    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * self.x + 2 * self.y
    def describe(self,text):
        self.description = text
    def authorName(self,text):
        self.author = text
    def scaleSize(self,scale):
        self.x = self.x * scale
        self.y = self.y * scale
&lt;/source&gt;
What you have created is a description of a shape (That is, the variables) and what operations you can do with the shape (That is, the functions). This is very important - you have not made an actual shape, simply the description of what a shape is. The shape has a width (x), a height (y), and an area and perimeter (area(self) and perimeter(self)). No code is run when you define a class - you are simply making functions and variables.

The function called __init__ is run when we create an instance of Shape - that is, when we create an actual shape, as opposed to the 'blueprint' we have here, __init__ is run. You will understand how this works later.

self is how we refer to things in the class from within itself. self is the first parameter in any function defined inside a class. Any function or variable created on the first level of indentation (that is, lines of code that start one TAB to the right of where we put class Shape) is automatically put into self. To access these functions and variables elsewhere inside the class, their name must be preceeded with self and a full-stop (e.g. self.variable_name).

== Using a Class ==

Its all well and good that we can make a class, but how do we use one? Here is an example, of what we call creating an instance of a class. Assume that the code example 2 has already been run:

;Code Example 3 - Creating a class
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
rectangle = Shape(100, 45)
&lt;/source&gt;
What has been done? It takes a little explaining...

The __init__ function really comes into play at this time. We create an instance of a class by first giving its name (in this case, Shape) and then, in brackets, the values to pass to the __init__ function. The init function runs (using the parameters you gave it in brackets) and then spits out an instance of that class, which in this case is assigned to the name rectangle.

Think of our class instance, rectangle, as a self-contained collection of variables and functions. In the same way that we used self to access functions and variables of the class instance from within itself, we use the name that we assigned to it now (rectangle) to access functions and variables of the class instance from outside of itself. Following on from the code we ran above, we would do this:

;Code Example 4 - accessing attributes from outside an instance
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
#finding the area of your rectangle:
print rectangle.area()

#finding the perimeter of your rectangle:
print rectangle.perimeter()

#describing the rectangle
rectangle.describe(&quot;A wide rectangle, more than twice\
 as wide as it is tall&quot;)

#making the rectangle 50% smaller
rectangle.scaleSize(0.5)

#re-printing the new area of the rectangle
print rectangle.area()
&lt;/source&gt;
As you see, where self would be used from within the class instance, its assigned name is used when outside the class. We do this to view and change the variables inside the class, and to access the functions that are there.

We aren't limited to a single instance of a class - we could have as many instances as we like. I could do this:

;Code Example 5 - More than one instance
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
long_rectangle = Shape(120,10)
fat_rectangle = Shape(130,120)
&lt;/source&gt;

Both long_rectangle and fat_rectangle have their own functions and variables contained inside them - they are totally independent of each other. There is no limit to the number of instances I could create.

== Lingo ==

Object-oriented programming has a set of lingo that is associated with it. Its about time that we have this all cleared up:

* when we first describe a class, we are defining it (like with functions)
* the ability to group similar functions and variables together is called encapsulation
* the word 'class' can be used when describing the code where the class is defined (like how a function is defined), and it can also refer to an instance of that class - this can get confusing, so make sure you know in which form we are talking about classes
* a variable inside a class is known as an Attribute
* a function inside a class is known as a method
* a class is in the same category of things as variables, lists, dictionaries, etc. That is, they are objects
* a class is known as a 'data structure' - it holds data, and the methods to process that data.

== Inheritance ==

Lets have a look back at the introduction. We know how classes group together variables and functions, known as attributes and methods, so that both the data and the code to process it is in the same spot. We can create any number of instances of that class, so that we don't have to write new code for every new object we create. But what about adding extra features to our golf club design? This is where inheritance comes into play.

Python makes inheritance really easily. We define a new class, based on another, 'parent' class. Our new class brings everything over from the parent, and we can also add other things to it. If any new attributes or methods have the same name as an attribute or method in our parent class, it is used instead of the parent one. Remember the Shape class?

;Code Example 6 - the Shape class
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
class Shape:
    def __init__(self,x,y):
        self.x = x
        self.y = y
        self.description = &quot;This shape has not been described yet&quot;
        self.author = &quot;Nobody has claimed to make this shape yet&quot;
    def area(self):
        return self.x * self.y
    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * self.x + 2 * self.y
    def describe(self,text):
        self.description = text
    def authorName(self,text):
        self.author = text
    def scaleSize(self,scale):
        self.x = self.x * scale
        self.y = self.y * scale
&lt;/source&gt;
If we wanted to define a new class, let's say a square, based on our previous Shape class, we would do this:

;Code Example 7 - Using inheritance
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
class Square(Shape):
    def __init__(self,x):
        self.x = x
	self.y = x
&lt;/source&gt;
It is just like normally defining a class, but this time we put in brackets after the name, the parent class that we inherited from. As you see, we described a square really quickly because of this. That's because we inherited everything from the shape class, and changed only what needed to be changed. In this case we redefined the __init__ function of Shape so that the X and Y values are the same.

Let's take from what we have learnt, and create another new class, this time inherited from Square. It will be two squares, one immediately left of the other:

;Code Example 8 - DoubleSquare class
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# The shape looks like this:
# _________
#|    |    |
#|    |    |
#|____|____|

class DoubleSquare(Square):
    def __init__(self,y):
        self.x = 2 * y
        self.y = y
    def perimeter(self):
        return 2 * self.x + 2 * self.y
&lt;/source&gt;
This time, we also had to redefine the perimeter function, as there is a line going down the middle of the shape. Try creating an instance of this class. As a helpful hint, the IDLE command line starts where your code ends - so typing a line of code is like adding that line to the end of the program you have written.

== Pointers and Dictionaries of Classes ==

Thinking back, when you say that one variable equals another, e.g. variable2 = variable1, the variable on the left-hand side of the equal-sign takes on the value of the variable on the right. With class instances, this happens a little differently - the name on the left becomes the class instance on the right. So in instance2 = instance1, instance2 is 'pointing' to instance1 - there are two names given to the one class instance, and you can access the class instance via either name.

In other languages, you do things like this using pointers, however in python this all happens behind the scenes.

The final thing that we will cover is dictionaries of classes. Keeping in mind what we have just learnt about pointers, we can assign an instance of a class to an entry in a list or dictionary. This allows for virtually any amount of class instances to exist when our program is run. Lets have a look at the example below, and see how it describes what I am talking about:

;Code Example 9 - Dictionaries of Classes
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# Again, assume the definitions on Shape,
# Square and DoubleSquare have been run.
# First, create a dictionary:
dictionary = {}

# Then, create some instances of classes in the dictionary:
dictionary[&quot;DoubleSquare 1&quot;] = DoubleSquare(5)
dictionary[&quot;long rectangle&quot;] = Shape(600,45)

#You can now use them like a normal class:
print dictionary[&quot;long rectangle&quot;].area()

dictionary[&quot;DoubleSquare 1&quot;].authorName(&quot;The Gingerbread Man&quot;)
print dictionary[&quot;DoubleSquare 1&quot;].author
&lt;/source&gt;
As you see, we simply replaced our boring old name on the left-hand side with an exciting, new, dynamic, dictionary entry. Pretty cool, eh?

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

Last lesson we covered the killer topic of Classes. As you can remember, classes are neat combinations of variables and functions in a nice, neat package. Programming lingo calls this feature encapsulation, but reguardless of what it is called, it's a really cool feature for keeping things together so the code can be used in many instances in lots of places. Of course, you've got to ask, &quot;how do I get my classes to many places, in many programs?&quot;. The answer is to put them into a module, to be imported into other programs.

== Module? What's a Module? ==

A module is a Python file that (generally) has only defenitions of variables, functions, and classes. For example, a module might look like this:

;Code Example 1 - moduletest.py
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
### EXAMPLE PYTHON MODULE
# Define some variables:
numberone = 1
ageofqueen = 78

# define some functions
def printhello():
    print &quot;hello&quot;
    
def timesfour(input):
    print input * 4
    
# define a class
class Piano:
    def __init__(self):
        self.type = raw_input(&quot;What type of piano? &quot;)
        self.height = raw_input(&quot;What height (in feet)? &quot;)
        self.price = raw_input(&quot;How much did it cost? &quot;)
        self.age = raw_input(&quot;How old is it (in years)? &quot;)
	
    def printdetails(self):
        print &quot;This piano is a/an &quot; + self.height + &quot; foot&quot;,
        print self.type, &quot;piano, &quot; + self.age, &quot;years old and costing\
 &quot; + self.price + &quot; dollars.&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

As you see, a module looks pretty much like your normal Python program.

So what do we do with a module? We import bits of it (or all of it) into other programs.

To import all the variables, functions and classes from moduletest.py into another program you are writing, we use the import operator. For example, to import moduletest.py into your main program, you would have this:

;Code Example 2 - mainprogram.py
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
### mainprogam.py
### IMPORTS ANOTHER MODULE
import moduletest
&lt;/source&gt;
This assumes that the module is in the same directory as mainprogram.py, or is a default module that comes with python. You leave out the '.py' at the end of the file - it is ignored. You normally put all import statements at the beginning of the python file, but technically they can be anywhere. In order to use the items in the module in your main program, you use the following:

;Code Example 3 - mainprogram.py continued
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
### USING AN IMPORTED MODULE
# Use the form modulename.itemname
# Examples:
print moduletest.ageofqueen
cfcpiano = moduletest.Piano()
cfcpiano.printdetails()
&lt;/source&gt;
As you see, the modules that you import act very much like the classes we looked at last lesson - anything inside them must be preceeded with modulename. for it to work.

== More Module Thingamajigs (in lack of a better title) ==

Wish you could get rid of the modulename. part that you have to put before every item you use from a module? No? Never? Well, I'll teach it you anyway.

One way to avoid this hassle is to import only the wanted objects from the module. To do this, you use the from operator. You use it in the form of from modulename import itemname. Here is an example:

;Code Example 4 - importing individual objects
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
### IMPORT ITEMS DIRECTLY INTO YOUR PROGRAM

# import them
from moduletest import ageofqueen
from moduletest import printhello

# now try using them
print ageofqueen
printhello()
&lt;/source&gt;
What is the point of this? Well, maybe you could use it to make your code a little more readable. If we get into heaps of modules inside modules, it could also remove that extra layer of crypticness.

If you wanted to, you could import everything from a module is this way by using from modulename import *. Of course, this can be troublesome if there are objects in your program with the same name as some items in the module. With large modules, this can easily happen, and can cause many a headache. A better way to do this would be to import a module in the normal way (without the from operator) and then assign items to a local name:

;Code Example 5 - mainprogram.py continued
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
### ASSIGNING ITEMS TO A LOCAL NAME

# Assigning to a local name
timesfour = moduletest.timesfour

# Using the local name
print timesfour(565)
&lt;/source&gt;
This way, you can remove some crypticness, AND have all of the items from a certain module.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

Last lesson we learnt how to load external code into our program. Without any introduction (like what I usually have), let's delve into file input and output with normal text files, and later the saving and restoring of instances of classes. (Wow, our lingo power has improved greatly!)

== Opening a File ==

To open a text file you use, well, the open() function. Seems sensible. You pass certain parameters to open() to tell it in which way the file should be opened - 'r' for read only, 'w' for writing only (if there is an old file, it will be written over), 'a' for appending (adding things on to the end of the file) and 'r+' for both reading and writing. But less talk, lets open a file for reading (you can do this in your python idle mode). Open a normal text file. We will then print out what we read inside the file:

;Code Example 1 - Opening a file
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
openfile = open('pathtofile', 'r')
openfile.read()
&lt;/source&gt;

That was interesting. You'll notice a lot of '\n' symbols. These represent newlines (where you pressed enter to start a new line). The text is completely unformatted, but if you were to pass the output of openfile.read() to print (by typing print openfile.read()) it would be nicely formatted.

== Seek and You Shall Find ==

Did you try typing in print openfile.read()? Did it fail? It likely did, and reason is because the 'cursor' has changed it's place. Cursor? What cursor? Well, a cursor that you really cannot see, but still a cursor. This invisible cursor tells the read function (and many other I/O functions) where to start from. To set where the cursor is, you use the seek() function. It is used in the form seek(offset, whence).

whence is optional, and determines where to seek from. If whence is 0, the bytes/letters are counted from the beginning. If it is 1, the bytes are counted from the current cursor position. If it is 2, then the bytes are counted from the end of the file. If nothing is put there, 0 is assumed.

offset decribes how far from whence that the cursor moves. for example:

openfile.seek(45,0) would move the cursor to 45 bytes/letters after the beginning of the file.
openfile.seek(10,1) would move the cursor to 10 bytes/letters after the current cursor position.
openfile.seek(-77,2) would move the cursor to 77 bytes/letters before the end of the file (notice the - before the 77)
Try it out now. Use openfile.seek() to go to any spot in the file and then try typing print openfile.read(). It will print from the spot you seeked to. But realise that openfile.read() moves the cursor to the end of the file - you will have to seek again.

== Other I/O Functions ==

There are many other functions that help you with dealing with files. They have many uses that empower you to do more, and make the things you can do easier. Let's have a look at tell(), readline(), readlines(), write() and close().

tell() returns where the cursor is in the file. It has no parameters, just type it in (like what the example below will show). This is infinitely useful, for knowing what you are refering to, where it is, and simple control of the cursor. To use it, type fileobjectname.tell() - where fileobjectname is the name of the file object you created when you opened the file (in openfile = open('pathtofile', 'r') the file object name is openfile).

readline() reads from where the cursor is till the end of the line. Remember that the end of the line isn't the edge of your screen - the line ends when you press enter to create a new line. This is useful for things like reading a log of events, or going through something progressively to process it. There are no parameters you have to pass to readline(), though you can optionally tell it the maximum number of bytes/letters to read by putting a number in the brackets. Use it with fileobjectname.readline().

readlines() is much like readline(), however readlines() reads all the lines from the cursor onwards, and returns a list, with each list element holding a line of code. Use it with fileobjectname.readlines(). For example, if you had the text file:

;Code Example 2 - example text file
&lt;pre&gt;
Line 1

Line 3
Line 4

Line 6
&lt;/pre&gt;
The returned list from readlines() would be:

{| width=25% border=1
  |+ Table 1 - resulting list from readlines
|-
  ! Index
  ! Value
|-
|0
|'Line 1'
|-
|1
|''
|-
|2
|'Line 3'
|-
|3
|'Line 4'
|-
|4
|''
|-
|5
|'Line 6'
|}

The write() function, writes to the file. How did you guess? It writes from where the cursor is, and overwrites text in front of it - like in MS Word, where you press 'insert' and it writes over the top of old text. To utilise this most purposeful function, put a string between the brackets to write e.g. fileobjectname.write('this is a string').

close, you may figure, closes the file so that you can no longer read or write to it until you reopen in again. Simple enough. To use, you would write fileobjectname.close(). Simple!

In Python IDLE mode, open up a test file (or create a new one...) and play around with these functions. You can do some simple (and very inconvenient) text editing.

== Mmm, Pickles ==

Pickles, in Python, are to be eaten. Their flavour is just too good to let programmers leave them in the fridge.

Ok, just joking there. Pickles, in Python, are objects saved to a file. An object in this case could be a variables, instance of a class, or a list, dictionary, or tuple. Other things can also be pickled, but with limits. The object can then be restored, or unpickled, later on. In other words, you are 'saving' your objects.

So how do we pickle? With the dump() function, which is inside the pickle module - so at the beginning of your program you will have to write import pickle. Simple enough? Then open an empty file, and use pickle.dump() to drop the object into that file. Let's try that:

;Code Example 3 - pickletest.py
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
### pickletest.py
### PICKLE AN OBJECT

# import the pickle module
import pickle

# lets create something to be pickled
# How about a list?
picklelist = ['one',2,'three','four',5,'can you count?']

# now create a file
# replace filename with the file you want to create
file = open('filename', 'w')

# now let's pickle picklelist
pickle.dump(picklelist,file)

# close the file, and your pickling is complete
file.close()
&lt;/source&gt;
The code to do this is laid out like pickle.load(object_to_pickle, file_object) where:

* object_to_pickle is the object you want to pickle (i.e. save it to file)
* file_object is the file object you want to write to (in this case, the file object is 'file')

After you close the file, open it in notepad and look at what you see. Along with some other gibblygook, you will see bits of the list we created.

Now to re-open, or unpickle, your file. to use this, we would use pickle.load():

;Code Example 4 - unpickletest.py
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
### unpickletest.py
### unpickle file

# import the pickle module
import pickle

# now open a file for reading
# replace filename with the path to the file you created in pickletest.py
unpicklefile = open('filename', 'r')

# now load the list that we pickled into a new object
unpickledlist = pickle.load(unpicklefile)

# close the file, just for safety
unpicklefile.close()

# Try out using the list
for item in unpickledlist:
    print item
&lt;/source&gt;
Nifty, eh?

Of course, the limitation above is that we can only put in one object to a file. We could get around this by putting lots of picklable objects in a list or dictionary, and then pickling that list or dictionary. This is the quickest and easiest way, but you can do some pretty advanced stuff if you have advanced knowledge of pickle.

Which we won't cover.

      <comment>/* Exceptions - Limitations of the Code */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

If you haven't seen them before, you're not trying hard enough. What are they? Errors. Exceptions. Problems. Know what I'm talking about? I got it with this program:

;Code Example 1 - buggy program
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def menu(list, question):
    for entry in list:
        print 1 + list.index(entry),
        print &quot;) &quot; + entry

    return raw_input(question) - 1

# running the function
# remember what the backslash does
answer = menu(['A','B','C','D','E','F','H','I'],\
'Which letter is your favourite? ')

print 'You picked answer ' + (answer + 1)
&lt;/source&gt;
This is just an example of the menu program we made earlier. Appears perfectly fine to me. At least until when I first tried it. Run the program, and what happens?

== Bugs - Human Errors ==

The most common problems with your code are of your own doing. Sad, but true. What do we see when we try to run our crippled program?

;Code Example 2 - error message
&lt;pre&gt;
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;/home/steven/errortest.py&quot;, line 8, in -toplevel-
    answer = menu(&lt; I'll snip it here &gt;)
  File &quot;/home/steven/errortest.py&quot;, line 6, in menu
    return raw_input(question) - 1
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'int'
&lt;/pre&gt;
Say what? What Python is trying to tell you (but struggling to find a good word for it) is that you can't join a string of letters and a number into one string of text. Let's go through the error message and have a look at how it tells us that:

* &lt;code&gt;File &quot;/home/steven/errortest.py&quot;, line 8, in -toplevel-&lt;/code&gt; tells us a couple of things. File &quot;/home/steven/errortest.py&quot; tells us which file the error occured in. This is useful if you use lots of modules that refer to each other. line 8, in -toplevel- tells us that it is in line # 8 of the file, and in the top level (that is, no indentation).
* &lt;code&gt;answer = menu(['A','B','C','D','E','F','H','I'],'Which letter is your favourite? ')&lt;/code&gt; duplicates the code where the error is.
* Since this line calls a function, the next two lines describe where in the function the error occured.
* &lt;code&gt;TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'str' and 'int'&lt;/code&gt; tells you the error. In this case, it is a 'TypeError', where you tried to subtract incompatible variables.

There are multiple file and code listings for a single error, because the error occured with the interaction of two lines of code (e.g. when using a function, the error occured on the line where the function was called, AND the line in the function where things went wrong).

Now that we know what the problem is, how do we fix it. Well, the error message has isolated where the problem is, so we'll only concentrate on that bit of code.

;Code Example 3 - calling the menu function
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
answer = menu(['A','B','C','D','E','F','H','I'],\
'Which letter is your favourite? ')
&lt;/source&gt;
This is a call to a function. The error occured in the function in the following line

;Code Example 4 - Where it went wrong
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
return raw_input(question) - 1
&lt;/source&gt;
raw_input always returns a string, hence our problem. Let's change it to input(), which, when you type in a number, it returns a number:

;Code Example 5 - Fixing it
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
return input(question) - 1
&lt;/source&gt;

Bug fixed!

== Exceptions - Limitations of the Code ==

Okay, the program works when you do something normal. But what if you try something weird? Type in a letter (lets say, 'm') instead of a number? Whoops!

;Code Example 6 - Another error message
&lt;pre&gt;
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;/home/steven/errortest.py&quot;, line 8, in -toplevel-
    answer = menu(&lt; I'll snip it here &gt;)
  File &quot;/home/steven/errortest.py&quot;, line 6, in menu
    return input(question) - 1
  File &quot;&quot;, line 0, in -toplevel-
NameError: name 'm' is not defined
&lt;/pre&gt;
What is this telling us? There are two code listings - one in line 8, and the other in line 6. What this is telling us is that when we called the menu function in line 8, an error occured in line 6 (where we take away 1). This makes sense if you know what the input() function does - I did a bit of reading and testing, and realised that if you type in a letter or word, it will assume that you are mentioning a variable! so in line 6, we are trying to take 1 away from the variable 'm', which doesn't exist.

Have no clue on how to fix this? One of the best and easiest ways is to use the try and except operators.

Here is an example of try being used in a program:

;Code Example 7 - The try operator
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
try:
    function(world, parameters)
except:
    print world.errormsg
&lt;/source&gt;
This is an example of a really messy bit of code that I was trying to fix. First, the code under try: is run. If there is an error, the compiler jumps to the except section and prints world.errormsg. The program doesn't stop right there and crash, it runs the code under except: then continues on.

Let's try that where the error occured in our code (line 6). The menu function now is:

;Code Example 8 - testing our fix
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
def menu(list, question):
    for entry in list:
        print 1 + list.index(entry),
        print &quot;) &quot; + entry
    try:
        return input(question) - 1
    except NameError:
        print &quot;Enter a correct number&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
Try entering a letter when you're asked for a number and see what happens. Dang. We fixed one problem, but now it has caused another problem furthur down the track. This happens all the time. (Sometimes you end up going around in circles, because your code is an absolute mess). Let's have a look at the error:

;Code Example 9 - Yet another error message
&lt;pre&gt;
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File &quot;/home/steven/errortest.py&quot;, line 12, in -toplevel-
    print 'You picked answer', (answer + 1)
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'
&lt;/pre&gt;
What has happened this time is that the menu function has returned no value - it only printed an error message. When, at the end of the program, we try to print the returned value plus 1, what is the returned value? There is no returned value? So what is 1 + ... well, we have no clue what we are adding 1 to!

We could just return any old number, but that would be lying. What we really should to is rewrite the program to cope with this exception. With what? try and except!

;Code Example 10 - yet another solution
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
# from when we finish defining the function
answer = menu(['A','B','C','D','E','F','H','I'],\
'Which letter is your favourite? ')
try:
    print 'You picked answer', (answer + 1)
    # you can put stuff after a comma in the 'print' statement,
    # and it will continue as if you had typed in 'print' again
except:
    print '\nincorrect answer.'
    # the '\n' is for formatting reasons. Try without it and see.
&lt;/source&gt;
Problem solved again.

== Endless Errors ==

The approach that we used above is not recomended. Why? Because apart from the error that we know can happen, except: catches every other error too. What if this means we never see an error that could cause problems down the track? If except: catches every error under the sun, we have no hope of controlling what errors we deal with, and the other ones that we want to see, because so far we haven't dealt with them. We also have little hope of dealing with more than one type of error in the same block of code. What should one do, when all is hopeless? Here is an example of code with such a situation:

;Code Example 11 - The Problem We Face
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print 'Subtraction program, v0.0.1 (beta)'
a = input('Enter a number to subtract from &gt; ')
b = input('Enter the number to subtract &gt; ')
print a - b
&lt;/source&gt;
Okay, you enter your two numbers and it works. Enter a letter, and it gives you a NameError. Lets rewrite the code to deal with a NameError only. We'll put the program in a loop, so it restarts if an error occurs (using continue, which starts the loop from the top again, and break, which leaves the loop):

;Code Example 12 - Dealing With NameError
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print 'Subtraction program, v0.0.2 (beta)'
loop = 1
while loop == 1:
    try:
        a = input('Enter a number to subtract from &gt; ')
        b = input('Enter the number to subtract &gt; ')
    except NameError:
        print &quot;\nYou cannot subtract a letter&quot;
    continue
    print a - b
    try:
        loop = input('Press 1 to try again &gt; ')
    except NameError:
        loop = 0
&lt;/source&gt;
Here, we restarted the loop if you typed in something wrong. In line 12 we assumed you wanted to quit the program if you didn't press 1, so we quit the program.

But there are still problems. If we leave something blank, or type in an unusual character like ! or ;, the program gives us a SyntaxError. Lets deal with this. When we are asking for the numbers to subtract, we will give a different error message. When we ask to press 1, we will again assume the user wants to quit.

;Code Example 13 - Now, dealing with SyntaxError
&lt;source lang=&quot;python&quot;&gt;
print 'Subtraction program, v0.0.3 (beta)'
loop = 1
while loop == 1:
    try:
        a = input('Enter a number to subtract from &gt; ')
        b = input('Enter the number to subtract &gt; ')
    except NameError:
        print &quot;\nYou cannot subtract a letter&quot;
	continue
    except SyntaxError:
        print &quot;\nPlease enter a number only.&quot;
	continue
    print a - b
    try:
        loop = input('Press 1 to try again &gt; ')
    except (NameError,SyntaxError):
        loop = 0
&lt;/source&gt;
As you can see, you can have multiple except uses, each dealing with a different problem. You can also have one except to deal with multiple exceptions, by putting them inside parentheses and seperating them with commas.

Now we have a program that is very difficult, to crash by an end user. As a final challenge, see if you can crash it. There is one way I have thought of - if you read the section on human error carefully, you might know what it is.

First, let us try a naked pre block:

&lt;pre&gt;
[[1,2,3,4]]
&lt;/pre&gt;

And a naked parser function:

{{#tag:pre|[[1,2,3,4]]}}

Then, surrounding pre it with a body note:

{{body note|1=&lt;pre&gt;
[[1,2,3,4]]
&lt;/pre&gt;
}}

Next, HaskellGHCi

{{HaskellGHCi|1=

}}

Finally, HaskellGHCiExample

{{HaskellGHCiExample|1=A list with a single list|2=

...what about a bare Exercises?

{{Exercises|

&lt;code&gt;[[1,2,3,4]]&lt;/code&gt;

&lt;code&gt;[1,2,3, 4]&lt;/code&gt;

      <comment>/* Activity bias Example */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">Activity bias is when an individual, given the choice of taking action or doing nothing, chooses to take action. People want to do something rather than do nothing. Their choice to take action may result in a less-than-optimal decision being made, but they feel that taking action is what they are supposed to do. Activity bias is sometimes referred to as the active participation hypothesis. 

==Background==
Activity bias is often used to explain errors in experimental economics. Experimental economics is the use of experimental methods in order to study questions of economics. Activity bias is present in experimental economics because some experiments may be accidentally worded in such a way or designed to encourage stupid behavior. For example, if a subject is given the choice to participate in a study or not, they might feel like they are supposed to; that they weren’t recruited for the study to do nothing.

==Activity Bias in Experimental Asset Markets==
	One market games experiment was conducted by Vivian Lei, Charles Noussair, and Charles Plott in which there were three sections: Nospec, Twomarket, and Twomarket/Nospec. In the experiment, there were markets set up for assets with a finite number of periods. The asset then paid an allotment in each period, and that allotment was the only source of central value. This allotment is identical for each trader/subject in the experiment and the process is common knowledge to all traders/subjects.  The study found that errors in decision making were resultant of activity bias.
  
===The Asset Market Experiment===
In the Nospec section, the markets are constructed similar to markets that have had bubbles and crashes. For the subject, the ability to speculate is removed and their role is either a buyer or seller so that there is no purpose to buy for the reason of resale. The only possible benefit from a purchase in this experiment is in the allotment that the asset pays out, since the unit can never be resold. In the Twomarket experiment, there is another market that operates simultaneously to the asset market. This asset market allows buying for resale and the market follows a boom and crash pattern. The directions were labeled as such to prevent bias toward inaction or action: “you are not required to participate in either of the markets if you choose not to. It may be to your advantage not to participate in either or it may be to your advantage to participate in one or both. You should decide what might be in your best interest and make your choice accordingly &lt;ref name=Vivian&gt;{{Citation| author = Vivian Lei|author2 = Charles N. Noussair|author3 = Charles R. Plott|title = Nonspeculative Bubbles in Experimental Asset Markets: Lack of Common Knowledge or Rationality vs. Actual Irrationality|year = 2001|type = journal Economica}}&lt;/ref&gt;.” In the Twomarket/Nospec section, there are two markets that are exactly the same as in the Twomarket section, but the option of buying for resale in the asset market is not available. 

	
Even with the directions not indicating a bias towards inaction or action, the subject may still feel as if they are supposed to buy and sell in the markets because they are placed into the market environment with the role of a trader &lt;ref name=Vivian/&gt;. Given this role, the subject may believe that buying and selling is one of the objectives of the experiment. Believing this notion, if the subject was given the choice between an unprofitable transaction and not trading, the subject will choose the unprofitable transaction. This is a speculated reason why so much trading activity occurs and the pattern of stock markets suggests such behavior occurs. In order for activity bias to be present in this study, the volume of trade must decline in the asset market in the Twomarket and Twomarket/Nospec sections relative to the standard experiments in which the asset market is the only market operating.

===Results===	
The Results that Vivian Lei, Charles Noussair, and Charles Plott found indicated that activity bias was present because both the addition of a second market and the changes in the instructions saying that participation was optional “drastically reduced participation in asset market &lt;ref name=Vivian/&gt;.” Activity bias in this experiment explained the large observed transaction volumes in the Nospec section; these transaction volumes were errors in decision-making. The error was believing that one had to buy and sell. The Twomarket and Twomarket/Nospec sections were designed to try to reduce the level of activity bias by stating that participation was optional.

==Activity Bias in Extensive Form Games==
A coordination games experiment was researched by Evren Atiker, William S. Neilson, and Michael K. Price in which they studied the effect of activity bias and focal points in a basic centipede game. &quot;The centipede game itself consists of alternating play of binary choices, with each player making the decision to end the game or continue.  Continuing the game increases the total payoff to the two players, but switches  who receives the larger payoff &lt;ref name = Evren&gt;{{Citation|author = Evren Atiker| author2 = William S. Neilson|author3 = Michael K. Price|title = Activity Bias and Focal Points in Extensive Form Games|year = 2011|type = document|url = http://www.eea-esem.com/files/papers/EEA-ESEM/2011/790/Centipede%20Oslo.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&quot; But, if player A chose to continue and Player B did not at the next node, Player A's payoff would be lower than if A ended the game at the previous node. A single subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE) strategy combination is returned from this payoff format &lt;ref name=Evren/&gt;. The effect in this equilibrium has whatever player who is the first mover ending the game at the very first node. The experiment found that activity bias was a contributing explanation for why the subjects failed to play SPE in the games.

===Basis of the Experiment===
The experiment used the centipede game as the basis and changed it by removing a certain confusing element and and observing how it affects the game play. Changes made are small such as to make minor or no changes in strategy space, no changes in length of the game, and with one exception, to make no changes in the equilibrium path. There were four different approaches that the experiment had. The first approach held constant the joint payoff at all the decision nodes; it was the standard game but without growth in the payoff nodes. The second approach added a pair of nodes to the beginning of the game and continuing the game from this point increased both individual payoffs and joint payoffs. The third approach removed the final two nodes of the game and created a new pair of nodes. This new pair of nodes provided one player with an extremely large payoff while the other player would receive a smaller (and sometimes negative) payoff. The player who receives the larger payoff can only receive this if their opponent ends the game; this is to see the deviations from the SPE play reflect the beliefs about rationality. The fourth and final approach doesn't allow Player B to participate, the outcome of which Player A might be averse to. This approach does provide Player B with a trivial choice if Player A chooses to end the game at the first node &lt;ref name=Evren/&gt;. 

===Hypothesis of the experiment===
The experiment states several hypothesis of what should happen in the game. Hypothesis three predicts that there should be no difference in the frequency of the SPE across the games for Player B in the fourth approach. The frequency of A should be grater in these games than in the games at the beginning of the experiment (standard game). This would be consistent with the explanation of activity bias and one-sided errors, but inconsistent with the prediction that players have a preference for actions that will allow their opponents to have at least one move &lt;ref name=Evren/&gt;.

===Results===
The results of the experiment found that activity bias is a contributing explanation for why the subjects failed to play the SPE in the games. Both players ended up increasing their frequency in which they play dow at the predicted node; it wasn't just Player A.

==Activity Bias and Online Advertising==
An experiment to test advertising effectiveness also tested activity bias and was conducted by the company Yahoo!. The research team wanted to find out if activity bias was the &quot;source of overestimation in observational estimates of the effects of online advertising &lt;ref name = Randall&gt;{{Citation|author = Randall A. Lewis|author2 = Justin M. Rao|author3 = David H. Reiley|title = Here, There, and Everywhere: Correlated Online Behaviors Can Lead to Overestimates of the Effects in Advertising|year = 2011|url = http://www.nber.org/conf_papers/f56911/f56911.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&quot; Because clicks on advertisements are easy to measure, online advertising generated a way to study the effects of advertising. There are two assumptions made: 1) if two people, A and B, looked at the exact advertisement yesterday, and only A is exposed today, then person B would be a good control to use for what would have happened to the exposed individual and 2) a person's behavior yesterday is a good indication of what they would likely do today&lt;ref name = Randall/&gt;. But these assumptions fail to hold for advertising because browsing activity brings exposure to an ad campaign, making other users who saw the ad to be more active on the publisher's site during that time; different users' browsing behavior depict a large difference over time, meaning people browse a different amount of pages every day; and user's browsing behavior across the different websites appear to be positively related meaning someone who browses one website more than usual on a certain day is more likely to be viewing other sites more than usual. These three reasons combine to form the basis of activity bias; in online advertising, activity bias is the &quot;tendency to overestimate the causal effects of advertising using online data &lt;ref name = Randall/&gt;.&quot; Users browsing activity is not consistent over time and, as a result, creates a non-causal correlation between viewing the ads and purchases.

==Activity bias Example==
Suppose an amusement park wanted to estimate the effect of a billboard they put up along the highway would have. The company that owns the park cannot simply compare drivers who saw the ad to drivers who didn't because there are differences in the drivers. For example, drivers who did not see the billboard could be due to that they live on the other side of town. To compensate for this, the company would receive a list of drivers who travel along the highway on their morning commute. If the billboard runs for 2 weeks, then the firm would survey drivers to determine their exposure and what products they used during the 2 week period. Their study finds that the exposed drivers were more likely to come to their park with their families in the 2 week period and the week after that compared to drivers who only saw the ad once or didn't see it at all. Activity bias says the reason for the increased bias is because the drivers were more active in shopping during this period compared to the unexposed drivers. The drivers who were listed as morning commuters on that route, but didn't show up as much during this time may be because of a part-time job, they were sick or out of town, etc. It is likely the ad had a positive effect, but to reach a clear, concise conclusion that the ad was the sole reason is impossible. If that data were on hand, the amusement park company could have found there was an increase in speeding tickets &quot;caused&quot; by the billboard as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Introduction===
Sports and their role in American society has become increasingly controversial with the ballooning salaries of players and the exponential growth of television network contracts.  Take Albert Pujols’ new $254 million/10 year contract with the Angels, or the team’s new $3 billion television agreement with Fox Sports West as examples of unnecessary spending in sports (ESPN).  Neil Postman, a media theorist and author of ''Amusing Ourselves to Death'', would consider sports to be nothing but a distraction that merely entertains and cannot inform or unite.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, Neil. ''Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business''. New York: Penguin, 1986. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; But naysayers, like Postman, often overlook the positive impact that sports have had on society.  Look no further than September 21st, 2001, when the Mets restarted the baseball season by playing the first game since the league suspended play after the World Trade Center collapse.  Or the New Orleans Saints who won the 2009 Super Bowl, and returned normalcy to a city, and stadium, rocked by Hurricane Katrina just a few years before.  I consider sports to be the world’s rawest reality show which lets fans connect with a team or player in ways that they can’t with political parties or movie stars.  We live and die with our team’s success and it’s this connection that makes sports a vital piece in the public sphere.

====The Mets and 9/11====
September 11th, 2001, is forever a day of infamy in American history.  It seemed like the entire nation was frozen for a week, in awe and disbelief of what just happened and for ten days, the professional baseball season was put on hold by commissioner Bud Selig.  The New York Mets would have the honor of re-opening the 2001 season by hosting their bitter rival Atlanta Braves on the 21st of September.  Johnny Franco, closer for the Mets at the time, said it best: “Nobody knew what the right time was, or if it was the right time to come back&quot; (MLB.com).  The Mets took the field donning FDNY caps and patches. The opening ceremonies were touching, and chants of “U-S-A” could be heard from the stands.  However, fans at the game described the moment as confusing.  They felt odd cheering and giving their all for something as meaningless as a baseball game, after something so much bigger had just shook America.  Yet, as the soon-to-be-hero Mike Piazza, later stated, there was something necessary about it:  “People wanted to find refuge in baseball: in a crowd and around other people&quot; (MLB.com).
	In the 8th inning of a 2-1 game, Mike Piazza stepped up to the plate with a runner on first and one out with a chance to reclaim the lead.  With one swing of the bat, Piazza was about to send Shea Stadium into a state of frenzy.  Down 0-1 in the count, Piazza swung at a low fastball and belted it out of the park to left center, forever changing baseball history.  The stadium erupted, and fans suddenly felt comfortable cheering.  For the first time in ten days, New Yorkers had something to jump with joy about.  It was as if Piazza’s homerun snapped New York out of its misery and returned it to a state of belief.  Everything felt right, and hundreds of children who had lost parents and relatives to the attacks could laugh and scream with excitement.  The game was something out of a Hollywood script, but so much better because it was real and tangible.
	  No words of a politician, or declarations of war would fix the immediate pain felt by individuals touched by 9/11, but the Mets could.  It’s amazing to think that one swing of a bat could pump life into a city that seemed dead just days before.  Mets announcer Howie Rose put it simply: “Shea Stadium has something to smile about.”  The building was waiting to explode all night, and they finally got their chance.  To have strangers on your right and left high five you and hug you and jump with you was the medicine needed to bring comfort to New York.  It gave business men something positive to talk about at the water cooler the next day, and it provided a moment that every person watching could reflect on and draw inspiration from.

====The Saints and Hurricane Katrina====
In 2005, Hurricane Katrina, a category five hurricane, rocked New Orleans and sent the city into chaos.  Over 1,800 people were killed, and total property damage reached over $81 billion.  So many places had been destroyed that people began seeking refuge in the Superdome, the stadium and home of the Saints football team.  Images of citizens standing on their roofs screaming at military helicopters for help still plays in the minds of many Americans.  President Bush’s embarrassing attempts at rescue only infuriated the city and drove them to extreme limits.  In fact, Martial Law, a law stating that military force can be used on Americans, was about five minutes from being enacted, a situation that would have forever changed history.  Luckily, the law was not put into effect and slowly, the city began to heal, yet again with the help of sports.
	In 2006, the Superdome was cleared out and given back to the New Orleans Saints.  They reopened their stadium on Monday Night Football against Michael Vick and the Atlanta Falcons and a storybook three years was about to unfold.  The sellout crowd packed the stadium and waved signs reading “Welcome Home Saints” and “Dome Sweet Dome.”  After the Saints' defense forced a three and out on the first drive, the Falcons' special teams unit came out to punt the ball from around their own 30 yard line.  Steve Gleason broke through the line and blocked Atlanta’s punt backwards; it was recovered by Curtis Deloatch who took several steps and dove clumsily into the end zone, which set the tone for the next few years.
	What was an abysmal team for years prior suddenly harnessed the angst and emotion of their city, put the people on their backs and carried them to happiness.  For three years, the Saints scratched and clawed their way to better and better records, taking the pain and frustration of the city and using it as fuel for motivation to continue to grow as a team.  It was a two-way connection between team and fans.  The team drove the fans to keep fighting for their normalcy at home, while the fans drove the team to fight for wins on the field.  Having something to look forward to each Sunday gave those who lost everything a chance to gain something once a week.     
	When President Bush’s words couldn’t revive the city, the Saints did.  Once again, political rhetoric wasn’t believable; it wasn’t tangible.  Football games were more than entertainment; they were weekly doses of medicine prescribed to return joy and comfort.  Our political system made horrendous efforts to help the people of New Orleans.  They needed something local to come together around because Washington wasn’t providing that stability.

===Sports as a Means of Getting an Education===
As Al Gore stated in his book, The Assault on Reason, “In an age where education has more economic value than ever before, it is obvious that education should have a higher national priority. It is also clear that democracies are more likely to succeed when there is wide-spread access to high-quality education”. &lt;ref&gt;Gore, Al. The Assault on Reason. London: Penguin, 2007. 250. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; While it is clear that proper education is important, it is not necessarily easy for youth, especially those in at-risk areas, to have access to proper education. There are, however, many ways in which athletics can provide opportunities to kids and teens that otherwise would not have access to proper educational tools. Thanks to these opportunities, our citizenry can become more adequately informed and the Public Sphere benefits, as well.
====The Tiger Woods Foundation====
Back in 1996, Tiger Woods and his father, Earl, set up an organization to provide educational resources to students that would help streamline them into colleges across the country. The Tiger Woods Foundation has a campus in Southern California, two campuses in Washington D.C., and have recently announced that another location will be opening up in Philadelphia. At these campuses, students are provided with a great amount of technology and learning tools that give them a hands-on learning experience that is difficult for them to obtain in the inner-city public school system.

[[File:Tiger Woods in 2009.jpg|thumb|Tiger Woods uses his celebrity appeal to attract youth towards education]]

After the death of his father in 2006, Tiger Woods dedicated the Earl Woods Scholarship in his memory. This scholarship is given to the most deserving students involved in the TWF and provide them with thousands of dollars every year to help pay for their college education. In addition, the TWF also provides these scholars with a mentor and specialized internships that prepare them for life after they graduate college. Not only does this scholarship program provide urban youth with a means of continuing their education and help jump-start their careers, but, given the selectivity of the program (dozens of scholarships for thousands of students) the competition motivates the students to be their best and learn as much as they can. Because of this, even if they miss the cut and don’t win a scholarship, they have hopefully learned a lot in the program and will be able to leave the program with a quality education – perhaps even continue their education on their own.

By setting up these campuses in big cities like Anaheim, Washington, and Philadelphia, the TWF has reached out to thousands of youth that otherwise would not have access to high-quality educational tools such as those the program provides. Thanks to these tools and the Earl Woods Scholarship program, urban youth become more educated citizens and will eventually be able to give back to their communities in similar ways, creating a cycle that, hopefully, will break the barriers preventing urban youth from having access to proper education. It is a prime example of how professional athletics can reach youth in ways that traditional educational systems simply cannot match.

====High School Athletes Escaping Bad Situations====
Compton, California is one of, if not, the most dangerous cities in America. Once referred to as the murder capital of the US, young teens have little hope of ever leaving the gang-ridden city, let alone making it past their teen years alive. College recruiters, however, flock to Compton on a yearly basis to scout the talent, particularly for football and basketball. Athletics are one of the only ways for young people to get out of their dangerous living situations.

In 2011, CBS News and Sports Illustrated Magazine joined forces and followed a high school athlete named Kitam Hamm Jr. and showcased how his parents, once linked to the Crips gang, taught him how to survive in Compton. Hamm had a GPA of 3.8, but because of the reputation of Compton, very few schools had interest in his academic prowess. What stood out to the top universities, however, was his tremendous football talent.

Schools from all over the country, including Ivy League institutions, were constantly in touch with young Hamm, as college recruiters usually are, and they all took great interest in his life and safety. At his high school, his teachers and coaches took special interest in Hamm because they knew that he had a ticket out of that horrible place and wanted to see him take it.
To some, the vulture-like tendencies of college recruiters can be a turn off and will say that they don’t care about the student, only the athlete. But, regardless of their intentions, these recruiters have given Hamm a way to get out – a way to survive. 

As with the case with all athletes in inner cities, simply participating in sports helps student-athletes from staying out of trouble. “Football practice occupies the biggest chunk of Hamm's school day. That's by design. The time between school letting out and nightfall is when boys in Compton get into trouble. Football provides an alternative.” &lt;ref&gt;Benedict, Jeff. &quot;Straight Outta Compton.&quot; top student and football star in South Central L.A., Kitam Hamm is one of a growing number of high school athletes who face life-and-death decisions every day as they try to survive in gang-infested communities. 5 Dec 2011: n. page. Web. 26 Apr. 2013. &lt;http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1192636/1/index.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
By keeping these at-risk teens busy, it keeps them away from the gangs, away from crime, away from police. The structure and discipline sport provides helps them become better role models for their fellow citizens. It helps the community rally around something healthy, collectively. While this may be more difficult in inner cities, it gives some in the community something to be proud of: seeing Hamm, who has been through what they’re going through, “make it” into a better place in the world.
[[File:Compton High School billboard.jpg|thumb|High School is the only safe haven for many athletes in dangerous neighborhoods]]
Given his academic abilities, regardless of whether football pans out as a career, Hamm has the ability to go on to contribute great things to society and reach out to others in his situation. At the time of the article’s publication, Hamm indicated that he would like to attend Columbia University; a prestigious school built on academic success. Thanks to football, Hamm and countless others have been given the tools to succeed in life and make a better society.

====How it all Connects====
Jürgen Habermas and other scholars of the Public Sphere list sport as a distraction from “important” issues in the world such as politics and the economy. In some ways, they are right, although I believe that sport is intended to be a distraction; a way to help people get through the hardships of daily life. However, what they fail to account for is how the economic and popular force that is sport and how it can influence an entire culture and an entire nation.

During the recent National Basketball Association (NBA) lockout, there were dozens of local businesses in small-market NBA host cities (Cleveland, Portland, Oklahoma City, etc.) that were forced to go out of business because the games no longer attracted fans to their stores/restaurants near the stadium. Places that would normally be packed with crazed fans before and after basketball games were barren. Even the arenas had to layoff employees because there was no money coming in from games anymore. Sports provided these cities with business, prosperity, and culture. In order to have a healthy Public Sphere, it is important for the citizenry to not only feel pride for their home, but also have a sense of comradery with their fellow citizens so that difficult problems might be solved more easily. A group is more likely to reach consensus when they like each other rather than hate each other.

Education is the bloodstream of the Public Sphere. Without it, society would become decultured and mankind would slip into a radical state. It is important that every citizen be provided the tools necessary to make that education happen. While that task is nearly impossible to accomplish, sport plays but a small role in that education. An athlete doesn’t have to “go pro” in order for their years of dedication to mean something. In the case of Kitam Hamm Jr., sports provided him with a path towards the highest education in the country in the Ivy League, the moral structure and fortitude that should be sought in all citizens, and even helped him stay alive past the age of 18.

In the case of the Tiger Woods Foundation, urban youth become interested in education in ways that public schools only dream of doing. Putting a famous name and face like that of a professional athlete’s draws in a demographic that otherwise would find education to be boring and pointless. 

Also, it is important that those who succeed through these programs continue to pass on their learning and connections with others that are in similar situations to those that they were in. For Kitam, that mentor role was filled by Greg Camarillo, a wide receiver for the Minnesota Vikings that met Kitam through his inner city program and has helped guide him in his life ever since.
Kids need a chance and sports give them that chance. It is a small role, to be sure, but to those who are lucky enough to get those opportunities, the world is opened up to them. Like Al Gore said, “…democracies are more likely to succeed when there is wide-spread access to high-quality education”.

===Effects of Lockouts on the Public Sphere===
While Jürgen Habermas and other influential figures of the Public Sphere say that sports are merely a distraction, it is quite apparent that people connect with sports in ways that cannot be done otherwise. Sports play a tremendous roll in the education of students, helping develop young minds into mature, goal-driven contributors to society. Sports may not be out of a textbook, but lessons can always be learned. Professional sports are entertaining for viewers and still provide lessons for the younger fans, such as how to interact with players from the other team and respecting your coach. Children understand sports and always have a favorite athlete; someone they want to be when they grow up. Professional athletes serve as mentors, even though they may never come in direct contact with their biggest fans.

Being a professional at anything, whether it be in medicine, dentistry, or sports, comes with a responsibility. Professionals are expected to act as exemplary members of society. Recently there have been some rather serious disturbances to that image. Since the turn of the millennium, there have been five lockouts in professional sports. There were two in the NHL, two in the NFL (a player lockout and a referee lockout), and one in the NBA. While these lockouts certainly frustrate everyone immediately involved, it also disrupts the Public Sphere outside of the sport itself.

====NHL Lockout====
The first of two NHL Lockouts would occur during the 2004-2005 hockey season. It was the second lockout since Commissioner Gary Bettman took the reigns, and it would cripple the league’s image. Before the season even began, team owners were demanding a salary cap of $35 million and a plan to give players a 50/50 cut on league revenue. &lt;ref&gt;Dater, Adrian. &quot;NHL lockout timeline: comparing 2004-05 to 2012-13.&quot; As the calendar nears the Sept, 15 expiration of the NHL's Collective Bargaining Agreement, it's starting to look, sound and feel a lot like the dark fall of 2004. 29 August 2012: page 1. Web. 24 April 2013. &lt;http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2012/writers/adrian_dater/08/23/nhl-lockout-timeline/index.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Negotiations were on-and-off until Bettman finally decided to cancel what was left of the already-reduced schedule. An entire season of hockey was being cut from the calendar, and there were talks of the following season being cancelled as well.

While the financial aspects of the lockout between players and owners seems insane for most people, the financial impact on the immediate areas surrounding hockey rinks was apparent. Areas such as Detroit, Pittsburgh, and Boston witnessed small businesses having to close shop. This was a direct result of the lockout because without the hockey season, some small shops could not afford to stay open. Their revenue came from tourists and fans, and without hockey there was a serious decrease in both. Shops that sold memorabilia and replica uniforms struggled without the influx of money from fans. While millionaires squabbled over dimes and nickels, people who paid attention to hockey saw a change in the sport’s image in the Public Sphere.

====NBA Lockout====
Before the start of the 2011 NBA season, Commissioner David Stern announced that the league would be locked out. There had been talks of such an event for months, but people held out hope that the issue would be resolved without having a second sports lockout in the same year (the NFL had held a brief lockout just months before). However, there would be immediate groans of disbelief and resentment as the NBA locked out its players. It would be yet another argument over money, and “it was extremely difficult for most NBA fans to sympathize with millionaires and billionaires arguing over money.”&lt;ref&gt;Glass, Alana. &quot;Why The NBA Lockout Wasn't So Bad After All.&quot; We can all agree that the NBA Lockout didn’t shed the greatest light on professional basketball. 2 December 2011: page 1. Web. 25 April 2013. &lt;http://www.forbes.com/sites/sportsmoney/2011/12/02/why-the-nba-lockout-wasnt-so-bad-after-all/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the NBA was able to salvage its season and play a condensed schedule of only 66 games (instead of the normal 82), its image in the Public Sphere had been badly wounded. In similar fashion to the 2004-05 NHL Lockout, small businesses around the basketball arenas were immediately and harshly impacted by the lack of tourism and fans. 

====NFL Lockout====
The fan base of the NFL was aware of the oncoming lockout as early as April of 2011, and it was ready to accept its arrival. It wasn’t that people would not fight it, but that people believed it could be ended quickly. Fans were okay with a low profile draft and a quiet offseason, but that was all in the anticipation of a quick solution between the NFL Players Association (NFLPA) and the owners.&lt;ref&gt;Toback, Shaun. &quot;NFL Lockout 2011: How the NFL Is Shooting Itself in the Foot.&quot; Early April is a boring time to be an NFL fan. 1 April 2011. Web. 24 April 2013. &lt;http://bleacherreport.com/articles/651542-lockout-2011-how-the-nfl-is-shooting-itself-in-the-foot&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the NFL Lockout would not be solved as quickly as fans had hoped. Just like the NBA players and owners would do later that same year, NFL players and owners argued over millions of dollars. Again, merchandise sales plummeted and, just like their NHL and NBA counterparts, NFL fans started turning their backs. While the millionaires dispute over money, they forget about the people who essentially paid them. Without the fans, many owners and players would not be as rich as they are today. The NFL Lockout was another victim of the Public Sphere in sports, and those within the league had only themselves to blame.
 
Back in 1994, Major League Baseball (the MLB) encountered its own player strike. Prior to its occurrence, owners had seen the sport’s popularity as a chance to cash in and get rich; what they forgot to do was keep fighting for the sport. When the MLB’s elite kicked back and allowed everything to go up in flames, the fans were all but forgotten. Fans were not too displeased initially, but with the cancellation of the 1994 World Series, everything changed. Baseball had been enjoying the peak of its popularity, and in an instant it was gone. Baseball fans don’t see the World Series as just a championship, but as an entirely different season. 

Jump forward to the NFL Lockout in 2011 and the same attitude can be seen amongst the fans. People didn’t mind the loss of preseason games; those hardly counted for anything more than a scrimmage. What people worried about was the loss of an entire season. With the NFL’s level of popularity, especially in recent years, a cancelled season could have ended the league. While the 2011 NFL schedule would proceed almost without interruption, minus the preseason games, it left a scar on the NFL. Once again, due to the greediness of millionaires, the Public Sphere was affected by the flow of money and not by the sport.

====How the Lockouts all Connect in the Public Sphere====
Jürgen Habermas may believe that sports are a distraction in the Public Sphere, but in the U.S. everything runs on money. That’s just the way capitalism works. Without a profit it is hard to succeed. Based on that fact alone, it is not far-fetched to say that sports are not actually the distraction anymore, if they ever were. Instead, the distractions stem from the disruption of comfort. People feel comfortable when they are watching sports and enjoy themselves. When that is taken from them, they lose a contributing factor to their pursuit of happiness. The Public Sphere is affected more by the flow of money than the act of watching a sporting event.

What these lockouts all have in common is that too much power was put in the hands of too few people. Due to the very fact that capitalism is a democratic idea, one could argue that the Constitutional rules should still apply when it comes to making decisions. As Al Gore states in his book, The Assault on Reason:
	
&lt;center&gt;The “auxiliary precautions” [James Madison] had in mind were the checks and balances that our Founders used in their design of the Constitution in order to prevent the unhealthy concentration of too much power in the hands of a few—and thereby to force those in authority to justify their views to one another by applying the rule of reason.&lt;ref&gt;Gore, Al. The Assault on Reason. London: Penguin, 2007. 216. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/center&gt;

Not enough people had a say in any of the lockouts. Players took to Twitter, Facebook, and other media outlets to vent their frustration, but nothing they said would be heard by those in power. Only a handful of star players ever have the ability to influence such an issue, but even then the stars’ requests and ideas can fall on deaf ears. The only thing players could do was wait it out and find another way to kill time. In the NBA, for example, a number of players left to play in other leagues around the world. To these players it was more about being able to play than about making an extra couple million dollars. 

The lockouts always cast a shadow over the affected sport because of how the incident looks in the Public Sphere. No one will sympathize with rich men trying to make more money than they can handle, and as a result the fan bases can shrink or even disappear. Sports can be entertaining, but they become a distraction when money is an issue. Of course, that’s the nature of capitalism, but democracy does not exist behind the closed doors of those lockouts.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Because of the loyal nature associated with dogs, humans have found it useful to use these kind of friendly dogs and train them to work and captivate us using tricks. By using a bit of endurance and effort we can teach our own dogs a great number of important activities to help make our lives greater. Unless you actually do not have the time to invest in training your current dog, it is usually much better for both individual to work with your pet yourself. You can find professional dog trainers you can use to teach your dog certain regimens but they will be unable to help you bond with your four-legged friend.

 Exercising is a good marvellous way to bond with your dog. A happy dog is certainly one [http://www.amazon.com/How-To-Train-Dog-ebook/dp/B00699A196 how to train a dog] regularly exercised and has basic obedience training. And a dog that could be well-exercised will invariably much better behaved. Knowning that makes for a happy dog and a content owner!

 At this moment, let's talk about Dog Training Trainer created by Kobie Lawson and the way it may help you actually. I really hope this short Dog Training Coach Review will assist you to differentiate whether Dog Training Instructor is Con or a Real.

 When you get a new dog, it's important you will get a harbess to use for her too. It's usually required by law to have an individual's dog on a teather in most regions. You need to start things away by getting the right one for your dog.

 It is actually understandable to wish to move towards the next session when your dog performs a command properly. You are excited about your pets progress therefore you want to always keep things going into the right guidance. But the greatest strategy is to learn one endeavor before starting the next individual. This is accomplished as a result of repetition exercises, and it is by far the most essential step in successful training. Start every new wisdom by analyzing previous coaching. Build your dogs self esteem by letting him perform chores he is knowledgeable about before progressing with fresh material.

 Training clicker training is effective considering that the clicking sound is a very exceptional sound definitely not heard within everyday life. Compared with our voice which can be read often, dog clicker are listened to only when a dog does what you would like. So when the particular dog hears a clicker they know that he performed something to thrill you.

 There are 3 basic factors your dog should learn through fundamental dog training. These are: stay, stay, and are avalable. The first part associated with dog training is to tutor your dog to sit down. To start this unique dog training, you will initial need some dog snacks.

 Positive dog behavior schools and dog obedience training programs can help to shape your dog on the beauty salon diva that you know she will be. She is going to be confident, fearless in the face of grooming gizmos, and often will view grooming as quality time with you.

 Made is a great strategy to teach calm behavior. The calmer any dog, the easier plus much more enjoyable it is to be around ones dog. Your friends will enjoy you and your dog improved when they come over to your house plus your dog does not soar all over these individuals.</text>

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] (global to the system) or in a page on your own userspace.
* Remember to use [[Commons:Main Page|Commons]] project for image uploading.
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks are open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer since things work a little different here.
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to keep a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]].

* Most of this page is a comment on the GPL's inability to link well with non-GPL programs. The LGPL fixes this issue.
* The page mentions GNOME - actually, a lot of the library side (GTK+, for example) of GNOME is licensed under the LGPL. So, if I just use GTK+ and GLib, the claim &quot;the entire application would have to be licensed under the GPL&quot; is false.

[[File:Guangzhou-electronic-components-shop-0479.jpg|thumb|The &quot;electronic components district&quot; of [[Guangzhou]], where numerous shops sell electronic components to other companies that would use them to manufacture consumer goods.]]
'''Business-to-business''' ('''B2B''') describes commerce transactions between businesses, such as between a [[manufacturer]] and a [[wholesaler]], or between a wholesaler and a retailer.  Contrasting terms are business-to-consumer ([[business-to-consumer|B2C]]) and business-to-government ([[business-to-government|B2G]]).

The volume of B2B (Business-to-Business) transactions is much higher than the volume of B2C transactions.

&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Shelly | first = Gary | title = Systems analysis and design | publisher = Course Technology, Cengage Learning | location = Boston, MA | year = 2011 | isbn = 0538474432 | page = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Garbade | first = Michael | title = Differences in Venture Capital Financing of U.S., UK, German and French Information Technology Start-ups A Comparative Empirical Research of the Investment Process on the Venture Capital Firm Level | publisher = GRIN Verlag GmbH | location = München | year = 2011 | isbn = 3640893166 | page = 31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary reason for this is that in a typical [[supply chain]] there will be many B2B transactions involving sub components or [[raw materials]], and only one B2C transaction, specifically sale of the finished product to the end customer.  For example, an automobile manufacturer makes several B2B transactions such as buying tires, glass for windscreens, and rubber hoses for its vehicles.  The final transaction, a finished vehicle sold to the consumer, is a single ([[business-to-consumer|B2C]]) transaction. 

B2B is also used in the context of communication and collaboration.  Many businesses are now using social media to connect with their consumers (B2C); however, they are now using similar tools within the business so employees can connect with one another.  When communication is taking place amongst employees, this can be referred to as &quot;B2B&quot; communication.

==Etymology==
The term was originally coined to describe the [[electronic communication]]s between [[business]]es or [[Organization|enterprises]] in order to distinguish it from the [[communication]]s between businesses and consumers (&quot;[[business-to-consumer]]&quot;). It eventually came to be used in [[marketing]] as well, initially describing only industrial or [[capital goods]] marketing. Today it is widely used to describe all products and [[Service (economics)|services]] used by enterprises. Many professional institutions and the trade publications focus much more on B2C than B2B, although most sales and marketing personnel are in the B2B sector.

'''Consumer-to-business''' ('''C2B''') is a business model in which consumers (individuals) create value, and firms consume this value. For example, when a consumer writes reviews, or when a consumers gives a useful idea for new product development, then this individual is creating value to the firm, if the firm adopts the input. Excepted concepts are crowd sourcing and co-creation. 

Another form of C2B is the electronic commerce business model, in which consumers can offer products and services to companies and the companies pay them. This business model is a complete reversal of traditional business model where companies offer goods and services to consumers (business-to-consumer = B2C).  We can see this example in blogs or internet forums where the author offers a link back to an online business facilitating the purchase of some product (like a book on Amazon.com), and the author might receive affiliate revenue from a successful sale.
. 

This kind of economic relationship is qualified as an inverted business type. The advent of the C2B scheme is due to major changes:

* Connecting a large group of people to a bidirectional network has made this sort of commercial relationship possible. The large traditional media outlets are one direction relationship whereas the internet is bidirectional one.
* Decreased cost of technology : Individuals now have access to technologies that were once only available to large companies ( digital printing and acquisition technology, high performance computer, powerful software)

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{info|This page (as arguably the conventions themselves) is a work in progress.}}

This page documents some of the style conventions in use through the Haskell wikibook. Before we start, a few important remarks. 
* This page will have examples for most of the conventions present; so if you have doubts on how to add them to a page, just click edit and check the wikitext source. 
* At present many of the conventions here are still in flux; and there are several inconsistencies accumulated over the years around the book (we will point out some of the most annoying ones). You can use the [[Talk:Haskell/Style conventions|talk page]] to voice your opinions about such issues and bring them closer to resolution.
* Last, but not least: ''do not bite newcomers over these conventions!'' Not only because several of the points are not set in stone, but also because making a fuss about them would generally be counter-productive - new editors who stick around will get used to the main conventions soon enough.

== Code samples ==

The one stable convention about code samples is to use &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;&lt;/source&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; blocks for samples in source files and &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; blocks for GHCi samples:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
numOfSolutions a b c
    | disc &gt; 0  = 2
    | disc == 0 = 1
    | otherwise = 0
        where
        disc = b^2 - 4*a*c
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
Prelude&gt; (2 + 2 == 5) || (2 &gt; 0)
True
Prelude&gt; (||) (18 == 17) (9 &gt;= 11)
False
&lt;/pre&gt;

The main difference is that source blocks have syntax highlighting, while pre blocks do not (the highlighting does not fit well with GHCi samples). Large sections of the book still do not follow this basic convention, but that is slowly being corrected (you can help with that if you find non-conforming passages). 

=== Example templates ===

Beyond the basic tags, there are also the example templates - [[Template:HaskellExample]], [[Template:HaskellGHCi]] and [[Template:HaskellGHCiExample]] - click the links to see usage instructions. As of now, these are used mostly on the first few chapters of the book. There are a few issues with the usage of such templates. In most places all they add is a caption to the examples, which is not too useful given the lack of an index of examples, plus some extra indentation to the block atop the already distinctive layout of pre/source blocks (but cf. [[Talk:Haskell#Examples|this discussion]] about the semantics of example blocks). Furthermore, their handling is annoying to editors - not just due to verbosity, but also due to the issues with escaping special characters (see [[Template:!]] and [[Template:=]]) which make adding source and pre tags automatically with the template more trouble than it is worth. Due to these issues, there is recurring talk of eliminating example templates altogether, but thus far no editor was bold enough to push in one direction or the other.   

=== Inline code ===

Inline code samples like &lt;code&gt;2 + 2 == 4&lt;/code&gt; should be within &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;code&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags (tt tags are used for that purpose in several places; they are gradually being converted to code tags). A minor technicality is that lists within lists such as &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[['a','b'],&quot;c&quot;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; should be wrapped in nowiki tags inside the code tags - otherwise MediaWiki or other renderers might process the double square brackets as wikilinks.

== Navigational templates ==

''TODO: [[Template:Haskell minitoc]], [[Template:Haskell navigation]] and the chapter templates.''

== Notes and references ==

We make liberal use of footnotes as a way to present brief but distracting digressions, external references and pointers to chapters later in the book. References should be added at the point they are anchored in the text, within &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;ref&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt; tags, like this one&lt;ref&gt;foobar&lt;/ref&gt;. If a page has footnotes, [[Template:Haskell/NotesSection]] should be added to the bottom of the page, between the last section and the navigational templates at the very bottom.

{{body note|For longer digressions, create a body note like this one with [[Template:Body note]]. It would be wise not to have too many of these in a single page...}}

== Links ==

Hyperlinks can be useful, but should be used with discretion - since a wikibook is in essence still a book, it should not rely too heavily on external content and also be useful and easy to navigate in a printed version. Internal links within the book are less problematic than external links, but it is better to make to what the link points explicit (that is, &quot;as we will see in [[Haskell/More about lists|More about lists]]&quot; is better than &quot;as we will see [[Haskell/More about lists|a few chapters ahead]]&quot;). ''TODO: Mention [[Template:Haskell lib]], and when it is better to move a link to a footnote.''

== Exercises and solutions ==

''TODO: [[Template:Exercises]] and solution pages.''

== Miscellaneous ==

''TODO: math tags, clear templates and other small tricks.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Electronic commerce''', commonly known as '''e-commerce'''  or '''e-comm''', refers to the buying and selling of [[product (business)|product]]s or [[Service (economics)|service]]s over electronic systems such as the [[Internet]] and other [[computer network]]s. Electronic commerce draws on such technologies as [[electronic funds transfer]], [[supply chain management]], [[Internet marketing]], [[online transaction processing]], [[electronic data interchange]] (EDI), [[inventory management]] systems, and automated data collection systems. Modern electronic commerce typically uses the [[World Wide Web]] at least at one point in the transaction's life-cycle, although it may encompass a wider range of technologies such as [[e-mail]], mobile devices and telephones as well.

* Electronic commerce is generally considered to be the sales aspect of [[e-business]]. It also consists of the exchange of data to facilitate the financing and payment aspects of business transactions.

E-commerce can be divided into:
    
* E-tailing or &quot;virtual storefronts&quot; on Web sites with online catalogs, sometimes gathered into a &quot;virtual mall&quot;
* The gathering and use of demographic data through Web contacts
* Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), the business-to-business exchange of data
* E-mail and fax and their use as media for reaching prospects and established customers (for example, with newsletters)
* Business-to-business buying and selling
* The security of business transactions

==History==
===Early development===
Originally, electronic commerce was identified as the facilitation of commercial transactions electronically, using technology such as [[Electronic Data Interchange|Electronic Data Interchange (EDI)]] and [[Electronic funds transfer|Electronic Funds Transfer (EFT)]]. These were both introduced in the late 1970s, allowing businesses to send commercial documents like purchase orders or invoices electronically. The growth and acceptance of credit cards, automated teller machines (ATM) and telephone banking in the 1980s were also forms of electronic commerce. Another form of e-commerce was the airline reservation system typified by Sabre in the USA and Travicom in the UK.

Beginning in the 1990s, electronic commerce would include [[enterprise resource planning]] systems (ERP), [[data mining]] and [[data warehousing]]

In 1990, [[Tim Berners-Lee]] invented the [[WorldWideWeb]] [[web browser]] and transformed an academic telecommunication network into a worldwide everyman everyday communication system called internet/www. Commercial enterprise on the [[Internet]] was strictly prohibited by NSF until 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kevin Kelly (editor)|Kevin Kelly]]: [http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.08/tech.html?pg=2 We Are the Web] [[Wired magazine]], Issue 13.08, August 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Internet became popular worldwide around 1994 with the adoption of [[Mosaic (web browser)|Mosaic]] web browser, it took about five years to introduce security protocols (i.e. SSL encryption enabled on Netscape 1.0 Browser  in late 1994) and [[DSL]] allowing continual connection to the Internet. By the end of 2000, many European and American business companies offered their services through the [[World Wide Web]]. Since then people began to associate a word &quot;[[ecommerce]]&quot; with the ability of purchasing various goods through the Internet using secure protocols and electronic payment services.

===Timeline===
The timeline for e-commerce progression is shown below.

==Business applications==
[[File:Automated online assistant.png|thumb|200px|An example of an [[automated online assistant]] on a merchandising website.]]
Some common applications related to electronic commerce are the following:
* [[Document automation]] in [[supply chain]] and [[logistics]]
* Domestic and international [[payment system]]s
* [[Enterprise content management]]
* [[Group buying]]
* [[Automated online assistant]]s
* [[Instant messaging]]
* [[Newsgroups]]
* [[Online shopping]] and order tracking
* [[Online banking]]
* [[Online office suite]]s
* [[Shopping cart software]]
* [[Teleconferencing]]
* [[Electronic ticket]]s

==Governmental regulation==
In the United States, some electronic commerce activities are regulated by the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC).  These activities include the use of commercial e-mails, online advertising and consumer [[privacy]].  The [[CAN-SPAM Act of 2003]] establishes national standards for direct marketing over e-mail. The [[Federal Trade Commission Act]] regulates all forms of advertising, including online advertising, and states that advertising must be truthful and non-deceptive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.ftc.gov/bcp/conline/pubs/buspubs/ruleroad.shtm |title= Advertising and Marketing on the Internet: Rules of the Road |publisher= [[Federal Trade Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using its authority under Section 5 of the FTC Act, which prohibits unfair or deceptive practices, the FTC has brought a number of cases to enforce the promises in corporate privacy statements, including promises about the security of consumers’ personal information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.ftc.gov/privacy/privacyinitiatives/promises.html |title= Enforcing Privacy Promises: Section 5 of the FTC Act |publisher= [[Federal Trade Commission]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; As result, any corporate privacy policy related to e-commerce activity may be subject to enforcement by the FTC.

The Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2008, which came into law in 2008, amends the [[Controlled Substances Act]] to address [[Online pharmacy|online pharmacies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-6353&amp;tab=summary |title= H.R. 6353: Ryan Haight Online Pharmacy Consumer Protection Act of 2008 |publisher= [[Govtrack]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Internationally''' there is the International Consumer Protection and Enforcement Network (ICPEN), which was formed in 1991 from an informal network of government customer fair trade organisations. The purpose was stated as being to find ways of co-operating on tackling consumer problems connected with cross-border transactions in both goods and services, and to help ensure exchanges of information among the participants for mutual benefit and understanding. From this came econsumer, as an initiative of ICPEN since April 2001. www.econsumer.gov is a portal to report complaints about online and related transactions with foreign companies.
 
There is also '''Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation''' (APEC) was established in 1989 with the vision of achieving stability, security and prosperity for the region through free and open trade and investment. APEC has an Electronic Commerce Stearing Group as well as working on common privacy regulations throughout the APEC region.
 
In '''Australia''', Trade is covered under [[Australian Treasury Guidelines for electronic commerce]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.treasury.gov.au/documents/1083/HTML/docshell.asp?URL=australian_guidelines_for_electronic_commerce.htm |title=Australian Treasury Guidelines for electronic commerce|publisher= [[Australian Federal Government]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Australian Competition and Consumer Commission]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.accc.gov.au/ |title=Australian Competition and Consumer Commission |publisher= [[Australian Federal Government]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; regulates and offers advice on how to [[deal with businesses online]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.accc.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/54056 |title=Dealing with Businesses Online in Australia |publisher= [[Australian Federal Government]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offers specific advice on [[what happens if things go wrong.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.accc.gov.au/content/index.phtml/itemId/815341|title=What to do if thing go wrong in Australia|publisher= [[Australian Federal Government]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Also [[Australian government ecommerce website]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.digitalbusiness.gov.au|title=Australian government ecommerce website |publisher= [[Australian Federal Government]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides information on ecommerce in Australia.

==Forms==
Contemporary electronic commerce involves everything from ordering &quot;digital&quot; content for immediate online consumption, to ordering conventional goods and services, to &quot;meta&quot; services to facilitate other types of electronic commerce.

On the institutional level, big corporations and financial institutions use the internet to exchange financial data to facilitate domestic and international business. Data integrity and security are very hot and pressing issues for electronic commerce.

==Global trends==
Business models across the world also continue to change drastically with the advent of eCommerce and this change is not just restricted to USA. Other countries are also contributing to the growth of eCommerce. For example, the United Kingdom  has the biggest e-commerce market in the world when measured by the amount spent per capita, even higher than the USA. The [[internet economy]] in UK is likely to grow by 10% between 2010 to 2015. This has led to changing dynamics for the advertising industry&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/technology/2010/oct/28/net-worth-100bn-uk/|title=news|publisher=Guardian.co.uk | location=London|first=James|last=Robinson|date=2010-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst emerging economies, China's eCommerce presence continues to expand. With 384 million internet users,China's online shopping sales rose to $36.6 billion in 2009 and one of the reasons behind the huge growth has been the improved trust level for shoppers. The Chinese retailers have been able to help consumers feel more comfortable shopping online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.forbes.com/2010/01/18/china-internet-commerce-markets-equities-alibaba.html/|title= China's migration to eCommerce|newspaper=Forbes.com|date=January 18, 2010|first=Robert|last=Olsen}}&lt;/ref&gt; eCommerce is also expanding across the Middle East. Having recorded the world’s fastest growth in internet usage between 2000 and 2009, the region is now home to more than 60 million internet users. Retail, travel and gaming are the region’s top eCommerce segments, in spite of difficulties such as the lack of region-wide legal frameworks and logistical problems in cross-border transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thomaswhite.com/explore-the-world/postcard/2012/middle-east-online-retail.aspx |title= Now a Digital Mall Boom in the Middle East &amp;#124; Thomas White International |publisher=Thomaswhite.com |date=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; E-Commerce has become an important tool for businesses worldwide not only to sell to customers but also to engage them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eisingerich |first1=Andreas B. |last2=Kretschmer |first2=Tobias |year=2008 |title=In E-Commerce, More is More |journal=Harvard Business Review |volume=86 (March) |pages=20–21 |url=http://hbr.org/2008/03/in-e-commerce-more-is-more/ar/1  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact on markets and retailers==
Economists have theorized that e-commerce ought to lead to intensified price [[competition (economics)|competition]], as it increases consumers' ability to gather information about products and prices. Research by four economists at the University of Chicago has found that the growth of online shopping has also affected industry structure in two areas that have seen significant growth in e-commerce, [[book selling|bookshops]] and [[travel agencies]]. Generally, larger firms have grown at the expense of smaller ones, as they are able to use [[economies of scale]] and offer lower prices. The lone exception to this pattern has been the very smallest category of bookseller, shops with between one and four employees, which appear to have withstood the trend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Economics focus: The click and the dead|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16478931|newspaper=The Economist|date=July 3–9, 2010|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution channels==
E-commerce has grown in importance as companies have adopted Pure-Click and [[Bricks and clicks|Brick and Click]] channel systems. We can distinguish between pure-click and brick and click channel system adopted by companies.

* Pure-Click companies are those that have launched a website without any previous existence as a firm. It is imperative that such companies must set up and operate their e-commerce websites very carefully. Customer service is of paramount importance.
* Brick and Click companies are those existing companies that have added an online site for e-commerce. Initially, Brick and Click companies were skeptical whether or not to add an online e-commerce channel for fear that selling their products might produce channel conflict with their off-line retailers, agents, or their own stores. However, they eventually added internet to their distribution channel portfolio after seeing how much business their online competitors were generating.

This Wikibook will become the product of a research project being run by [http://cslld.edu.au The Centre for School Leadership, Learning and Development] for the [http://www.metalounge.org/ Institute of Metadata Management]. CSLLD has been asked to develop an annotated list of 10 or 15 open data initiatives, explaining how they work and include examples of where their data has been reused. We hope to attract volunteers from Wikipedia and Wikibooks to help develop and maintain this Wikibook, and to participate in the research project ([http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Open_Data see the Wikiversity page]) so that it may continue to grow and develop beyond the life of this project. We also want to model open research and development practices in a project looking at open data.

We are aiming to compete our part in this project by September 2012. Please refer to [http://en.wikiversity.org/wiki/Open_Data the Wikiversity page] for our research progress.

'''SAL''' is a collection of stuff that the author has found useful in his projects.

A large part of SAL provides a coherent set of generic abstract data types, intended to be yet another entry in the &quot;Standard Ada Library&quot; discussion. The goal in this part of SAL was to provide Ada packages that take full advantage of the flexibility and power of Ada generics, while at the same time making things relatively easy for the casual user. This was written well before the Ada 95 and 2005 Containers library, and is mostly superseded by that library.

Another large part of SAL provides math operations for kinematics and dynamics of masses in 3 dimensional space. Cartesian vectors, quaternions, orthonormal rotation matrices, moments of inertia, forces, acceleration, velocity are supported, in 3 and 6 degrees of freedom (translation and rotation). The author has used this library for both robotics and satellite simulation. 

There are also extensions to the AUnit testing framework, a config files package, and other useful things.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I, as an IB student think, that definitions of rivalrous and excludable goods are incorrect. 

According to my notes and other internet sources, 

'''rivalrous''' is something which only some people can afford (hence the ones with lower income are excluded from having the good/service)

good is'''excludable''' when if one person uses it, he decreases the enjoyment of that good of other person.

Please respond if this is correct or not and justify. Thanks, Barbora</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Dear Wikibookians,&lt;br /&gt;

No doubt some of you are familiar with the free college courses available on [http://Saylor.org Saylor.org]. Much like the Wikimedia community, we are committed to providing free and accessible education for everyone with internet access. At Saylor, we combine some of our custom-created educational materials with materials that are already available throughout the internet. However, because we sometimes use links to third party materials, those sections of our courses are not entirely sustainable. The Saylor Wikibooks Project is a way for you to help minimize that threat. We’ve uploaded a number of our course outlines to Wikibooks in the hope that you all will contribute to our effort. Our course outlines have been developed by our consultant professors by studying a collection of syllabi of relevant courses from various traditional brick and mortar institutions. This guarantees that our students will be provided the same learning opportunity as a student enrolled in a traditional institution. We believe that we have created the best structure for our courses, which optimizes the information that students would be expected to know. By creating openly licensed content that fits in with Saylor’s established course outlines, (in the form of Wikibooks’ textbooks), you can add to the ever-expanding body of wiki material, while simultaneously improving the sustainability of our courses.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Thanks for your help, &lt;br /&gt;

The Saylor Team

'''&lt;big&gt;Summary&lt;/big&gt;'''

[[File:Der_Tempel_der_Juno_in_Agrigent_(C_D_Friedrich).jpg|thumb|right]]
We will study the emergence of the major civilizations of the ancient world, beginning with the Paleolithic Era (about 2.5 million years ago) and finishing with the end of the Middle Ages in fifteenth century A.D. We will pay special attention to how societies evolved across this expanse of time—from fragmented and primitive agricultural communities to more advanced and consolidated civilizations. By the end of the text, you will possess a thorough understanding of important overarching social, political, religious, and economic themes in the ancient world, ranging from the emergence of Confucian philosophy in Asia to the fall of imperial Rome. You will also understand how many aspects of these ancient civilizations continue to remain relevant in today’s world.


'''&lt;big&gt;Global Learning Outcomes&lt;/big&gt;'''

Upon successful completion of this text, the student will be able to:

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Using CDISC ODM 1.3 with OpenClinica Extensions to export to SAS ==

SAS can import data in a number of formats.  For OpenClinica version 3.x the obvious choice, due to its portability and SAS's import facilities, is CDISC ODM 1.3 XML.

The CDISC ODM 1.3 XML with OpenClinica extensions format includes two types of data:
# CDISC ODM 1.3 specification data (which SAS's libname knows how to import)
# OpenClinica extensions data (which SAS can be told how to pick up with a mapping file)
Most of the useful data is CDISC ODM 1.3, but some useful data is 'hidden' in OpenClinica extensions sections (e.g. DateOfBirth, Sex and Event Start Dates).

== SAS doesn't import OpenClinica Extensions by default ==

OpenClinica extensions aren't part of the CDISC ODM 1.3 specification, and need to be imported separately.  The code below uses a mapping file (extensions.xml) to import some, but not all, of the extensions.  Other OpenClinica extensions can be picked up from the data file by altering the mapping file appropriately - OpenClinica extensions are tags and attributes in the data file that have the Openclinica prefix, some of which are important.  The only place to obtain the Study Subject ID is by using OpenClinica:StudySubjectId - the SubjectKey refers to the internal OID, which doesn't change even if the Study Subject ID does (the OID remains SS_TEST, even if the Study Subject ID is changed to Test 2).  The CDISC ODM 1.3 schema generated by OpenClinica is also documented at [https://dev.openclinica.com/tools/odm-doc/index_ODM.html#Link248 Openclinica.com/tools/odm-doc].

== How to import CDISC ODM 1.3 XML with OpenClinica extensions into SAS ==

Download the [https://mailman.openclinica.com/pipermail/users/attachments/20120503/ee1a434c/attachment.xml mapping file].

Our init.sas file has pointers to directories containing:
#The data to be imported
#The mapping file to import OpenClinica Extension data
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;sas&quot;&gt;
%let orig=C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\Documents\&lt;study&gt;\Original Data\;
%let maps=C:\Users\&lt;user&gt;\Documents\&lt;study&gt;\Map\;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

We import using the CDISC ODM 1.3 XML using the libname command (proc cdisc is deprecated as of SAS 9.2).  The import.sas file first imports the CDISC ODM file, then imports the OpenClinica Extensions.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;sas&quot;&gt;
* Import Screening XML file;

filename odm0 &quot;&amp;orig.&lt;filename&gt;.xml&quot;;
libname odm0 xml xmltype=CDISCODM FormatActive=YES FormatNoReplace=NO FormatLibrary=&quot;WORK&quot;; 

* Create ODM dataset;

data odm0blood;
	set odm0.Blood;
run;

* Import OpenClinica extensions values from Screening XML file;

filename ex0 &quot;&amp;orig.&lt;filename&gt;.xml&quot;;
filename sx0emap &quot;&amp;maps.extensions.xml&quot;;
libname ex0 xml92 xmlmap=sx0emap access=READONLY;

* Create OpenClinica extensions dataset;

data studyeventdata0;
	length __SUBJECTKEY $100.;
	set ex0.Studyeventdata;
run;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

== Issues with importing CDISC ODM 1.3 ==

=== SAS doesn't like Partial Dates ===

CDISC ODM 1.3 includes a specification for a data type called partial date, which SAS can't import (it throws an error when you try to read the file).  You may choose to not have partial dates in your study and use a text field instead, validated by a regular expression.  Alternatively you can modify the XML export before it is imported to change partial dates to text fields (see below).

=== SAS doesn't import labels ===

SAS will use a shortened version (truncated to 8 chars) of the ITEM_NAME as the field name, e.g. DMHEIGHT (the SASFieldName attribute of the ItemDef tag in the XML).  It will use the full ITEM_NAME itself as the field label (the Name attribute of the ItemDef tag in the XML).  In some cases it would be good to pick up the DESCRIPTION_LABEL as the field label (the Comment attribute of the ItemDef tag in the XML).  The code below includes a section (commentable) that switched the Name and Comment attributes of ItemDef tags around, so that DESCRIPTION_LABELs are imported as the label.

=== Field names too long for SAS ===

SAS doesn't like field names that are longer than 32 characters including the OpenClinica prefix (e.g. I_HTBAS_BLD_1STDOSESTUDYMEDSGIVEN).  You may want to use [[OpenClinica_User_Manual/CRFandOIDissues|shorter names]] (e.g. 8 character long) for new studies, but if you have an old study you may need to replace long field names with shortened versions.

=== OpenClinica (3.0.3 at least) exports badly encoded entities ===

OpenClinica can export entities that aren't defined in the DTD (see [https://issuetracker.openclinica.com/view.php?id=14287 this issuetracker bug] - OpenClinica login needed).  The script correctly escapes the leading ampersand.

== Script to clean up Partial Dates, Labels and Entities ==

The script below modifies the CDISC ODM XML directly.  For CTIMPs (Clinical Trials Involving Medicinal Products) this alters the valuable data you have been collecting, and should be done carefully, with the changes validated (how exactly is up to you).

===Notes===
*The code below is specific to Windows, and has been tested in Windows 7  
*Windows doesn’t run unsigned PowerShell scripts, so until a signed version of the script below can be created, you have to run the commands manually.
*Don't be concerned if you notice the XML files double in size, this is because PowerShell's output files are in Unicode (two bytes for every original character) to cope with international characters.  The original is most likely to have been in single byte encoding (ASCII or similar)
*The regexps could be reimplemented in Perl under Linux

===How to run the code===
#Copy the code below into Notepad (or a similar text editor)
#Alter the $extractdirectory value to point to your data extracts (paths can be obtained from the Explorertoolbar).  This script creates files ending in _new.xml from existing .xml files (and ignores existing files ending in _new.xml).
#Type cmd into the Windows Start Orb search box (which opens a terminal)
#Then copy and paste the code into the terminal (right-clicking on the terminal will open context menu from whence you can paste.)

== Further information ==

This [https://mailman.openclinica.com/pipermail/users/2012-September/007615.html OpenClinica forum thread] further discussed details of how to import data into SAS.

== OpenClinica SPSS to Stata ==
On a similar note, for those interested in Stata, there's a tool that converts SPSS to Stata here:
http://openclinica.mcri.edu.au/DMTools/OpenClinica/SPSStoStata.aspx


== Errors when importing into SPSS ==

When a dataextract is exported in SPSS-format the zip contains 2 files:

* the data, in tab-delimited format, named .dat
* an SPSS-syntax file, which can be run to add vaue and variable labels to the data, named .sps

Most of the time the syntax file must be edited, because it assumes that the dat-file is in the default SPSS directory. If this is not the case,

GET DATA  /TYPE = TXT/FILE = 'SPSS_DAT2013-04-19-200700043.dat'

must be changed into something like:

GET DATA  /TYPE = TXT/FILE = 'c:\temp\SPSS_DAT2013-04-19-200700043.dat'

Also error messages appear referring to dates. The reason why dates are not imported correctly is in the different date
formats in the .dat file and the .sps file:
The .dat file contains dates in searchable format whereas the .sps file
expects American date format. If you change all ADATE to SDATE in the the
spss syntax (search&amp;replace) then it should work.

== SAS, R and CSV xsl Transformations ==
Some excellent xsl transform files were made available by Linas Silva on [https://mailman.openclinica.com/pipermail/developers/2014-January/005544.html this developers list thread] ([https://github.com/lindsay-stevens-kirby/openclinica_scripts/tree/master/OC_XML_to_SAS_R_CSV also available here]). 

These transformations can be run on full ODM 1.3 xml extracts, with the accompanying powershell scripts. The CSV powershell script is probably the most important as it chops up the output csv into into a series of csvs. 

Alternatively, the transforms can be run without powershell, instead using the copy of the saxon library that comes with OpenClinica. Example syntax (all on one line):

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
&quot;path_to_java.exe&quot; -cp &quot;path_to_tomcat\webapps\OpenClinica3141\WEB-INF\lib\saxon-8.7.jar&quot; 
net.sf.saxon.Transform -o &quot;output_file_path.ext&quot; &quot;input_xml_file.xml&quot; &quot;path_to_xsl.xsl&quot;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Each of the xsl files refer to renaming map stylesheet called 'xml_convert_dynamic_lookup' which lists the CRF and Item Group name combinations and what they should be renamed to in the output. If this is not used, the dataset names default to the Item Group OID.


=== applying the script for SAS ===
For SAS transfomations, use the script titled '''powershell_perform_SAS_xsl_transforms.ps1'''. This is a powershell-script, so you should open a command-prompt as administrator. 
Change to the directory where you unzipped the script plus the *.xsl-files and start powershell.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;dos&quot;&gt;
cd Yourdrive:\YourPath\ExportODM
powershell
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Now you have a Powershell-prompt and first you must set the Execution policy:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;powershell&quot;&gt;
Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Running the script is done with one big line, invoking the script with 7 parameters:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;powershell&quot;&gt;
.\powershell_perform_SAS_xsl_transforms.ps1 &quot;RDP001_ODM_20140311.xml&quot; &quot;xml_convert_sas_map.xsl&quot; &quot;sasmap_rdp001_20140310.map&quot; &quot;xml_convert_sas_data.xsl&quot; &quot;data_rdp1_20140311.xml&quot; &quot;xml_convert_sas_format.xsl&quot; &quot;formatout_20140310.sas&quot;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The parameters are:
* &quot;RDP001_ODM_20140311.xml&quot; and this must be the name of your dataextract in ODM1.3-format
* &quot;xml_convert_sas_map.xsl&quot; is one of the *.xsl-files of the zip, so do not change this one
* &quot;sasmap_rdp001_20140310.map&quot; is the mapping-file that is created and you can give this any name you want
* &quot;xml_convert_sas_data.xsl&quot; is one of the *.xsl-files of the zip, so again: do not change this one 
* &quot;data_rdp1_20140311.xml&quot; is the resulting sas-data-file
* &quot;xml_convert_sas_format.xsl&quot; is one of the *.xsl-files of the zip: no changing this one
* &quot;formatout_20140310.sas&quot; is a SAS-file wit info about radio- and singleselect-options

Hi, Stephe. I reviewed your SAL article. Another user removed your email address and the link to the library. The deletion of the email was probably correct but I have restored the homepage. I have also give the article an impersonal style, since in Wikibooks the personal style is deprecated because it does not encourage collaboration and editing of articles. You can review the changes in the history tab of the article. Any doubt you have about Wikibooks or the Ada wikibook, don't hesitate to ask me.

:(a) under subsection 153(1), section 155, 163.1, 170 or 171 or subsection 212(1), (2), (2.1) or (4) with respect to another person who is, or who the accused believes is, under the age of 18 years;
:(b) under section 151 or 152, subsection 160(3) or 173(2) or section 271, 272, 273 or 280 with respect to another person who is, or who the accused believes is, under the age of 16 years; or
:(c) under section 281 with respect to another person who is, or who the accused believes is, under the age of 14 years.
&lt;P&gt;
(2) Every person who commits an offence
under subsection (1)
:(a) is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term of not more than 10 years and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of one year; or
:(b) is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction and is liable to imprisonment for a term of not more than 18 months and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of 90 days.
&lt;P&gt;
(3) Evidence that the person referred to in paragraph (1)(a), (b) or (c) was represented to the accused as being under the age of 18, 16 or 14 years, as the case may be, is, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, proof that the accused believed that the person was under that age.
&lt;P&gt;
(4) It is not a defence to a charge under paragraph (1)(a), (b) or (c) that the accused believed that the person referred to in that paragraph was at least 18, 16 or 14 years of age, as the case may be, unless the accused took reasonable steps to ascertain the age of the person.
&lt;P&gt;
(5) It is not a defence to a charge under paragraph (1)(a), (b) or (c)
:(a) that the person with whom the accused agreed or made an arrangement was a peace officer or a person acting under the direction of a peace officer; or

      <text xml:space="preserve">Dear Wikipedians,&lt;br /&gt;

No doubt some of you are familiar with the free college courses available on [http://Saylor.org Saylor.org]. Much like the Wikimedia community, we are committed to providing free and accessible education for everyone with internet access. At Saylor, we combine some of our custom-created educational materials with materials that are already available throughout the internet. However, because we sometimes use links to third party materials, those sections of our courses are not entirely sustainable. The Saylor Wikibooks Project is a way for you to help minimize that threat. We’ve uploaded a number of our course outlines to Wikibooks in the hope that you all will contribute to our effort. Our course outlines have been developed by our consultant professors by studying a collection of syllabi of relevant courses from various traditional brick and mortar institutions. This guarantees that our students will be provided the same learning opportunity as a student enrolled in a traditional institution. We believe that we have created the best structure for our courses, which optimizes the information that students would be expected to know. By creating openly licensed content that fits in with Saylor’s established course outlines, (in the form of Wikibooks’ textbooks), you can add to the ever-expanding body of wiki material, while simultaneously improving the sustainability of our courses.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Thanks for your help,&lt;br /&gt;

The Saylor Team

'''&lt;big&gt;Summary&lt;/big&gt;'''

[[File:C_plus_plus.svg|thumb|right]]
We will begin with a discussion of the essential elements of C++ programming: variables, loops, expressions, functions, and string class.  Next, we will cover the basics of object-oriented programming: classes, inheritance, templates, exceptions, and file manipulation.  We will then review function and class templates and the classes that perform output and input of characters to/from files.  This text will also cover the topics of namespaces, exception handling, and preprocessor directives.  In the last part of the text, we will learn some slightly more sophisticated programming techniques that deal with data structures such as linked lists and binary trees.

The starting point for this wiki-book is a synopsis of analytical chemiluminescence, &lt;http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/chemiluminescence&gt;. In its fifteen thousand words it does not attempt to summarise all the work done to date. It aims to use mainly well-established literature to give a brief introduction to the achievements of each division of the field. It deals with the research and development that underlies the present state of the art. The chemistry of each reagent that has been used in chemiluminescence is explained and the techniques for increasing the magnitude of the emitted signal are discussed. Further sections describe the different instrumental methods that have been used and examine the sort of work that has been carried out with them. The final sections discuss the applications of chemiluminescence in some of the major areas of analytical chemistry. The aim of the book is to give a comprehensive account of the subject suitable for students, research workers, professional analytical chemists and life scientists.

==Introduction==
Section 29 of the Canada Evidence Act recognizes the high degree of reliability in business documents from financial institutions by permitting &quot;any book or record kept in a financial institution&quot; to be admissible as evidence. 

==Statute==
Section 29 concerns documents of financial institutions:
{{quotation|
'''Copies of entries'''&lt;br&gt;
29. (1) Subject to this section, a copy of any entry in any book or record kept in any financial institution shall in all legal proceedings be admitted in evidence as proof, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, of the entry and of the matters, transactions and accounts therein recorded.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Admission in evidence'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) A copy of an entry in the book or record described in subsection (1) shall not be admitted in evidence under this section unless it is first proved that the book or record was, at the time of the making of the entry, one of the ordinary books or records of the financial institution, that the entry was made in the usual and ordinary course of business, that the book or record is in the custody or control of the financial institution and that the copy is a true copy of it, and such proof may be given by any person employed by the financial institution who has knowledge of the book or record or the manager or accountant of the financial institution, and may be given orally or by affidavit sworn before any commissioner or other person authorized to take affidavits.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Cheques, proof of “no account”'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) Where a cheque has been drawn on any financial institution or branch thereof by any person, an affidavit of the manager or accountant of the financial institution or branch, sworn before any commissioner or other person authorized to take affidavits, setting out that he is the manager or accountant, that he has made a careful examination and search of the books and records for the purpose of ascertaining whether or not that person has an account with the financial institution or branch and that he has been unable to find such an account, shall be admitted in evidence as proof, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, that that person has no account in the financial institution or branch.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Proof of official character'''&lt;BR&gt;
(4) Where evidence is offered by affidavit pursuant to this section, it is not necessary to prove the signature or official character of the person making the affidavit if the official character of that person is set out in the body of the affidavit.
&lt;P&gt;...&lt;P&gt;
R.S., 1985, c. C-5, s. 29; 1994, c. 44, s. 90; 1995, c. 28, s. 47; 1999, c. 28, s. 149.|[http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-5/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-5.html#sec29]}}

==Principles==
For documents to be admissible under s. 29 of the CEA, the party seeking to admit the document must show that:
# the book or record was, at the time of making of the entry, one of the ordinary books or record of the financial institutions;
# that the original book or record is in the custody or control of the financial institution nad 
# the copy is a &quot;true copy&quot;

All these elements can be proven by way of affidavit usually from the manager or accountant of the institution. However, there is no specific requirement as to whom it must be from.

For the purposes of s. 29, &quot;record&quot; can include computer printouts.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v McMullen (1979) 47 CCC (2d) (Ont.C.A.)&lt;br&gt;
R v Bell (1982) 65 CCC (2d) 376 (Ont.C.A.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

A &quot;true copy&quot; is any copy that can be said to be accurate in all essential particulars, so that no one can be misled as to the effect of the record.&lt;ref&gt;R v Morash (1982) 17 MVR 34 (SKQB) citing Commercial Credit Co. of Canada v Fulton Brothers, [1923] AC 798 (PC)&lt;Br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notice==

Any records that are admissible under s. 29 do not need notice to produce.&lt;Ref&gt;1.7 R. v. Best (1978), 43 C.C.C. (2d) 236&lt;/ref&gt;

Ares v. Venner, [1970] SCR 608 [http://canlii.ca/t/1nl92 1970 CanLII 5]&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; 
# it is an original entry;
# it was made at the time of the event;
# it was made in the routine of business;
# it was made by a person who has personal knowledge of the thing recorded;
# who had a duty to make the record; and
# the maker had no motive to misrepresent

The fundamental rationale behind this rule that permits records being tendered into evidence without calling the author is not to avoid the inconvenience of bringing in the witnesses or because of no reasonable alternative. Rather it is premised on the documents having been created &quot;under circumstances which makes them inherently trustworthy.  Where an established system in a business or other organization produces records which are regarded as reliable and customarily accepted by those affected by them, they should be admitted as prima facie evidence.&quot; &lt;reF&gt;
R v Monkhouse, [http://canlii.ca/t/1p6j7 1987 ABCA 227] at p. 350 to 351
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statute==
Section 30 of the CEA allows &quot;business records&quot;--that is records from organizations other than financial institutions--to be tendered as evidence for the truth of their contents without needing the author of the documents to give evidence.

The admission of the record requires an affidavit setting out the requirements that make them business records and that there is timely notice to the defence of the record and affidavit no less than 7 days before their admission. &lt;ref&gt;e.g. R v Meier, [http://canlii.ca/t/fqtt9 2012 SKPC 41] at 62&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of of section 30 is to provide a method of putting business records into evidence beyond what is permitted by the common law and principled hearsay exceptions.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Handous, [http://canlii.ca/t/fqhfq 2012 ABPC 49] at 16&lt;/ref&gt;

If there is failure to provide notice, then the document can still be admissible at common law by having the affiant give ''viva voce'' evidence instead.

'''Business records to be admitted in evidence'''&lt;br&gt;
30. (1) Where oral evidence in respect of a matter would be admissible in a legal proceeding, a record made in the usual and ordinary course of business that contains information in respect of that matter is admissible in evidence under this section in the legal proceeding on production of the record.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Inference where information not in business record'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) Where a record made in the usual and ordinary course of business does not contain information in respect of a matter the occurrence or existence of which might reasonably be expected to be recorded in that record, the court may on production of the record admit the record for the purpose of establishing that fact and may draw the inference that the matter did not occur or exist.

Unlike the common law, there is no requirement that the maker is under a duty to make it.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Wilcox (2001) 152 CCC 3d 157 (NSCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Business Records Defined===
A business record is a form of an unsworn statement.

Under s. 30(12), business records include &quot;the whole or any part  of any book, document, paper, card, tape or other thing on or in which information is written, recorded, stored or reproduced&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Canada Evidence Act s. 30(12) [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-5/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-5.html#sec30]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under s.30(10), business records made &quot;in the course of an investigation or inquiry&quot; are not admissible as business documents.&lt;ref&gt;
See R v  Sunila, (1986) 26 CCC (3d) 331(NSTD)&lt;/ref&gt;

When considering whether a computer stored information is a business record, the court should have regards to several factors:&lt;ref&gt;
Davis, Hutchinson, &quot;Computer Crime in Canada&quot; (Carswell) at p.205 citing K.Chasse &quot;Business Documents: Admissibility of Computer-Produced Records&quot; [1991] Crown's Newsletter 27 at 36
&lt;/ref&gt;
# Sources of Data and Information: there should be an identifiable source of the record and the source should be reliable
# Contemporaneous Recording: the recordings should be made shortly after the events they record
# Routine Business Data: the creation should be part of a routine of recording
# Data Entry: there should be evidence of the process used to input the information
# Industry Standards: where there is a standard, compliance with the standard should be shown
# Business Reliance: there should be some demonstrated reliance on the records
# System Continuity: there should be some evidence from the records keeper or system manager explaining the integrity of the system, including protections against tampering or errors

There is some suggestion that the method of printing out the document should be presented.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Rowbotham (1977) 33 CCC (2d) 411 (Ont.)
&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 30(10) clarifies that certain documents are not to be included as business documents. That includes: 
* records made in the course of an investigation or inquiry,
* a record made in the course of obtaining or giving legal advice or in contemplation of a legal proceeding,
* a record in respect of the production of which any privilege exists and is claimed, or
* a record of or alluding to a statement made by a person who is not, or if he were living and of sound mind would not be, competent and compellable to disclose in the legal proceeding a matter disclosed in the record;
*any record the production of which would be contrary to public policy; or
* any transcript or recording of evidence taken in the course of another legal proceeding.

{{reflist|2}}

====Records Produced during the course of the investigation====
Records produced during the course of the investigation include police notes and reports and any other documents that police create.
As stated in reference to s.30(10), there is an exception to the rule of admissibility of such documents as business records. These types of documents cannot be admissible under s.30. This does not mean that they are not admissible under the common law.&lt;ref&gt;
see  R v Monkhouse [http://canlii.ca/t/1p6j7 1987 ABCA 227], (1987), 83 AR 62 at para 15 per Laycraft CJA regarding summary of payroll records (&quot;In my view the evidence tendered was admissible under the common law rule and it is not necessary to consider whether it also met the tests of Section 30.&quot;)&lt;br&gt; 
R v Bloomfield (1973), 6 NBR (2d) 5 (CA)&lt;br&gt;
c.f. R v Schertzer [http://canlii.ca/t/1vhkh 2008 CanLII 1836] (ON SC), (2008), 232 CCC (3d) 218 (Ont SC) at para 9&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
===Notice===
Notice requirements for business records are addressed under s. 30(7) of the Canada Evidence Act [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-5/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-5.html]:
{{quotation|
s. 30(7)&lt;br&gt;
:'''Notice of intention to produce record or affidavit'''
::(7) Unless the court orders otherwise, no record or affidavit shall be admitted in evidence under this section unless the party producing the record or affidavit has, at least seven days before its production, given notice of his intention to produce it to each other party to the legal proceeding and has, within five days after receiving any notice in that behalf given by any such party, produced it for inspection by that party.
}}

Essentially, notice of intention to admit the documents as well as a copy of the document must be served on the other parties within seven days. 

The purpose of the notice provision is to &quot;alert the accused to the fact that the prosecution intends to produce a copy of the document at trial&quot;&lt;ref&gt; R v Cordes (1978) 40 CCC (2d) 442 (ABCA)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It is intended to &quot;prevent surprise&quot; and &quot;ensure that the accused is able to make full answer and defence&quot;.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Handous, 2012 ABPC 49 at 18&lt;/ref&gt;

Notice can be either formal or informal, even oral notice can be sufficient.&lt;ref&gt; 
R. v. Schiel, [http://canlii.ca/t/1m7s2 2005 BCPC 581] &lt;br&gt;
R v Handous, [http://canlii.ca/t/fqhfq 2012 ABPC 49] at 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The court has discretion to exempt a party from this rule. For example, in R. v. Mahoney [http://canlii.ca/t/2dk1s 1986 ABCA 195], the accused refused to acknowledge his record at the sentencing hearing. A written record was submitted and an officer testified to its reliability. The judge admitted the record but it was overturned on appeal.

Exemption should only be given where it will not prejudice the accused.&lt;Ref&gt; John Sopinka and Sidney N. Lederman, The Law of Evidence in Civil Cases Toronto: Butterworths (1974) at page 92 (the exemption can be given where the &quot;record is simple and not detailed&quot; and where it &quot;feels that the opposite party will not be severely prejudiced as a result of such lack of notice.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;

In R. v. Kennedy, 2008 NSPC 73, the judge refused to allow a printout from a computer screen with only one day notice.

Factors to be considered for exempting the notice provisions include:&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Nguyen et al [http://canlii.ca/t/1hjsb 2001 ABPC 52]&lt;/ref&gt;
#The amount of notice given,
#Amount of time prosecution had access to the notice,
#Volume of evidence,
#Reasonableness of any explanation for the delay,
#Any prejudice created by the lack of notice.

{{reflist|2}}

==Case Digests==
* R. v. C.M., [http://canlii.ca/t/frn13 2012 ABPC 139] - phone bill and text messages admissible for truth on short notice.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Dear Wikipedians,&lt;br /&gt;

No doubt some of you are familiar with the free college courses available on [http://Saylor.org Saylor.org]. Much like the Wikimedia community, we are committed to providing free and accessible education for everyone with internet access. At Saylor, we combine some of our custom-created educational materials with materials that are already available throughout the internet. However, because we sometimes use links to third party materials, those sections of our courses are not entirely sustainable. The Saylor Wikibooks Project is a way for you to help minimize that threat. We’ve uploaded a number of our course outlines to Wikibooks in the hope that you all will contribute to our effort. Our course outlines have been developed by our consultant professors by studying a collection of syllabi of relevant courses from various traditional brick and mortar institutions. This guarantees that our students will be provided the same learning opportunity as a student enrolled in a traditional institution. We believe that we have created the best structure for our courses, which optimizes the information that students would be expected to know. By creating openly licensed content that fits in with Saylor’s established course outlines, (in the form of Wikibooks’ textbooks), you can add to the ever-expanding body of wiki material, while simultaneously improving the sustainability of our courses.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Thanks for your help,  &lt;br /&gt;

'''&lt;big&gt;Summary&lt;/big&gt;'''

[[File:Dáil_Chamber.jpg|thumb|right]]
Like it or not, we can’t escape politics.  Politics, a term best defined as the distribution, exercise, and consequences of power, exists at multiple levels in our society and in our daily lives.  We experience politics in action, for example, in international negotiations, government policy choices, our workplace, and even in our own families.  This course focuses its efforts on exploring the formal, public sphere of politics and power relations through a systematic study and comparison of types of government and political systems.

Comparatists (practitioners of comparative politics) seek to identify and understand the similarities and differences between these systems by taking broad topics—say, for example, “democracy” or “freedom”—and breaking them down into factors that can be found in individual systems.  We call this general approach “the comparative method.”  The goal of the comparative method is to identify the factors and/or categories of analysis to effectively compare and contrast different political phenomena.  Using the comparative method, we can tackle broader, more complicated questions like: Are certain forms of representative democracy more effective than others?  Why are some countries extremely prosperous, while others are extremely poor?  How does the degree of authoritarian control by a government drive economic development?  Does culture impact quality of governance?

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Overview ==

According to Everett M. Rogers, diffusion is “...the process by which an innovation is communicated through certain channels over time among the members of a social system. An Innovation is an idea, practice or object perceived as new by an individual or other unit of adoption. The diffusion of innovations involves both mass media and interpersonal communication channels” &lt;ref&gt;Rogers, E.M. (1995). Diffusion of Innovations (4th ed.). New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In otherwords, diffusion of innovations is the manner in which new practices/objects is communicated by people.  

Innovations typically have an s-shaped rate of adoption.  There are five different types of adopter in the whole diffusion of innovations process which are identified by how early they adopt the innovation.  The five types of adopters, in order from those adopted earliest to latest, are: Innovators, Early Adopters, Early Majority, Late Majority, and Laggards.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, E.M. (1994). A history of communication study: A biographical approach. New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  The rate of adoption between these groups follows a bell shaped standard deviation curve. &lt;ref&gt;http://www2.gsu.edu/~wwwitr/docs/diffusion/&lt;/ref&gt;  

There are five stages with respect to how an individual chooses to adopt an innovation or not. The first stage takes place when the potential adopter becomes aware of the innovation.  The second stage has the potential adopter projecting a positive or negative attitude towards the innovation. The third stage has the entity making a decision to adopt or not.  The fourth has the adopter implementing the the innovation.  The last stage evaluates the innovation. &lt;ref&gt;Rogers, E.M. (1995). Diffusion of Innovations (4th ed.). New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Probability is a concept that is extremely prevalent in the study of Information Markets and Economics in general. It is particularly useful when examining [[Network Externalities|&quot;Network Externalities&quot;]] as well as Economic Prediction Models. The following will provide a brief background on probability and address its specific uses with regard to Information Markets. 

==General==
According to the Business Dictionary, probability is defined as the quantitative measure of the likelihood of something occurring.&lt;ref name=&quot;busdic&quot;&gt;business.yourdictionary.com, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In other words probability is the chance that something happens in a certain way. This chance can be non-influenced or random, which is known as physical probability, or it can be influenced by certain factors which is known as evidential probability. Physical probability is somewhat of the classical idea of probability while evidential is more of a real world application. Physical probability will be given a brief overview in order to understand the general concepts however the large focus of this page will be toward evidential probability as this is the more relevant type of probability to information markets. 

==Mathematical Definition and Basic Laws==
===Main Laws===
The concept or probability has two main laws or axioms that define it. They are:
# The probability of any occurrence is a real number between the value of 0 and 1 inclusive. &lt;ref name=&quot;Strevens&quot;&gt;Strevens, Michael, ''Probability and Chance'', The Encyclopedia of Philosophy, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
# The probability of an occurrence that never happens is 0 and the probability of an occurrence that always happens is 1. &lt;ref name=&quot;Strevens&quot; /&gt;

===Notation===
The probability of an occurrence is written as &lt;big&gt;P(A) = X&lt;/big&gt;. This is read as the the probability of event A occurring is equal to some value X. For example, if we were to measure the chance that the earth is round, we could say that given A=Earth is round,&lt;big&gt;P(A) = 1 &lt;/big&gt;, since it is always true that the Earth is round.
The

===Basic Situations=== 
* Not Event: Since we know that the probability of an event A occurring is written as &lt;big&gt;P(A)&lt;/big&gt;, and that all probabilities must be between 0 and 1 inclusive, then we can say that the probability of even A not occurring is &lt;big&gt;1 - P(A)&lt;/big&gt;. &lt;ref name=&quot;Omega Math&quot;&gt; Omegamath.com 1998 &lt;/ref&gt;

* Multiple Events separate: If two events A and B are completely separate from one another, then the probability of both events occurring is written as &lt;big&gt;P(A and B)/big&gt;. This is equivalent to &lt;big&gt;P(A)P(B)&lt;/big&gt;.  An example of separate multiple events would be if there were two pitchers in two different baseball games, and one wanted to know what the probability be that they both threw fastballs on the first pitch. &lt;ref name=&quot;Omega Math&quot; /&gt;

====Mutually Exclusive====
Mutually exclusive is a concept needed to understand the other basic situations. The term mutually exclusive signifies when two events are a possible result of a single occurrence. For example, in baseball when one is up to bat, the pitcher may throw a curveball or a fastball. The probability of getting a curveball or fastball are two events on the single occurrence of the first pitch at bat. This would be signified by the notation &lt;big&gt;P(A or B) or P(A U B)&lt;/big&gt;. This is equivalent to &lt;big&gt;P(A) + P(B)&lt;/big&gt;. &lt;ref name=&quot;Omega Math&quot; /&gt;

If two events of a single occurrence are not mutually exclusive, that implies that their is some overlap is the possible events. For example, if one was collecting baseball cards he or she wanted to know the probability of getting a rookie card or a pitcher's card. Since there will be cards for rookie pitchers these to events are not mutually exclusive. This situation is denoted by &lt;big&gt;P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)&lt;/big&gt;. Conceptually this expression makes sense as you have to remove the probability of both happening so you don't count it twice.&lt;ref name=&quot;Omega Math&quot; /&gt;


==Physical Probability==
Physical probability, also known as Classical probability is study of physical objects which have which have equally possible events for every occurrence. Examples of this include heads or tails on a coin, number sides on a die, or drawing a certain card in a card deck. It is probability at its basis. The classical theory of probability, written by Laplace is what governs this type of probability. It states that the probability of a favorable event occurring, is equal to the total number of favorable events, divided by the total number of possible events. &lt;ref name=&quot;Classic&quot;&gt; Laplace, ''Classical'', Stats.org/uk , 1999 &lt;/ref&gt;. If one were to examine this using a simple coin toss, then the probability of the coin landing heads would be 1 possible favorable outcome, divided by 2 total possible outcomes (heads and tails). so using probability notation &lt;big&gt;P(H) = 1/2 where H = a coin landing on heads when tossed.&lt;/big&gt;

==Evidential Probability==
Evidential Probability has to do with the study of uncertain situations given certain knowledge or known factors. &lt;ref name=&quot;Roch&quot;&gt; Kyburg H., ''Evidential Probability'', University of Rochester, 1991 &lt;/ref&gt; In other words, given a situation where the result is not known, one is provided with knowledge or evidence of why certain events may be the ending result, and from that evidence the probability of each event occurring is derived. Examples of this are the chances a man on trial will be convicted or acquitted. The probability of each of these outcomes is influenced by the evidence presented on trial and how each juror interprets that evidence. In the study of Information Markets, evidential probability is the type of probability that is most prevalent. 

===Conditional Probability===
To express a probability where one event is dependent on the given evidence of another, the concept of conditional probability is used. If one had two events A and B, a conditional probability would be the chance of event B occurring given that event A has occurred. This is expressed by the notation &lt;big&gt;P(B|A)&lt;/big&gt;, which is equivalent to &lt;big&gt;P(A and B)/P(A)&lt;/big&gt;. &lt;ref name=&quot;Yale&quot;&gt; Easton V. and McColl's J., ''Conditional Probability'', Stat.Yale.edu , 1997 &lt;/ref&gt;    
  
==Common Applications of Probability in Information Markets==
===Information Cascades===
Information cascades are a very common application of probability in information markets. Cascades are centered around evidential probability and more specifically conditional probability. The goal of the cascade is to guess the correct decision based on the evidence of prior events. For a detailed analysis of information cascades, visit the discussion section in [[Strategy for Information Markets/Network Externalities/Two Bandwagons|Network Externalities Two Bandwagons]]

===Prediction Markets===
Prediction Markets are another area of study in Information markets where probability is applied. In prediction markets, prices are determined by the probability of a certain event occurring and the belief by individuals that a certain event will occur. &lt;ref name=&quot;Pred&quot;&gt; Wolfers, J. and Zitzewitz E., ''Prediction Markets'', Journal of Economic Perspectives University of Pensylvania, 2004 &lt;/ref&gt; For more information on Prediction Markets visit [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prediction_market Prediction Markets].

      <comment>Small typo in &quot;introduced.&quot;</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In this section, we will encounter most important application of group theory. This is the notion of an ''action'' on some object. Over-generalizing slightly, we only care about groups ''because'' they act on things.

== Group Actions ==

There are two equivalent ways to define a group action. We will present both, then prove their equivalence.


'''Definition 1a:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group and &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; a set. Then a ''group action'' (or just ''action'') of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a binary operation &lt;math&gt;*\,:\,G\times X\rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; such that for any &lt;math&gt;g,h\in G&lt;/math&gt; and any &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;,

:i) &lt;math&gt;e*x=x&lt;/math&gt;

:ii) &lt;math&gt;g*(h*x)=(gh)*x&lt;/math&gt;


'''Definition 1b:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group and &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; a set. Then a ''group action'' (or just ''action'') of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\sigma\,:\, G\rightarrow S_X&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Theorem 2:''' Definitions 1a and 1b are equivalent.

''Proof'': We must show that for each binary operationas in Definition 1a there is a unique homomorphism as in Definition 1b and vice versa. Given the binary operation, define the permutation &lt;math&gt;\sigma(g)\in S_X&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;\sigma(g)(x)=g*x&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\sigma(g)\circ\sigma(h)(x)=\sigma(g)(\sigma(h)(x))=g*(h*x)=(gh)*x=\sigma(gh)(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g,h\in G&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is a homomorphism &lt;math&gt;G\rightarrow S_X&lt;/math&gt;. Now, given a homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, define a binary operation &lt;math&gt;*\,:\, G\times X\rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;g*x=\sigma(g)(x)&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;e*x=\sigma(e)(x)=\mathrm{id}_X(x)=x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g*(h*x)=\sigma(g)\circ\sigma(h)(x)=\sigma(gh)(x)=(gh)*x&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; is a binary operation satisfying the axioms in Definition 1a, and we are done. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Example 3:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group. Then &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; acts on itself by left multiplication, that is, &lt;math&gt;g*h=gh&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;g,h\in G&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Example 4:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group with &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; a any subgroup. Then &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; acts on the left cosets &lt;math&gt;G/H&lt;/math&gt; by left multiplication, that is, &lt;math&gt;g*(g^\prime H)=(gg^\prime)H&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;g,h\in G&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Definition 5:''' A set which is acted on by a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is called a &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;''-set''.


'''Definition 6:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group acting on a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;. Then the action of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is said to be

:i) ''faithfull'' if &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the only element in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;g*x=x&lt;/math&gt; for ''all'' &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;, and

:ii) ''free'' if &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; is the only element in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;g*x=x&lt;/math&gt; for ''any'' element in &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Remark 7:''' A group acting on itself by left multiplication is a free action. Thus is it also faithfull.


'''Definition 8:''' Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-set. The action is called ''transitive'' if for any &lt;math&gt;x,y\in X&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt; sich that &lt;math&gt;y=g*x&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Remark 9:''' We see that the actions in Example 3 and Example 4 are transitive.


'''Definition 10:''' Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-set and &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;. Define the ''orbit of ''&lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; to be the set &lt;math&gt;G*x=\{g*x\mid g\in G\}&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Definition 11:''' Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-set and &lt;math&gt;x,y\in X&lt;/math&gt;. Define the equivalence relation &lt;math&gt;x\sim y \,\Leftrightarrow\, (\exist g\in G) y=g*x \,\Leftrightarrow\, y\in G*x&lt;/math&gt;. (Check that this ''is'' an equivalence relation!) Then &lt;math&gt;X/\sim&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''orbit space'' of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, and we write &lt;math&gt;X/\sim \equiv X/G&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Remark 12:''' Since the action is obviously transitive on each orbit, to &quot;understand&quot; group actions we only have to understand ''transitive'' actions.


'''Definition 13:''' Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-set. The ''stabilizer'' of &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; is the set &lt;math&gt;G_x=\{g\in G\mid g*x=x\}&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Lemma 14:''' Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-set and let &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;G_x&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Since &lt;math&gt;e*x=x&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;e\in G_x&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;a,b\in G_x&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;(ab)*x=a*(b*x)=a*x=x&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;ab\in G_x&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, &lt;math&gt;x=e*x=(b^{-1}b)*x=b^{-1}*(b*x)=b^{-1}*x&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;b^{-1}\in G_x&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;G_x&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Lemma 15:''' Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-set, &lt;math&gt;a\in X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b=g*a\in X&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;G_b=gG_ag^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;h\in G_a&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;(ghg^{-1})*b=(ghg^{-1}g)*a=(gh)*a=g*(h*a)=g*a=b&lt;/math&gt;, showing &lt;math&gt;gG_ag^{-1}\subseteq G_b&lt;/math&gt;. To show &lt;math&gt;G_b\subseteq gG_ag^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, note that &lt;math&gt;a=g^{-1}*b&lt;/math&gt; and follow the same arugment, obtaining &lt;math&gt;g^{-1}G_bg\subseteq G_a&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


A &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-set is an algebraic structure, and as in any situation where we have several instances of a structure, we cannot resist the temptation to introduce maps between them.


'''Definition 16:''' Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;X^\prime&lt;/math&gt; be &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-sets with binary operations &lt;math&gt;*&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;*^\prime&lt;/math&gt; respectively. Then a function &lt;math&gt;f\,:\, X\rightarrow X^\prime&lt;/math&gt; is called an ''equivariant'' function if &lt;math&gt;f(g*x)=g*^\prime f(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is called an isomorphism if &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is bijective.


'''Lemma 17:''' Compositions of equivariant functions are equivariant.

''Proof'': Trivial. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 18:''' Every transitive action of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; on a set &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is isomorphic to left multiplication on &lt;math&gt;G/H&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;H=G_x&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': By Lemma 15, the stabilizers of any two elements in an orbit are conjugate and so isomorphic. Thus the chosen element ''is'' arbitrary. Let &lt;math&gt;f\,:\, G/H\rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;f(gH)=g*x&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt;. Then if &lt;math&gt;g_1H=g_2H&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;g_1g_2^{-1}\in H&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;(g_1g_2^{-1})*x=x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_1*x=g_2*x&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is well-defined. Now let &lt;math&gt;h\,:\, X\rightarrow G/H&lt;/math&gt; be defined by &lt;math&gt;h(g*x)=gH&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;g_1*x=g_2*x&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;(g_1g_2^{-1})*x=x&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;g_1g_2^{-1}\in H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g_1H=g_2H&lt;/math&gt; showing that &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; is well-defined. Since &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; are obviously inverses of each other, this shows that &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a bijection. To prove equivariance, observe that &lt;math&gt;f(g_1gH)=(g_1g)*x=g_1*(g*x)=g_1*f(gH)&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Corollary 19 (orbit stabilizer theorem):''' Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; be a &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-set and &lt;math&gt;G*x&lt;/math&gt; the orbit of &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;|G*x||G_x|=|G|&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Indeed, from Theorem 18 and Lagrange's theorem we obtain &lt;math&gt;|G*x||G_x|=|G|&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Definition 20:''' The orbit of &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;-set is said to be ''trivial'' if &lt;math&gt;G*x=\{x\}&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; denote the set of elements of &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; whose orbits are trivial. Equivalently, &lt;math&gt;Z=\{x\in X\mid (\forall g\in G) g*x=x\}&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Lemma 21:''' Let &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; be a finite set and &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group acting on &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. Next, let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be a set containing exactly one element from each nontrivial orbit of the action. Then, &lt;math&gt;|S|=|Z|+\sum_{a\in A} |G/G_a|&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Since the orbits partition &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;, the cardinality of &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; is the sum of cardinalities of the orbits. All the trivial orbits are contained in &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;|S|=|Z|+\sum_{a\in A} |G*a|&lt;/math&gt;. By Corollary 19, &lt;math&gt;|G*a|=|G/G_a|&lt;/math&gt;, proving the lemma. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Definition 22:''' A &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;''-group'' is a group whose order is a finite power of a prime integer &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Corollary 23:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-group acting on a set &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;|S|\equiv |Z|\ \mathrm{mod}\ p&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Since &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;-group, &lt;math&gt;|G*a|&lt;/math&gt; divides &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; for each &lt;math&gt;a\in A&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; defined as in Lemma 21. Thus &lt;math&gt;\sum_{a\in A}|G*a|\equiv 0\ \mathrm{mod}\ p&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


== Group Representations ==

Linear group actions on vector spaces are especially interesting. These have a special name and comprise a subfield of group theory on their own, called ''group representation theory''.　We will only touch slightly upon it here.

'''Definition 24:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group and &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; be a vector space over a field &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;. Then a ''representation'' of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a map &lt;math&gt;\Phi\,:\, G\times V\rightarrow V&lt;/math&gt; such that

:i) &lt;math&gt;\Phi(g)\,:\, V\rightarrow V&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;\Psi(g)(v)=\Psi(g,v)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v\in V&lt;/math&gt;, is linear in &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; over &lt;math&gt;F&lt;/math&gt;.

:ii) &lt;math&gt;\Phi(e,v)=v&lt;/math&gt;

:iii) &lt;math&gt;\Phi\left(g_1,\Phi(g_2,v)\right)=\Phi(g_1g_2,v)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;g_1,g_2\in G&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;v\in V&lt;/math&gt;.

V is called the ''representation space'' and the dimension of &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, if it is finite, is called the ''dimension'' or ''degree'' of the representation.


'''Remark 25:''' Equivalently, a representation of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is a homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\phi\,:\, G\rightarrow GL(V,F)&lt;/math&gt;. A representation can be given by listing &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(V,\phi)&lt;/math&gt;.


As a representation is a special kind of group action, all the concepts we have introduced for actions apply for representations.


'''Definition 26:''' A representation of a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; on a vector space &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is called ''faithful'' or ''effective'' if &lt;math&gt;\phi\,:\, G\rightarrow GL(V,F)&lt;/math&gt; is injective.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Conditional Probability ==

If &lt;math&gt; Pr(A|B) = &lt;/math&gt; '''&quot;Probability of A given B&quot;''' or '''&quot;Probability of A conditioned on B&quot;'''

then,

&lt;math&gt; Pr(A|B) = \frac {Pr(A\ AND\ B)}{Pr(B)}&lt;/math&gt;


=== Bayes' Rule ===

&lt;math&gt; Pr(B|A) = \frac { Pr(A|B)Pr(B) } { Pr(A|B)Pr(B)+Pr(A|NotB)Pr(NotB) } &lt;/math&gt;

== Condorcet Jury Theorem ==

=== Binomial Distribution ===
If the probability of one success is &lt;math&gt;\text{ }p&lt;/math&gt;, then

&lt;math&gt;  Pr(k\text{ successes in}\ n\ \text{trials}) = 	\binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{(n-k)} &lt;/math&gt;

while 

*&lt;math&gt; p^k\ &lt;/math&gt; stands for the probability of a particular &lt;math&gt;\text{  }k&lt;/math&gt; trial being a success

*&lt;math&gt;  (1-p)^{(n-k)} &lt;/math&gt; stands for the probability of a particular &lt;math&gt;\text{  }(n-k)&lt;/math&gt; trial being a failure


and in math,

*&lt;math&gt; \binom{n}{k} = \frac {n!}{k!(n-k)!}  &lt;/math&gt;


=== Group Decision/Voting ===
In order to determine if a group decision/voting is correct, the number of successes &lt;math&gt;\text{  }C&lt;/math&gt; needs to be more than half of &lt;math&gt;\text{  }n&lt;/math&gt;. The following formula derived from the Binomial Distribution Function tells the chance of the right group decision.

In the case here, by eliminating the situation that the vote is a tie, let's assume that the number of votes &lt;math&gt;\text{  }n&lt;/math&gt; is odd so that &lt;math&gt;\text{  }C&lt;/math&gt; could be more than half of &lt;math&gt;\text{  }n&lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore,

&lt;math&gt; Pr(C) = \sum_{k=\frac{n+1}{2}}^{n} \binom{n}{k} p^k (1-p)^{(n-k)}  &lt;/math&gt;

=== Influence-Dependent Model of Group Decision/Voting ===

In daily lives, people usually make votes with other influences, instead of absolutely independent decision making. Let's derive another model to determine the probability of correct group decision on other influences.

Let

*&lt;math&gt; p = &lt;/math&gt; the probability of being correct

*&lt;math&gt;  C = &lt;/math&gt; the group makes the correct decision (more than half of the votes are correct)

*&lt;math&gt;  P_I = &lt;/math&gt; the probability of the influence being correct

*&lt;math&gt; \alpha =  &lt;/math&gt; the probability of the voter following the influence to make decision

*&lt;math&gt; Pr(\text{Voter votes correctly}) = (1- \alpha)p + \alpha P_I &lt;/math&gt;

*&lt;math&gt;  P_T = Pr(\text{Voter Correct}|\text{Influence Correct})= (1- \alpha)p + \alpha =&lt;/math&gt; the probability of the voter being correct if the influence is correct

*&lt;math&gt; P_F = Pr(\text{Voter Correct}|\text{Influence Wrong})= (1- \alpha)p =&lt;/math&gt; the probability of the voter being correct if the influence is wrong


Therefore,


&lt;math&gt; Pr(\text{Group Correct}) = Pr(\text{Influence Correct})Pr(\text{Group Correct}|\text{Influence Correct}) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;+ Pr(\text{Influence Wrong})Pr(\text{Group Correct}|\text{Influence Wrong})&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; Pr(C) = P_I\sum_{k=\frac{n+1}{2}}^{n} \binom{n}{k} P_T^k (1-P_T)^{(n-k)}+(1-P_I)\sum_{k=\frac{n+1}{2}}^{n} \binom{n}{k} P_F^k (1-P_F)^{(n-k)} &lt;/math&gt;

== Central Limit Theorem ==

Let &lt;math&gt;x_1,x_2,...,x_n&lt;/math&gt; be a series of independently and identically distributed random variables.
The mean of these variables is &lt;math&gt; \mu_x&lt;/math&gt; and the variance is &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x^2&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;y = \frac {1}{n} (x_1+x_2+...+x_n) &lt;/math&gt;.

When &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; gets larger, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; gets closer to be a random variable that is normally distributed and has mean &lt;math&gt; \mu_y = \mu_x &lt;/math&gt; and variance &lt;math&gt;\sigma_y^2 = \frac{\sigma_x^2}{n}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">OpenClinica can export Discrepancy Notes as a CSV file, however as of version 3.x, the export causes a few problems if opened in Excel.  The problems are caused by double quotes, newlines and carriage returns in the description and detailed notes fields.  Additionally, an extra newline character causes excel to have a blank row every other row.

== Aims ==
To simply transform the content of discrepancy notes csv exports into something usable by Excel.
To do this, newlines and carriage returns in the description and detailed notes fields are removed.  Double quotes are kept, but correctly escaped, and the double newline character at the end of the line is replaced with a single newline character.

== Limitations ==
*The code below is specific to Windows, and has been tested in Windows 7.
*Windows doesn’t run unsigned PowerShell scripts, so until a signed version of the script below can be created, you have to run the commands manually. 
*Run this on the unaltered csv file downloaded from OpenClinica - don't alter or open and save the file in Excel
*Neither the output nor the input files can be open when the script is started.
*The regexps could be reimplemented in Perl under Linux.

== Instructions ==
#Alter the input and output values below to point to your desired inputfile and outputfile names (paths can be obtained from Explorer's 'location box')
#Type cmd into the Windows Start Orb search box (which opens a terminal)
#Then copy and paste the following section into the terminal (right-clicking on the terminal will open context menu from whence you can paste)
#Below the script are instructions on how to open the updated file and save it in Excel format

      <text xml:space="preserve">Dear Wikipedians,&lt;br /&gt;

No doubt some of you are familiar with the free college courses available on [http://Saylor.org Saylor.org]. Much like the Wikimedia community, we are committed to providing free and accessible education for everyone with internet access. At Saylor, we combine some of our custom-created educational materials with materials that are already available throughout the internet. However, because we sometimes use links to third party materials, those sections of our courses are not entirely sustainable. The Saylor Wikibooks Project is a way for you to help minimize that threat. We’ve uploaded a number of our course outlines to Wikibooks in the hope that you all will contribute to our effort. Our course outlines have been developed by our consultant professors by studying a collection of syllabi of relevant courses from various traditional brick and mortar institutions. This guarantees that our students will be provided the same learning opportunity as a student enrolled in a traditional institution. We believe that we have created the best structure for our courses, which optimizes the information that students would be expected to know. By creating openly licensed content that fits in with Saylor’s established course outlines, (in the form of Wikibooks’ textbooks), you can add to the ever-expanding body of wiki material, while simultaneously improving the sustainability of our courses.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

Thanks for your help,&lt;br /&gt;

The Saylor Team

'''&lt;big&gt;Summary&lt;/big&gt;'''
[[File:Ringbound notebook.jpg|thumb]]
No matter what career you pursue, you must be able to communicate effectively and clearly if you plan on a successful future.  This course will enhance your ability to do so by sharpening your critical thinking and writing skills.  We will begin with a unit designed to change the way in which you think about writing.  First, you will learn to think of writing not as a solitary act but as a conversation between yourself and an audience.  In this light, writing becomes a dynamic, interactive site of creativity rather than a rote practice.  You will also begin to value writing as a process—and an admittedly difficult one—rather than a product.  You will come to see that writing is an act of discovery rather than a recitation of prefabricated ideas.

'''&lt;big&gt;Global Learning Outcomes&lt;/big&gt;'''

Upon successful completion of this course, the student will be able to:
* Demonstrate mastery of principles of grammar, usage, mechanics, and sentence structure.

* Organize ideas logically within an essay, deploying adequate transitional devices to ensure coherence, flow, and focus.

==Production at Common Law / O'Connor Application==
A party may apply for an order requiring a third party, that is, a party other than the crown or its agents, to produce relevant documents for the purpose of using them in court.

The application, often referred to an as &quot;O'Connor Application&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R. v. O’Connor, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411&lt;/ref&gt;, is a two-stage process. First the applicant must satisfy the judge that the record is likely relevant to the proceedings against the accused. If so, the judge may order the production solely for the court's inspection. Second, the judge must then determine, after inspection, what portions of the documents are to be produced for the defence.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. O’Connor, [http://canlii.ca/t/1frdh 1995 CanLII 51] (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. McNeil, 2009 SCC 3, [2009] 1 S.C.R. 66 at para. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

An O'Connor application consists of a service of a subpoena and notice to the relevant parties.

{{Reflist|2}}
===Third Party Records vs Disclosure===
:''See also [[Canadian Criminal Procedure and Practice/Disclosure#Control]]''

A third party includes Crown entities other than the prosecuting authority and so would be subject to an O'Connor application.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. McNeil, 2009 SCC 3 [2009] 1 S.C.R. 66 at 13&lt;/ref&gt; This does not apply to materials that the police are under a duty to disclose to the crown as the &quot;fruits of the investigation&quot;, in which case it would constitute a first party record.&lt;ref&gt;R v McNeil&lt;/ref&gt;

Records of police investigations of third parties and police disciplinary records, usually constitutes third-party records.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. McNeil,  at 25&lt;/ref&gt; Unless the the misconduct relates to the investigation or could reasonably impact on the case against the accused.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. McNeil,&lt;/ref&gt;

Records will be either in possession the Crown or a third party depending on several factors:&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Coopsammy, 2008 ABQB 266&lt;/ref&gt;
# whether the information is the &quot;fruits of the investigation&quot;;
# what the purpose the information was created for;
# whether the information was created or obtained as a result of, or in connection to, the specific investigation or prosecution of the accused;
# whether the information is sufficiently related to the specific investigation or prosecution
# whether there is an intrinsic link, i.e. by a factual and evidential link, to the investigation
# the nature and content of the information
# whether any third parties have a privacy interest in the information

{{Reflist|2}}

==Production in Statute==
===Protected Personal Information for Sexual Offences===
Records that contain certain personal information are non-disclosable where it relates to a sex related offence. In order to allow any of these records to be disclosed it must be ordered by a judge under s.278.3 where the grounds permit.

{{quotation|
'''Definition of “record”'''&lt;br&gt;

&lt;P&gt;
1997, c. 30, s. 1.

&lt;P&gt;
'''Production of record to accused'''&lt;br&gt;
278.2 (1) No record relating to a complainant or a witness shall be produced to an accused in any proceedings in respect of
:(a) an offence under section 151, 152, 153, 153.1, 155, 159, 160, 170, 171, 172, 173, 210, 211, 212, 213, 271, 272 or 273,

:(c) an offence under section 146, 151, 153, 155, 157, 166 or 167 of the Criminal Code, chapter C-34 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1970, as it read immediately before January 1, 1988,
&lt;P&gt;
or in any proceedings in respect of two or more offences that include an offence referred to in any of paragraphs (a) to (c), except in accordance with sections 278.3 to 278.91.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Application of provisions'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) Section 278.1, this section and sections 278.3 to 278.91 apply where a record is in the possession or control of any person, including the prosecutor in the proceedings, unless, in the case of a record in the possession or control of the prosecutor, the complainant or witness to whom the record relates has expressly waived the application of those sections.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Duty of prosecutor to give notice'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) In the case of a record in respect of which this section applies that is in the possession or control of the prosecutor, the prosecutor shall notify the accused that the record is in the prosecutor’s possession but, in doing so, the prosecutor shall not disclose the record’s contents.
&lt;P&gt;
1997, c. 30, s. 1; 1998, c. 9, s. 3.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Application for production'''&lt;br&gt;
278.3 (1) An accused who seeks production of a record referred to in subsection 278.2(1) must make an application to the judge before whom the accused is to be, or is being, tried.
&lt;p&gt;
...
&lt;p&gt;
'''Insufficient grounds'''&lt;br&gt;
(4) Any one or more of the following assertions by the accused are not sufficient on their own to establish that the record is likely relevant to an issue at trial or to the competence of a witness to testify:
:(a) that the record exists;
:(b) that the record relates to medical or psychiatric treatment, therapy or counselling that the complainant or witness has received or is receiving;
:(c) that the record relates to the incident that is the subject-matter of the proceedings;
:(d) that the record may disclose a prior inconsistent statement of the complainant or witness;
:(e) that the record may relate to the credibility of the complainant or witness;
:(f) that the record may relate to the reliability of the testimony of the complainant or witness merely because the complainant or witness has received or is receiving psychiatric treatment, therapy or counselling;
:(g) that the record may reveal allegations of sexual abuse of the complainant by a person other than the accused;
:(h) that the record relates to the sexual activity of the complainant with any person, including the accused;
:(i) that the record relates to the presence or absence of a recent complaint;
:(j) that the record relates to the complainant’s sexual reputation; or
:(k) that the record was made close in time to a complaint or to the activity that forms the subject-matter of the charge against the accused.
&lt;p&gt;
'''Service of application and subpoena'''&lt;br&gt;
(5) The accused shall serve the application on the prosecutor, on the person who has possession or control of the record, on the complainant or witness, as the case may be, and on any other person to whom, to the knowledge of the accused, the record relates, at least seven days before the hearing referred to in subsection 278.4(1) or any shorter interval that the judge may allow in the interests of justice. The accused shall also serve a subpoena issued under Part XXII in Form 16.1 on the person who has possession or control of the record at the same time as the application is served.

==Disclosing Specific Materials==

===Training Materials===

In advancing a violation of rights by peace officers, the training manuals applicable to the investigation are of limited relevance since they are not indicative of violations.&lt;reF&gt;R. v. Ferrari, [http://canlii.ca/t/5h4p 2001 SKQB 340] at 7;  R. v. Akinchets, [http://canlii.ca/t/fm27r 2011 SKPC 88] - considered training materials on sobriety testing&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

===Peace Officer Misconduct (&quot;McNeil Disclosure&quot;)===

Certain types of police misconduct records have been recommended as being treated as primary disclosure, including:&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. McNeil, [http://canlii.ca/t/2254d 2009 SCC 3] (CanLII), [2009] 1 SCR 66 at para. 57 - known as the &quot;Ferguson Five&quot; categories
&lt;/ref&gt;
# Any conviction or finding of guil[t] under the Canadian Criminal Code or under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act [for which a pardon has not been granted].
# Any outstanding charges under the Canadian Criminal Code or the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.
# Any conviction or finding of guilt under any other federal or provincial statute.
# Any finding of guilt for misconduct after a hearing under the Police Services Act or its predecessor Act.
# Any current charge of misconduct under the Police Services Act for which a Notice of Hearing has been issued.

The police have an obligation to notify the Crown of any relevant misconduct, as well as seek advice from the Crown on whether the misconduct record is relevant.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Boyne, [http://canlii.ca/t/fvgx3 2012 SKCA 124] (CanLII) at para. 34, 35
&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crown are to exercise a gate-keeper function with respect to the disclosure of these materials to the defence.&lt;ref&gt;
Boyne at para. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

A complex number is something that has both real and imaginary parts. So what is an imaginary number? an imaginary number is represented as j. j&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = -1 so -1&lt;sup&gt;0.5&lt;/sup&gt; = j. Using j all quadratics can be solved. this makes j a very powerful and usable idea. j is not a prime.

We often give complex numbers in Cartesian form &lt;math&gt; z = a + bj &lt;/math&gt;

Note: The letter j is generally used by engineers and i by mathematicians. j is used throughout this course.
==Proof==
how do you solve this: &lt;math&gt; x^2 + 1 = 0 &lt;/math&gt; ?

You can rearrange into:
# &lt;math&gt; x^2 = -1 &lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt; x = \sqrt{-1} &lt;/math&gt;

However how do we then deal with the &lt;math&gt; \sqrt{-1} &lt;/math&gt;? We do it by substituting it for a letter, j.
This works because: &lt;math&gt; (\sqrt{-1})^2 + 1 = 0 &lt;/math&gt; is true which was our original equation. Therefore j is a root of this equation.

==Operations==
===Powers of j===
powers of j are very interesting and show a looping pattern.

&lt;math&gt; j^2 = -1 &lt;/math&gt;, 

&lt;math&gt; j^3 = -j &lt;/math&gt;, 

&lt;math&gt; j^4 = 1 &lt;/math&gt;, 

&lt;math&gt; j^5 = j &lt;/math&gt;, 

This fact can be used to simplify complex numbers.

====Questions====
Simplify
:# &lt;math&gt; j^9 &lt;/math&gt;
:# &lt;math&gt; j^{22} &lt;/math&gt;

[[/solutions to powers of j questions|worked solutions]]

===Basic Operations===
These can all be easily calculated by yourself, I've just included them to show that j follows all of the rules of algebra.

Addition: &lt;math&gt; (a+bj) + (c+dj) = (a+c) + (b+d)j &lt;/math&gt; 

subtraction: &lt;math&gt; (a+bj) - (c+dj) = (a-c) + (b-d)j &lt;/math&gt;

Multiplication: &lt;math&gt; (a+bj)(c+dj) = ac + adj + bcj + bdj^2 = ac - bd + (ad + bc)j &lt;/math&gt;

Division: &lt;math&gt; (a+bj)\div(c+dj) = a\div(c+dj) + bj\div(c+dj) &lt;/math&gt;. Essentially the same but there is no real simplification.

====Question====
Evaluate
# &lt;math&gt;5j + 3j&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;7(3j)&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;(9+2j)(1-j) + 3 -2j&lt;/math&gt;
# &lt;math&gt;(21 + 7j) \div 7&lt;/math&gt;

==Argand diagrams==
[[File:Argand2.png|thumb|an Argand diagram]]
Complex numbers can be plotted on an Argand diagram, with the x axis being used to represent real numbers and the y axis being used to represent the imaginary part of an equation. 

Knowledge of [[A-level Mathematics/MEI/C2/Radians|Radians]] is recommended for the next section. 

We can therefore give complex numbers in a different form, using their modulus (distance from origin) and angle (in radians). This is called polar form. &lt;math&gt; z = r(cos \theta + j sin \theta) &lt;/math&gt;.

These equations can be calculated using simple trigonometry and Pythagoras.

&lt;math&gt; r = |\sqrt{a^2+b^2}| &lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; \theta = tan ^{ - 1}( {b \over a} ) &lt;/math&gt;

With θ in radians and  -π &lt; θ ≤ π

You may wonder what the value of polar form is, and that's fine as it is not readily apparent. When the solutions of an equation are plotted on an Argand diagram they form a circle (and finding the equation of the circle is a common question)
The equation of a circle in this form is: &lt;math&gt; z = |r(a,b)j| &lt;/math&gt;

====Questions====
Find the polar form
:#&lt;math&gt; 20 &lt;/math&gt;
:# &lt;math&gt; 12j &lt;/math&gt;
:# &lt;math&gt; 4 + 3j &lt;/math&gt;
:# &lt;math&gt; 12+5j &lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to create a Microsoft Word document from a DocBook file.

== Method ==
There are two steps to building a high quality DocBook to MS-Word .docx transform.
# Create a docx generator that assembles a zip file with all the correct components
# Create a typeswitch transform that converts each DocBook element into the appropriate Open Office XML format
In this article we will create a zip file using the Microsoft [[w:Open_Packaging_Conventions|Open_Packaging_Conventions]] (OPC) format.  OPC files
can be opened with any desktop unzip program but must be created problematically to ensure that specific files are places in the correct order.  We will create several small XQuery functions that will extract key elements from the input DocBook 5 file and generate the XML files used in the Open Office XML specifications.  Then we will assemble all the components into a zip file using a single generate-docx() function.



The other transformation will follow a very similar pattern.

== Zip File Generation ==
This section shows you the process of generating a zip file using XQuery.  This depends on having a zip function that allows you to specify each of the components of the output file and specifically requires the output to be in document-order.

== The Output File Configuration ==

The output is a zip file with the following contents:
* '''[Content_Types].xml''' - a single XML file in the root directory.  This file '''MUST''' be placed first in the zip file collection.
* '''_rels''' - a folder that has a single '''.rels''' file that is an XML file with releationships between files
* '''docProps''' - a folder that has the document properies files in it.  These are usually the app.xml and core.xml files
* '''word''' - a folder with all the word content and two subfolders.  Typical content includes:
** _rels folder with a single file such as document.xml.rels in it
** theme folder with a single file such as theme1.xml in it
** document.xml
** fontTable.xml
** settings.xml
** styles.xml
** webSettings.xml

== Sample Use of Zip Function ==
The compression:zip( $entries, true() ) function takes two parameters.  The first is a series of &lt;entries&gt; elements, one for each
file or collection we are going to create.

Here is the entry for building the main '''[Content_Types].xml''' file.
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entry name=&quot;[Content_Types].xml&quot; type=&quot;xml&quot; method=&quot;store&quot;&gt;{doc(concat($db2docx:template-collection, '/content-types-template.xml'))}&lt;/entry&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The following is an example of how we put a file in the _rels folder with the .rels file name:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;entry name=&quot;_rels/.rels&quot; type=&quot;xml&quot; method=&quot;store&quot;&gt;{doc(concat($db2docx:template-collection, '/dot-rels.xml'))}&lt;/entry&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

So to build a docx file we &quot;assemble&quot; each of the &lt;entry&gt; elements using the compression:zip() function and then return the binary stream to the web browser with the correct mime type and file name.  This file is downloaded and you can then open it with MS word.
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function db2docx:generate-docx($docbook-input-document as node(), $filename as xs:string) {

(: this has a sequence of &lt;entry&gt; elements that is used by the zip function :)
    let $entries :=
        (
        db2docx:content-type-entry(),
        ...
        db2docx:root-rels())
    return
        (
        response:set-header(&quot;Content-Disposition&quot;, concat(&quot;attachment; filename=&quot;, concat($filename, '.docx')))
        ,
        response:stream-binary(
            compression:zip( $entries, true() ),
            'application/zip',
            concat($filename, '.docx')
            )
        )
};
&lt;/source&gt;

== Mapping DocBook 5 Elements to Open Office XML ==

DocBook files are very easy to work with since the entire document can be stored in a single file.  DocX has many small files
and these files are stored in many different locations in the zip archive.

Here are some examples:

=== Core Properties ===
The Core Properties element are the standard [[w:Dublin Core|Dublin Core]] metadata elements that you might see in a bibliographic entry for a book or article.

=== Application Properties ===
Here is an example of an XQuery function that will fill in the number of sections in the application properties XML file.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function db2docx:app-properties($docbook-input-document as node()) {
&lt;Properties xmlns=&quot;http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/extended-properties&quot; 
   xmlns:vt=&quot;http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/docPropsVTypes&quot;&gt;
    &lt;SectionCount&gt;{count($docbook-input-document//sect1)}&lt;/SectionCount&gt;
    &lt;Application&gt;DocBook 5 to Microsoft Open Office XML (DocX) Converter by Dan McCreary of Kelly-McCreary &amp;amp; Associates&lt;/Application&gt;
    &lt;DocSecurity&gt;0&lt;/DocSecurity&gt;
    &lt;Lines&gt;1&lt;/Lines&gt;
    &lt;Paragraphs&gt;1&lt;/Paragraphs&gt;
    &lt;ScaleCrop&gt;false&lt;/ScaleCrop&gt;
    &lt;Company&gt;Kelly-McCreary &amp;amp; Associates&lt;/Company&gt;
    &lt;LinksUpToDate&gt;false&lt;/LinksUpToDate&gt;
    &lt;CharactersWithSpaces&gt;12&lt;/CharactersWithSpaces&gt;
    &lt;SharedDoc&gt;false&lt;/SharedDoc&gt;
    &lt;HyperlinksChanged&gt;false&lt;/HyperlinksChanged&gt;
    &lt;AppVersion&gt;0.1&lt;/AppVersion&gt;
&lt;/Properties&gt;
};
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Document Body Element Transforms ===

Mapping your DocBook elements into Open Office XML format will vary depending on what DocBook elements you use and what your Word template structure is.  This tutorial example will demonstrate mapping for the following elements:
# article
# article title
# sect1
# sect 1 title
# para
# figure

=== Sample DocBook 5 Input File ===
We will begin with a DocBook 5 chatper with a two level 1 sections that each have two level two subsections each with two paragraphs each.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;chapter xmlns=&quot;http://docbook.org/ns/docbook&quot; xmlns:xlink=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink&quot; version=&quot;5.0&quot;&gt;
    &lt;title&gt;Chapter Title&lt;/title&gt;
    &lt;subtitle&gt;Chapter Subtitle&lt;/subtitle&gt;
    &lt;para&gt;This is the body introductory text of the chapter&lt;/para&gt;
    &lt;sect1&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Level 1 Title 1&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;subtitle&gt;Section 1 Subtitle&lt;/subtitle&gt;
        &lt;para&gt;This is the text of the first paragraph of the first level 1 article section.&lt;/para&gt;
        &lt;para&gt;This is the text of the second paragraph of the first level 1 article section.&lt;/para&gt;
        &lt;sect2&gt;
            &lt;title&gt;Level 2 Title 1.1&lt;/title&gt;
            &lt;para&gt;This is the text of the first paragraph of the first level 2 article sub-section.&lt;/para&gt;
            &lt;para&gt;This is the text of the second paragraph of the first level 2 article sub-section.&lt;/para&gt;
        &lt;/sect2&gt;
        &lt;sect2&gt;
            &lt;title&gt;Level 2 Title 1.2&lt;/title&gt;
            &lt;para&gt;This is the text of the first paragraph of the second level 2 article sub-section.&lt;/para&gt;
            &lt;para&gt;This is the text of the second paragraph of the second level 2 article sub-section.&lt;/para&gt;
        &lt;/sect2&gt;        
    &lt;/sect1&gt;
    &lt;sect1&gt;
        &lt;title&gt;Level 1 Title 2&lt;/title&gt;
        &lt;subtitle&gt;Section 1 Subtitle&lt;/subtitle&gt;
        &lt;para&gt;This is the text of the first paragraph of the first level 1 article section.&lt;/para&gt;
        &lt;para&gt;This is the text of the second paragraph of the first level 1 article section.&lt;/para&gt;
        &lt;sect2&gt;
            &lt;title&gt;Section 2 Title 2.1&lt;/title&gt;
            &lt;para&gt;This is the text of the first paragraph of the first level 2 article sub-section.&lt;/para&gt;
            &lt;para&gt;This is the text of the second paragraph of the first level 2 article sub-section.&lt;/para&gt;
        &lt;/sect2&gt;
        &lt;sect2&gt;
            &lt;title&gt;Section 2 Title 2.2&lt;/title&gt;
            &lt;para&gt;This is the text of the first paragraph of the second level 2 article sub-section.&lt;/para&gt;
            &lt;para&gt;This is the text of the second paragraph of the second level 2 article sub-section.&lt;/para&gt;
        &lt;/sect2&gt;
        
    &lt;/sect1&gt;
&lt;/chapter&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Document Body ===
Open Office XML uses a complex XML structure for storing the body of text.  Paragraphs are broken up into &quot;runs&quot; and then have text within those run elements.  The following structure is an example of this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;w:document xmlns:wp=&quot;http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/drawingml/2006/wordprocessingDrawing&quot; 
    xmlns:o=&quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot; 
    xmlns:m=&quot;http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/math&quot; 
    xmlns:wne=&quot;http://schemas.microsoft.com/office/word/2006/wordml&quot; 
    xmlns:w10=&quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:word&quot; 
    xmlns:w=&quot;http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/wordprocessingml/2006/main&quot; 
    xmlns:v=&quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:vml&quot; 
    xmlns:r=&quot;http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/officeDocument/2006/relationships&quot; 
    xmlns:ve=&quot;http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/markup-compatibility/2006&quot;&gt;
    &lt;w:body&gt;
        &lt;w:p&gt;
            &lt;w:r&gt;
                &lt;w:t&gt;Hello World!&lt;/w:t&gt;
            &lt;/w:r&gt;
        &lt;/w:p&gt;
    &lt;/w:body&gt;
&lt;/w:document&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Creating Your Typeswitch Transform ===

We are now ready to dive into the element by element transform.

The structure looks like this:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function db2docx:main($content as node()*) as item()* {
    for $node in $content
    (: let $log := util:log-system-out(concat('In main with ', count($node//node()), ' elements')) :)
    return 
        typeswitch($node)
            case text() return $node
            
            (:
            case element(article) return db2h:article($node)
            case element(book) return db2h:book($node) :)

            (: each of these is responsible for handling its own title, paragraphs and subsections :)
            case element(db:chapter) return db2docx:chapter($node)
            case element(db:sect1) return db2docx:sect1($node)
            case element(db:sect2) return db2docx:sect2($node)
....
           default return db2docx:null()
}; 
&lt;/source&gt;

Mapping your DocBook elements into Open Office XML format will vary depending on what DocBook elements you use and what your Word template structure is.  This tutorial example will demonstrate mapping for the following elements:
# article
# article title
# sect1
# sect 1 title
# para
# figure
# etc

=== Sample Recursive Function ===
The main &quot;dispatch&quot; function will arrive at the node of every high-level element.  It will then just to the function specifically associated with that element.  Usually the function has the same name as the element.

At each level of the transform you put in the data elements you need and then call the main function for each sub-element.  This allows you to specifically put in structure that you know exists and avoids having to look up the context of an element depending on where you are in the tree.  For example the title element is used consistently in the chapter, sect1 and sect2 sections.  You can lookup the parent element name when you get to the title element but it is often easier just to put in the elements within the section you have just arrived at.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function db2docx:sect1($sect1 as node()) as node()* {
(
    &lt;!-- sect1 --&gt;,
    &lt;w:p&gt;
        &lt;w:pPr&gt;
            &lt;w:pStyle w:val=&quot;Heading1&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/w:pPr&gt;
        &lt;w:r&gt;
            &lt;w:t&gt;{$sect1/db:title/text()}&lt;/w:t&gt;
        &lt;/w:r&gt;
    &lt;/w:p&gt;,
    db2docx:main($sect1/db:para),
    db2docx:main($sect1/db:sect2)
)
};
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Sample Output ===

[[File:Screen-image-of-docbook-to-docx.png|center|Screen Image]]

=== Adding Images ===
==== DocBook Figures ====
DocBook figures have the following sample structure:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
   &lt;title&gt;Figure Caption&lt;/title&gt;
   &lt;mediaobject&gt;
      &lt;imageobject&gt;
           &lt;imagedata fileref=&quot;images/my-image.png&quot; scale=&quot;50&quot; contentwidth=&quot;500&quot;/&gt;
      &lt;/imageobject&gt;
   &lt;/mediaobject&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;
In the sample above we store all images for an article in an images collection directly in the collection that stores the main article XML file.  We also scale the image
to 50% of its original size or set the content width to be a fixed number of pixels.

==== Sample Open Office Image ====
Below is the equivalant structure of an image in docx format:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;w:drawing&gt;
    &lt;wp:inline distT=&quot;0&quot; distB=&quot;0&quot; distL=&quot;0&quot; distR=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
        &lt;wp:extent cx=&quot;1714286&quot; cy=&quot;514286&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;wp:effectExtent l=&quot;19050&quot; t=&quot;0&quot; r=&quot;214&quot; b=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;wp:docPr id=&quot;1&quot; name=&quot;Picture 0&quot; descr=&quot;nosql-logo.png&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;wp:cNvGraphicFramePr&gt;
            &lt;a:graphicFrameLocks xmlns:a=&quot;http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/drawingml/2006/main&quot;
               noChangeAspect=&quot;1&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/wp:cNvGraphicFramePr&gt;
        &lt;a:graphic xmlns:a=&quot;http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/drawingml/2006/main&quot;&gt;
            &lt;a:graphicData
                uri=&quot;http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/drawingml/2006/picture&quot;&gt;
                &lt;pic:pic
                    xmlns:pic=&quot;http://schemas.openxmlformats.org/drawingml/2006/picture&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;pic:nvPicPr&gt;
                        &lt;pic:cNvPr id=&quot;0&quot; name=&quot;my-image-file.png&quot;/&gt;
                        &lt;pic:cNvPicPr/&gt;
                    &lt;/pic:nvPicPr&gt;
                    &lt;pic:blipFill&gt;
                        &lt;a:blip r:embed=&quot;rId4&quot; cstate=&quot;print&quot;/&gt;
                        &lt;a:stretch&gt;
                            &lt;a:fillRect/&gt;
                        &lt;/a:stretch&gt;
                    &lt;/pic:blipFill&gt;
                    &lt;pic:spPr&gt;
                        &lt;a:xfrm&gt;
                            &lt;a:off x=&quot;0&quot; y=&quot;0&quot;/&gt;
                            &lt;a:ext cx=&quot;1714286&quot; cy=&quot;514286&quot;/&gt;
                        &lt;/a:xfrm&gt;
                        &lt;a:prstGeom prst=&quot;rect&quot;&gt;
                            &lt;a:avLst/&gt;
                        &lt;/a:prstGeom&gt;
                    &lt;/pic:spPr&gt;
                &lt;/pic:pic&gt;
            &lt;/a:graphicData&gt;
        &lt;/a:graphic&gt;
    &lt;/wp:inline&gt;
&lt;/w:drawing&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The binary images must be placed in the word/media collection.

=== Revision Identifiers (RSIDS) ===
Microsoft documents also have a large number of revision attributes or &quot;RSIDS&quot; for each paragraph, run and text.  These are used when there are multiple authors making changes and the changes must be tracked using a revision reviewing system.  Buy assigning random ID numbers to each component of text it is easier for a person to view the tracked changes.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;w:p w:rsidR=&quot;00D910F7&quot; w:rsidRDefault=&quot;00CB02EF&quot; w:rsidP=&quot;00CB02EF&quot;&gt;
   &lt;w:pPr&gt;
      &lt;w:pStyle w:val=&quot;Title&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/w:pPr&gt;
      &lt;w:r&gt;
         &lt;w:t&gt;Document Title&lt;/w:t&gt;
      &lt;/w:r&gt;
&lt;/w:p&gt;
&lt;w:p w:rsidR=&quot;00CB02EF&quot; w:rsidRDefault=&quot;00CB02EF&quot; w:rsidP=&quot;00CB02EF&quot;&gt;
   &lt;w:pPr&gt;
      &lt;w:pStyle w:val=&quot;Heading1&quot;/&gt;
         &lt;/w:pPr&gt;
      &lt;w:r&gt;
         &lt;w:t&gt;I am heading&lt;/w:t&gt;
      &lt;/w:r&gt;
&lt;/w:p&gt;
&lt;w:p w:rsidR=&quot;00CB02EF&quot; w:rsidRDefault=&quot;00CB02EF&quot;&gt;
   &lt;w:r&gt;
      &lt;w:t&gt;This is the body text for a paragraph.&lt;/w:t&gt;
   &lt;/w:r&gt;
&lt;/w:p&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

You can disable the generation of the RSIDs by going to the Microsoft Word Options and then to the Trust Center and then Select &quot;Privacy Settings&quot; (although this has nothing to do with privacy) and the UNcheck the &quot;Store random number to improve Combine accuracy&quot;

== '''A. Introduction ==
== A1.	Electronic transitions and luminescence''' ==
Luminescence is the emission of light due to transitions of electrons from molecular orbitals of higher energy to those of lower energy, usually the ground state or the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals. Such transitions are referred to as relaxations. Figure A1.1 shows four electronic energy levels (S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,  S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and the possible transitions between them. S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; represents the ground state, while S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; represent higher-energy excited states;S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are singlet states in which all the electrons form pairs of opposed spins whereas T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is a triplet excited state, in which not all electrons are paired off in this way. 


[[File:Jablonski diagram.jpg|600px|center]]


Figure A1.1 – Jablonski diagram showing four electronic energy levels S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, with their vibrational fine structure and the transitions between them that affect luminescence. 

Each energy level is subdivided into a number of vibrational states, each characterised by an amount of vibrational energy that accompanies the potential energy of the electrons occupying the orbitals. 
Luminescence is classified according to the excited state that gives rise to it and to the source of the energy that caused the excited state to be populated with electrons. The promotion of electrons to an excited state is called excitation. In many cases, this is brought about by absorption of visible or ultraviolet radiation. In such a case, if the luminescence arises because electrons are relaxing from a singlet excited state to a singlet ground state, then it is called '''fluorescence''', and generally occurs within 10&lt;sup&gt;-11&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;-5&lt;/sup&gt; s. The transition is very fast because it involves no reversal of electron spin. If, however, it arises due to relaxation from a triplet excited state, then the luminescence is called '''phosphorescence''', which generally occurs within 10&lt;sup&gt;-4&lt;/sup&gt; to 100 s. If the excitation is the result of energy released in a chemical reaction, the luminescence is called '''chemiluminescence'''. A subset of chemiluminescence occurring in the biosphere as a result of biological processes is called '''bioluminescence'''. '''Electrochemiluminescence''' is another distinct subset of chemiluminescence phenomena, made up of those reactions in which the excited species is produced at an electrode during electrolysis. 

Before luminescence occurs, there is a non-radiative loss of energy (due to collisions between molecules) as the excited state relaxes to a lower vibrational state while remaining at the same electronic energy level. This type of transition is called '''vibrational deactivation'''. It has to occur even more rapidly than fluorescence and typically occurs within 10&lt;sup&gt;-12&lt;/sup&gt; s of excitation. Therefore the luminescence involves the emission of photons of lower energy (higher wavelength) than would otherwise be the case. Another possible transition is '''internal conversion''', in which an electron transfers from a lower vibrational state of a higher electronic energy level to a higher vibrational state of a lower electronic energy level, without any significant gain or loss of energy; such a transition, S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → S&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, is shown schematically in Figure 1.1. In '''intersystem crossing''', internal conversion would involve also reversal of the spin of the electron as in a transition from a singlet to a triplet state; the transition S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; in Figure 1.1 is of this type. Such transitions can give rise to phosphorescence. Finally, luminescence is not inevitable. The intensity of the emission compared with the number of molecules in the excited state is called the '''quantum yield'''(Φ&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;). This can be calculated for fluorescent emission by dividing the number of emitted photons by the number of absorbed photons. Φ&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; in a chemiluminescence phenomenon should be the same as in the fluorescence phenomenon involving the same excited state, but, because chemiluminescence does not depend on the absorption of photons, it can be calculated in the same way only by performing a separate fluorescence experiment. 
The intensity of chemiluminescence emission is more meaningfully compared with the number of reactant molecules; this measure is called the '''chemiluminescence quantum yield''' (Φ&lt;sub&gt;CL&lt;/sub&gt;). It is related to Φ&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; by the equation:

                                    Φ&lt;sub&gt;CL&lt;/sub&gt; = Φ&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;.Φ&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt;.Φ&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt;

where Φ&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; is the proportion of reactant molecules converted into product and Φ&lt;sub&gt;E&lt;/sub&gt; is the proportion of product molecules formed in the excited state.  Φ&lt;sub&gt;CL&lt;/sub&gt; has values from 0 to 1 and reaches 0.88 for firefly luciferin ''in vitro''&lt;ref&gt;Seliger H H and McElroy W D, Pathways of energy transfer in bioluminescence, ''Radiation Res.'', Suppl. 2 (1960), 528-38. 
&lt;/ref&gt;. 

Because Φ&lt;sub&gt;CL&lt;/sub&gt; depends on Φ&lt;sub&gt;F&lt;/sub&gt; it would be reasonable to suppose that chemiluminescence is affected by substitution in product molecules in the same way as is fluorescence. In that case, Φ&lt;sub&gt;CL&lt;/sub&gt; would be increased by electron donors and decreased by electron acceptors. There would also be an increase in Φ&lt;sub&gt;CL&lt;/sub&gt; (and a bathochromic shift in emission wavelength) due to conjugated systems and in rigidly planar molecules having facilitated π-bond delocalisation. Such generalisations must be used with great care, for the only product species to which they can apply are the molecules that are actually emitting; it is by no means obvious what these are in any particular case.

== Book structure ==

I've renamed your book to our normal style so it isn't all in capital letters. It is now here [[Analytical Chemiluminescence]]. I've also moved the subpage into the book. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 23:15, 4 May 2012 (UTC)

The structure used here is to have every chapter of the book &quot;indented&quot; below the main page. This is done by naming the subpages like this:
:Main page named &lt;nowiki&gt;[[My Book]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:All chapters named &lt;nowiki&gt;[[My Book/Chapter One]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

You can refer to the chapters by using a &quot;relative link&quot; from the main page like this &lt;nowiki&gt;[[/Chapter One/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Don't worry if you make any mistakes, someone will fix them. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 23:23, 4 May 2012 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Preference Reversal is the situation in which preferences for bundles are shifted after the options are juxtaposed.  When bundles are valued separately the decision made on the bundle is different than when they are valued jointly.  This is due to the relativity of choices.  
&quot;Relativity is easy to understand, but there's one aspect of relativity that consistently trips us up.  It's this: we not only tend to compare things with one another, but also tend to focus on comparing things that are easily comparable- and avoid comparing things that cannot be easily compared.&lt;ref&gt;Ariely, Dan. Predictably Irrational. 1. 14-16. eBook. &lt;https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:qcvxxsVgUDMJ:xa.yimg.com/kq/groups/1048630/1548442734/name/predictably+irrational+dan+ariely.docx &amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESj9QqE8_iAefamN1Ee5NqC-0nsh2Va0DiEuX-w926Bee2k1myh7NuC8tViXtzMeh69mavzulbsTP0nTzciFHeUTKvqymlAfyBk7o68uF5rOWasfDDM2UbQoNO1deE9Axv2P1yfL&amp;sig=AHIEtbSGrCYX941_p0i6B2ik_EgTrw5Zag&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;&quot;
This is the reason that people tend to change preferences when comparing things separately and jointly.  Comparisons become easier once juxtaposed, and more important attributes can be easily compared.
Preference Reversal is a theory opposite of the theory of riskless choice.  Riskless choice is a theory created by Jeremy Bentham and James Mill that states that decision makers reach utility maximizing choices through consistent and stable choices.  Preference Reversal theory however, states that optimal choices might not exist even with the most simple of choices when preferences are contingent on circumstance and whims.  When uncertainty is introduced into the decision making process, the theory of consistent and stable preferences is contradicted.  Preference reversals have been noted in a number of settings, but have largely been ignored by economists as many believe that preference reversals are wiped out in marketplace settings.  A study by John A. List has proven the opposite however, as he has taken to the marketplace to prove the existence of preference reversals&lt;ref name=List2012&gt;List, John. &quot;Preference Reversals of a Different Kind: The &quot;More Is Less&quot; Phenomenon.&quot; 92.5 n. page. Web. 4 May. 2012. &lt;http://karlan.yale.edu/fieldexperiments/uploads/PreferenceReversalsofaDifferentKind.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.
Preference Reversals violate the theory of the weak axiom of revealed preference.  WARP states that if bundle A is strictly preferred to bundle B, and the two bundles are not the same, then it cannot be true that bundle B is directly revealed preferred to bundle A.  When presented relative to other goods however, we can see a preference reversal due to relativity&lt;ref&gt;Varian, Hal. Intermediate Microeconomics. 8. New York: W.W. Norton and Company, 124. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Marketplace Application==
	John List has conducted a study using the marketplace for sports trading cards to prove the existence of the “more is less” phenomenon, a name used to describe preference reversals.  Professor List attended a trading card showcase to observe market behavior of experienced and non-experienced card enthusiasts.  He offered four bundles of cards for sale.  The first was ten excellent condition trading cards worth a total of $15, which he auctioned off.  The second bundle was the exact same ten cards, plus three “poor” condition cards worth $18, which he auctioned off as well.  In the third bundle, he auctioned off the exact same two sets of cards side by side.  In the fourth bundle, he had customers pay him $5 to choose which set of cards they wanted.  What List finds is that when bid on separately, consumers bid higher on the ten card bundle rather than the 13 card bundle, even though the 13 card bundle is worth $3 more than the ten card bundle.  When the two bundles are juxtaposed, consumers bid higher on the 13 card bundle, showing a reversal of preference.  This phenomenon can be see using non-dealers, who are in-experienced, and also holds true for the dealers, who are considered extremely experienced in this field.  List goes on to conclude that when individuals bid on one item in isolation, easy to evaluate characteristics, not necessarily the most important ones are used to determine value.  When bid on jointly in a juxtaposition, bundles are judged compared to the other bundle, and reference characteristics are better defined allowing consumers to make utility maximizing choices&lt;ref name=List2012/&gt;.
==Joint vs. Separate Evaluation==
	There are two types of evaluations seen in the Preference Reversal theory.  These evaluations are Joint Evaluation and Separate Evaluation, in which drastically different choices are made depending on the type of evaluation being done.  Joint Evaluation is the situation in which multiple options are presented at the same time and the consumer can make decisions based upon comparison to the other options.  This type of evaluation usually leads to better decisions and less consumer error.  Separate Evaluation is the situation in which consumers are presented one option at a time and evaluated in isolation from other options.  This type of evaluation draws on consumers references and is affected by uncertainty, leading to consumer error&lt;ref name=HseeEtAl1999&gt;Hsee, Christopher, Sally Blount, George Loewenstein, and Max Bazerman. &quot;Preference Reversals Between Joint and Separate Evaluations of Options: A Review and Theoretical Analysis.&quot; American Psychological Association. 125.5 (1999): n. page. Web. 4 May. 2012. &lt;http://www.andrew.cmu.edu/user/gl20/GeorgeLoewenstein/Papers_files/pdf/PrefRevJoint.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.  
==Evaluating Attributes==
	Some attributes, most notably measurable attributes such as GPA, IQ, or other scores, are easy to independently evaluate, and other attributes such as job experience or how many programs a candidate has written are more difficult to independently evaluate.  In Separate Evaluation, the attributes that are difficult to evaluate have less impact on the overall choice or decision.  In Separate Evaluation, easy to evaluate attributes hold more weight and are the primary determinants of the final decision.  In Joint Evaluation however, options can be compared side by side and the difficult to evaluate attributes become easier to evaluate, exerting greater influence over the final decision.  Easy to evaluate attributes do not play a large role in Joint Evaluation, as they can even be evaluated in the Separate Evaluation mode and are of no use when difficult to evaluate attributes can be used.  This leads to preference reversal as the impact of the different attributes change when using Joint Evaluation as opposed to Separate Evaluation&lt;ref name=HseeEtAl1999/&gt;.

=ChoirWire=
is a scalable, fault tolerant, distributed digital sound mixer system especially for life concert purposes. It is a definition for a low cost system with good performance and the possibility of high channel count. Goal is not to define state of the art. (Distributed audio mixers which are coupled via optical high speed communication are on the market for a few mio. Dollars.)

'''Aim of the project is to define an open standard for the physical and logical data layer so that different hardware and software projects worldwide by students or professionals can be established and work together.'''

This KISS-standard shall be suitable for a stage audio system with 2-512 input channels, two main and up to four distributed monitor outputs and one remote mixing console. Every distributed input has its own adjustable logical address (0-255) on which it is identified. It doesn’t care on which socket an input is plugged in. 
The amount of data shall not be too high so that standard components with low cost can be used. Nevertheless a data main stream of 2x23bit is foreseen to make high quality as well possible as single chip solutions.

Fig.1: Example of Use-Case of ChoirWire standard

=Main principle=

A standard mixing console consists of several input channels. After tone adjustment, the sound of every channel is put on cross bars of main L/R and monitor channels with different volumes. After all, there is a master volume for main and monitor channels.
Every input wire is routed in parallel to the mixing console. Monitor channels are routed back to the stage or musician. A lot of wires are required if there are more than a douzend musicians.


[[File:ChoirWire_standardMixingConsole.gif]]

Fig. 2: Classic sound mixing console

To get rid of the wiring horror it would be nice to put all the information of input and output on one wire which collects the inputs and distributes the outputs from and to everywhere. But the problem doing so is, that there is a very huge amount of data. Having 64 input channels with 2x24bits (main)+ 4x12bits (monitor) and sampling rate of 48ksamples/s means a pay load of 294.912Mbit/s. Might be possible – but difficult and expensive to handle. Data reduction is undesired for professional music equipment.

The solution for low real-time data rate without loss of quality is to transfer the Xbars, not the inputs directly. The input channels are put on the stage, the “knobs” are remote controlled. Additionally, if the inputs are already on stage near the musicians, the transfer of the monitor channels (for example for in-ear monitors) is possible.

=Definition of the ChoirWire standard=
==Physical layer==

The data transport consists of a bidirectional, redundant ring system. 


[[File:ChoirWire_PrincipleBidirectionalDataTransport.gif]]

Fig.4: Principle of bidirectional data transport

It carries main audio data, monitor audio data and status data from the distributed inputs to the data collector and audio data and control data from a data collector to the distributed inputs.

One input will be the first who receives data from both sides. He will ignore one side and send his data to the other because the received data is redundant. 
If the flow of control and music data fails, the previous ignored side will be checked for valid data. With this mechanism it is possible to detect single defects – and blank them out!

The audio data shall be at 48kHz sampling rate. A Codec needs 256*48kHz = 12.288Mhz bus clock. It shall be possible to find an UART working with 6144 kBaud bus clock with a standard 8 bit coding. So 12 Bytes per frame can be used: 3 left main 3 right main, 6 monitor. 

Beside of the data, the distributed inputs are supplied with DC voltage of 48V. This makes it necessary to use DC/DC converter modules in the inputs, but reduces the current flowing over the supply wire. If necessary, more than one power supply in the physical ring can be used in parallel to power the inputs.



[[File:ChoirWire_DataAndPowerFlowOnStage.gif]]

Fig. 5: Power and data flow in a distributed system

==Connector system==

The practical implementation of a ring is rather nasty and not suitable for a quick on-stage installation. Nevertheless, only the ring is really fault tolerant against broken wires.

A single wire with a simple plug which can be plugged-in somewhere on the stage and the connection is always correct is much easier to use as a double connected ring.

The compromise: Stage boxes (as many as required) are connected as a ring, the distributed inputs are connected to them. Even more, chains of distributed inputs shall be possible.

===Sockets and connectors for distributed inputs===
For keeping the data ring closed it is necessary to have female connections which have bypass switches: With the connector plugged in, the physical ring is looped-through the input, without connector, the physical ring is closed. 
Short circuits during plugging would disturb data flow or, even worse, brake down supply and reset the whole system which will lead to audible black outs. 
One connection system which fulfils the needs of bypass switch and shortcut free plugging is the German TAE analogue telephone connection (see Wikipedia TAE connector). (The Austrian telephone sockets have more pins, so redundancy for power supply would be possible. But often they have not all contacts (Only 6) - and they are more expensive.)

&lt;gallery&gt;
File:TAE-Stecker-F.jpg|Fig. 6: TAE connector
File:TAE-Dose-NFF-UP.jpg|Fig.7: TAE socket
&lt;/gallery&gt;
The TAE socket has 6 contacts. Contacts 1-6 and 2-5 are closed via switch in the female connector if no connector is plugged in. Contacts 3-4 don’t have this feature. The contacts are not gold plated – but for a short-term use like on-stage there is no time for oxidation. And the plugs are not too small and sensitive, the cable outlet is protected – even more suitable for use on-stage. The coding “F” shall be used.
(other connectors? Well, there must be a bypass switch, so the USA telephone or network sockets don’t work. Nevertheless, better solutions are welcome.)

Very important in this system is ground and supply. Pin 3 has positive 48V, Pin 4 is connected to ground.
The two signal wire pairs on Pin 1/2 and 5/6 are used bidirectional. So it is possible to detect a broken link and use the other signal path. 
If the distributed inputs are equipped with a socket (to create chains) it is necessary to change the signal direction (left side of the ring – right side of the ring). So every two inputs the signal is repeated – and not only bypassed a lot of times. This enhances signal transfer stability even in long chains because the inputs act as a signal repeater. 

Shielded cables are necessary for the interconnection. 
Proposal: symmetrical network wires with a RF impedance of 100 ohms are used.
Between stage box and input, a 4 pair network wire may be used: 2 pairs for data communication, the others for supply.
May be an USB 3.0 wire (with 3 pairs plus supply wires) is also suitable, but it has an impedance of 90 Ohms.

===Sockets and connectors for the stage boxes===

The stage boxes consist mainly from the telephone standard socket “F F”, which has 2 outlets. Two connectors can be plugged in. With the standard “NFN” telephone socket, pin 3 and 4 cannot be accessed seperately for adding (PTC-) fuses. Only the single “F” and the double “F F“ socket give this possibility. (In fact, it is possible to cut off the coding nozzle from the connector – and then it is possible to use N or F connector in N or F sockets).

The data transfer from and to the data collector shall be done via 100 ohms network wires. Only one pair is required - so the other three may carry the 48V supply. Alternatively, a 1 pair network wire and a 1 pair supply wire with large copper diameter may be used.

The power lines are critical to short circuits, so a reasonable distance between 48V and GND is necessary. Having up to 254 distributed inputs with a power consumption of 2W each will result in a total power consumption of 508W. So, the power lines in the stage box ring have to withstand up to 10.6A. The telephone “F” connectors are limited to about 0.5A. For protection against overload, PTC resistors (poly switch fuse) shall be used in the stage box to limit the output current to 0.5A. So the length of every input chain (power consumption 2W each) is limited to 12. The number of stage boxes is not limited.
For power connection and data XLR-connectors with 4 poles are recommended. (Better solutions are welcome.) 
Pin 4 (near marking) is used as GND, pins 2+3 are used for data, and pin 1 carries 48V. So, the distance between GND and 48V is maximum.

[[File:ChoirWire_WiringDiagram.jpg|border|800px]]

Fig. 11: Example of the wiring diagram of the ChoirWire

==Electrical data transmission and reception==
The data wires are used bidirectional. So the transceiver has to blank-out his own sent signal analogue. Even more, it is recommended to use a magnetic transformer. So together with galvanic isolated DC/CD converters (48V to 5V) it is easy to make the distributed inputs galvanic isolated. Disturbances from mains will be reduced to a minimum.
The data transfer rate will be 48kHz * 128bits = 6.144MBit, so the necessary band with of the transformer is (6.144MBit / 10Bits/byte =) 614kHz to (6.144MBit/2Bit * 5 =) 15.36 MHz.  (at least 6.144MBit/2Bit*3 = 9.216MHz).
For eliminating the DC offset, a kind of &quot;Alternate mark&quot; RZ coding is used. In an UART-like communication the idle level on the signal wire is high, the active level is low. So a &quot;silent&quot; line is high (idle) for the UART, means that there are no transmission pulses on the communication wire.

[[Image:Ami encoding.svg|thumb|360px|An example of bipolar encoding, or AMI (Alternate mark inversion).]]

Implementation example:
The generation of an alternating signal is done with a divider (D-FlipFlop), which flips at every sent low signal. Disadvantage is, that the transmission clock is needed. A standard SPI output of a micro controller can do this.
With a tristate line driver and three resistors, the three voltage levels are generated. In tristate (SPI-TX signal high), a medium voltage is applied to the transceiver amp. If the SPI-TX signal is low, the flip flop level is output.
The transceiver shall output the serial signal with an impedance of about 90 Ohms.  Because of the wire and receiver impedance and the output swing of a video amplifier, the voltage swing on the signal wire is 1Vpp. An differential amplifier is mixing the transmitted and received signal to the receive channel so that the own sent signal is eliminated. 
A window comparator circuit (with small hysteresis) detects a &quot;voltage around zero&quot; (&lt;40% of input swing) of a &quot;voltage present&quot; (&gt;60% of input swing). Via OR (here with diodes and pullup), a UART compatible signal for the micro is generated to receive data.


[[File:ChoirWire_TransceiverCircuit.jpg|800px|Example for Transceiver Circuit]]

Fig. 12: Transceiver example


==Logical data transfer==

There are two data directions: &lt;br /&gt;
-	the Control &amp; monitor data from the Data collector to the distributed inputs and &lt;br /&gt;
-	the Status &amp; music data from the distributed slaves to the data collector.

===Data transfer ===
This description is valid for both directions: From inputs to data collector and vice versa.

There are 128 bit times for data transmission in one 48kHz cycle. So 12 Bytes with 1start bit, 1stop bit and 8 data bytes can be transmitted, 

LSB first (standard UART).&lt;br /&gt;

The distributed inputs receive the music data (main and monitor) from the predecessor and add their own music data to it.
The transmission starts with the LSB first. So it is possible to reduce the delay to one bittime per distributed input, if a logic device is 

used: Receive the LSB from the previous input, add own LSB, and send it out.
(Example: data rate 48kHz * 128bits = 6144kb/s --&gt; Bittime is 0.1627µs = Delay per input --&gt; 41.65µs delay for 256 inputs archeivable.)
 
The data collector adds the music data from the left and the right physical ring and has then the complete music data. 
The complete music data are then sent back via the two signal wires to the physical ring.
So, everywhere in the net, the reception of the main mix output and 2-4 monitor channels is possible. (&quot;Virual x-bars&quot;)

To give a maximum of flexibility to quality, four transmission modes are selectable:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Mode !! main channels !! monitor channels !! sum of channels
|-
| 0 (default) || 16bit L, 16bit R || 2x15bit, 2x16bit|| 6 channels
|-
| 1  || 23bit L, 23bit R || 2x24bit|| 4 channels
|-
| 2  || 23bit L, 23bit R || 3x16bit|| 5 channels
|-
| 3  || 23bit L, 23bit R || 4x12bit|| 6 channels
|} 

Within the music data, two control bits are integrated.
So 96kBits control data per second can be transmitted.
It is mandatory, that the data bits have allways the same position.
After Reset, when the mode is not known, the main channels are used with 16bits with. The monitor channels need a few milliseconds.
The monitor channels are ignored (no signal output) until the input has received a configuration command (7).

===Data transfer with the two data bits 1+2===
Prior goal is to transfer music and not to transfer unnecessary data. So this 96kB/s is used as an asynchronous data transfer:
The data stream consists of the content of consecutive data bits D1-D2-D1-D2-D1-D2-D1-D2 and so on.
The idle state is logic‘1’.  A data transfer is started by a start bit transition to ‘0’. Then the 8 bit data content is sent byte by byte, LSB 

first, to simulate a standard UART protocol.
So it is easy to route the transmitted/received data bits to general IO ports where they can be received/transmitted by other standard UARTs.
For adjusting all possible 256 inputs with a new volume value and letting 10Bits sync pause, this will take (256 x 40Bits ./. 96kBit/s = ) 

107ms. This is fast enough, especially if only the inputs in use are addressed.

The data from the predecessor have to be buffered in the inputs to avoid data collisions due to transfer times. If a data transfer from the predecessor is running, the input must wait with the transmission of its data. If an input is transferring status data, the data of the predecessor is buffered in a FIFO buffer.
Also the data collector has to buffer the data coming from the left or right arm of the physical ring. The data to inputs are longer (3Bytes) than the feedback data (2Byes). So there is enough time to transmit all the data – but buffers are needed to handle collisions due to delay times.

===Start of communication and synchronisation===

The communication starts from the data collector in both directions (left and right ring arm).
Because the idle phase of the data stream is shorter than a byte, every 2nd frame is sent only.

[[File:ChoirWire_Synchronisation1.gif]]

Fig.15: Sync step 1

If the start of communication is recognized correctly, the music data is sent back with half speed. So, the Data collector (or precedent distributed input) can synchronize.

[[File:ChoirWire_Synchronisation2.gif]]

Fig.16: Sync step 2

If and as long the Data collector has correct communication, he starts sending every frame.
If there has been silence on the other side of input 2,3, it starts transmitting the control flow for the next input block.

[[File:ChoirWire_Synchronisation3.gif]]

Fig.17: Sync step 3

Because of the full speed transmission of the Data collector, the input 2 and 3 send back with full speed.
The Input1will receive data from both side, so no “idle side” is found. It has to decide for one direction. The first correct received frame will fix this.
The time difference may come from line delay or program sequence. In this example the left ring was first.

[[File:ChoirWire_Synchronisation4.gif]]

Fig.18: Sync step 4

For Input 1, there is correct data on both sides, so it knows that the ring is closed.
After receiving the control data with full speed, it sends back to the left side only, but also with full speed.

*“Data received” means a full 12 byte frame received without stopbit errors.

===Mixing console data transfer===
For the data transfer from the data collector to the mixing console, a standard audio wire with 3 pin XLR connectors can be used. Alternative, Sub-D connectors with 9 pins are provided so a RS232 null modem cable can be used.

Fig.21: XLR connector     Fig.22: RS232 null modem cable

The female connector is on the mixing console, the male connector in the data collector. Pin 1 is connected to ground, pin 2 is used for data transfer from mixing console to data collector, Pin 3 for data transfer from data collector to mixing console.

Sub-D 9pin male on data collector:
Pin 5 is connected to ground, pin 2 is RX and used for data transfer from mixing console to data collector, pin 3 is TX and used for data transfer from the data collector to mixing console. 

The simple RS232 levels shall be used there for the 96kBaud signals with the known standard levels. So a laptop (with USB to COM adaptor) can be used as mixing console as a software solution. 
For a better handling, a mixing console with buttons and slider will be more suitable on stage to control the distributed inputs.

==Conformity to ChoirWire standard==
Items which are 100% compatible with this ChoirWire standard must fulfill this minimum requirements:

===for distributed inputs===
* The input voltage range is 40V...50V minimum
* All mechanical, physical and data transport methods are conform

===for data collectors===
* The nominal output voltage is 48V
* All mechanical, physical and data transport methods are conform
* Commands from the remote mixing console to the inputs and vice versa are not filtered


=Appendix=
==Example of a mixing console==

[[File:ChoirWire_ExampleMixingConsole.gif]]

fig. 23: Example of a mixing console

This example shows a possible mixing console with the possibilities in a certain situation:
On the left side there are 24 (of possible 256) input selectors/displays. On each there is the input number and a “solo” button / lamp on which the channel (here 10) has more volume (Solo add). Then the level indicator chain of the input and – the most important thing- a selection button in several colours:
If it is off, then the input is not connected in the physical ring.
If it is green, the input is present and OK, but is not selected.
If it is red, the input has encountered a problem – for example, a bad wire.
If it is yellow, the input is selected. Pushing the input button selects this input, pushing a “Group” button selects the group – and all the inputs assigned to this group are yellow. In this example, group 2 was selected. The inputs 20, 21, 22 and 23 (for example 4 sopranos) are assigned to that group and are yellow. Now the selection buttons (selection volume, selection pitch/balance, selection bass / mid / treble, Monitor 1,2,3,4) will adjust the sound levels of the whole soprano group.
If only one input is selected, the selection buttons adjust the sound of this input.
The master volume left and right can be adjusted in every setting.

Here an example for calculating the volume of one  channel:
Input 12: 
Volume left = Volume(12) + balanceL(12)+[solo(12) if active]+Volume(group2)+
balanceL(group2)+MasterVolumeL  
So, the input12 gets the information with which level he should add his signal to the main channel left. The calculation adds only the setting levels in db, not the signal level. So the problem of “headroom” as in analogue mixing consoles does not exist. 
The adjust buttons are position coders. The actual setting of a channel is displayed via LED chain. Of course, if the selected input changes, the present “selection volume” for example changes. The LED chain will display the virtual “position” of the button. It is not possible to use potentiometers, because it may be necessary to turn this button round and round. Analogue faders can be used for master volume setting.

===Set addressing of the distributed input===
The mixing console sends out a “addressing request” bit to one input channel.
(For example, after pushing “select” and “solo” button on the mixing console.)
The distributed inputs have an addressing mode (after pushing a button). In addressing mode, the input waits for the “addressing request” bit and accepts the address as his new address for future. It shall be stored in non volatile memory, too. Then this input answers with his address normally – and the mixing console knows, the slave is addressed now and resets the “addressing request”. 
Example: pushing “address” button on an input, then pushing “select” and “solo” button on the mixing console – and the input is connected or reconnected. 

==Examples of distributed inputs==

[[File:ChoirWire_ExampleDistributedInput1.gif]]

Fig. 25: Example of a distributed input with monitor output

This example shows an implementation of a distributed input. In the middle (red) the adjust button for addressing. On the left (or bottom side, if turned) the connectors for the input (microphone, e-guitar, keyboard,…), the monitor output (for example in-ear monitor or headphone) and – the ChoirWire input. A ChoirWire output is foreseen to make chains of musicians possible. With the yellow “solo” button the solo offset of this input can be switched on and off. So no intervening from the mixing console is necessary. With the “mute” button the input can be switched off short time – for example while coughing.  The right three buttons are a small mixer for the monitor out. It mixes the own input, and two other channels from main channel, monitor 1, monitor 2, monitor 3 or monitor 4. So for example a singer can individually mix his monitoring from himself, the piano on monitor 2 and the complete set from main.
Of course other implementations are possible, for example a pure input without monitoring and a pure distributed output without addressing.


Also possible is a locally controlled distributed input without remote control. This device will send his data directly to main and a monitor channels, volume and sound are locally adjusted. Addressing and remote mixing console are not necessary; the musician controls directly the speaker output and there is no “master control” for all inputs. So this is suitable for small bands only. 
The number of monitor channels is given by the mixing console (if present) and recognized by this input; if there is no mixing console in use, the number of monitor channels is set to two, with 24 bits.

==Example of a Data Collector==

Fig. 27: Example of a Data Collector

The data collector is the power supply for all distributed inputs and “collects” the music data from the right and left side of the physical data ring. It can be put in a 19’’ rack, for example, and mounted together with the power amplifier.
It contains only connections: for power, for the remote mixing console (or laptop), then the sound outputs main and monitor channels and, of course, the connector for the ChoirWire distributed inputs.
Of course, it is possible to build the mixing console and the data collector in one housing. (Then the main outputs are at the FOH – this is kind of taste.)

==Application example: Church or town hall==

With ChoirWire, present installed wiring for microphones (XLR connector system) can be used for connecting a remote mixing console. So it is easy to use more microphones on the stage than before.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Review May 5 ==
This is a good description of what's in those two papers. Here's some suggestions to try to make it better:
* See if you can do an overall introduction to the idea--you can do this without references, but I think using an example from the ''Predictably Irrational'' book would fit well with the introduction. Do this before you get to the specific studies by List &amp; Hsee et al.
* Try to get something in there about revealed preference and WARP.
* I know List starts his paper off by talking about Bentham and Mill, but I for this page, I'm afraid that gives it the feeling that the idea is out-of-date. It's still very much alive and essential, as seen by our using revealed preference in class. Maybe rephrase it some so it makes it clear that '''current economic theory''' precludes preference reversals.
* ``Riskless Choice'' is most of what we have been studying, and probably doesn't need to be highlighted much. I think List was trying to make sure that his discussion didn't get confused with preference reversal discussion which has to do with '''risky choice''', since economists mostly (now) accept that choice about risky things is ... weird.

This is a terrific start--most of the way to being a terrific finish. [[User:TDang|TDang]] ([[User talk:TDang|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/TDang|contribs]]) 19:28, 5 May 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">First brought to attention by Daniel Ellsberg, the Ellsberg Paradox represents a class of choice situations in which an uncertainty is weighed against a known probability. In most cases it is observed that this uncertainty is regarded as a risk, while statistically is equally as likely of producing a given outcome as the known probability.&lt;ref name=Ellsberg&gt;Daniel Ellsberg. Risk, Ambiguity, and the Savage Axioms. The Quarterly Journal of Economics ,Vol. 75, No. 4 (Nov., 1961), pp. 643-669. Published by: Oxford University Press. Article Stable URL: http://www.jstor.org/stable/1884324&lt;/ref&gt;

In most cases the failure to realize such conditions is not due to haphazard guessing, as many irrational decisions are themselves deliberately and empirically reasoned, but represent an uncertainty about the nature of information given, where the ambiguity of the information presented to the responder incites probabilistic responses. This suggestion of of human activity by Ellsberg is in contradiction to the Savage axioms of choice, which suggest that people will react rationally, assign a relative probability to an uncertain situation, and rely on this perceived probability and expected outcome to make choices.&lt;ref name=Ellsberg /&gt;

==Examples==

'''Urn with Marbles'''&lt;ref name=Ellsberg /&gt;

&lt;u&gt;Experimental Conditions&lt;/u&gt;

Urn I contains 100 red and black balls, at an unknown ratio
Urn II contains exactly 50 black and 50 red balls

&lt;u&gt;Experimental Questions&lt;/u&gt;

#  If you were to draw a ball from Urn I if you had to bet $100 dollars on drawing either Red&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt; or Black&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt; which would you chose?
# &quot; Which do you prefer to bet on, Red&lt;sub&gt;II&lt;/sub&gt; or Black&lt;sub&gt;II&lt;/sub&gt;?&quot;
# &quot; Which do you prefer to bet on, Red&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt; or Red&lt;sub&gt;II&lt;/sub&gt;?&quot;
# &quot; Which do you prefer to bet on, Black&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt; or Black&lt;sub&gt;II&lt;/sub&gt;?&quot;

&lt;u&gt;Experimental responses&lt;/u&gt;

To the question &quot; Which do you prefer to bet on, Red&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt; or Red&lt;sub&gt;II&lt;/sub&gt;&quot;
and the question&quot; Which do you prefer to bet on, Black&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt; or Black&lt;sub&gt;II&lt;/sub&gt;&quot; the majority of responses suggested a preference in Red&lt;sub&gt;II&lt;/sub&gt; and Black&lt;sub&gt;II&lt;/sub&gt; over Red&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt; and Black&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;. From these majority preferences it seems that preference is not based on statistical probability as the possibilities are equally as likely with the given characteristics.&lt;ref name=Ellsberg /&gt;

==Ambiguity==

The more ambiguous information seems, the less confident is held with the estimate of that probability, despite an ample amount of information. This presence of ambiguity comes from when questions of reliability, relevance, and conflict appears in a set of information. Ellsberg defines ambiguity in ''Risk, Ambiguity, and the Savage Axioms'' as:
&quot;a quality depending on the amount, type, reliability and &quot;unanimity&quot; of information, and giving rise to one's degree of &quot;confidence&quot; in an estimate of relative likelihoods.&quot; (Ellsberg, p. 657)

Ambiguity can be found as variable in situations in which information is unreliable or conflicting,  where expectations differ from expected behavior, and where confidence in such expectations or predictions is low.&lt;ref name=Ellsberg /&gt;

'''Uncertainty'''

Because knowledge is limited, and the processes and characteristics may not have the ability to be completely known, without specific and narrowed knowledge on a subject, everyday decisions are made off of crude estimates. Confidence of such estimates rests in perceived probabilities and judgements, even though there is usually not enough information or ability to calculate probabilities to exactly support such confidence.&lt;ref name=Knight&gt;Knight, Frank H., Risk, Uncertainty, and Profit. 1921. Library of Economics and Liberty. 6 May 2012. &lt;http://www.econlib.org/library/Knight/knRUP1.html&gt;. &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Risk vs Uncertainty''' 

Frank Knight, an American economist suggested a key difference  between risk and uncertainty. Risk, as Knight proposed is  a type of uncertainty (which soon becomes an effective certainty) in which probability of the outcomes can be applied. Uncertainty in turn involves a class of situations in which the probability behind outcomes seems ambiguous, or is not known. Ellsberg, who outlines the Ellsberg paradox as a class of situations in which it is observed that in certain circumstances there are  decision rules which are based in an uncertainty that lack the use of probability to describe such circumstances.&lt;ref name=Knight /&gt;

==Conservative Decision Rule==

Faced with a situation that involves a set of decisions which contain pay offs and weights involving different actions which can be pursued which have ambiguous values. In Ellsberg's analysis of such a simulation conservative decision towards dealing with known risks rather than uncertainty in ambiguity. Ellsberg makes this assertion that as ambiguity in a situation decreases, because of conservative though which suggests that individuals act as though the worst case scenario are more likely than their personal best estimate in order to ambiguity, and instead navigate towards known risk.&lt;ref name=Ellsberg /&gt;

==Connections to Neuroscience==

'''Risk and Ambiguity'''

*Risk
Aversion to risk and ambiguity have large and obvious ties to connections in neuroscience, in which the human mind reacts to situations involving the two uncertainties. In the case of risk, it is seem that aversion to risk coincides with fear responses. Such responses are known to be found in the amygdala area of the brain, which is responsible for immediate reaction to situations which potentially involve fear, as well as  input associations involving fear, and thus risk aversion.With the ability for strong emotional responses, it is observed that there is a strong ability to aversion to situations with greater risk.&lt;ref name=Camerer&gt;Camerer, Colin F., Loewenstein, George, and Prelec,Drazen. Neuroeconomics: Why Economics Needs Brains. The Scandinavian Journal of Economics , Vol. 106, No. 3, Behavioral Economics (Sep., 2004), pp. 555-579
Published by: Blackwell Publishing on behalf of The Scandinavian Journal of Economics
Article Stable URL: http://www.jstor.org/stable/3441124&lt;/ref&gt;

*Ambiguity
Aversion to ambiguity also can be actively observed by neurocognitive processes, specifically to emotional activity within the brain. Facing a situation of ambiguity versus a situation of certainty it has been observed that the insula cortex of the brain, which  relays and processes information about bodily states such as pain, hunger, discomfort activated differently suggesting a difference in the neuroactivity in certain and ambiguous situations.&lt;ref name=Camerer /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello,

my name is Andreas Mueller.
I'm an 43 years old communications engineer.

Singing in a Gospel choir is a hobby of me.
Our &quot;Lord's Amazing Choir &amp; Band&quot; makes 2-3 large concerts per year.
With a lot of microphones, wires an other thechnical staff which fills a lorry...

So I've made some thinking about improving this chaos and get rid of some stress.
The result is &quot;ChoirWire&quot;, a distributed mixing console. 
But makeing it, may be patenting it, would create an island solution nobody accepts.
So I try to start a public article and discussions so that a &quot;plug and play&quot; solutions for several students or manufacturers is possible - without the horrific payments for published standards.

I hope the Idea is good and makes its way.

Sincinerly

It sets the (X)HTML language code for the word or phrase, to assist with things like font selection.
It also highlights the word or phrase by setting the font style to italic (by default, although this can be overridden).

=== Usage ===
 &amp;#123;&amp;#123;lang eo
  |&lt;span style=&quot;color: grey; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;Esperanto word or phrase&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;
  |style=&lt;span style=&quot;color: grey; font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&amp;lt;Optional CSS styles to apply&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt;

{{template shortcut|sc}}
&lt;!-- Categories and interwikis go at the bottom of this page. --&gt;

=== Usage ===
This template shows all text in {{smallcaps|smallcaps}} as a hard format. That is, the caps are permanent, regardless of user preferences. For example:
* {{tlx|smallcaps all|Hello World}} &amp;rarr; {{smallcaps all|Hello World}}

The template performs two steps: bare text is changed into uppercase, and it is shown in small caps.

====Difference from {{tlx|smallcaps}}====
The {{tlx|smallcaps}} template is for soft formatting, which is more often what is desired. There are three differences between the templates:&lt;br/&gt;

1. '''All input text is shown in {{smallcaps|small caps}}''', not just the lowercase input. Compare:
::* {{tlx|smallcaps|Hello World}} &amp;rarr; {{smallcaps|Hello World}}
::* {{tlx|smallcaps all|Hello World}} &amp;rarr; {{smallcaps all|Hello World}}
::Note that the initial full capitals are gone.
2. '''The bare, unstyled text is changed into uppercase'''. This is relevant for non-CSS browsers, and when one copy-pastes the page. Compare:
::* {{tlx|smallcaps|Hello World}} &amp;rarr; {{smallcaps|Hello World}}. Copy-paste produces: &lt;code&gt;Hello World&lt;/code&gt;
::* {{tlx|smallcaps all|Hello World}} &amp;rarr; {{smallcaps all|Hello World}}. Copy-paste produces: &lt;code&gt;HELLO WORLD&lt;/code&gt;
3. '''To maintain initial full capitals, a second parameter is to be used'''. Doing this has no effect on how text is displayed in non-CSS browsers and with copy-paste. Example:
::* {{tlx|smallcaps all|H|ello}} {{tlx|smallcaps all|W|orld}} &amp;rarr; {{smallcaps all|H|ello}} {{smallcaps all|W|orld}}. Copy-paste produces: &lt;code&gt;HELLO WORLD&lt;/code&gt;

====General Usage====
This template should only be used for words, such as acronyms, that should be capitalized regardless of typographic style. Examples are {{smallcaps all|NASA}} and {{smallcaps all|BC/AD}}, which are stylistic variants of NASA and BC/AD. 

It should not be used for things that are not inherently capitalized, such as the use of small caps to distinguish given from family names, because it makes the capitalization permanent, and the reader cannot override it. In such cases, the template {{tl|smallcaps}} should be used instead.

;Examples
To lighten ALL-CAP words, abbreviations, or [[w:acronym|acronym]]s, as a matter of typographic style
* The initialism [[w:UNESCO|{{smallcaps all|U|nesco}}]] (instead of UNESCO)
* The trademark [[w:Time (magazine)|{{smallcaps all|T|ime}}]] (instead of TIME)
* Dates such as 625&amp;nbsp;{{smallcaps all|BCE}}

If the template is placed outside a link, it will capitalize the link itself, so in some cases it needs to be placed inside the link.

===See also===
Templates that change the display (copy-paste will get the original text):

* {{tl|Allcaps}}   – upper-case display
* {{tl|Nocaps}}    – lower-case display
* {{tl|Smallcaps}} – small-caps display

[[w:Help:Magic words#Formatting|Magic words]] that rewrite the output (copy-paste will get the text as displayed):

* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;lc:}}      – lower case output of the full text
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;uc:}}      – upper case output of the full text
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;lcfirst:}} – lower case output of the first character only
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;ucfirst:}} – upper case output of the first character only

__NOTOC__
'''{{tl|Nocaps}}''' will display text in full lower case.

===Usage===
The source text will not be altered (copying/pasting the text will be presented in its original form), only in its browser display. You can use this template to control the display of the variable output of [[w:Help:Magic words#Formatting|magic words]] and of other templates.
Instead of HELLO you would have hello

===Example===
; Code : &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Nocaps|thE ''NaMe'' oF thE GAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
; Result : {{Nocaps|thE ''NaMe'' oF thE GAME}}

===Note===
'''Substitution (&lt;code&gt;subst:&lt;/code&gt;) of this template is not recommended.''' The result will ''not'' create lower case source text but only an appearance thereof; the original text will wrapped in an HTML tag in the page source. Because of this, it would be more effective to simply edit the original text as lower case.

===See also===
Templates that change the display (copying/pasting will present the original text):

* {{tl|Allcaps}}   – upper-case display
* {{tl|Smallcaps}}    – small-caps display
* {{tl|Smallcaps all}} – hard-formatted small-caps display

[[w:Help:Magic words#Formatting|Magic words]] that rewrite the output (copying/pasting will present the text as displayed):

* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;lc:}}      – lower case output of the full text
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;uc:}}      – upper case output of the full text
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;lcfirst:}} – lower case output of the first character only
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;ucfirst:}} – upper case output of the first character only

'''{{tl|Allcaps}}''' will display text in all capital letters.

===Usage===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Allcaps|your text}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; will display your text in full upper case. Your source text is not altered (a copy-paste will give it in its original form), only the way it is displayed. You can use this template to control the display of the variable output of magic words and of other templates.

: '''In:''' &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Allcaps|The ''Name'' of the Game}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
: '''Out:''' {{Allcaps|The ''Name'' of the Game}}

'''Preferably do not subst: it''' because the result will NOT be an uppercase source text but the original text wrapped in HTML code making it appear uppercase, so it is more efficient for this purpose to simply rewrite the text in uppercase once and for all.

* {{tl|Nocaps}}    – lower case display
* {{tl|Smallcaps}} – small caps display

* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;lcfirst:}} – lower case output of the first character only
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;ucfirst:}} – upper case output of the first character only

{{notice|There are far too many labelled image templates with widths and scales of -1 or are inconsistent. Please don't do that. Keep both widths and scales greater than zero and exactly the same in each template. For example, if width is 300, then all the scales must also be 300. Thanks.&lt;!-- See http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Template_talk%3ALanarkshire_and_Ayrshire_Railway_Map&amp;diff=165876967&amp;oldid=165872467 --&gt;}}

&lt;!-- EDIT TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;

&lt;includeonly&gt;;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;===&lt;/noinclude&gt;How to use&lt;noinclude&gt;===&lt;/noinclude&gt;
Consider this example, adapted from [[Template:France Regions Labelled Map]]:
&lt;pre style=&quot;overflow:auto;&quot;&gt;
{{Image label begin|image=France fond de carte 27 régions.png|width={{{width|400}}}|float={{{float|right}}}}}
{{Image label small|x=0.4875|y=0.07|scale={{{width|400}}}|text=Nord-Pas &lt;br /&gt;de Calais}}
{{Image label small|x=0.5225|y=0.165|scale={{{width|400}}}|text=Picardy}}
...
{{Image label end}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;div style=&quot;float:right;&quot;&gt;__TOC__&lt;/div&gt;

;Width/Scale
In this example, '''all widths must be set to the same number''' of 400 as the default width.
They must all be the same number of 400 for the template to be &lt;u&gt;functionally scalable&lt;/u&gt;.
This means they can be displayed at a different size by supplying a width parameter to the template when in use.
For example, ''&amp;#123;{France Regions Labelled Map|width=500}}'' will display the labelled image as a larger one of 500 pixels in width instead of 400.

To change the default size, search and replace
&quot;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;{&amp;#123;{width|400}}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;
with
&quot;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;color: red;&quot;&gt;{&amp;#123;{width|500}}}&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&quot;.

For earthly geographic maps, conforming to these specifications can allow easier conversion for any other purposes such as for the use of {{tl|Location map+}}.

&lt;includeonly&gt;;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;===&lt;/noinclude&gt;X/Y&lt;noinclude&gt;===&lt;/noinclude&gt;

X and Y values are always between 0 and 1.
They represent the percentages of the width and height respectively where the label will be placed.
The exact point is the top-left corner of the image label.
 x=0  |y=0   will place the top-left corner of the label at the top-left     of the image
 x=0  |y=1   will place the top-left corner of the label at the bottom-left  of the image
 x=1  |y=1   will place the top-left corner of the label at the bottom-right of the image
 x=1  |y=0   will place the top-left corner of the label at the top-right    of the image
 x=0.5|y=0.5 will place the top-left corner of the label at the centre       of the image

&lt;includeonly&gt;;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;===&lt;/noinclude&gt;Image&lt;noinclude&gt;===&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The title of the wiki page of the image without the &quot;Image:&quot; prefix.

&lt;includeonly&gt;;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;===&lt;/noinclude&gt;Text&lt;noinclude&gt;===&lt;/noinclude&gt;

The text label to display as wiki markup.

&lt;includeonly&gt;;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;===&lt;/noinclude&gt;Float&lt;noinclude&gt;===&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Three options:
 {&amp;#123;{float|none}}}  makes the image sit on its own line of the page by default
 {&amp;#123;{float|left}}}  makes the image pushed to the left of the page  by default
 {&amp;#123;{float|right}}} makes the image pushed to the right of the page by default

&lt;includeonly&gt;;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;===&lt;/noinclude&gt;link&lt;noinclude&gt;===&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Specifies where the image should link to. If &lt;code&gt;File:&lt;/code&gt; (the default), the image links to its file page. If empty, the image does not link to anything; this is appropriate for [[WP:ALT #Purely decorative images|purely decorative images]].

&lt;includeonly&gt;;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;===&lt;/noinclude&gt;alt&lt;noinclude&gt;===&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Specifies text to be used in the image's &quot;alt&quot; attribute. If {{para|link}} is empty, this should be empty; if {{para|link}} is &lt;code&gt;File:&lt;/code&gt; or is not given, this should describe the image; if {{para|link}} points to some other page this should describe the action that will be taken if you click on the image.

&lt;includeonly&gt;;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;===&lt;/noinclude&gt;caption&lt;noinclude&gt;===&lt;/noinclude&gt;

Specifies text to be used in the image's &quot;title&quot; attribute.
In certain browsers, this text will appear in a tooltip when the mouse pointer is rolled over it.

&lt;includeonly&gt;;&lt;/includeonly&gt;&lt;noinclude&gt;==&lt;/noinclude&gt;Template set&lt;noinclude&gt;==&lt;/noinclude&gt;

This template will determine the name of a language from its [[w:IETF language code|IETF language code]] or [[w:ISO 6391 code|ISO 6391 code]]. The name will be given in English by default, or in the language that is specified in the second parameter. The second parameter should also be specified using a language code. If parameter two is set to a language other than English the name will be wrapped in the {{tl|lang}} template.

=== Usage ===

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Documentation subpage}}
&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;
===Usage===
The template is used mainly for image placement.   The default is for {{#switch: {{Str right|{{BASEPAGENAME}}|7}} | left = a left | right = a right | center = a center | none = no | #default = a left }} alignment.  Whereas an image without a border cannot have a caption, this limitation is overcome by placing the image in a table cell construct which resembles the usual thing.     It behaves broadly as if it were simple image syntax.

It is called as follows:
{{tlx|{{BASEPAGENAME}}|&lt;nowiki&gt;[[File:Gerbera pink.jpg|250px]]|Pink Gerbera : ''This is the caption''&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}

It looks like this.  (Text has been added to illustrate the default spacings.):
{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|[[File:Gerbera pink.jpg|250px]]|Pink Gerbera : ''This is the caption''}}
{{text}}{{text}}{{text}}{{text}}
{{-}}

===Parameters===
There are two parameters.  They are each numbered and named. 
*The first parameter contains the wiki image syntax line.   This can be specified with {{para|content}} or simply as a nameless parameter if placed in the first position.
*The second parameter contains the text for the image caption.  This can be specified with {{para|caption}} or as a nameless parameter.  Use the former if the caption contains an equals (=) sign.
*Note that the parameter names are in lower case.  These (along with image file names) are case sensitive.
*The optional values that are listed below must equate to the option names, with the options and parameters all spaced from one another with pipe symbols.  An example for use at the right of the page would look like this:
*:{{tlx|{{BASEPAGENAME}}|content&lt;nowiki&gt;=[[File:Gerbera pink.jpg|250px]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;|caption{{=}}Caption|align{{=}}right|margin{{=}}0 0 0 1em}}

===Options===
;align:  override the default position on the page, left, center, right, none. 
;margin:  overall margins; in em, px, etc.
;background: structure background color, ''default transparent''; hex, rgb, named colors etc. 
;color:   font color, ''default black''; any color e.g. hex, rgb, or named color.
;ff:   font family, ''default inherit''; any family, or font face name.
;border: border color, ''default none''; can look like a frame with &lt;nowiki&gt;border=1px solid #aaaaaa;&lt;/nowiki&gt;
;padding: text padding for the caption only, ''default 2px 2px 2px 4px''; in em, px, etc.

===See also===
Several templates are available that specify the default alignment without a parameter, allowing the specification of only the image and caption:
*{{tl|noframeleft}}
*{{tl|noframecenter}}
*{{tl|noframeright}}
*{{tl|noframenone}}

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

=== Usage ===
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Location map/decdeg|dec= |deg= |min= |sec= |hem= }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

=== Examples ===

;Degrees, minutes, seconds, hemisphere
*&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Location map/decdeg|dec=|deg=56|min=03|sec=00|hem=N}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; → {{Location map/decdeg|dec=|deg=56|min=03|sec=00|hem=N}}

This template places one or more location marks on a map, with optional labels. It is in the same family of templates as the [[Template:Location map|Location map]] template and the documentation for that template might be helpful.

This template uses a helper template, [[Template:Location map~|Location map~]], one or more times to generate a mark for each location.

=== Usage ===

{|
|- style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;
|&lt;pre style=&quot;width:15em; margin-right:2em;&quot;&gt;
{{Location map+
| {{{1}}}
| width          =
| float          =
| border         =
| caption        =
| alt            =
| relief         =
| AlternativeMap =
| overlay_image  =
| places         =
}}&lt;/pre&gt;
|&lt;pre style=&quot;width:15em;&quot;&gt;
{{Location map~
| {{{1}}}
| label      =
| label_size =
| position   =
| background =
| mark       =
| marksize   =
| link       =
| lat_deg    =
| lat_min    =
| lat_sec    =
| lat_dir    =
| lon_deg    =
| lon_min    =
| lon_sec    =

=== Parameters ===
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;
|+ Parameters for Location map+
! Parameter
! Description
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/tt&gt;
| Required. Use the name of the map as the first unnamed parameter. For example, specify ''England'' to use the values in {{tl|Location map England}}. See the [[#Examples|examples]] below.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;width&lt;/tt&gt;
| Determines the width of the map in [[w:pixel|pixel]]s. The default is 240. Do not include &lt;code&gt;px&lt;/code&gt;, for example: &lt;code&gt;width=300&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code&gt;width=300px&lt;/code&gt;.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;float&lt;/tt&gt;
| Specifies the position of the map on the page. Valid values are &lt;code&gt;left&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;right&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;center&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;none&lt;/code&gt;. The default is &lt;code&gt;right&lt;/code&gt;''.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;border&lt;/tt&gt;
|  Specifies the color of the 1px map border. The default is ''lightgrey'' (see [[w:Web colors|Web colors]]). If set to &lt;code&gt;none&lt;/code&gt;, no border will be generated. This parameter is seldom used.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;caption&lt;/tt&gt;
| The text of a caption to be displayed below the map. Specifying a caption will cause the map to be displayed with a frame. If &lt;code&gt;caption&lt;/code&gt; is defined but is not assigned a value, the map will not be framed and no caption will be displayed. If &lt;code&gt;caption&lt;/code&gt; is not defined, the map will not be framed and a default caption will be generated. The default caption is created from the &lt;tt&gt;label&lt;/tt&gt; parameter (or the current page name if label not defined) and the &lt;tt&gt;name&lt;/tt&gt; parameter from map definition template. See the [[#Examples|examples]] below.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;alt&lt;/tt&gt;
| Alt text for map; used by screen readers.
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;relief&lt;/tt&gt;
| Any non-blank value (1, yes, etc.) will cause the template to display the map specified in the map definition template as &lt;tt&gt;image1&lt;/tt&gt;, which is usually a [[w:Relief mapping (computer graphics)|relief map]]. See the example at [[Template:Location_map#Relief_parameter|Template:Location map]].
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;AlternativeMap&lt;/tt&gt;
| Allows the use of an alternative map. The image must have the same edge coordinates as the location map template. See the example at [[Template:Location_map#AlternativeMap_parameter|Template:Location map]].
|-
| &lt;tt&gt;overlay_image&lt;/tt&gt;
| Allows an overlay to be superimposed on the map. This parameter is seldom used.

=== Available map templates ===

Location map templates can be found using these sources:

:[[:Category:Location map templates]] - templates sorted by category.
:[[Special:Prefixindex/Template:Location map]] - another search that might help.

=== Creating new map definition templates ===

See [[Template:Location map/Creating a new map template|Creating a new map template]].

=== Examples ===

This example does not designate the &lt;code&gt;caption&lt;/code&gt; parameter. It demonstrates the use of the defaults. Notice that the default caption is the page name followed by the map name in parenthesis and that the label position is automatically adjusted if it is too close to an edge.

{{Location map+ | Australia
| places =
  {{Location map~ | Australia
    | label = Sydney
    | lat_deg = -33.86
    | lon_deg = 151.21 }}
  {{Location map~ | Australia
    | label = Melbourne
    | lat_deg = -37.81
    | lon_deg = 144.96 }}
}}
&lt;pre style=&quot;width:35em;&quot;&gt;
{{Location map+ | Australia
| places =

  {{Location map~ | Australia
    | label = Melbourne
    | lat_deg = -37.81
    | lon_deg = 144.96 }}
}}&lt;/pre&gt;

{{clear}}

This example uses a designated but empty &lt;code&gt;caption&lt;/code&gt;. It demonstrates coordinates using [[w:decimal degrees|decimal degrees]] and a 10px mark with a link.

&lt;!-- DOCUMENTATION --&gt;
This template generates a location map as a [[m:Help:composite images|composite image]] consisting of a map and a location mark. Optionally a label and caption can be added.

== Usage ==
Map image files are not accessed directly but by using an auxiliary map definition template. For example, if the first unnamed parameter supplied to this template is &quot;Japan&quot;, then this template uses the auxiliary template, &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Location map Japan}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; which contains the data needed to generate the composite image.

;Please note:
* Assigning any value to the parameter &lt;code&gt;caption&lt;/code&gt; causes the map to be displayed as a thumbnail image. If this parameter is not declared, the template will generate a default caption.
* The coordinates are not checked. If the coordinates specified fall outside the area covered by the map image, the location mark will not display inside the image, however, it may be displayed somewhere else on the page.
* Do not use '''&lt;code&gt;px&lt;/code&gt;'''. Using &lt;code&gt;width=200px&lt;/code&gt; will usually cause a very large map to be displayed. Use &lt;code&gt;width=200&lt;/code&gt;.
* To create a map with more than one location mark use {{tl|Location map+}}.

== Blank templates ==

== Parameters ==
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;width:100%;&quot;
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;background-color:lightblue&quot; | Map display parameters
|-
! Parameter
! Description
|-
| &lt;code&gt;{{{1}}}&lt;/code&gt;
| '''Required'''. Use the name of the map as the first unnamed parameter. For example, specify ''England'' to use the values in {{tl|Location map England}}. See the [[#Examples|examples]] below.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;width&lt;/code&gt;
| Determines the width of the map in [[w:pixel|pixel]]s. The default is 240. Do not include &lt;code&gt;px&lt;/code&gt;, for example: &lt;code&gt;width=300&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code&gt;width=300px&lt;/code&gt;.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;float&lt;/code&gt;
| Specifies the position of the map on the page. Valid values are &lt;code&gt;left&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;right&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;center&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;none&lt;/code&gt;. The default is &lt;code&gt;right&lt;/code&gt;''.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;border&lt;/code&gt;
|  Specifies the color of the 1px map border. The default is ''lightgrey'' (see [[w:Web colors|Web colors]]). If set to &lt;code&gt;none&lt;/code&gt;, no border will be generated. This parameter is seldom used.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;caption&lt;/code&gt;
| The text of a caption to be displayed below the map. Specifying a caption will cause the map to be displayed with a frame. If &lt;code&gt;caption&lt;/code&gt; is defined but is not assigned a value, the map will not be framed and no caption will be displayed. If &lt;code&gt;caption&lt;/code&gt; is not defined, the map will not be framed and a default caption will be generated. The default caption is created from the &lt;code&gt;label&lt;/code&gt; parameter (or the current page name if label not defined) and the &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; parameter from map definition template. See the [[#Examples|examples]] below.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;alt&lt;/code&gt;
| Alt text for map; used by screen readers.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;relief&lt;/code&gt;
| Any non-blank value (1, yes, etc.) will cause the template to display the map specified in the map definition template as &lt;code&gt;image1&lt;/code&gt;, which is usually a [[w:Relief mapping (computer graphics)|relief map]]. See the example at [[#Relief parameter|below]].
|-
| &lt;code&gt;AlternativeMap&lt;/code&gt;
| Allows the use of an alternative map. The image must have the same edge coordinates as the location map template. See the example [[#AlternativeMap parameter|below]].
|-
| &lt;code&gt;overlay_image&lt;/code&gt;
| Allows an overlay to be superimposed on the map. This parameter is seldom used.
|-
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; style=&quot;background-color:lightblue&quot; | Label and mark parameters
|-
! Parameter
! Description
|-
| &lt;code&gt;label&lt;/code&gt;
| The text of the label to display next to the mark. A wiki link can be used. The default if not specified is no label, just the marker.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;label_size&lt;/code&gt;
| The font size to use for the label, given as a percentage of the normal font size (&lt;100 = smaller, &gt;100 = larger). The default is 90. Do not include &lt;code&gt;%&lt;/code&gt;, for example: &lt;code&gt;label_size=80&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code&gt;label_size=80%&lt;/code&gt;.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;label_width&lt;/code&gt;
| The width to use for the label, given as an [[w:Em (typography)#CSS|em size]]. The default is 6. Do not include &lt;code&gt;em&lt;/code&gt;, for example: &lt;code&gt;label_width=7&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code&gt;label_width=7em&lt;/code&gt;.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;position&lt;/code&gt;
| The position of the label relative to the mark. Valid values are &lt;code&gt;left&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;right&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;top&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;bottom&lt;/code&gt;. The default is &lt;code&gt;right&lt;/code&gt;''.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;background&lt;/code&gt;
| The background color to use for the label. See [[w:Web colors|Web colors]]. The default is no background color, which shows the map image behind the label.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;mark&lt;/code&gt;
| The name of an image to display as the mark. The default is [[:File:Red pog.svg|Red pog.svg]] ([[File:Red pog.svg|8px]]). See examples at [[Commons:Location markers]] and [[Commons:Category:Map icons]].
|-
| &lt;code&gt;marksize&lt;/code&gt;
| The size of the mark in [[w:pixel|pixel]]s. The default is 8. Do not include &lt;code&gt;px&lt;/code&gt;, for example: &lt;code&gt;marksize=10&lt;/code&gt;, not &lt;code&gt;marksize=10px&lt;/code&gt;.

|-
| &lt;code&gt;lon_deg&lt;/code&gt;
| '''Required'''. The degrees of [[w:longitude|longitude]]. This value can be specified using [[w:decimal degrees|decimal degrees]] and when this format is used minutes and seconds should not be specified.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;lon_min&lt;/code&gt;
| The minutes of longitude.
|-
| &lt;code&gt;lon_sec&lt;/code&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Understanding map definition templates ==
{{expand}}

The {{tl|Location map}} family of templates utilize any one of a set of map definition templates. These are not forks but rather auxiliary templates and are must have names such as &quot;Location map ''location''&quot;, where ''location'' is the name of the area covered by the map. To create a simple map definition template using an image of a map with an [[w:equirectangular projection|equirectangular]] [[w:Mercator projection|Mercator projection]]:

# Create a new map image and upload it to [[commons:Main Page|Wikimedia commons]] or find an existing map on the same site.
# Create a template named Template:Location map ''location'', copy the content below into it and substitute the appropriate values.

As an example of a map that uses an equirectangular projection, we use {{tl|Location map Bosnia and Herzegovina}}. Please do not experiment using active templates.

&lt;pre style=&quot;width: 30em;&quot;&gt;
{{#switch:{{{1}}}
| name   = Bosnia and Herzegovina
| top    = 45.4
| bottom = 42.4
| left   = 15.5
| right  = 19.9
| image  = Bosnia and Herzegovina location map.svg
| image1 = Bosnia and Herzegovina relief location map.png
}}&lt;noinclude&gt;
{{Location map/Info}}
&lt;/noinclude&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;width: 50%;&quot;
! Parameter
! Description
|-
| &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;
| The name of the area covered
|-
| &lt;code&gt;top&lt;/code&gt;
| The latitude of the top edge of the image using [[w:decimal degrees|decimal degrees]]
|-
| &lt;code&gt;bottom&lt;/code&gt;
| The latitude of the bottom edge of the image
|-
| &lt;code&gt;left&lt;/code&gt;
| longitude of the left edges of the image
|-
| &lt;code&gt;right&lt;/code&gt;
| longitude of the right edges of the image
|-
| &lt;code&gt;image&lt;/code&gt;
| The name of the image file on Commons
|-
| &lt;code&gt;image1&lt;/code&gt;
| The name of an alternate image, usually a relief map that can be accessed using the &lt;code&gt;relief&lt;/code&gt; parameter.
|}

Maps of this type work will for small to mid sized areas. {{tl|Location map USA}} is another example of a map description template that uses an equirectangular projection. Notice that the image of the country is not what most would expect. 

Maps that use other projections, such as {{tl|Location map USA2}}, which uses an equidistant [[w:conic projection|conic projection]]. require formulas which are used to calculate the &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; coordinates for the location mark. Understanding these formulas requires a familiarity with the subject and is currently beyond the scope of this discussion. Note that the formula for &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to 0 for the left edge of the image and 100 for the right edge. Likewise, the formula for &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; evaluates to 0 for the top edge and 100 for the bottom edge.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;
This template displays values for the map templates such as {{tl|Location map Croatia}}. These templates are used by {{tl|Location map}} to obtain values such as the file name and the border coordinates of each location map.

=== Usage ===
;On a template page
&lt;pre&gt;
&lt;noinclude&gt;{{Location map/Info}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;
;On a documentation sup-page
&lt;pre&gt;
{{Location map/Info}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

====The &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; parameter====

The {{tl|Location map}} family of templates uses the value assigned to &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; to generate alt text. It is used to construct the sentence &quot;&lt;code&gt;label&lt;/code&gt; is located in &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt;&quot;. Assign a value to &lt;code&gt;&lt;name&gt;&lt;/code&gt; that fits in the sentence. For example:

:  Chicago is located in &lt;u&gt;the&lt;/u&gt; United States&lt;/u&gt;. So {{para|name|the United states}}.
:  Santo Domingo is located in &lt;u&gt;the&lt;/u&gt; Dominican Republic. So {{para|name|the Dominican Republic}}.

[[File:As-map.png|thumb|250px|Map of Australia]]

'''Template:Location map Australia''' is a location map definition used to overlay markers and labels on an [[w:equirectangular projection|equirectangular projection]] map of [[w:Australia|Australia]]. The markers are placed by [[w:latitude|latitude]] and [[w:longitude|longitude]] coordinates on the default map or a similar map image. 

== Usage ==
These definitions are used by the following templates when invoked with parameter &quot;Australia&quot;:
* {{tlx|Location map | Australia&amp;nbsp;| ...}}
* {{tlx|Location map+ | Australia&amp;nbsp;| ...}}
* {{tlx|Location map~ | Australia&amp;nbsp;| ...}}

== Map definition ==
* &lt;tt&gt;'''name''' = {{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|name}}&lt;/tt&gt;
*: Name used in the default map caption

* &lt;tt&gt;'''image''' = [[:File:{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|image}}|{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|image}}]]&lt;/tt&gt;
*: The default map image, without &quot;Image:&quot; or &quot;File:&quot;
{{#if:{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|image1}}|

* &lt;tt&gt;'''image1''' = [[:File:{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|image1}}|{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|image1}}]]&lt;/tt&gt;
*: An alternative map image, usually a relief map, can be displayed via the ''relief'' or ''AlternativeMap'' parameters
}}{{#if:{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|image2}}|

* &lt;tt&gt;'''image2''' = [[:File:{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|image2}}|{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|image2}}]]&lt;/tt&gt;
*: A second alternative map image, can be displayed via the ''AlternativeMap'' parameter only
}}{{#if:{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|top}}{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|bottom}}{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|left}}{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|right}}|

* &lt;tt&gt;'''top''' = {{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|top}}&lt;/tt&gt;
*: [[w:Latitude|Latitude]] at top edge of map, in [[w:decimal degrees|decimal degrees]]

* &lt;tt&gt;'''bottom''' = {{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|bottom}}&lt;/tt&gt;
*: Latitude at bottom edge of map, in decimal degrees

* &lt;tt&gt;'''left''' = {{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|left}}&lt;/tt&gt;
*: [[w:Longitude|Longitude]] at left edge of map, in decimal degrees

* &lt;tt&gt;'''right''' = {{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|right}}&lt;/tt&gt;
*: Longitude at right edge of map, in decimal degrees
}}{{#if:{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|x}}{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|y}}|

* &lt;tt&gt;'''x''' = {{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|x}}&lt;/tt&gt;
*: An expression to calculate a location on the map via its [[w:longitude|longitude]]; evaluates as 0 along the left edge and 100 along the right edge

* &lt;tt&gt;'''y''' = {{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|y}}&lt;/tt&gt;
*: An expression to calculate a location on the map via its [[w:latitude|latitude]]; evaluates as 0 along the top edge and 100 along the bottom edge
}}
{{#if:{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|image1}}|
== Alternative map ==
The map defined as '''image1''' (&lt;tt&gt;{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|image1}}&lt;/tt&gt;) can be displayed by using the ''relief'' or ''AlternativeMap'' parameters in {{tl|Location map}} and {{tl|Location map+}}. {{#if:{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|image2}}| The map defined as '''image2''' (&lt;tt&gt;{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|image2}}&lt;/tt&gt;) can only be displayed by using the ''AlternativeMap'' parameter.}} The use of these two parameters is shown in the examples below.

'''Template:Location map USA2''' is a location map definition used to overlay markers and labels on an [[w:equidistant conic projection|equidistant conic projection]] map of the [[w:United States|United States]]. The markers are placed by [[w:latitude|latitude]] and [[w:longitude|longitude]] coordinates on the default map or a similar map image. 

== Usage ==
These definitions are used by the following templates when invoked with parameter &quot;USA2&quot;:
* {{tlx|Location map | USA2&amp;nbsp;| ...}}
* {{tlx|Location map+ | USA2&amp;nbsp;| ...}}
* {{tlx|Location map~ | USA2&amp;nbsp;| ...}}

== Map definition ==
* &lt;tt&gt;'''name''' = {{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|name}}&lt;/tt&gt;
*: Name used in the default map caption

* &lt;tt&gt;'''image''' = [[:File:{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|image}}|{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|image}}]]&lt;/tt&gt;
*: The default map image, without &quot;Image:&quot; or &quot;File:&quot;

* &lt;tt&gt;'''image1''' = [[:File:{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|image1}}|{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|image1}}]]&lt;/tt&gt;
*: An alternative map image, usually a relief map, can be displayed via the ''relief'' or ''AlternativeMap'' parameters
{{#if:{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|image2}}|

* &lt;tt&gt;'''image2''' = [[:File:{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|image2}}|{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|image2}}]]&lt;/tt&gt;
*: A second alternative map image, can be displayed via the ''AlternativeMap'' parameter only
}}{{#if:{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|top}}{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|bottom}}{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|left}}{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|right}}|

* &lt;tt&gt;'''top''' = {{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|top}}&lt;/tt&gt;
*: [[Latitude]] at top edge of map, in [[decimal degrees]]

* &lt;tt&gt;'''bottom''' = {{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|bottom}}&lt;/tt&gt;
*: Latitude at bottom edge of map, in decimal degrees

* &lt;tt&gt;'''left''' = {{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|left}}&lt;/tt&gt;
*: [[Longitude]] at left edge of map, in decimal degrees

* &lt;tt&gt;'''right''' = {{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|right}}&lt;/tt&gt;
*: Longitude at right edge of map, in decimal degrees
}}{{#if:{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|x}}{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|y}}|

* &lt;tt&gt;'''x''' = {{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|x}}&lt;/tt&gt;
*: An expression to calculate a location on the map via its [[w:longitude|longitude]]; evaluates as 0 along the left edge and 100 along the right edge

* &lt;tt&gt;'''y''' = {{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|y}}&lt;/tt&gt;
*: An expression to calculate a location on the map via its [[w:latitude|latitude]]; evaluates as 0 along the top edge and 100 along the bottom edge
}}

== Alternative map ==
The map defined as '''image1''' (&lt;tt&gt;{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|image1}}&lt;/tt&gt;) can be displayed by using the ''relief'' or ''AlternativeMap'' parameters in {{tl|Location map}} and {{tl|Location map+}}. {{#if:{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|image2}}| The map defined as '''image2''' (&lt;tt&gt;{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|image2}}&lt;/tt&gt;) can only be displayed by using the ''AlternativeMap'' parameter.}} The use of these two parameters is shown in the examples below.

== Examples using location map templates ==

  {{Location map~ | USA2
  | label   = Seattle
  | lat_deg = 47.61
  | lon_deg = -122.33

== How to use an alternative map ==
This template normally displays the map shown above as '''image''':
*&lt;tt&gt;{{{{PAGENAME}}|image}}&lt;/tt&gt;.
The ''AlternativeMap'' parameter in [[Template:Location map]] can be used to display {{#if:{{{{PAGENAME}}|image2}}|one of the following images|the following image}}:
*&lt;tt&gt;{{{{PAGENAME}}|image1}}&lt;/tt&gt;
{{#if:{{{{PAGENAME}}|image2}}|
*&lt;tt&gt;{{{{PAGENAME}}|image2}}&lt;/tt&gt;
}}
Further instructions and examples can be found at [[Template:Location map#AlternativeMap parameter]].

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

'''Template:Location map Fiji''' is a location map definition used to overlay markers and labels on an [[w:equirectangular projection|equirectangular projection]] map of [[w:Fiji|Fiji]]. The markers are placed by [[w:latitude|latitude]] and [[w:longitude|longitude]] coordinates on the default map or a similar map image. 

== Usage ==
These definitions are used by the following templates when invoked with parameter &quot;Fiji&quot;:
* {{tlx|Location map | Fiji&amp;nbsp;| ...}}
* {{tlx|Location map+ | Fiji&amp;nbsp;| ...}}
* {{tlx|Location map~ | Fiji&amp;nbsp;| ...}}

== Map definition ==
; name
: used in default map caption (&lt;tt&gt;{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|name}}&lt;/tt&gt;)
; image
: the default map image, without &quot;Image:&quot; or &quot;File:&quot; (&lt;tt&gt;[[:File:{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|image}}|{{{{BASEPAGENAME}}|image}}]]&lt;/tt&gt;)
; x
: an expression to calculate a location on the map via its [[w:longitude|longitude]]; evaluates as 0 along the left edge and 100 along the right edge
; y
: an expression to calculate a location on the map via its [[w:latitude|latitude]]; evaluates as 0 along the top edge and 100 along the bottom edge

== Examples ==

==Multiple terms==
:Place the most recent terms at the top. When both a start and an end term are given, you can instead specify the complete term using using the parameters {{para|term}}, {{para|terms2}}, etc., as is done with {{para|term3}} in the example below. This can be helpful with complicated terms that cannot be given as simple starting or ending dates, or if you prefer something other than the default term separator (an en dash, with spaces around it if the start or end is not a simple integer date).

=== Usage ===
This template is used for displaying a date in both Old Style and New Style, including a discreet link to the article [[w:Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style and New Style dates]], in cases where the year is the same in both Styles.

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{OldStyleDate|NS day and month|year|OS day and month}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

If it helps you remember the order of the parameters, you may optionally choose to think of it like this:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{OldStyleDate|NS day and month|NS year|OS day and month|OS year}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

Note that in this usage the fourth parameter will be ''ignored'' when the template is rendered.

=== Examples ===
* Usage: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{OldStyleDate|2 February|1905|20 January}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
** Result: {{OldStyleDate|2 February|1905|20 January}}

* Usage: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{OldStyleDate|February 2|1905|January 20}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
** Result: {{OldStyleDate|February 2|1905|January 20}}

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This template can be used to create a formatted external link.

=== Usage ===
:* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{URL|&lt;/nowiki&gt;1=''url name''&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;2=''optional display text''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:** The first parameter is parsed to see if it takes the form of a complete URL. If it doesn't start with an known URI scheme and a slash (&quot;http:/&quot; or &quot;https:/&quot; or &quot;ftp:/&quot;, possibly others in the future, by editing its code), an &quot;http://&quot; prefix will be prepended to the specified generated target URL of the link.
:** If no display text is specified or is empty, a default display text will be inferred by trying to reduce the specified URL without its recognized URI scheme (without the default &quot;/&quot; path of HTTP and FTP resources), and the domain name part will be forced to lowercase (for shorter and canonical display, but also to limit the occurrences of easily confusable characters, for example between letters and digits). The rest of the URL (including the rest of its path, the optional query string or the specified anchor) will be displayed unchanged.
:* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{URL|&lt;/nowiki&gt;2=''display text''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:** The url or domain name is optional : if it is not specified in the first parameter or this parameter is empty, the display text becomes mandatory, and will be displayed without any change.
:** If both parameters are missing or empty, a default message referencing a correct usage of this template will be generated (including a link to this page), to help editors.

: '''Warning:'''
:* It is strongly advised to number the parameters explicitly (notably when the value of the URL is unknown, for example when this template is used in another template specifying the effective URL as a variable value), because many URLs contain an equal sign (in their query string). In that case, the second parameter for the displayed text, if present, '''must''' also be explicitly numbered ; otherwise it will override the value of the explicitly numbered first parameter.
:* If you specify a query string (starting by &quot;?&quot;, up to the end of the string or up to the first &quot;#&quot; character) or an anchor (starting by '&quot;#&quot; up to the end of the string) in the first parameter then you '''must''' specify at least the default path &quot;/&quot; immediately after the domain name ; otherwise the resulting link target will be unpredictable, as the query string and/or the anchor may be unexpectedly converted to all lowercase ; it is strongly recommended to use full and canonical URLs in the first parameter (without depending on the tentative detection of a missing URI scheme or path). Don't worry, this default &quot;/&quot; path won't be visible in the default display text.

== Microformat==
The template wraps the displayed URL with a &lt;code&gt;class=&quot;url&quot;&lt;/code&gt; so that it is included in any parent [[:w:microformat|microformat]] which takes a URL parameter - see [[Wikipedia:WikiProject Microformats|the microformat project]].

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

===Usage===
{{tl|Plainlist}} starts a plain, or unbulleted, list, such as:

{{plainlist|
*[[Cookbook:Appetizers|Appetizers]]
*[[Cookbook:Beverages|Beverages]]
*[[Cookbook:Bread Recipes|Bread]]
*[[Cookbook:Breakfast Recipes|Breakfast]]
*[[Cookbook:Confections|Confections]]
*[[Cookbook:Dessert|Desserts]]
*[[Cookbook:Meat Recipes|Meats]]
*[[Cookbook:Pasta Recipes|Pasta]]
*[[Cookbook:Rice Recipes|Rice]]
*[[Cookbook:Salad Recipes|Salads]]
}}

It uses proper HTML list markup, which is more standards-compliant and more accessible than separating list items with {{tag|br|s}}.

This template can be used with or without {{tl|endplainlist}}. It is an alternative to {{Tl|Unbulleted list}}, which performs the same function in a more concise but less wiki-style manner.

===Examples===
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{Plainlist |
*[[Cookbook:Appetizers|Appetizers]]
*[[Cookbook:Beverages|Beverages]]
*[[Cookbook:Bread Recipes|Bread]]
*[[Cookbook:Breakfast Recipes|Breakfast]]
*[[Cookbook:Confections|Confections]]
*[[Cookbook:Dessert|Desserts]]
*[[Cookbook:Meat Recipes|Meats]]
*[[Cookbook:Pasta Recipes|Pasta]]
*[[Cookbook:Rice Recipes|Rice]]
*[[Cookbook:Salad Recipes|Salads]]
}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

{{Plainlist |
*[[Cookbook:Appetizers|Appetizers]]
*[[Cookbook:Beverages|Beverages]]
*[[Cookbook:Bread Recipes|Bread]]
*[[Cookbook:Breakfast Recipes|Breakfast]]
*[[Cookbook:Confections|Confections]]
*[[Cookbook:Dessert|Desserts]]
*[[Cookbook:Meat Recipes|Meats]]
*[[Cookbook:Pasta Recipes|Pasta]]
*[[Cookbook:Rice Recipes|Rice]]
*[[Cookbook:Salad Recipes|Salads]]
}}

;Alternative syntax:
&lt;pre&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
{{Plainlist}}
*[[Cookbook:Appetizers|Appetizers]]
*[[Cookbook:Beverages|Beverages]]
*[[Cookbook:Bread Recipes|Bread]]
*[[Cookbook:Breakfast Recipes|Breakfast]]
*[[Cookbook:Confections|Confections]]
*[[Cookbook:Dessert|Desserts]]
*[[Cookbook:Meat Recipes|Meats]]
*[[Cookbook:Pasta Recipes|Pasta]]
*[[Cookbook:Rice Recipes|Rice]]
*[[Cookbook:Salad Recipes|Salads]]
{{endplainlist}}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

{{Plainlist}}
*[[Cookbook:Appetizers|Appetizers]]
*[[Cookbook:Beverages|Beverages]]
*[[Cookbook:Bread Recipes|Bread]]
*[[Cookbook:Breakfast Recipes|Breakfast]]
*[[Cookbook:Confections|Confections]]
*[[Cookbook:Dessert|Desserts]]
*[[Cookbook:Meat Recipes|Meats]]
*[[Cookbook:Pasta Recipes|Pasta]]
*[[Cookbook:Rice Recipes|Rice]]
*[[Cookbook:Salad Recipes|Salads]]
{{Endplainlist}}

===Parameters===
* '''indent''' – indents the list by a number of standard indents (one indent being 1.6em), particularly handy for inclusion in an indented discussion thread.
::Example: {{para|&lt;var&gt;indent&lt;/var&gt;|&lt;var&gt;2&lt;/var&gt;}}
* '''style''' – adds CSS style options.
::Example: {{para|&lt;var&gt;style&lt;/var&gt;|&lt;var&gt;border:solid 1px silver; background:lightyellow&lt;/var&gt;}}

===See also===
* {{tl|endplainlist}}
* {{tl|unbulleted list}}
* {{tl|flatlist}}

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

This template is used (primarily in infoboxes) to create unbulleted lists using the correct HTML mark-up using CSS to hide the bullets. Up to 50 entries are supported. Each item in the list may have styles added to it individually, by appending a numbered parameter. The parameter &lt;tt&gt;li_style1&lt;/tt&gt; formats the first item, &lt;tt&gt;li_style2&lt;/tt&gt; the second, and so on.

=== Usage ===
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Unbulleted list|entry1|entry2|entry3}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Unbulleted list|entry1|entry2|entry3|li_style1=css-style-a;css-style-b;|li_style3=css-style-x;css-style-y;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

{{Coord how-to}}

__TOC__
==Purpose==
{{Tl|Coord}} provides a standard notation for encoding locations by their [[w:latitude|latitude]] and [[w:longitude|longitude]] coordinates. It is primarily for specifying the [[w:World Geodetic System|WGS84]] geographic coordinates of locations on [[w:Earth|Earth]], at the same time emitting a machine-readable [[w:Geo (microformat)|Geo microformat]]. However, it can also encode locations on natural satellites, dwarf planets, and planets other than Earth.

==Features==
Latitude and longitude may be specified (with appropriate precision) either in decimal notation or as degrees/minutes/seconds.  By default, coordinates appear in the format used to specify them.  However, the &lt;code&gt;format=&lt;/code&gt; parameter can be used to force display in a particular format. 

The template displays the formatted coordinates with a [[w:hyperlink|hyperlink]] to [[tswiki:GeoHack|GeoHack]]. GeoHack displays information customized to the location, including links to external mapping services.

For [[w:Earth|terrestrial]] locations, a blue globe ([[File:Erioll_world.svg|18px|link=|alt=]]) appears to the left of the hyperlink.  Clicking on the globe activates the [[:meta:WikiMiniAtlas|WikiMiniAtlas]] (requires [[JavaScript]]).

By default, coordinates appear &quot;in line&quot; with the adjacent text.  However, the &lt;code&gt;display=&lt;/code&gt; parameter can be used to move the coordinates up near the page title—or display them in both places at once.

The template outputs coordinates in three formats:
* Degree/minutes/seconds (&quot;DMS&quot;, precision is degrees, or degrees/minutes, or degrees/minutes/seconds, based on input precision).
* Decimal degrees (varying the number of decimal places based on input precision)
* A machine readable [[w:Geo (microformat)|Geo microformat]].

Logged-in users can customize how coordinates appear in their browsers.

== Usage ==
 '''&amp;#123;{coord|'''''latitude'''''|'''''longitude'''''|'''''[[#1|coordinate parameters]]'''''|'''''[[#2|template parameters]]'''''}&amp;#125;'''
 '''&amp;#123;{coord|'''''dd'''''|'''''N/S'''''|'''''dd'''''|'''''E/W'''''|'''''[[#1|coordinate parameters]]'''''|'''''[[#2|template parameters]]'''''}&amp;#125;'''
 '''&amp;#123;{coord|'''''dd'''''|'''''mm'''''|'''''N/S'''''|'''''dd'''''|'''''mm'''''|'''''E/W'''''|'''''[[#1|coordinate parameters]]'''''|'''''[[#2|template parameters]]'''''}&amp;#125;'''
 '''&amp;#123;{coord|'''''dd'''''|'''''mm'''''|'''''ss'''''|'''''N/S'''''|'''''dd'''''|'''''mm'''''|'''''ss'''''|'''''E/W'''''|'''''[[#1|coordinate parameters]]'''''|'''''[[#2|template parameters]]'''''}&amp;#125;'''

The hemisphere identifiers (''N/S'') and (''E/W''), if used, must be adjacent to the enclosing pipe &quot;'''&lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt;'''&quot; characters, and cannot be preceded or succeeded by spaces.

There are two kinds of parameters, all optional:

*&lt;span id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;'''Coordinate parameters'''&lt;/span&gt; are parameters that {{tl|Coord}} passes to the map server. These have the format ''parameter:value'' and are separated from each other by the underscore character ( _ ). The supported coordinate parameters are ''dim:'', ''globe:'', ''region:'', ''scale:'', ''source:'', and ''type:''. See [[#Coordinate parameters|coordinate parameters]] for details and examples.

*&lt;span id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;'''Template parameters'''&lt;/span&gt; are parameters used by the {{tl|Coord}} template.  These have format ''parameter=value'' and are separated from each other by the pipe character ( | ). The supported template parameters are ''display='', ''format='', ''name='', and ''notes=''.
:* '''display=''' can be one of the following:
::* &lt;code&gt;display=inline&lt;/code&gt; – Display the coordinate inline (default)
::* &lt;code&gt;display=title&lt;/code&gt; – Display the coordinate near the page title
::** shortcut: &lt;code&gt;display=t&lt;/code&gt;
::* &lt;code&gt;display=inline,title&lt;/code&gt; – Display the coordinate both inline and at title
::** shortcut: &lt;code&gt;display=it&lt;/code&gt;
::* &lt;code&gt;display=title,inline&lt;/code&gt; has the same effect as &lt;code&gt;display=inline,title&lt;/code&gt;
::Note: the &lt;code&gt;title&lt;/code&gt; attribute indicates that the coordinates apply to the entire page, and not just one of (perhaps many) places mentioned in it &amp;mdash; so it should only be omitted in the latter case. 
:* '''format=''' can be used to force ''dec'' or ''dms'' coordinate display.
::* &lt;code&gt;format=dec&lt;/code&gt; reformats the coordinates to &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;decimal degrees&lt;/span&gt; format.
::* &lt;code&gt;format=dms&lt;/code&gt; reformats the coordinates to &lt;span style=&quot;text-decoration:underline;&quot;&gt;degrees | minutes | seconds&lt;/span&gt; format.
:* '''name=''' can be used to annotate inline coordinates for display in map services such as the [[:meta:WikiMiniAtlas|WikiMiniAtlas]]. If omitted, the article title (PAGENAME) is assumed.
::Note: a ''name='' parameter causes {{tl|Coord}} to emit an [[w:hCard|hCard]] [[w:microformat|microformat]] using that name, ''even if used within an existing hCard''. Do not use when the name is that of a person (e.g for a gravesite), as the generated hCard would be invalid. Also, do not use square brackets in names.
:* '''notes=''' specifies text to be displayed immediately following the coordinates.  This is primarily intended for adding footnotes to title coordinates.

== Coordinate parameters ==
The first unnamed parameter following the longitude is an optional string of coordinate parameters, separated by underscores. These parameters help [[tswiki:GeoHack|GeoHack]] select suitable map resources, and they will become more important when [[m:Wikimaps|Wikimaps]] becomes fully functional.

=== type:''T'' ===
{{Coord-doc-type}}

=== scale:''N'' ===
{{Coord-doc-scale}}

=== dim:''D'' ===
{{Coord-doc-dim}}

=== region:''R'' ===
{{Coord-doc-region}}

=== globe:''G'' ===
{{Coord-doc-globe}}

=== source:''S'' ===
{{Coord-doc-source}}

==Per-user display customization==
{{UF-coord-classes}}

==Internals==
===Subtemplates===
{{Coord/sub doc}}

===Class names===
The class names '''geo''', '''latitude''' and '''longitude''' are used to generate the microformat and '''MUST NOT''' be changed.

| To add {{Coord|57|18|22.5|N|4|27|32.7|W}} to the top of a page, use {{Tl|Coord}}, thus:
:'''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Coord|57|18|22.5|N|4|27|32.7|W|display=title}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''
These [[w:Geographic coordinate system|coordinates]] are in [[w:Degree (angle)|degrees]], [[w:Minute of arc|minutes]], and seconds of arc.
|-
| To add {{Coord|44.112|N|87.913|W}} to the top of a page, use either 
:'''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Coord|44.112|N|87.913|W|display=title}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''
''or''
:'''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Coord|44.112|-87.913|display=title}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''
These coordinates are in [[w:Decimal fraction|decimal]] degrees.
|-
|
* Degrees, minutes and seconds must be separated by [[w:Vertical bar|a pipe (&quot;|&quot;)]].
* [[w:Geodetic system|Map datum]] must be WGS84 (except for off-earth bodies).
* Avoid excessive precision (0.0001° is &lt;11 m, 1″ is &lt;31 m).
* Latitude (N/S) must appear before longitude (E/W).
|-
|Optional coordinate parameters follow the longitude and are separated by [[w:Underscore|an underscore (&quot;_&quot;)]]:&lt;br /&gt;
*[[Template:Coord#dim:D|dim]]: &lt;code&gt;dim:&lt;/code&gt;'''''N''''' (viewing diameter in metres)
*[[Template:Coord#region:R|region]]: &lt;code&gt;region:&lt;/code&gt;'''''R''''' ([[w:ISO 3166-1 alpha-2|ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] or [[w:ISO 3166-2|ISO 3166-2]] code)
*[[Template:Coord#type:T|type]]: &lt;code&gt;type:&lt;/code&gt;'''''T''''' (&lt;code&gt;landmark&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;city(30,000)&lt;/code&gt;, for example)

Other optional parameters are separated by [[w:Vertical bar|a pipe (&quot;|&quot;)]]:&lt;br /&gt;
*[[Template:Coord#Display|display]]
*: {{Para|display|inline}} (the default) to display in the body of the page only,
*: {{Para|display|title}} to display in the title only, or
*: {{Para|display|inline,title}} to display in both places.
*[[Template:Coord#Name|name]]
*: &lt;code&gt;name=&lt;/code&gt;'''''X''''' to label the place on maps (default is [[mw:Help:Magic words#Page names|PAGENAME]])
Thus: '''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Coord|44.117|-87.913|dim:30_region:US-WI_type:event&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''
::'''&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|display=inline,title|name=accident site}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;'''

Use {{Para|display|title}} (or {{Para|display|inline,title}}) once per page, for the subject of the page, where appropriate.

For globes other than Earth, {{tl|coord}} does not assume a specific reference system (in contrast with Earth's WGS84).  Since the template defaults to east longitude, the &lt;code&gt;|W|&lt;/code&gt; direction must be specified for globes that measure longitude westward.  At the present time, only limited mapping is available for Mars and the Moon and none for other extraterrestrial bodies.&lt;noinclude&gt;[[Category:Template namespace templates|{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;/noinclude&gt;</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The &lt;code&gt;region:&lt;/code&gt; parameter specifies the political region for terrestrial coordinates.  It is used to select appropriate map resources. If no &lt;code&gt;region:&lt;/code&gt; parameter is provided, [[tswiki:GeoHack|GeoHack]] attempts to determine the region from the coordinates.

The region should be supplied as either a two character [[w:ISO 3166-1 alpha-2|ISO 3166-1 alpha-2]] country code or an [[w:ISO 3166-2|ISO 3166-2]] region code.

* '''DE-TH''' [[w:Thuringia|Thuringia]]
* '''US-NY''' [[w:New York|New York state]]

The oceans have the following Wiki assigned code elements:
* '''XN''' Arctic Ocean
* '''XA''' Atlantic Ocean
* '''XI''' Indian Ocean
* '''XP''' Pacific Ocean
* '''XS''' Southern Ocean

In addition, two Wiki assigned code elements can be used with {{tl|coord}}:
* '''XZ''' for objects in or above international waters (similar to [[w:UN/LOCODE|UN/LOCODE]]).
* '''ZZ''' for use in examples.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Specifies, where present, the data source and data source format/datum, and optionally the original data, presented in parentheses. This is initially primarily intended for use by geotagging robots, so that data is not blindly repeatedly copied from format to format and Wikibooks to Wikibooks, with progressive loss of precision and attributability.

Examples:
* A lat/long geotag derived from a [[w:Ordnance Survey|Ordnance Survey]] [[w:British national grid reference system|National Grid Reference]] NM&amp;nbsp;435&amp;nbsp;355 found in the English-language Wikibooks would be tagged as &quot;source:enwikibooks-osgb36(NM435355)&quot;
* A latitude-longitude location sourced from data taken from the German-language Wikibooks would be tagged as &quot;source:dewikibooks&quot; – and so on, for other language codes;
* A location sourced from the public domain [[w:GEOnet Names Server|GeoNet Names Server]] database would be tagged as &quot;source:GNS&quot;. No datum or format information is needed, since by default all Wikibooks coordinates are in latitude/longitude format based on the [[w:World Geodetic System|WGS84]] datum. Similarly, US locations sourced from the similar public domain [[w:Geographic Names Information System|GNIS]] database would be tagged as &quot;source:GNIS&quot;.&lt;noinclude&gt;[[Category:Template namespace templates|{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;/noinclude&gt;</text>

If no &lt;code&gt;dim:&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;type:&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;scale:&lt;/code&gt; parameters are provided, GeoHack uses its default viewing circle of {{convert|30|km|mi}}.

&lt;!-- BE CAREFUL WITH COPY PASTING
HTMLTidy moves our whitespace around. We use &amp;#xfeff; (unicode zero width no break space/BOM) to force a space char at the end or beginning of a span to stay where it is, and this character gets lost in copypasting. This is a deprecated unicode character for these purposes, but it is the only method that works consistently around all browsers (opposed to #x2060 and #x200b).

This template, {{tl|Coord/link}}, is used by {{tl|Coord}}.

=== Examples ===
&lt;table class=&quot;wikitable&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;#123;{coord|10|N|30|W}}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;{{coord|10|N|30|W}}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;#123;{coord|10|11|N|30|31|W}}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;{{coord|10|11|N|30|31|W}}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;&amp;#123;{coord|10|11|12|N|30|31|32|W}}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;{{coord|10|11|12|N|30|31|32|W}}&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

=== Notes on classes===
Note: the span classes &quot;geo-default&quot;, &quot;geo-dec&quot;, and &quot;geo-dms&quot; are defined at [[MediaWiki:Common.css]].  

In addition, &quot;geo&quot; and the nested &quot;latitude&quot; and &quot;longitude&quot; have special meaning as a [[w:Geo (microformat)|Geo microformat]] and so might also be used by other templates; see also http://microformats.org/wiki/geo.

===Usage===
Adds zeros to the end of ''new'' until it is the same as the negative ''original'' without its sign. Used with functions that have done ''new''=abs(''original'') and lost precision.

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Coord/negzeropad|original|new}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

===Example===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Coord/negzeropad|-1.200|1.2}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; becomes {{Coord/negzeropad|-1.200|1.2}}&lt;includeonly&gt;[[Category:Template subpages|{{PAGENAME}}]]&lt;/includeonly&gt;</text>

--NOTES:
--    [ These comments are skipped by &lt;noinclude&gt; and not send
--      inside formatted Internet pages, only during edit. ]
--
--NOTE A1: This template determines the precision of decimals
--     by counting the length of the numeric string (in a
--     #switch comparing lengths of padded strings), then
--     subtracting integer length, minus the decimal point,
--     and minus 1 if negative. For integers, 1 place is
--     subtracted for each trailing 0 on the integer.
--     For fractions, any prior count is cleared x 0, then
--     size is logarithm of denominator divided by logn 10:
--     (..prior...)*0 + floor(logn denom / logn 10 - .01) + 1.
--
--NOTE D2: The check, for whole integers, compares the amount
--     versus appending &quot;0&quot; at the end: when the amount is a
--     decimal, then the value is unchanged by appending 0 at
--     the end: so 5.23 = 5.230 is true, whereas for whole
--     integers, it would be: 5 = 50 as false, due to values
--     becoming n*10 for integer n. So, for integer n, the
--     check rejects: n = n0 as false; hence n is integer.
--
--NOTE M3: The magnitude of the integer portion is calculated
--     by logarithm of the floor of absolute value (divided by
--     [[natural logarithm]] of 10 to adjust for e=2.71828*),
--     as: ln (floor( abs({{{1|-0.050067}}}) )+0.99 )/ln10
--     Function floor(x) trims the decimal part, to leave the
--     whole count: 0-9 yield 0, 10-19 as 1, 1000-1999 as 3.
--     The abs(x) avoids floor of negatives, floor(-0.1)= -1,
--     hence using abs(x) ensures -0.1 floors to 0 not -1.
--     Near zero, the +0.99 avoids invalid log of 0, but does
--     not round-up any decimals, already floored as nnn.00.
--     Complexity is 6 operations: floor of abs( {1} ) +0.99
--     then logn div logn10, then floor that logarithm ratio.
--     Decimals -1 &lt; x &lt; 1 yield -1, avoiding log 0.001 = -3.
--
--NOTE N4: Nesting of if-else and nested templates is kept to
--     a minimum, due to the MediaWiki 1.6 limit of 40 levels
--     of if-logic for all nested templates used together.
--     Template {ordomag} was omitted to avoid 2 more levels
--     of nested templates. Template {Precision} had 8 levels,
--     and this template was trimmed to only 5 levels.
--
--NOTE S5: The #switch is run with &quot;x&quot; prepended in front of
--     the amount, otherwise a #switch will compare as numeric
--     where 2 would match &quot;2.0&quot; even though &quot;2&quot; is length 1.
--     So &quot;x2&quot; won't match &quot;x2.0&quot; in non-numeric comparison.
--     The #switch will exit on the first match, so smaller
--     lengths are compared first, to avoid extra comparisons
--     for more rare, longer numeric strings up to 41 long.
--
--NOTE W6: The check for integers with whole end-zeroes uses
--     typical n=n/10*10, for each power of 10, where whole
--     millions match: {{#ifexpr: {1}=floor( {1}/1E6 )*1E6| }}
--     Previously, {Precision} had tried to use &quot;round&quot; to
--     detect end-zeroes but &quot;round&quot; loses precision at -5,
--     so, n00000 round -5 differs from n00000 slightly, and
--     comparisons to exact rounded amounts failed to match
--     some numbers when 6 or more zeroes &quot;n000000&quot;.
--
--NOTE Z7: The check on zero for any .00000 compares adding 1
--     to the amount, versus appending &quot;1&quot; at the end: if the
--     amount is a decimal, then adding 1 will be larger than
--     appending 1 at the end: 0.00 + 1 &gt; 0.001, whereas for
--     whole zero, it would be: 0+1 &gt; 01 as false, due to the
--     value being the same. So, for integer 0, the check
--     rejects: 0+1 &gt; 01 as false; hence whole 0 is integer.

-- WARNING: *** DO NOT DELETE COMMENTS FROM THIS TEMPLATE ***
--      Unless these comments are readily available, people
--      might tinker with the coding (or rename templates),

__NOTOC__
This template determines the precision (as a count of decimal digits) for any amount, large or negative, using
a fast algorithm. It can also handle a trailing decimal point (such
as &quot;15.&quot; or &quot;-41.&quot;) or trailing zeroes (such as &quot;15.34000&quot; having precision as 5 decimal digits).  For fractional input it returns the base ten logarithm of the numerator.

&lt;!--For a number in ordinary decimal notation with a decimal point, this template determines the number of digits after the point. It is a measure for the precision implied by the notation.

For multiples of non-negative powers of 10 the negative of the exponent is returned. Note however that zeros do not necessarily indicate precision, a precise number can happen to be a multiple of a power of 10.

Note that floating point values have a maximum number of digits total, so 1111111111.11111111 is equivalent to 1111111111.1111111 (one less digit after decimal point), so the output of &amp;#123;{precision}&amp;#125; for both of those is 7.

===Known bugs===
* For numbers in scientific notation, the precision is typically returned as too low by 1 decimal place. Example: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{precision |7.1234E+06}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; &amp;rarr; {{precision|7.1234E+06}} (should be precision as 4 decimal digits, not 3).
* Large numbers are limited to 11 trailing zeroes, so even larger numbers still report precision as being -11, such as 9 trillion: {&amp;#123;precision|9000000000000}} &amp;rarr; {{precision|9000000000000}} (should be: -12).

===Technical notes===
*NOTE A1: This template determines the precision of decimals by counting the length of the numeric string (in a #switch comparing lengths of padded strings), then subtracting integer length, minus the decimal point, and minus 1 if negative. For integers, 1 place is subtracted for each trailing 0 on the integer. For fractions, any prior count is cleared x 0, then returns the base ten logarithm of denominator: (..prior...)*0 + (ln denom / ln 10).
*NOTE D2: The check, for whole integers, compares the amount versus appending &quot;0&quot; at the end: when the amount is a decimal, then the value is unchanged by appending 0 at the end: so 5.23 = 5.230 is true, whereas for whole integers, it would be: 5 = 50 as false, due to values becoming n*10 for integer n. So, for integer n, the check rejects: n = n0 as false; hence n is integer.
*NOTE M3: The magnitude of the integer portion is calculated by logarithm of the floor of absolute value (divided by [[w:natural logarithm|natural logarithm]] of 10 to adjust for e=2.71828*), as: ln (floor( abs({{{1|-0.050067}}}) )+0.99 )/ln10 Function floor(x) trims the decimal part, to leave the whole count: 0-9 yield 0, 10-19 as 1, 1000-1999 as 3. The abs(x) avoids floor of negatives, floor(-0.1)= -1, hence using abs(x) ensures -0.1 floors to 0 not -1. Near zero, the +0.99 avoids invalid log of 0, but does not round-up any decimals, already floored as nnn.00. Complexity is 6 operations: floor of abs( {1} ) +0.99 then log&lt;sub&gt;10&lt;/sub&gt;''x'' (ln''x'' ÷ ln10), then floor that logarithm ratio. Decimals -1 &lt; x &lt; 1 yield -1, avoiding log 0.001 = -3.
*NOTE N4: Nesting of if-else and nested templates is kept to a minimum, due to the MediaWiki 1.6 limit of 40 levels of if-logic for all nested templates used together. Template {ordomag} was omitted to avoid 2 more levels of nested templates. Template {Precision} had 8 levels, and this template was trimmed to only 5 levels.
*NOTE S5: The #switch is run with &quot;x&quot; prepended in front of the amount, otherwise a #switch will compare as numeric where &quot;2&quot; would match &quot;2.0&quot; even though &quot;2&quot; is length 1 so &quot;x2&quot; no longer matches with &quot;x2.0&quot; as non-numeric. The #switch will exit on the first match, so smaller lengths are compared first, to avoid extra comparisons for more rare, longer numeric strings up to 41 long.
*NOTE W6: The check for integers with whole end-zeroes uses typical n=n/10*10, for each power of 10, where whole millions match: &lt;nowiki&gt;{{#ifexpr: {1}=floor( {1}/1E6 )*1E6| }}&lt;/nowiki&gt; Previously, {Precision} had tried to use &quot;round&quot; to detect end-zeroes but &quot;round&quot; loses precision at -5, so, n00000 round -5 differs from n00000 slightly, and comparisons to exact rounded amounts failed to match some numbers when 6 or more zeroes &quot;n000000&quot;.
*NOTE Z7: The check on zero for any .00000 compares adding 1 to the amount, versus appending &quot;1&quot; at the end: if the amount is a decimal, then adding 1 will be larger than appending 1 at the end: 0.00 + 1 &gt; 0.001, whereas for whole zero, it would be: 0+1 &gt; 01 as false, due to the value being the same. So, for integer 0, the check rejects: 0+1 &gt; 01 as false; hence whole 0 is integer.

{{tl|precision/mini}} is very similar to {{tl|precision}}, but the output range is only 0 to 6.  Thus the functionality of {{tl|precision/mini}} is a subset of the functionality of {{tl|precision}} but the advantage is that the template code is much shorter.  It is useful when one has to be cautious of template limits.

=== Examples ===
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Precision/mini|111.12345678}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; || {{Precision/mini|111.12345678}}

| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Precision/mini|111.1234567}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; || {{Precision/mini|111.1234567}}
|-
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Precision/mini|111.123456}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; || {{Precision/mini|111.123456}}
|-
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Precision/mini|111.12345}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; || {{Precision/mini|111.12345}}

Given a decimal coordinate, two cardinal directions, and precision, render a coordinate in degrees/minutes/seconds.

=== Usage ===
 &amp;#123;{coord/dec2dms|''coord''|N|S|''precision''}}
 &amp;#123;{coord/dec2dms|''coord''|E|W|''precision''}}

Precision codes:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
| d || Degrees (rounded to integer)
|-
| d1 || Degrees (rounded to 0.1 degrees)
|-
| dm || Degrees, minutes (rounded to integer)
|-
| dm1 || Degrees, minutes (rounded to 0.1 minutes)
|-
| dms || Degrees, minutes, seconds (rounded to integer)
|-
| dms1 || Degrees, minutes, seconds (rounded to 0.1 seconds)
|}

=== Examples ===
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
| &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Coord/dec2dms|10.391944|N|S|d}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;    || {{Coord/dec2dms|10.391944|N|S|d}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Origins ==
In the 1950s, decision theorists were beginning to face difficulties in applying the ambiguous rationality postulate to more complicated decision problems.  In response, Herbert Simon developed the notion of “bounded rationality.”  Bounded rationality, as Simon describes, demonstrates the limit of rationality due to lack of information, intellectual ability, and definite amounts of time.  He developed this notion from the fusion of substantive rationality (decisions made due to “total preference ordering” and the principal of individual rationality) and procedural rationality (decisions made by following a specific set of rules or procedures).&lt;ref name=&quot;roy&quot;&gt; Radner, Roy. &quot;Satisficing.&quot; ''Journal of Mathematical Economics''. 2. (1975): 253-262. Web. 6 May. 2012. &lt;http://pages.stern.nyu.edu/~rradner/publishedpapers/34Satisficing.pdf&gt;. Max vs. Satisficing &lt;/ref&gt;

With the background of bounded rationality, the term “satisficing” was developed as an alternative to optimization.  Simon describes the need for satisficing:

“Because real-world optimization, with or without computers, is impossible, the real economic actor is in fact a satisficer, a person who accepts ‘good enough’ alternatives, not because less is preferred to more, but because there is no choice.” &lt;ref name=&quot;W&quot;&gt; Stirling, Wynn. ''Satisficing Games and Decision Making: With Applications to Engineering and Computer Science''. 1. Cambridge: The Press Syndicate of the University of Cambridge, 2003. 1-28. Web. &lt;http://bilder.buecher.de/zusatz/24/24280/24280972_lese_1.pdf&gt;. &lt;/ref&gt;

Simon believed that the goal of optimization (or maximizing) was virtually always unachievable in real life.&lt;ref name=&quot;B&quot;&gt; Schwartz, Barry, Andrew Ward, et al. &quot;Maximizing Versus Satisficing: Happiness Is a Matter of Choice.&quot; ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology''. 83.5 (2002): 1178-1197. Web. 6 May. 2012. &lt;http://dtserv2.compsy.uni-jena.de/ss2008/allgpsy_uj/80198328/content.nsf/Pages/1C596D0306A714AAC1257434003D959A/$FILE/schwartz et al. 2002 jpsp.pdf&gt;. &lt;/ref&gt; The term “satisficing” was created by Simon in 1956 to describe this theory of choice that determined the role of alternatives in decision making.&lt;ref name=&quot;W&quot; /&gt; Simon ultimately believed that satisficing was a more accurate depiction of choice theory maximization.&lt;ref name=&quot;B&quot; /&gt;

== Definition ==

Investopedia describes satisficing as a “decision-making strategy that aims for a satisfactory or adequate result, rather than the optimal solution. This is because aiming for the optimal solution may necessitate needless expenditure of time, energy and resources.”&lt;ref name=&quot;I&quot;&gt; &quot;Satisficing Definition.&quot; ''Investopedia''. N.p., 2012. Web. 6 May 2012. &lt;http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/satisficing.asp &lt;/ref&gt;

== Meaning ==

In order to satisfice, people “need only to be able to place goods on some scale in terms of the degree of satisfaction they will afford, and to have a threshold of acceptability.”&lt;ref name=&quot;B&quot; /&gt; A satisficer continually subjects his or her judgment on a variety of goods until one comes across that exceeds the “acceptability threshold,” and the good is then chosen.  Because the satisficer is constantly evaluating new goods, he or she may find a second good that achieves a higher utility than the first; and in response, the satisficer replaces the latter for the former.  Therefore, the satisficer always strives to achieve maximization without it ever being the explicit goal, nor ever being able to truly achieve maximization.&lt;ref name=&quot;B&quot; /&gt;

Therefore, satisficing, in many instances, can be translated to mean “an approximation to being best,” or more commonly, “good enough.”&lt;ref name=&quot;W&quot; /&gt; Because full optimization is virtually impossible in the real world, consumers are left to find choices that are good enough to fulfill their needs.

== Applications ==

The satisficing theory pertains to many applications in a variety of fields aside from economics--including, but not being limited to, artificial intelligence and sociology.&lt;ref name=&quot;I&quot; /&gt; Currently, a lot of research is being dedicated to the “design and implementation of artificial social systems.”&lt;ref name=&quot;W&quot; /&gt; In the modern world--where computers are constantly evolving to become more efficient, precise, and effective--it is inevitable that artificial systems will increasingly function analogously to humans.&lt;ref name=&quot;W&quot; /&gt;  Computers will continually undertake the tasks that human workers execute as even complex computer labor becomes cheaper and more readily available.

One of the most common outlets of artificial intelligence (i.e. computers and other technology) for civilian consumers is security.  Many corporations and organizations are increasingly deciding to use technology as a substitute for hiring people for quality security measures. Human workers may ultimately be more capable of accomplishing the task at hand, but humans must be continually paid and take breaks; whereas, computers are purchased once and can work twenty four hours a day.  Therefore, the organization may choose to satisfice: when confronted with a variety of choices to fill a need, the organization decides to buy a computer system instead of hiring employees.&lt;ref name=&quot;I&quot; /&gt; Although the computer may not be completely equipped to handle the most difficult situation, the consumer decides that the computer is “good enough” for the money that is required to purchase it.  Although there is a trade-off in purchasing the full amount for the computer system at one time verses continually paying employees, the consumer may decide that the trade-off is worth it.

:Example: The owner of a casino needs to achieve the task of obtaining adequate facial recognition software for surveillance to detect any unusual :behavior exhibited by gamblers.  The owner has multiple options, of which include buying a computer system that constantly surveys the casino, or :hiring a team of people to survey the various cameras throughout the casino.  Hiring a team of human workers for surveillance takes time and :resources, while buying a computer system to work in conjunction with an already established security technology is faster and cheaper. Instead :of taking the time, energy, and money to interview a variety of potential candidates, the owner decides to buy the computer software to expedite :the process.  The owner may acknowledge that the technology has its limits in comparison to those employees that would be able to think for :themselves with ingenuity, but the owner decides to satisfice and choose the computer software to get the job done.

== Description ==
[[File:Trust Game -- 1st Move.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|1st Move of the Trust Game, Y is an Amount of Money.]]
In the trust game, like the ultimatum game and the dictator game, there are two participants that are anonymously paired.&lt;ref&gt;Brulhart&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these individuals are given some quantity of money. The first individual, or player, is told that he must send some amount of his money to an anonymous second player, though the amount sent may be zero. The first player is also informed that whatever he sends will be tripled by the experimenter.&lt;ref&gt;Berg 123&lt;/ref&gt; So, when the first player chooses a value, the experimenter will take it, triple it, and give that money to the second player. The second player is then told to make a similar choice – give some amount of the now-tripled money back to the first player, even if that amount is zero.&lt;ref&gt;Brulhart&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berg 123-124&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Trust Game -- 2nd Move.jpg|upright=1.5|thumb|2nd Move of the Trust Game, Y is an Amount of Money.]]

== Predicted Results ==
	Under standard economic assumptions of rational self-interest, the predicted actions of the first player in the trust game will be that he will choose to send nothing. Even with perfect information about the mechanics of the game, the first player option to send nothing (and thus the second player option to send nothing back) is the Nash equilibrium for the game.&lt;ref&gt;Berg 123&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

== Actual Results ==
In the original Berg et al. experiment, thirty out of thirty-two game trials resulted in a violation of the results predicted by standard economic theory. In these thirty cases, first players sent money that averaged slightly over fifty percent of their original endowment.&lt;ref&gt;Berg 123&lt;/ref&gt; Additional runs of this game by Brulhart showed similar results on the part of the first player, with only 11% of first players acting selfishly and giving nothing. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The results of the second players, in response to the non-zero transfers of the first players, were more varied in the above experiments. In the Berg et al. experiment, the amount reciprocated heavily depended on the level of social information the experimenters gave the second player about the first. However, no matter what information the experimenters gave, the average amount returned to the first player by the second was in excess of the amount originally sent.&lt;ref&gt;Berg 134-135&lt;/ref&gt; In the Brulhart experiment, the average money returned was also more than what was sent, with only 20% of the second players returning nothing.&lt;ref&gt;Brulhart&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In these experiments, the actual results of both the first and second players differed sharply from those results predicted under the standard economic assumption of pure self-interest.

== Explanations ==
Despite these results apparently contradicting the economic notion of rational self-interest, there are explanations of the results that preserve this notion. If he is acting under rational self-interest, a first player who decides to give anything to the second player must be expecting a positive return on his risk.&lt;ref&gt;Berg 123-124&lt;/ref&gt; One way for a first player to develop this expectation would be if the experimenter ran multiple trials of the game between the same two players, in order to build a reputation of the trustworthiness of the second player in the mind of the first. Then, the first player giving money to the second might be rationally self-interest, if he found the second player reliable enough to reciprocate. But, as the majority of first players send money to the second, even on the first run of the game, an alternative explanation to the results is needed. 

An alternative approach, which denies that self-interest is the sole motivator to human actions, might be to look to evolution. As Berg states, “Evolutionary models predict the emergence of trust because it maximizes genetic fitness.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Berg 124&lt;/ref&gt; So, if trust is evolutionarily innate, it would become a “behavioral primitive,” and thus an economic primitive alongside self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;Berg 124&lt;/ref&gt; This would then suffice to explain action under the trust game, at least for the first player. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The explanation as to the high average return by the second player might equally be dependent on the evolutionary innateness of trust. Berg suggests that the response of reciprocation is triggered by the second player viewing “the decision to send money [by the first player] as an attempt to use trust to improve the outcome for both parties.”&lt;ref&gt;Berg 124, 138-139&lt;/ref&gt; Realizing this, the second player would be more inclined to reciprocate. &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
No matter what explanations is chosen, though, the results of the trust game make it evident that “the ability to include trust and reciprocity as part of the rational choice paradigm would seem to allow better explanations of economic institutions.” &lt;ref&gt;Berg 138&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dictator Game is an economic game that is designed to question the standard economic assumption that individuals will act solely out of self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;Guala, Francesco, Luigi Mittone. “Paradigmatic experiments: The Dictator Game.” The Journal of Socio-Economics 39 (2010): 578, 578-584.&lt;/ref&gt; This is done by presenting real-life data of otherwise rational individuals acting in a manner that runs counter to the predictions of economic assumptions.&lt;ref&gt;Guala 578&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Description ==
	The Dictator Game typically consists of two individuals, one of whom is given some quantity of money. The second individual is given nothing. The participant given the money, known in the experiment as “the dictator,” is told that he must offer some amount of that money to the second participant, even if that amount is zero. Whatever amount the dictator offers to the second participant must be accepted. The second participant, should he find the amount unsatisfactory, cannot then punish the dictator in any way.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman, Elizabeth,  Kevin McCabe, Vernon Smith. “RECIPROCITY IN ULTIMATUM AND DICTATOR GAMES:
AN INTRODUCTION.” Handbook of Experimental Economics Results 1, (2008): 412, 411-416. DOI: 10.1016/S1574-0722(07)00046-7&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Dictator Game -- Predicted Outcome Cartoon.jpg |thumb|upright=1.5|alt=The Predicted Outcome of the Dictator Game.|The Predicted Outcome of the Dictator Game, 1st Player Gives a Zero Amount.]]
== Predicted Results ==

	Standard economic theory assumes that all individuals act solely out of self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;Guala 578&lt;/ref&gt; Under this assumption, the predicted result of the dictator game is that the “dictator should keep 100% of the cake, and give nothing to the other player.”&lt;ref&gt;Guala 578&lt;/ref&gt; This effectively assigns the value of what the dictator shares with the second player to zero.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Dictator Game -- Actual Outcome Cartoon.jpg |thumb|upright=1.5|alt=The Actual Outcome of the Dictator Game.|The Actual Outcome of the Dictator Game, 1st Player Gives a Non-Zero Amount.]]
== Actual Results ==

	The actual results of this game, however, differ sharply from the predicted results (though to varying degrees, depending on the exact setup of the game). With a “standard” dictator game setup, “only 40% of the experimental subjects playing the role of dictator keep the whole sum.”&lt;ref&gt;Guala 578&lt;/ref&gt; The average amount given, under these standard conditions, is found by Forsythe et al. to be around 20% of the allocated money.&lt;ref&gt;Guala 579&lt;/ref&gt; In any case, in the majority of these game trials the dictator assigns the second player a non-zero amount.&lt;br /&gt; 
&lt;br /&gt; 
As the experiment parameters of the dictator game are altered, the actual results begin to vary widely, though they still do not conform to the results predicted by the assumption of self-interest. Under double blind conditions, where the isolation between the dictator and the second participant is maximized, a majority of dictators keep all the money and almost all dictators keep at least 80% of it.&lt;ref&gt;Hoffman 414&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Guala 579&lt;/ref&gt; To the opposite extreme, exists an experiment design by Mittone and Ploner, where both participants have previously taken a quiz in order to participate, but only the dictator is directly rewarded (by the initial allocation).&lt;ref&gt;Guala 579&lt;/ref&gt; Under this design, “up to 80% of dictators” give some amount of money to the second player.&lt;ref&gt;Guala 579&lt;/ref&gt; Again, as standard economic theory predicts no dictator will give anything to the second player, no matter how small, both these results remain problematic for the assumption of self-interested action.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

== Conclusions ==
The clearest conclusion to draw from the results of the dictator game is that there exists some motive for human actions other than self-interest.&lt;ref&gt;Guala 578&lt;/ref&gt; Guala suggests two such alternative motives: people care for the welfare of others (altruism) or people are averse to particularly inequitable distributions (they desire fairness).&lt;ref&gt;Guala 579&lt;/ref&gt; But, the extreme variability in the results of the dictator game, depending on minor variations in experimental setup, has made any conclusions about the results of the dictator game tenuous. Economists have simply been precluded “from giving a clear-cut interpretation of the [dictator game] data as either supporting or falsifying the standard theory.”&lt;ref&gt;Guala 581&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

== Objections ==
Rather than give an explanation of the anomalous results of the dictator game that seeks to prove or disprove standard economic theory, the dictator game itself can be accused of being flawed. The idea is that, “The dictator game, on its own, is probably too unusual and too abstract to trigger any real-life normative behavior.”&lt;ref&gt;Guala 584&lt;/ref&gt; Given the rather unrealistic nature of the game (there are few comparable real-life situations), the dictator game simply does not elicit a response from its participants based on a single social norm (whether that norm is rational selfishness or something else).&lt;ref&gt;Guala 581&lt;/ref&gt; There is just no norm that has been developed to match a situation that is so unlikely to occur in reality. Knowing this, huge variability in results can be taken as a symptom of different social norms (each activated by various setups of the dictator game) determining results.&lt;ref&gt;Guala 581&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in a dictator game experiment by Cherry et al., where only the dictator is made to take a quiz before he receives the initial money, there is a very low level of sharing of the allocated money by the dictator.&lt;ref&gt;Guala 579,581&lt;/ref&gt; This setup is taken by Guala to elicit the social norm that one should be allowed to enjoy the fruits of one’s labor.&lt;ref&gt;Guala 581&lt;/ref&gt; The dictator had to work to get his allocation, by taking a quiz, and therefore he likely feels he should not have to share his &quot;earnings&quot; with the second participant who did not take a quiz in order to play the game. As these explanations vary between game setups, it may be that the dictator game is just not detailed or realistic enough to make any direct conclusions about any norm, even rational self-interest, absent confounding explanations.&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Ultimatum Game is an economic game that is designed to question the standard economic assumption of universally self-interested action.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Description ==
	Created by the Israeli game theorist Ariel Rubinstein, the ultimatum game, like the dictator game, usually involves two people.&lt;ref name=Clark2008&gt;Clark, Josh.  &quot;What\u0027s the ultimatum game?&quot;  26 February 2008.  HowStuffWorks.com. &lt;http://money.howstuffworks.com/ultimatum-game.htm&gt;  06 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the ultimatum game, after the first player is given some quantity of money, said first player must make an offer to the second player of how much of the money he is willing to share. If the offer of the first player is rejected by the second player, neither player gets to keep any money.&lt;ref name=HoffmanEtAl2008&gt;Hoffman, Elizabeth,  Kevin McCabe, Vernon Smith. “RECIPROCITY IN ULTIMATUM AND DICTATOR GAMES:
AN INTRODUCTION.” Handbook of Experimental Economics Results 1, (2008): 412, 411-416. DOI: 10.1016/S1574-0722(07)00046-7&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Predicted Results ==
	Under the standard assumption of self-interested rationality, the first player is predicted to offer the smallest non-zero amount he can to the second player, in order to maximize his own share of the money. Because the second player would be better off with even “a vanishingly small offer,&quot; as opposed to zero should he reject any kind of offer, he ought to accept even the lowest offer of money, so long as it is not zero.&lt;ref name=HoffmanEtAl2008/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Actual Results ==
	According to experiments involving the ultimatum game done by Khaneman, Knetsch, and Thaler (1986), the majority of first players in basic ultimatum games offer to split the money equally with the second player.&lt;ref name=HoffmanEtAl2008/&gt; Further, “offers of less than $5 [representing 50% of the total allocation in the Khaneman et al. experiments] are sometimes rejected” by the second players.&lt;ref name=HoffmanEtAl2008/&gt; These results contradict both the predicted results of the first player and those of the second player.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
	As with the dictator game, the results of the ultimatum game can be modified by changing more subtle parameters of the game (while leaving the overall premise intact).  For example, there is a version of the game where both players are given a quiz before allocation and the first player is told that he “earned the right” to distribute money as he had the higher score. Offers by the first player in this version of the game are typically lower than in the standard experiment.&lt;ref name=HoffmanEtAl2008/&gt; Rather than offering an equal split, the first player offers the second player a lower amount, typically a 70-30 distribution.&lt;ref name=HoffmanEtAl2008/&gt; Despite this difference in the amount of money offered, rejection rates by the second player do not change significantly between permutations of the ultimatum game.&lt;ref name=HoffmanEtAl2008/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
== Explanations ==
	The explanations as to the anomalous behavior (according to standard economic theory) observed in the ultimatum game are varied.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
	The most obvious explanation to these results is “a fear of rejection.”&lt;ref name=Clark2008/&gt; As the second player may decide to punish the first player for proposing too low an offer, causing neither to receive anything, the proposer may feel the need to offer a more equitable distribution as a means of self-protection.&lt;ref name=Clark2008/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
	A second explanation is that human beings are inherently driven to cooperate and find a more equitable solution to such situations. The origin of this drive to the equitable is usually taken to be cultural ideas of “fairness” or “manners.”&lt;ref name=HoffmanEtAl2008/&gt; As evidence to this, Hoffman states, “although the forms and norms of reciprocity vary endlessly across cultures, they are functionally equivalent in promoting cooperation.”&lt;ref name=HoffmanEtAl2008/&gt; Indeed, the near universal presence of such norms of reciprocity can be taken to be evidence of a larger, evolutionary, predisposition to reciprocity among Homo sapiens.&lt;ref name=HoffmanEtAl2008/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The problem with differentiating between these two (and other) competing explanations of the results of the ultimatum game is one of the appeals of the dictator game, which controls for the &quot;fear of rejection&quot; explanation.&lt;ref name=HoffmanEtAl2008/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Definition ==
The endowment effect occurs when a good increases in value based on ownership of that good &lt;ref name=&quot;Kahn-Thaler&quot;&gt;, Kahneman, Daniel, Jack Knetsch, and Richard Thaler. “Experimental Tests of the Endowment Effect and the Coase Theorem.” Behavioral Law and Economics. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000. 211-231.&lt;/ref&gt;. The endowment effect is important in economics because it causes actual behavior to conflict with microeconomic theory, which says that an object’s value should be independent of ownership. &lt;ref name=&quot;Kahn-Spitzer&quot;&gt;, McCaffery, Edward, Daniel Kahneman, and Matthew Spitzer. &quot;Framing the Jury: Cognitive Perspective on Pain and Suffering Awards.&quot; Behavioral Law and Economics. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2000. 259-287.&lt;/ref&gt;.

== General Explanation of the Endowment Effect ==
Endowment of a good generally changes an individual’s economic behavior toward that good. Kahneman gives this general example for how endowment affects preference: 
*A person may prefer Good 1 over Good 2 when they start out with ownership of Good 1. Otherwise, that person would prefer Good 2 over Good 1&lt;ref name=&quot;Kahn-Thaler&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.   
Ariely generalizes the idea for a non-economic audience by describing an exchange situation where the owner thinks his possession is of higher value than what the buyer is willing to pay. He uses the quote, “One man’s ceiling is another man’s floor” to describe the endowment effect. When you own an object you are at the ceiling and want to sell at a higher price than the desired price of the buyer, who is at the floor. The endowment effect, as Ariely puts it, is just a change of persepective&lt;ref name=&quot;Ariely&quot;&gt;, Ariely, Dan. Predictably Irrational. New York: Harper Collins, 2008, Print.&lt;/ref&gt;. The endowment effect is easily understood in the long-term, where emotional attachment is likely to occur. But, the effect of ownership can be instant as well. Kahneman showed through several experimental tests that the value given to an object instantly increases when ownership of that object is gained, even if that object is as trivial as a pen &lt;ref name=&quot;Kahn-Thaler&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.  The endowment effect greatly affects economic theory. Instead of thinking that ownership and preferences are unrelated, experiments show that preferences are formed in reference to what a person owns.  Thus, preferences are directly related to endowment effects.

== Setting for the Endowment Effect ==
The endowment effect is a factor in the exchange of goods and it mostly affects the seller. But, not all sellers feel this effect. For example, there is no endowment effect when a good is being held only for the purpose of being a money token.  On the other hand, if an item is purchased for use, the owner is very likely to be influenced by an endowment effect, especially if the item is rare or hard to replace. Endowment effects occur not only for individuals, but for organizations such as businesses, firms, and corporations as well &lt;ref name=&quot;Kahn-Thaler&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Consequences of the Endowment Effect ==
The endowment effect causes indifference curves to have a kink at the initial endowment because this is the reference point for a person’s preferences.  Also, trade will not be as profitable because sellers may be reluctant to trade and ask for increased prices (compared to a trade where there is no endowment effect)&lt;ref name=&quot;Kahn-Thaler&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Examples and Experiments ==
Many experiments have been conducted showing that the endowment effect has a large affect on economic decision making.
*Dan Ariely conducted an experiment with college students at Duke University.  Basketball is a beloved sport at Duke and because the small arena is not even close to large enough to hold the entire student population, basketball tickets are in high demand amongst college students.  So, a very intense process has been developed where only the most dedicated student fans will gain admittance. In the experiment, after the tickets had been distributed, those without tickets were willing to pay around $170 for a ticket. On the other hand, those who earned tickets were willing to sell for around $2,400 a ticket&lt;ref name=&quot;Ariely&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.
*Purohit performed an experiment involving used cars. At trade-in, the owner was shown to prefer a higher payment for the used car over a lower price for the new car, even if the overall price was the same in both cases&lt;ref name=&quot;Gerrit&quot;&gt;, Antonides, Gerrit. &quot;Comparing models of consumer behavior.&quot; The Cambridge Handbook of Psychology and Economic Behaviour. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2008. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;. 
*In an experiment by Franciosi (and others) where some people traded mugs from a university bookstore, endowment cause significant undertrading as opposed to when there was no initial endowment. There were many variations on the experiment in order to show how slight alterations in the exchange setting can change the impact of the endowment effect&lt;ref name=&quot;Fran&quot;&gt;, Robert Franciosi, Praveen Kujal, Roland Michelitsch, Vernon Smith, and Gang Deng. “Experimental tests of the endowment effect.” Journal of Economic Behavior, Volume 30, Issue 2 (Aug, 1996), pp. 213-226. http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016726819600858X&lt;/ref&gt;.
*A similar experiment by Kahneman used the trade of mugs and pens to observe the endowment effect. There were successive experiments so trades could be observed where trading experience was gained. Also, trials were run with and without trading rules, and with and without money incentives.  Also, in order to create a realistic environment, buyers were not given money and had to supply money out of their own pocket in order to make exchanges. In this experiment, average selling prices were more than double the buying prices&lt;ref name=&quot;Kahn-Thaler&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The simple Future ==
The simple future is formed by adding the endings (-ai, -as, -a, -ons, -ez, -ont) to the infinitive form of a verb. If the infinitive verb ends in -e, drop the final -e before adding the appropriate ending. The example will illustrate the translation of simple future in English: Je parlerai = I will talk/speak.

      <text xml:space="preserve">I don't like the justification of the Article. There are statements like:

*&quot;Historically, the introduction of entropy has been confusing.&quot;
*&quot;So stated, without any reference to basic principles within real physics, this definition is weak and open to interpretation,&quot;
*&quot;the definition is critically limited in various ways. It cannot for instance, adequately explain the entropy of mixing, implying a fundamental defect. These and other limitations are sufficient cause to abandon the classic approach.&quot;
*&quot;... does not have any of the limitations of the classical definition.&quot;
*&quot;In our opinion this confuses students and does not contribute to clarity of scientific thought.&quot;

All these statements are unfair, incorrect, and give the impression that the writers of the Article have not well understood thermodynamics. What's more important: there is no need for such a justification. The approach in the Article is interesting in its own right and complementary to the &quot;classical&quot; approach.

Please respond. If my opinion is supported I will write a more positive (if you like: harmonic) justification.

===Status of Book===
Entire Book: [{{decistage|6|May 7, 2012}}]
Individual chapters status' listed in contents

==Purpose of This Book==

The purpose of this book is to give a person who has never used the {{LaTeX}} environment before a crash-course in how to create a simple document quickly.  We will not go into the details of more complicated things {{LaTeX}} can do, but instead will focus on the use of templates and the basic principles of what is going on behind the scenes.  Ideally a beginner will be able to read the first few chapters and produce a document in the course of a few hours, then being proficient in the language henceforth.

This book is also intended as a general reference to the simpler functions, declarations, and predefined control-sequences used in the {{LaTeX}} environment.  Appendices will offer the reader an easy, logically ordered way of looking up the commands they want to find with examples where relevant.

===On References===

Using a project like Wikipedia or Wikibooks as the platform for a novel introduces the opportunity for a lot of new and wonderful concepts.  First of all the book is a living one, there's no need to go buy a new edition if something changes or if typos are found and corrected, they'll be available online immediately. 

The most useful feature, in the author's humbler opinion, is the ability to add live references to literally every word of the document.  While that won't be the case in this book, there will be references where necessary.  The &lt;i&gt;further reading&lt;/i&gt; section has links to more in-depth texts available online while certain keywords or concepts may link to their respective webpages or articles about them.  At the same time, to add to the validity of each entry, references will be made and rather than looking them up yourself as in a normal, printed book, one can simply click the link and be taken to the reference.

Primarily this novel references Wikimedia Foundation websites such as Wikipedia or Wikibooks.  Since these are live, anonymously edited pages one would normally think that their validity is questionable.  Note however that each of these pages references further pages which are generally of the sort that are considered reliable. 

In short, a majority of references in this book link to Wikipedia which is not in and of itself a reliable reference.  If you question the validity of a statement in the references used in this book check the external links or references at the bottom of the page and you should find the verification you're looking for.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Chapter 1: Introduction =

Anyone in the sciences will no doubt have seen at least one example of a novel or journal article written in {{LaTeX}}.  Surprisingly though it is not common for a university to offer a course in how to use the program.  Fortunately it's not particularly difficult to pick up and for most purposes there already exist packages and templates for creating standard, commonly used document styles.

Nevertheless, using {{LaTeX}} is a challenge at first since, for most people, it's a new paradigm in creating a document.  Unlike Microsoft Word or OpenOffice like programs, what you see is not necessarily what you get.  If you're typing a document in Word you see immediately what the printed page is going to look like; in the {{LaTeX}} environment this isn't the case at all.  You have the ability to control nearly every aspect of the final product and there isn't much clicking and dragging involved. 

What {{LaTeX}} lacks in apparent simplicity it more than makes up for in its ability to typeset elegant mathematical equations - which is really its primary purpose; technical and scientific documents.  If you're used to a word-processor like program then you'll know the ability to add, say, a fraction requires opening a separate application to format the equation and then adding it to the document, usually in an awkward format such as an image file or a strange and difficult to wrestle with proprietary filetype.  

If one wanted to typeset, say, that a function f, being a function of x and y, is equal to the ratio of y to x, one would simply type:
 $$f(x)=\frac{y}{x}$$
Which would give you a non-numbered equation that looks like so:
&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\frac{y}{x}&lt;/math&gt;

The only thing that may be initially confusing is that what you see in the document you edit, namely the .tex file, would be the slightly ugly bit between the dollar signs.  Until the document was &lt;i&gt;typeset&lt;/i&gt; which is something we will discuss later in this chapter.

==Typesetting Applications==

This author has used Apple OS X and Microsoft Windows to run {{LaTeX}} typesetting applications.  Since this is a crash-course, rather than a long and drawn out exposition on the environment, we shall discuss the relevant details of only two applications, one for each of the aforementioned operating systems. 

The reader is greatly encouraged to look for their own typesetting applications and add them to the list below titled &lt;i&gt;User Suggested Typesetting Applications&lt;/i&gt;.  The two suggested here are the two that the author is familiar with, knows how to install, and are similar enough in design and layout that the rest of the book can be written with instructions that will prove valid (in most cases) for both applications.

For Windows and OS X respectively we have:
*[http://miktex.org/ MikTEX] (Personally tested and functioning on Windows XP and above)
*[http://www.tug.org/mactex/2011/ MacTEX] (Personally tested and functioning on OS X 10.5 and higher)

You may notice that the names are eerily similar, the author suspects this is merely a coincidence.

Again, these are only the applications which this book is written to work with explicitly in terms of instructions, however other applications should be similar in command scheme and function but that author cannot guarantee this.  If you have an application you'd prefer to try go for it, that's half the fun of learning a new program.

===Installation Instructions===

We shall now discuss, briefly, how to install and start the applications mentioned in the previous section.  More in depth instructions are available on the website of the respective applications.

====MiKTEX====

The MiKTEX webpage actually has excellent instructions of their own.  To download the package itself, use the [http://miktex.org/ MikTEX homepage] and download the latest version.  As of currently, MikTEX 2.9 is the current version and from their [http://miktex.org/2.9/setup installation instructions webpage], here is a step-by-step guide.

The installation is fairly self-explanatory and one of the main advantages of MikTEX is that it is able to automatically load packages that aren't included in the initial download when they're needed, simplifying everything from the standpoint of the user.  The installation is the same way, one executable file to launch an installer.  Select your options and you're done.

{{quote|Downloading and Installing MiKTeX 2.9
What's new

Please read the release notes, before you install MiKTeX 2.9.

Special considerations

The following Windows platforms are supported:

Windows 7
Windows Vista with Service Pack 2 (all editions except Starter Edition)
Windows XP with Service Pack 3 (all editions except Starter Edition)
Windows Server 2008 R2
Windows Server 2008 with Service Pack 2
Windows Server 2003 R2
Windows Server 2003 with Service Pack 2
Please note that MiKTeX 2.9 does not work on legacy Windows systems (Windows 9x/Me/NT/2000).

It is possible to install MiKTeX 2.9 side-by-side to an existing MiKTeX 2.8 installation.

You have the option to create a shared MiKTeX 2.9 installation. Use this option if you are the administrator of your computer and if you want to install MiKTeX for all users. This option is not available if you are logged into a limited user account.

Preparations

You must uninstall a previous version of the 2.9 series, if it exists. To do so, start the &quot;Add or Remove Programs&quot; tool, select the MiKTeX 2.9 entry and click the Remove button. It is recommended that you choose the &quot;Tidy up thoroughly&quot; option on the first wizard page.

Installing a basic MiKTeX system

&quot;Basic MiKTeX 2.9&quot; Installer
To install a basic MiKTeX system, download and run the &quot;Basic MiKTeX&quot; installer. MiKTeX has the ability to install missing packages automatically, i.e., this installer is suitable for computers connected to the Internet.

When you have installed MiKTeX 2.9, it is recommended that you run the update wizard in order to get the latest updates.

Installing the complete MiKTeX system

You use the MiKTeX Net Installer to download all MiKTeX packages and install a complete MiKTeX system. See the section Installing MiKTeX in the MiKTeX manual, for more information.
|MikTEX Installation Guide|[http://miktex.org/2.9/setup MikTEX Website]}}

====MacTEX====

If you're using a Macintosh then you'll probably be more interested in the {{LaTeX}} software designed to run on your platform.  One easy solution is to go with the MacTEX distribution.  Just like MikTEX for the PC, MacTEX is fairly simple to install.  Here's a simple set of instructions that'll get you up and running your own distribution of MacTEX:

# Go to http://www.tug.org/mactex/2011/ and download the latest version
# Once the download is complete, go to your downloads folder (or wherever you saved the file) and unzip the file you downloaded
# Double-click the .dmg file to mount it
# It will now appear as though there is a disk in your computer so go to the desktop and open the disk that appeared
# In the disk's directory you will find an installer file, double click and run this
# Follow all the guided instructions on the screen
# Restart your computer

Congratulations, you now have MacTEX installed on your machine.  There are a variety of individual programs installed with this package but the program you'll want to use to typeset things is  called TeXShop.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Chapter 2: Typesetting, What is it and How do I do it?=

In the {{LaTeX}} environment, as we've discussed before, things are slightly different from what you'd expect from a word-processor; this is because {{LaTeX}} is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a word-processor, it is a typesetting application.  But what is typesetting and how is it different?  We'll explore that here before moving on to explain &lt;i&gt;how&lt;/i&gt; to typeset a document because a lot of the confusion regarding {{LaTeX}} revolves around the issue of typesetting and the paradigms involved.

When you create a document in {{LaTeX}} you control nearly every bit of what is put on the page.  The level of complexity available to a seasoned user is almost baffling but it is beautiful in that it allows highly professional documents to be created.  That said, {{LaTeX}} also provides simple templates to create basic documents quickly and professionally as well so there's no need to worry.  

The first thing you'll notice when you open up the {{LaTeX}} application you've chosen is that what you type into the window doesn't have a whole lot of options.  You can't make it italic or bold, you can't make a strikethrough or change the font size.  This is because what you're typing in that window isn't the final document.  What goes there is the content of the finished product; once the content has been typeset things like italics and boldface fonts will appear.

If it helps to think of it in terms of programming, consider Java or C or another language you may be familiar with, HTML even.  What's written in the code isn't the final product - it's simply the instructions passed to the computer to produce an application.  The same is true of {{LaTeX}}; what you type in the box isn't the final document, it's the content and instructions that are sent to the computer to produce it.

===Example 1===

As a simple example, let's use a {{LaTeX}} template to create a simple document.  Afterwards we'll discuss what everything we typed did and how it can be modified or expounded upon in the future.  This example doesn't produce anything particularly pretty so don't expect a gorgeous end-result.

Open the {{LaTeX}} application you chose to install and create a new .tex document.  In the entry window, type the following and be sure to change &lt;Your Name Here&gt; to your actual name:

 \documentclass[10pt,a4paper,oneside]{article}
 \usepackage{geometry} 
 \geometry{letterpaper} 
 \usepackage[parfill]{parskip}
 \usepackage{epsfig}
 \usepackage{float}
 \usepackage{subfigure}
 \usepackage[]{hyperref}
 \usepackage{amssymb}
 %
 \begin{document}
 \begin{figure}
 \centering
 {\large\bf My First {{LaTeX}} Document}\\
 By: &lt;Your Name Here&gt;\\
 \end{figure}
 %
 This is my first document using the {{LaTeX}} typesetting environment.  
 %
 It isn't very detailed, but it certainly looks good.
 %
 \end document

====The \documentclass property====
This particular option can be set anywhere in the document in theory, although good practice generally dictates placing it before the \begin{document} flag.  For convenience, the author suggests placing it as the first part of any document, simply so that it isn't forgotten.  If this flag is not specified before typesetting, the outcome is difficult to anticipate; some typesetting applications simply won't typeset while others will assume some default which may or may not be what you like.  If you're planning on making the .tex file available to others, or typesetting on another machine later which may have a different application, it's best just to place it at the top.

Let's dissect the command used above:
 \documentclass[10pt,a4paper,oneside]{article}
First is the command itself, called by typing \documentclass before the \begin{document} command which is discussed in a later section.  Secondly come the options.  Specifics come inside the brackets - [] and specify a variety of things.  There are a ridiculous number of options you can specify here so we'll ignore those for now and just discuss the ones you're most likely to use in the beginning.

First there's the 10pt option we used.  This is the font-size for the document.  This can be changed in paragraphs or for individual words later in the document, however there is a separate command for that we'll discuss later as well.  If you'd like to see how this varies, change the command we used but make 10pt 11pt, or 12pt, and you'll see how the text size for the document changes.

Note that between options there is no space but a comma (,); this is the general format we will use for options in this book.  It is also the standard for option modifiers in the \{{LaTeX}} language but some specific packages allow spaces while others don't and it's best to be safe.

Second there's the command a4paper.  If you're not familiar with the types of paper available, or the modifiers available in \{{LaTeX}}, don't bother changing this command.  a4paper is used for standard 8.5&quot;,11&quot; paper while the 'legal' flag is used for legal sized paper.  Until you're more familiar with the system, the author advises not playing with this command too much.

Finally there's the oneside option.  As it says, this causes \{{LaTeX}} to produce documents that will print one-sided.  This is a bit of an outmoded command since usually when you print a document on a printer that even supports multisided documents the option is instead handled by the printer driver.  Nevertheless, \{{LaTeX}} embeds a command in the .pdf it creates that will cause some print drivers to automatically print one-sided regardless of the defaults although, generally speaking, this kind of driver will not be encountered by the average user.

The last bit of the \documentclass modifier is located in curly-brackets {} and is '{article}'.  While what we created isn't technically an &lt;i&gt;article&lt;/i&gt; it's the easiest style of document to work with.  There are also {book} and {letter} modifiers which are typical, and a whole slew of others you can use once you're more familiar.  For now, we'll stick with the {article} class because it will allow us to create simple documents like those most readers will be looking to create.

=====An important note=====
In the above example you'll notice that some of the document is written inside of two flags, namely:
 \begin{figure}
and
 \end{figure}
These specify a &lt;i&gt;figure&lt;/i&gt; in \{{LaTeX}} which is not itself a very simple object, as nothing in \{{LaTeX}} truly is.  However, we will not be playing a lot with the options available in \{{LaTeX}} figures so don't worry. 

The caveat here is that if you were to try to typeset the above example without using the following command &lt;i&gt;before&lt;/i&gt; the \begin{document} constructor:
 \usepackage{subfigure}
it would still work.  This is because a figure is &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; a subfigure.  We'll use a subfigure in later examples but if you were to try to use a &lt;i&gt;subfigure&lt;/i&gt; without \usepackage{subfigure} you'd get an error and your document wouldn't typset.  This is because a figure is an inherent object in the \{{LaTeX}} library where a subfigure is not and therefore \{{LaTeX}} has no idea what you're talking about when you say subfigure unless you give it a \usepackage to reference.  

Remembering this fact will solve a lot of problems in the future if you're using different packages and should help with troubleshooting when you're writing your own documents.

====The geometry option====
The geometry option is also important to set in any document.  It can be specified with the flag as shown above.  More often than not you'll be printing in a portrait rather than landscape since the document will probably be something you'd read in print.

It's important to note, and we will get into this later on in the book, that this flag cannot be changed throughout the document.  It's a one-time deal.  If you've got a page of graphs that you think would look better displayed in a landscape style there is a different command for this and we will introduce it later on.

====The \usepackage option====
This is probably the simplest concept to think of, while also being one of the more difficult to deal with.  If you're using a different application to typeset your documents than the ones suggested in this book then you'll have to look at the documentation when you're using this command.

Essentially what's happening here is that you're adding functionality to your code.  It's similar to adding a library to a Java program so that your code can utilize simple functions predefined by yourself or other people.  However, not every {{LaTeX}} distribution comes with every package you would need.  

MacTex has a majority of the commonly used packages preinstalled and MikTex has an option to automatically download any that aren't already installed on the system being used.  However, if you should come across an error where your typesetting application cannot find the package or doesn't have it installed you'll either have to go about writing without using it, or find it online and install it yourself.

The details of installing a usepackage on a {{LaTeX}} typsetting program is a bit tedious and the author recommends using a Google search or the documentation provided with your application for those purposes since every distribution on different operating systems is different and therefore would be too much to go into in a short crash-course such as this one.

Let's take a look at two of the author's favorite \usepackage functions.
=====\usepackage[parfill]{parskip}=====
The author loves this option because it makes writing the document feel slightly more like what we're all used to if we learned to type in a word-processor.

If this \usepackage wasn't specified, something typed as so:
 This is a paragraph
 
 This is also a paragraph
Would typeset to one single paragraph.  If you're not using the \usepackage[parfill]{parskip} \usepackage in your document, you'll have to end paragraphs as so:
 This is the end of a paragraph I've written; I'd like the next to be on a new line \\

The double slash specifies the end of a paragraph or line.

=====\usepackage{amssymb}=====

The details of this package are a bit convoluted, but it's important for anyone who will be typing mathematical functions.  There are a lot of math symbols out there and having access to them in the \{{LaTeX}} environment is crucial.  For instance, with the \usepackage{amssymb} modifier at the beginning of the document typing:
 $$\alpha = \frac{\pi}{\Beta}$$
Will give you the proper Greek letters.  Other modifiers may do so as well, but they may look different or require different commands to call them.

For the rest of this book, unless otherwise specified, the amssymb \usepackage will be used in all the documents to handle the mathematical aspects.  For that reason, if you're using a different math symbol package you may experience errors in recreating the examples provided; the author cannot help other than to say that Google is your friend when looking up functions in \{{LaTeX}}.

====The \begin{} and \end{} functions====
In our example we had two of these.  The first was 
 \begin{document}
Which tells \{{LaTeX}} that what we're going to be typing next is the document itself, rather than the commands that it needs to have to specify how to typeset the document.  If you try to typeset any document without the \begin{document} command you will get an error.

We also have the following command:
 \begin{figure}
Which tells \{{LaTeX}} that what follows needs to be put in the class of 'figure' and handled as such.  As we said above, the figure is actually quite complicated, but for our purposes it's just like a box we can put things which we want to stay together.

Now, one must be very careful when using a \begin{} statement because if something begins, it must end.  Think of a Java class.  We cannot say
 static void main([] int)
 {
without also specifying the end of the class, the code would not compile.  In order to get a functioning program, we'd need
 static void main([] int)
 {
    Commands
 }

The same is true of a {{LaTeX}} \begin{} command, we also need to end what we began or the document will not typeset.  For the figure, this is done as follows:
 \begin{figure}
    Contents of the figure
    More contents of the figure
    Maybe some math ...
 \end{figure}
And everything is all well and good.

However, the \begin{document} function is slightly more crucial and will need to be used with care. 
 \begin{document}
    We've now begun the document.  Everything here is part of the document we wish to typeset.  For instance, if we want a figure:
    \begin{figure}
        Contents of the figure
    \end{figure}
    And now we have more of our document to deal with.  When we're finished with everything we want to typeset as a document, we must be sure to end it as follows
 \end{document}

Now everything will be good to go and you will be able to typeset the code.

==Mathematical Functions==

{{LaTeX}} is a wonderful change from word-processing in the way that it handles mathematical input.  In most word processors another application needs to be run within the main program in order to create the properly formatted equations.  Once this is done they are usually placed in the document as an image but even if they aren't putting them precisely where you want them is often a hassle, changing the document after placing the equation is difficult, and many times the formatting of the mathematics will be different from that of the rest of the document making it look unprofessional.

{{LaTeX}} is different in that you won't be able to see what you've written until you typeset the document.  For that reason the equations you type are handled by the back-end and placed in the document with proper formatting and in the right location.  

There are two main ways to insert a mathematical equation into your document.  Read the 2 following sections and then modify the example above to have 2 equations you may wish to see in a document, or two random equations, with each method.

===Inline Mathematical Functions===

The simplest way to place a mathematical function in a {{LaTeX}} document is to do it inside of a sentence or paragraph your writing.  For instance, say we wanted to define a variable we'll use in a later equation in the same sentence it is described:

 We will let the function f(x) be defined as $f(x) = \sqrt{x}$

The way this was achieved was with the use of the dollar-sign symbols.  Whenever you'll be placing an equation inside of a paragraph or sentence, you use the &quot;$&quot; symbol to tell {{LaTeX}} that what comes next should be treated as a math equation rather than as simple text.

You'll want to be careful about using words inside of equations however, since they are handled very differently.  The best method would be as follows:

 We assume that the constant n is defined to be in units of moles$^{-1}$
 
Which will place &quot;-1&quot; in the exponent of &quot;moles&quot; making it the unit of inverse-moles.  Where this specifically would be useful the author cannot be sure, but it serves to demonstrate the point that while we wanted the &quot;-1&quot; to be an exponent, we did not want &quot;moles&quot; to be typeset as an equation would be.  It would change the formatting of the letters and look different from the rest of the text.

===Separate Mathematical Functions===

If one wishes to insert an equation on its own line there are a variety of methods for doing this.  Later on we shall see how to insert a list of equations in the table of contents so it's important to note that equations on their own line are not &lt;i&gt;necessarily&lt;/i&gt; numbered by {{LaTeX}}.

If we don't want an equation numbered we can do it using two dollar signs ($$) like so:

 This is a sentence that would describe the following random equation:
 $$f(x) = \frac{\sqrt{x}}{2}$$
 Where $f$ is a function of $x$ called $f(x)$.

Not that any of the above is particularly helpful in real life, but it demonstrates the difference between a single dollar-sign and a double dollar-sign.  While the things given to {{LaTeX}} as $f$, $x$, and $f(x)$ will be kept in their respective sentence, the other equation kept in the double dollar-signs ($$) will be given its own line.

Please note that a double dollar sign can be substituted with $[ and $] and that  both forms will &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; be numbered.

If we wish to have a numbered equation so that it can be referenced later or automatically added to a list of equations in the table of contents, we would modify the above example as so:

 This is a sentence that would describe the following random equation:
 \begin{equation}
    f(x) = \frac{\sqrt{x}}{2}
 \end{equation}
 Where $f$ is a function of $x$ called $f(x)$.

Everything inside of the \begin{equation} and \end{equation} brackets will be formatted as a single equation and it will be numbered by {{LaTeX}}.  This is especially useful if you'll be referencing the equation a lot in your text, or if you'd like to make it available later on in the table of contents.

It's important to note that if you have two separate equations that you want numbered you would &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; place both of them inside the \begin{} and \end{} functions.  This would be typeset as a single equation which would not look very much like what you're hoping for.  Each individual equation would need to be bracketed within its own \begin{} and \end{} functions as shown here:

 Here are our first two equations:
 \begin{equation}
    f(x) = 2x^2
 \end{equation}
 \begin{equation}
    g(x) = f(x)^2 = 4x^4
 \end{equation}

And each of these would be labeled as equations in their own right as well as being displayed separately.

There are a variety of other environments available for inputting equations besides the '$', '$$', or 'begin{equation}' options, but for the sake of levity we will limit our discussion to these alone.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Chapter 3: Writing a Document from a Template=
==Articles==

If you're a scientist or scientist-in-training you've probably had to deal with writing an article at some point in your life.  Wikipedia has this to say about the scientific article:

{{quote|Articles are usually between five and twenty pages and are complete descriptions of current original research findings, but there are considerable variations between scientific fields and journals – 80-page articles are not rare in mathematics or theoretical computer science (from [[w:Scientific_journal#Types_of_articles|Wikipedia, Scientific journal]]}}

Which is extremely true.  Again, for the sake of brevity we will not delve into the specific requirements of the various academic and scientific journals one can publish too (however the author will note that excellent examples can be found at [http://www.arxiv.org Arixiv] or by using a [http://www.scholar.google.com Google Scholar] search for a topic or paper of interest), we will instead simply look at how one would format one of these documents.

===The Absolute Basic Template===

We present here the simplest template to work with.  From here you can edit the body of the document, create your article, and essentially get a finished product that looks good.  Of course every individual author will have different needs but those can be addressed later.  Here is the template, we'll go through everything else in a moment, it may be a good idea to copy this into your typesetting application so you can see what it look like, but don't typeset it quite yet:

 \documentclass[11pt,a4paper,oneside]{article}
 \usepackage{geometry} 
 \geometry{letterpaper} 
 \usepackage[parfill]{parskip}
 \usepackage{epsfig}
 \usepackage{float}
 \usepackage{subfig}
 \usepackage{fancyhdr}
 \usepackage{wrapfig}

===About GLSL===
GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) is one of several commonly used shading languages for real-time rendering (other examples are Cg and HLSL). These shading languages are used to program shaders (i.e. more or less small programs) that are executed on a GPU (graphics processing unit), i.e. the processor of the graphics system of a computer – as opposed to the CPU (central processing unit) of a computer.

GPUs are massively parallel processors, which are extremely powerful. Most of today's real-time graphics in games and other interactive graphical applications would not be possible without GPUs. However, to take full advantage of the performance of GPUs, it is necessary to program them directly. This means that small programs (i.e. shaders) have to be written that can be executed by GPUs. The programming languages to write these shaders are shading languages. GLSL is one of them. In fact, it is the shading language of several 3D graphics APIs (application programming interfaces), namely OpenGL, OpenGL ES 2.x, and WebGL. Therefore, GLSL is commonly used in applications for desktop computers, mobile devices, and the web.

===About this Wikibook===
This wikibook was written with students in mind, who like neither programming nor mathematics. The basic motivation for this book is the observation that students are much more motivated to learn programming environments, programming languages and APIs if they are working on specific projects. Such projects are usually developed on specific platforms and therefore the approach of this book is to present GLSL within the game engine Unity.

Chapters 1 to 8 of the book consist of tutorials with working examples that produce certain effects. Note that these tutorials assume that you read them in the order in which they are presented, i.e. each tutorial will assume that you are familiar with the concepts and techniques introduced by previous tutorials. If you are new to GLSL or Unity you should at least read through the tutorials in Chapter 1, “Basics”.

More details about the OpenGL pipeline and GLSL syntax in general are included in an “Appendix on the OpenGL Pipeline and GLSL Syntax”. Readers who are not familiar with OpenGL or GLSL might want to at least skim this part since a basic understanding of the OpenGL pipeline and GLSL syntax is very useful for understanding the tutorials.

===About GLSL in Unity===
GLSL programming in the game engine Unity is considerably easier than GLSL programming for an OpenGL, OpenGL ES, or WebGL application. Import of meshes and images (i.e. textures) is supported by a graphical user interface; mipmaps and normal maps can be computed automatically; the most common vertex attributes and uniforms are predefined; OpenGL states can be set by very simple commands; etc. 

A free version of Unity can be downloaded for Windows and MacOS at [http://unity3d.com/unity/download/ Unity's download page]. All of the included tutorials work with the free version. Three points should be noted: 
* First, '''Windows users''' have to use the command-line argument &lt;code&gt;-force-opengl&lt;/code&gt; [http://unity3d.com/support/documentation/Manual/Command%20Line%20Arguments.html] when starting Unity in order to be able to use GLSL shaders; for example, by changing the &lt;code&gt;Target&lt;/code&gt; setting in the properties of the desktop icon to: &lt;code&gt;&quot;C:\Program Files\Unity\Editor\Unity.exe&quot; -force-opengl&lt;/code&gt; . (On MacOS X, OpenGL and therefore GLSL is used by default.) Note that GLSL shaders cannot be used in Unity applications running in web browser on Windows.
* Secondly, this book assumes that readers are somewhat familiar with Unity. If this is not the case, readers should consult the first three sections of Unity's User Guide [http://unity3d.com/support/documentation/Manual/User%20Guide.html] (Unity Basics, Building Scenes, Asset Import and Creation).
* Furthermore, as of version 3.5, Unity supports a version of GLSL similar to version 1.0.x for OpenGL ES 2.0 (the specification is available at the [http://www.khronos.org/registry/gles/ “Khronos OpenGL ES API Registry”]); however, Unity's  shader documentation [http://unity3d.com/support/documentation/Components/SL-Reference.html] focuses on shaders written in Unity's own “surface shader” format and Cg/HLSL [http://unity3d.com/support/documentation/Components/SL-ShaderPrograms.html]. There are only very few details documented that are specific to GLSL shaders  [http://unity3d.com/support/documentation/Components/SL-GLSLShaderPrograms.html]. Thus, this wikibook might also help to close some gaps in Unity's documentation. However, optimizations (see, for example, [http://aras-p.info/blog/2011/02/01/ios-shader-tricks-or-its-2001-all-over-again/ this blog]) are usually not discussed.

&lt;!-- EDIT TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;
&lt;!--
  -- For parameter descriptions, use &amp;#124; to show bar &quot;|&quot;
  -- otherwise, table will freak.

{{notice|[[Template:Convert]] and most of its high-risk subtemplates have been protected so that only [[Wikibooks:Administrators|admins]] can edit them. Discuss proposed changes on the [[Template talk:Convert|Convert discussion page]].}}

=== Usage ===
This template shows measurement quantities as primary and converted secondary units (or ranges), with optional rounding, wikilinks, abbreviation, or UK spellings, and various separators including:&amp;nbsp; parentheses &quot;(&amp;nbsp;)&quot;, &quot;or&quot;, hyphens, comma, &quot;to&quot; or dashes. The can help users by generating correct conversions from one unit of measurement to another, particularly for more complex units. It's also useful by making the text adhere to books' [[Help:Local manuals of style|manuals of style]]. The text the template generates does not differ from a plain text equivalent, however.

Styles include: distance &quot;{{convert|32|m|ft}}&quot; and &quot;{{convert|32|m|ft|disp=or}}&quot;; temperature &quot;{{convert|18|°C|°F}}&quot;; mass &quot;{{convert|55.0|kg|lb|abbr=on}}&quot; or &quot;{{convert|65|to|80|kg|lb|abbr=on}}&quot;; etc. For units see: [[Template:Convert/list of units|Convert/list of units]].

{|
|- style=&quot;background:#FAFEFF; vertical-align:top;&quot;
|Options&amp;nbsp;include:&amp;nbsp;||[[#lk_in|&lt;code&gt;lk=in&lt;/code&gt;]], [[#abbr_on|&lt;code&gt;abbr=on&lt;/code&gt;]], [[#abbr_on|&lt;code&gt;abbr=off&lt;/code&gt;]], [[#sp_uk|&lt;code&gt;sp=uk&lt;/code&gt;]], [[#adj_on|&lt;code&gt;adj=on&lt;/code&gt;]], [[#adj_on|&lt;code&gt;adj=mid&lt;/code&gt;]], [[#disp_or|&lt;code&gt;disp=x&lt;/code&gt;]], [[#disp_table|&lt;code&gt;disp=table&lt;/code&gt;]] and [[#sortable_on|&lt;code&gt;sortable=on&lt;/code&gt;]] (explained below). By default, output is [[#Rounding|rounded]] to match the precision of input; alternatives include: &lt;code&gt;sigfig=3&lt;/code&gt; or using the end parameter, such as &quot;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#124;1&lt;/code&gt;&quot; to show tenths or &quot;&lt;code&gt;&amp;#124;-2&lt;/code&gt;&quot; to show full 100's, etc.

'''Single value''': 
 &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;convert|''value''|''in_unit''|''out_unit''|''round_to''&lt;nowiki&gt;|...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;

'''Range of 2 values, or set of 3''' (see below for list of ''range'' options):
&lt;tt&gt;
 {&amp;#123;convert|''val1''|''range''|''val2'' |''in_unit''|''out_unit''|''round_to''|...}}
 {&amp;#123;convert/3 |''val1''|''range''|''val2''|''words''|''val3''|''in_unit''|''out_unit''|''round_to''|...}}&lt;/tt&gt;
* Numbers must be entered in unformatted form (without commas). Values output by the template will be displayed formatted and with a true minus sign where appropriate. To specify with commas, re-code a number as &lt;nowiki&gt;{{formatnum:9,000,500|R}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; (becomes 9000500).
* Optional parameters, in examples below, allow abbreviated units (abbr=on), or U.K. spellings (sp=uk for ''metre''), or hyphenation (adj=on), etc.
* For this template many levels of substitution are possible, hence doing this fully, step by step, is cumbersome. Use [[Special:ExpandTemplates]] instead.
* The template has very limited in-built capacity for [[w:dimensional analysis|dimensional analysis]].  It is therefore up to the user to ensure that most input and output units are compatible.  Do not, for example, attempt to convert barrels to tonnes.  Also beware of units with similar names; the code &lt;code&gt;oz&lt;/code&gt;, for example, is for the avoirdupois ounce (a unit of mass), do not use this if you want fluid ounces.  Note also that the code &lt;code&gt;lb&lt;/code&gt; gives pounds mass, for pounds force use &lt;code&gt;lbf&lt;/code&gt;.
* An attempt to convert a unit to itself, ''e.g.'', km to km, will result in a template loop.
* The range functionality is not fully implemented for all units, so experimentation may be required.
* This documentation page tends to lag behind in terms of what the template can do.  For details see the talk page and its archives.

*Large scale units (e3, e6, e9)
*Combination-based units (ft&amp;in, st&amp;lb, lb&amp;oz) due to complexity of the conversion.

===Parameters===
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! colspan=&quot;2&quot; | Parameters
|-
| {{anchor|sp_uk}}Use [[w:British English|UK spelling]] 
| attach &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|sp=uk&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
|-
| {{anchor|lk_in}}Make units linked
| attach &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|lk=on&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;nbsp; to link all units (default: &lt;tt&gt;lk=off&lt;/tt&gt;)&lt;br /&gt; attach &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|lk=in&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;nbsp; to link only the input units&lt;br /&gt; attach &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|lk=out&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp; to link only the output units&lt;br /&gt;([[Wikibooks:Dewikify]] suggests that you should not link common units of measurement).
|-
| {{anchor|adj_on}}Use the adjective form, or insert mid-text words 
| attach &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|adj=on&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (e.g. &quot;190-foot (58 m) bridge&quot; instead of &quot;190 feet...&quot;).
:: This produces the adjective form—the unit name in the singular with a hyphen.
attach &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|adj=mid&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; (e.g. &quot;190-foot bridge (58 m)&quot; as: |adj=mid|bridge
:: or &quot;190-foot-long bridge (58 m)&quot; as: |adj=mid|-long bridge)
Note 1: Any rounding-parameter should follow the mid-text: &quot;text|0&quot;.&lt;br&gt;Note 2: For adj=mid, must specify both input &amp; output unit-codes.
:: For example, to convert feet, use &quot;ft|m&quot; or &quot;ft|0&quot;:&lt;br&gt;&amp;nbsp; &amp;bull; &lt;nowiki&gt;{{convert|9|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; &amp;rarr; 9-foot-long (2.7 m)&lt;br&gt;To default the output unit-code, set parameter 3 to: 0.
|-
| Abbreviate units, or not 
| {{anchor|abbr_on}}attach &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|abbr=on&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to show unit symbols&lt;br /&gt; attach &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|abbr=off&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; &amp;nbsp; to show all unit names in full words&lt;br /&gt; attach &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|abbr=in&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to abbreviate input units&lt;br /&gt; attach &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|abbr=out&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to abbreviate output units&lt;br /&gt; attach &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|abbr=values&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to suppress unit names &amp; show only values. So, &lt;nowiki&gt;{{convert|6|mi|abbr=values}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; gives: {{convert|6|mi|abbr=values}}.
|-
| {{anchor|disp_or}}Change &quot;( )&quot; to display other separators 
| attach &lt;code&gt;&amp;#124;disp=comma&lt;/code&gt; to put comma, not brackets/parentheses&lt;br /&gt; attach &lt;code&gt;&amp;#124;disp=or&lt;/code&gt; to put &quot;or&quot; between units.&lt;br /&gt; The default value is:&amp;nbsp; disp=b for brackets/parentheses.
|-
| Change &quot;( )&quot; to customized separators 
| attach &lt;code&gt;&amp;#124;disp=x&amp;#124; (begin &amp;#124; end)&lt;/code&gt; to show &quot;xx (begin yy end)&quot; See example 1&lt;br /&gt; attach &lt;code&gt;&amp;#124;disp=x&amp;#124;;&lt;/code&gt; to show &quot;xx; yy&quot; See example 2&lt;br /&gt; attach &lt;code&gt;&amp;#124;disp=x&amp;#124; (same as &amp;#124;)&lt;/code&gt; to show &quot;xx (same as yy)&quot;. See example 3&lt;br /&gt;Example 1: {{nowrap|&lt;nowiki&gt;{&amp;#123;convert|9|km|mi|disp=x| [|]}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}&amp;rarr;{{nowrap|9 kilometres [5.6 mi]}} (note space before &lt;nowiki&gt;[|&lt;/nowiki&gt;)&lt;br /&gt;Example 2: {{nowrap|&lt;nowiki&gt;{&amp;#123;convert|9|km|mi|disp=x|;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}&amp;rarr;{{nowrap|9 kilometres;5.6 mi}}&lt;br /&gt;Example 3: {{nowrap|&lt;nowiki&gt;{&amp;#123;convert|10|km|mi|disp=x| (about |)}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}&amp;rarr;{{nowrap|10 kilometres (about 6.2 mi)}} (note spaces used within the code).
|-
| Display output only 
| attach &lt;code&gt;&amp;#124;disp=output only&lt;/code&gt; to show result number &amp; unit&lt;br /&gt; attach &lt;code&gt;&amp;#124;disp=output number only&lt;/code&gt; to show just number&lt;br /&gt;Note when using &quot;disp=output only&quot; then the unit name can still be shown as full words by abbr=off or linked by lk=on.
|-
| Display units inverted as reverse order
| attach &lt;code&gt;&amp;#124;disp=flip&lt;/code&gt;&amp;nbsp; to reverse the order &amp; show output unit first.&lt;br /&gt;So, &lt;nowiki&gt;{{convert|6|km|disp=flip}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; shows &quot;3.7 miles (6 km)&quot;.&lt;br /&gt;To get symbol &quot;mi&quot; use abbr=in, to abbreviate the input unit (left-side unit).
|-
| Display unit name (only) 
| attach &lt;code&gt;&amp;#124;disp=unit&lt;/code&gt; to show the unit name for a symbol&lt;br /&gt;The unit name will be plural when the amount is not 1, or hyphenated when adj=on. So, &lt;nowiki&gt;{{convert|2|cuyd|disp=unit}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; shows &quot;cubic yards&quot; plural.
|-
| {{anchor|disp_table}}Display amounts as table cells 
| attach &lt;tt&gt;&amp;#124;disp=table&lt;/tt&gt; (or &lt;tt&gt;&amp;#124;disp=tablecen&lt;/tt&gt;) Note: For use in tables, the template must start on a new line after a pipe.  Only the number will be displayed unless you set &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|abbr=on&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|lk=on&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|lk=in&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|lk=out&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
|-

| attach &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|sigfig={some integer greater than zero}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;. In the case of temperatures Celsius or Fahrenheit this refers to the difference with the absolute-zero temperature. For example, at room temperature two significant digits means rounded to tens of degrees.
|-

For negative amounts, use two minus signs (hyphens): -11-1/4.
|-
|{{anchor|sortable_on}}Generate a hidden sort key for use with a [[Help:Tables#Sortable_tables|sortable table]]
| attach &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|sortable=on&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; to generate a hidden sort key so that [[Help:Tables#Sortable_tables|sortable tables]] will sort correctly. This uses {{tl|ntsh}} to generate a sort key from the first numeric value. It ignores any additional values, i.e., if you use &lt;code&gt;6|ft|2|in&lt;/code&gt; as the value, it will only use the 6 for the sort key. This will cause numeric values to sort in numeric order, i.e.: 5, 10, 15 instead of 10, 15, 5.

{{reflist|group=note}}

===Rounding===
''Convert'' supports four types of rounding:
;Rounding to a given precision 
:Specify the desired precision with the fourth unnamed parameter (or third unnamed parameter if the &quot;convert to&quot; parameter is omitted; or fifth unnamed parameter if a range is specified; or fourth unnamed parameter again if a range is specified and the &quot;convert to&quot; parameter is omitted; needs to be replaced with a &quot;precision&quot; named parameter).  The conversion is rounded off to the nearest power of {{frac|10}} this number.  For instance, if the result is 8621 and the round number is '-2', the result will be 8600.  If the result is '234.0283043' and the round number is '0', the result will be 234.

;Rounding to a given number of significant figures
:Specify the desired number of significant figures using &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;|sigfig={some integer greater than zero}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; as noted above.

;Default rounding
:If neither the desired precision nor the desired number of significant figures is specified, the conversion will be rounded either to a comparable precision as the input value (the number of digits after the decimal point—or the negative of the number of non-significant zeroes before the point—is increased by one if the conversion is a multiplication by a number between 0.02 and 0.2, remains the same if the factor is between 0.2 and 2, is decreased by 1 if it is between 2 and 20, and so on) or to two significant figures, whichever is the most precise.  An exception to this is temperature, wherein the conversion will be rounded either to precision comparable to that of the input value or to that which would give three significant figures when expressed in kelvins, whichever is the most precise.

{{mbox|text=This template will create valid sort keys for '''numbers''' only! Use {{tl|Sms}} for text.}}
__NOTOC__
'''Ntsh''' ('''&lt;u&gt;N&lt;/u&gt;'''umber '''&lt;u&gt;T&lt;/u&gt;'''able '''&lt;u&gt;S&lt;/u&gt;'''orting, '''&lt;u&gt;H&lt;/u&gt;'''idden) generates a hidden sort key that allows numbers to sort correctly when a column of a sortable table needs to be sorted alphabetically. This template is a  hidden version of {{tl|Number table sorting}}. See [[Help:Tables#Sortable_tables]]. It can be used to prefix non-numeric entries; for example, using &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{ntsh|0}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;None&lt;/code&gt; will cause &quot;None&quot; to be sorted as if it had a numeric value of zero. 

This template has the same limitation as {{tl|Number table sorting}}. Please read [[Template:Number table sorting#Limitations]]

===Parameters===
The first unnamed parameter must be a number.

The only option is {{para|debug|yes}} which causes the search key to be displayed in a box followed by the number.

===Usage===
:&lt;code&gt;&amp;#123;&amp;#123;ntsh&amp;#124;''some number''&amp;#125;&amp;#125;&lt;/code&gt;

This template is not intended for use with non numeric input. Doing so will result in an error message.

===Output===
No output is displayed when using almost all browsers. If a text browser is used the result is undefined. See [[Wikipedia:Accessibility#Users with limited CSS/JavaScript support]].

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{ntsh|123456789.00123}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; generates &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;10000000123456789001230&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{ntsh|-123456789.00123}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; generates &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;09999999876543210998769&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{ntsh|123456789.00123|debug=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; generates {{ntsh|123456789.00123|debug=yes}}

This template can be used to generate a generic sort key. See [[Help:Tables#Sortable_tables]]. It is useful in many different situations. For example:
:When used in the first row of a sortable column, it forces the column to sort alphabetically.
:When a cell contains a wiki link, it can be used to force the cell to be sorted by some hidden text and not the bracket.

===Usage===
:&lt;code&gt;&amp;#123;&amp;#123;sms&amp;#124;''some text''&amp;#125;&amp;#125;&lt;/code&gt;

===Output===
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{sms|some text}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; generates &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;&amp;amp;some text&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

{{Template shortcut|Nts}}

This template can be useful when building a [[Help:Tables#Sortable_tables|sortable table]] in which a column contains both numbers and text. This template should be applied to every number in the column. 

Currently, the template works for numbers less than or 10,000,000,000,000,000 (1×10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;) and greater than -10,000,000,000,000,000 (-1×10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;). Numbers outside this range will sort above or below other numbers depending on sign. See the [[#Limitations|Limitations]] section below.

By default the output is displayed using thousands separators. To display numbers as entered, use {{para|format|no}}.

The template generates a hidden &quot;sort key&quot; in the [[HTML]] markup which forces the [[Javascript]] [[w:sorting algorithm|sorting algorithm]] to sort the column alphabetically. 

===Purpose===
There are at two cases where this template is useful:
# When numbers are followed by some text
# When numbers are preceded by some text other than a currency symbol.

===Parameters===
The template has only one required parameter: a real number. These examples use the name of the redirect, {{tl|nts}}, for brevity.

; Optional parameters
* &lt;code&gt;prefix&lt;/code&gt;: To display some text before the number, use {{para|prefix|''some prefix''}}
*: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{nts|123456789.00123|prefix=approx.&amp;amp;nbsp;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; → {{nts|123456789.00123|prefix=approx.&amp;nbsp;}}
* &lt;code&gt;format&lt;/code&gt;: To retain a number's format, use {{para|format|no}}
*: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{nts|123456789.00123}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; → {{nts|123456789.00123}}
*: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{nts|123456789.00123|format=no}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; → {{nts|123456789.00123|format=no}}
* &lt;code&gt;debug&lt;/code&gt;: To display the sort key, use {{para|debug|yes}}.
*: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{nts|123456789.00123|debug=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; → {{nts|123456789.00123|debug=yes}}
*: &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{nts|-123456789.00123|debug=yes}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; → {{nts|-123456789.00123|debug=yes}}

Apart from the added thousands separators the numbers are formatted as supplied (scientific notation or not, leading and trailing zeros, and a zero before the decimal point or not). This formatting does not affect the sorted order except for numbers not satisfying the limitations mentioned below.

===Limitations===
*Any subset of numbers larger than 1×10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; are sorted as greater than 1×10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; but this subset is sorted alphabetically.
*Any subset of numbers smaller than -1×10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; are sorted as less than -1×10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; but this subset is sorted alphabetically.
*If a non-numeric value is given as the first unnamed parameter the results are undefined.
*There is a maximum of 6 digits after the [[w:decimal separator|decimal separator]]. Positive numbers with more than 6 decimal digits should sort correctly but the results for negative numbers with more that 6 decimal digits is undefined.
*A prefix (using the &lt;code&gt;prefix&lt;/code&gt; parameter) does not affect the sort order.

===Examples===
&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{nts|123456789.00123}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; → &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;&amp;0000000123456789.001230&lt;/span&gt;123,456,789.00123&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

For text which follows a number, &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{nts|123,456}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; as of 2012&lt;/code&gt; displays &lt;code&gt;123,456 as of 2012&lt;/code&gt; with a numerical sort key of &lt;code&gt;123456&lt;/code&gt;. This forces numerical sorting in the cell using this value instead of the default alphabetical sorting.

Below are more examples, some of which illustrate the limitations listed above.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;
'''{{PAGENAME}}''' stands for '''&lt;u&gt;N&lt;/u&gt;'''umber '''&lt;u&gt;T&lt;/u&gt;'''able '''&lt;u&gt;S&lt;/u&gt;'''orting '''&lt;u&gt;S&lt;/u&gt;'''caled and display numbers with [[w:Long and short scales|short or long scales]] in a [[Help:Tables#Sortable_tables|sortable table]] and have them numerically sorted in alphabetic sort mode. It is applied to all numbers of a column, in cases where numeric sort mode does not work or is not desired.

=== Usage ===
{{tlx|Ntss|value|scale|long|prefix&amp;#61;prefix}}

Where:

* '''value''' - the significant value that will be displayed in front of the scale (required).
* '''scale''' - scale used with value, see below.
* '''long''' - if included, will use long scales, otherwise uses short scales; see below.
* '''prefix''' - String to display before the number.

==== Decimal scales ====
Using [[w:long and short scales|long and short scales]]:
* thousand, million, billion, trillion, quadrillion, quintillion, sextillion, septillion, octillion

The &quot;long&quot; (old British) scales differ from &quot;billion&quot; (10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt;) onwards. When using long scales, this template also accepts the following -iard scales:
* milliard, billiard, trilliard, quadrilliard

==== Bit and byte scales ====
Using standard [[w:SI prefix|SI prefix]]es:
* bit, kbit, Mbit, Gbit, Tbit, Pbit, Ebit, Zbit, Ybit
* byte or &quot;B&quot;, kB, MB, GB, TB, PB, EB, ZB, YB

Using [[w:binary prefix|binary prefix]]es:
* kibit, Mibit, Gibit, Tibit, Pibit, Eibit, Zibit, Yibit
* kiB, MiB, GiB, TiB, PiB, EiB, ZiB, YiB

&lt;!-- EDIT TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;
'''{{PAGENAME}}''' stands for '''&lt;u&gt;D&lt;/u&gt;'''ate '''&lt;u&gt;T&lt;/u&gt;'''able '''&lt;u&gt;S&lt;/u&gt;'''orting and is used to correctly sort and display dates in a sortable table (see [[Help:Tables#Sortable_tables]]).

==What it solves==
Normally, for proper sorting, dates must be entered in YYYY-MM-DD format. However, that format does not conform to the many books' [[Help:Local manuals of style|manuals of style]] for date display. This template automatically creates the hidden &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;span&amp;nbsp;style=&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;1776-07-04&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; for sorting purposes and then displays the date like this: '''July 4, 1776'''. To hide the output, use the {{tl|dtsh}} template instead.

==Parameters==
{{notice|1=Date display can be modified using two named parameters. 
*To use international date formats, use the &lt;code&gt;format=dmy&lt;/code&gt; parameter. 
*To turn off the suppression of word wraps, use the &lt;code&gt;nowrap=off&lt;/code&gt; parameter.
}}

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|+The year, month and day can either be entered separately or as a single date.
|-
!style=&quot;width:50%;&quot;|{{tlx|dts|''year''|''month''|''day''|''BC''}}
!style=&quot;width:50%;&quot;|{{tlx|dts|''date''}}
|- style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;
|
*1st parameter – Year (optional if month is given)
**Year number – number in the range -9999 through 9999: the numbers -9999 through 0 are used without &quot;bc&quot; and represent astronomical years -9999 through 0, the numbers 1 through 9999 represent that year AD, or BC with the fourth parameter set to bc or BC
*2nd parameter – Month (optional if the day is not given either)
**Full month name – February or february
**Abbreviated month name – Feb or feb
**Month number – 2 or 02
*3rd parameter – Day (optional)
**Day number – 7 or 07
*4th parameter – optional with value BC or bc
**Used with a positive year number

Thus e.g. for the year 5 BC we can use &quot;5|bc&quot; or &quot;-4&quot;.

A time period (year or month and year) is sorted according to its start, and time periods with the same starting moment are in order of descending length: a year comes before its first month; a month comes before its first day.
|
*1st parameter – the full date in international, US or YYYY-MM-DD format
**It uses {{[[mw:Help:Extension:ParserFunctions#.23time:|#time:]]}} and so is limited to what the parser function can handle (e.g. it won't go beyond 100 AD).
**International format is left as it is.  YYYY-MM-DD format defaults to US format.
**Abbreviated months are accepted.
**Capitalisation and comma mistakes are corrected.
|}

===Input===
{{tlx|dts|''year''|''month''|''day''|''BC''}}
*{{&lt;code&gt;dts|1776|July|4&lt;/code&gt;}}
{{tlx|dts|''date''}}
*{{&lt;code&gt;dts|1776-07-04&lt;/code&gt;}}
*{{&lt;code&gt;dts|July 4, 1776&lt;/code&gt;}}
*{{&lt;code&gt;dts|4 July 1776&lt;/code&gt;}}

When supplying a single parameter for the date, it is accepted and interpreted according to the  [http://www.php.net/manual/en/datetime.formats.php php date/time format], except that a single number is interpreted as a year. By default the date is shown as supplied. If the first parameter is not just the year, but no format parameter is supplied, due to a call of function &lt;code&gt;#time&lt;/code&gt; the maximum number of calls of this template on a page is 1200.

Using &lt;code&gt;format&lt;/code&gt; produces a format that depends on, but is not necessarily equal to the format of the supplied date. This requires multiple calls of function &lt;code&gt;#time&lt;/code&gt;, reducing the maximum number of calls of this template on a page in the worst case to 88, see below.

Also see the [[#Examples|examples]] below.

===Output===
Output sent to table
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;01776-07-04&lt;/span&gt; July 4, 1776&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; or
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;01776-07-04&lt;/span&gt; 4 July 1776&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;

Output displayed to user&lt;br&gt;
*July 4, 1776 or
*4 July 1776

===Linking===
The template formerly linked dates automatically. To turn linking off the parameter &lt;code&gt;link=off&lt;/code&gt; was used. In accordance with current guidelines linking is no longer supported. Please do not use this parameter. Please remove it from existing transclusions.

==Examples==
{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!Normal function of the template.
!The template with &lt;code&gt;debug=yes&lt;/code&gt;, which causes hidden parts to appear:
|- style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;
|
{{dts/examples}}
|
{{dts/examples|debug=yes}}
|}

==Abbreviating the month name==
The template displays the name of the month either in abbreviated form or fully spelled out.  There are two ways of controlling which is used.
#Directly input the desired format.
#Use the &lt;code&gt;abbr&lt;/code&gt; parameter.
Note that the method to use is determined by the input.  The first method works wherever the second method fails and only in these cases.  The following explains which method to use.

;All numeric input
If the month is input as a number, the default is to spell it out in full.  
*{{&lt;code&gt;dts|2000-01-01&lt;/code&gt;}} gives &quot;{{dts|2000-01-01}}&quot;
*{{&lt;code&gt;dts|2000|1|1&lt;/code&gt;}} gives &quot;{{dts|2000|1|1}}&quot;
In this case the month can be abbreviated by setting &lt;code&gt;abbr&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;on&lt;code&gt;.
*{{&lt;code&gt;dts|2000-01-01|abbr=on&lt;/code&gt;}} gives &quot;{{dts|2000-01-01|abbr=on}}&quot;
*{{&lt;code&gt;dts|2000|1|1|abbr=on&lt;/code&gt;}} gives &quot;{{dts|2000|1|1|abbr=on}}&quot;

;Entering a non-numeric month as the second unnamed parameter
The name of the month either in abbreviated form or fully spelled out when input as the second unnamed parameter.  In either case the output form is equivalent to the input form.
*{{&lt;code&gt;dts|2000|January|1&lt;/code&gt;}} gives &quot;{{dts|2000|January|1}}&quot;
*{{&lt;code&gt;dts|2000|Jan|1&lt;/code&gt;}} gives &quot;{{dts|2000|Jan|1}}&quot;

;The whole date as a single parameter with a non-numeric month
The if the whole date is entered as a single parameter with a non-numeric month, the default is to display the date as input.  In this case either abbreviate or fully spelled out the name of the month as desired.
*{{&lt;code&gt;dts|1 January 2000&lt;/code&gt;}} gives &quot;{{dts|1 January 2000}}&quot;
*{{&lt;code&gt;dts|1 Jan 2000&lt;/code&gt;}} gives &quot;{{dts|1 Jan 2000}}&quot;
Using the &lt;code&gt;format&lt;/code&gt; parameter overrides this default behavior and the month name is spelled out in full by default. In this case the month can be abbreviated by setting &lt;code&gt;abbr&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;on&lt;code&gt;.
*{{&lt;code&gt;dts|1 January 2000&lt;/code&gt;|format=my}} gives &quot;{{dts|1 January 2000|format=my}}&quot;
*{{&lt;code&gt;dts|1 Jan 2000|format=my&lt;/code&gt;}} gives &quot;{{dts|1 Jan 2000|format=my}}&quot;
*{{&lt;code&gt;dts|1 January 2000&lt;/code&gt;|format=my|abbr=on}} gives &quot;{{dts|1 January 2000|format=my|abbr=on}}&quot;
*{{&lt;code&gt;dts|1 Jan 2000|format=my|abbr=on&lt;/code&gt;}} gives &quot;{{dts|1 Jan 2000|format=my|abbr=on}}&quot;

==Error handling==
Entering an invalid date format will (generally)&lt;!--It's not quite perfect.--&gt; produce an error message such as the one below.
&lt;blockquote&gt;{{dts|35 June 1900}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Part XII.2 was enacted in Bill C61 to meet Canada's international obligations under the United Nations Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances.&lt;Ref&gt;
Hubbard, Murphy, ODonnell, &quot;Money Laundering &amp; Proceeds of Crime&quot; (Irwin Law 2004) at p.79&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of Part XII.2 is to &quot;neutralize criminal organizations by taking the proceeds of their illegal activities away from them.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
Quebec (AG) v Laroche, [2002] SCJ No 74&lt;/ref&gt; It is also intended to recognize &quot;that some crime is big business, and that massive profits, both direct and indirect, can be made from criminal activity.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R v Wilson, (1993) 86 CCC (3d) 464 (ONCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Proceeds of Crime Defined===

Section 462.3 defines Proceeds of Crime as:
{{quotation|
“proceeds of crime” means any property, benefit or advantage, within or outside Canada, obtained or derived directly or indirectly as a result of

(a) the commission in Canada of a designated offence, or

(b) an act or omission anywhere that, if it had occurred in Canada, would have constituted a designated offence.
|[http://www.canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec462.3]}}



==Restraint of Proceeds of Crime==
Pursuant to section 462.33, on application by the Attorney General, the court may order that certain property be restrained.&lt;ref&gt;s.462.33(1)[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec462.33]&lt;/ref&gt;

The court may make the order where it is satisfied that &quot;there are reasonable grounds to believe that there exists&quot; there is property for which an order of forfeiture may be made &quot;in respect of a designated offence alleged to have been committed within the province in which the judge has jurisdiction&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;s. 462.33(3)&lt;/ref&gt; 

The order will have the effect of &quot;prohibiting any person from disposing of, or otherwise dealing with any interest in, the property specified in the order otherwise than in the manner that may be specified in the order.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;s. 462.33(3)&lt;/ref&gt;

The application must consist of:&lt;ref&gt;s. 462.33(3) [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec462.33]&lt;/ref&gt;
# a written application
# affidavit outlining:
## the offender or matter under investigation
## person believed to be in possession
## grounds for this belief
## grounds for belief that the order may be made under s.462.37(1), (2.01) or 462.38(2)
## a description of the property, and
## whether any previous application has been made

The application can be made ''ex parte''.&lt;Ref&gt;s. 462.33(2)[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec462.33]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forfeiture of Proceeds of Crime==

====Money====
To seize money during a criminal proceedings, the Crown must prove on a balance of probabilities that:
# The seized monies are in relation to offences for which the defendant has been convicted;  and,
# The property is proceeds of crime.

&quot;Property of an offender&quot; under s. 462.37(3) can include stolen cash&lt;ref&gt;Robichaud v. R., 2011 NBCA 112 [http://www.canlii.org/en/nb/nbca/doc/2011/2011nbca112/2011nbca112.html]&lt;/ref&gt; and so can be forfeited under those provisions.

==Fine in Lieu of Forfeiture==
Where the judge finds that property can be forfeited under s. 462.37(1) or (2.01), the court has the ability order that the offender pay a fine instead.

{{quotation|
'''Fine instead of forfeiture'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) If a court is satisfied that an order of forfeiture under subsection (1) or (2.01) should be made in respect of any property of an offender but that the property or any part of or interest in the property cannot be made subject to an order, the court may, instead of ordering the property or any part of or interest in the property to be forfeited, order the offender to pay a fine in an amount equal to the value of the property or the part of or interest in the property. In particular, a court may order the offender to pay a fine if the property or any part of or interest in the property
:(a) cannot, on the exercise of due diligence, be located;
:(b) has been transferred to a third party;
:(c) is located outside Canada;
:(d) has been substantially diminished in value or rendered worthless; or
:(e) has been commingled with other property that cannot be divided without difficulty.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec462.37 CCC]
}}


===Default===
Where the offender cannot pay the fine amount by the date required by the fine order, the offender will be in default. The judge will specify the penalty in default at the time of the making of the fine order.

Section 462.37(4) addresses default penalties:
{{quotation|
'''Imprisonment in default of payment of fine'''&lt;br&gt;
(4) Where a court orders an offender to pay a fine pursuant to subsection (3), the court shall
:(a) impose, in default of payment of that fine, a term of imprisonment
::(i) not exceeding six months, where the amount of the fine does not exceed ten thousand dollars,
::(ii) of not less than six months and not exceeding twelve months, where the amount of the fine exceeds ten thousand dollars but does not exceed twenty thousand dollars,
::(iii) of not less than twelve months and not exceeding eighteen months, where the amount of the fine exceeds twenty thousand dollars but does not exceed fifty thousand dollars,
::(iv) of not less than eighteen months and not exceeding two years, where the amount of the fine exceeds fifty thousand dollars but does not exceed one hundred thousand dollars,
::(v) of not less than two years and not exceeding three years, where the amount of the fine exceeds one hundred thousand dollars but does not exceed two hundred and fifty thousand dollars,
::(vi) of not less than three years and not exceeding five years, where the amount of the fine exceeds two hundred and fifty thousand dollars but does not exceed one million dollars, or
::(vii) of not less than five years and not exceeding ten years, where the amount of the fine exceeds one million dollars; and
:(b) direct that the term of imprisonment imposed pursuant to paragraph (a) be served consecutively to any other term of imprisonment imposed on the offender or that the offender is then serving.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The table below lists units supported by this template. It is divided up according to the quantity being measured. Not all supported units are listed here; there are links to more complete lists for each quantity.

The codes listed in the ''unit-code'' column (column 3) are accepted as input by the template.
These can be used as the second or third unnamed parameter. For some units there exist alternative codes. These are listed in brackets and have been incorporated to make the code more flexible for editors, e.g. °F ''or'' F may be entered.

The codes listed in the ''combinations'' column (column 7) can be used to produce multiple conversions. They can only be used as the third unnamed parameter, e.g. &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{convert|55|nmi|km mi}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; produces &quot;{{convert|55|nmi|km mi}}&quot;.

The '''Template:Convert/list of units/item''' processes one unit-code to display within the tables of the documentation page {{tl|Convert/list of units}} for [[Template:Convert]]. The parameters are:
:* T - the unit code
:* note - a text note to display in the table
:* rowspan - the number of table rows the unit will span
:* altab - the altab
:* uk - the spelling for a U.K. variation
:* fmt - beginning markup to format the conversion factor
:* fmtend - ending markup to format the conversion factor
:* d - (internal) template name to format data as a table row
This template invokes a typical conversion of a unit, but rather than converting to another unit, it triggers the display of the internal data used to calculate the specified conversion.

&lt;br /&gt;The '''[[Template:Convert/list_of_units/row]]''' displays one row of the unit-code tables in the {{tl|Convert/list_of_units}} documentation page. The template operates as a conversion output formatter, invoked during a partial conversion as the {d} display template (rather than converting to another unit). Parameters:
:* parameter 1 - the unit text title
:* parameter 2 - (not used)
:* parameter 3 - the rowspan setting (1 or 2)
:* parameter 4 - the {altab} text to show &quot;( )&quot; after the unit text, else {fmt}
:* parameter 5 - beginning markup {fmt} to format conversion factor {b}
:* parameter 6 - ending markup {fmtend} for conversion factor {b}
:* {n}, {u}, {t} - the unit name, symbol &amp; article title of the unit
:* {s} - the U.K. spelling of the unit (aka uk=...)
:* {b} - conversion factor defined for unit &quot;zz&quot; in {Convert/zz}
This template, used for documentation, is invoked from each {Convert/&lt;unit&gt;} to display one of the rows in each section's table of the short list of Convert's unit-codes. However, several rows in {Convert/list_of_units} are hard-coded rather than using this template to display {n}, {u}, {t} and {b} for a particular unit-code. The assignment of the 6 numbered parameters, as passed here, is set by template {{tl|Convert/list of units/item}}, acting as a dynamic template which changes it's target template based on the unit-code.

&lt;!-- EDIT TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;

The {{Tl|e}} and {{tl|10^}} templates are intended to facilitate and make uniform [[w:scientific notation|scientific notation]] numbers. The {{tl|10^}} template works exactly as described below except that it does not generate a multiplication (“×”) symbol.

=== Basic usage ===
To render {{green|3.14&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;}}, instead of writing {{green|&lt;nowiki&gt;3.14&amp;amp;nbsp;×&amp;amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;&amp;amp;minus;12&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} you can write {{green|&lt;nowiki&gt;3.14{{e|-12}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}:

&lt;nowiki&gt;a{{e|b}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; gives a{{e|b}} gives

&lt;nowiki&gt;{{10^|b}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; gives {{10^|b}}

&lt;nowiki&gt;{{10^|-12}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; gives {{10^|-12}}

=== Delimitation ===
The template uses the delimitation logic of the {{tl|val}} template. That is, typing {{green|&lt;nowiki&gt;1.2{{e|12341}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} will produce a delimited exponent ({{green|1.2{{e|12341}}}}). See ''[[#Forcing text display]]'' to turn this off.

=== Text and number recognition ===
By default, the template recognizes both text and numbers. That is, typing {{green|&lt;nowiki&gt;3.14{{e|-12}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}  will produce {{green|3.14{{e|-12}}}}, with the proper [[w:minus sign|minus sign]] ({{green|&amp;minus;}}), rather than with a [[w:hyphen|hyphen]] ({{green|-}}). However, typing {{green|&lt;nowiki&gt;A{{e|-BC}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} will produce {{green|A{{e|-BC}}}} since {{green|BC}} is not a number. In those cases, you need to write {{green|&lt;nowiki&gt;A{{e|&amp;amp;minus;BC}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} to produce the correct {{green|A{{e|&amp;minus;BC}}}}.

A minus sign also has to be provided for cases like {{green|1.2{{e|1 &amp;minus; 2}}}} ({{green|&lt;nowiki&gt;1.2{{e|1 &amp;amp;minus; 2}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}).

=== Explicit plus sign ===
To explicitly display the {{green|+}} character, write {{green|&lt;nowiki&gt;1.2{{e|4|plus}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} which will produce {{green|1.2{{e|&amp;#43;4}}}}.

=== Forcing text display ===
To force the template to display the input as text, and forgo the automatic delimitation and the recognition of the hyphen as a minus sign, write {{green|&lt;nowiki&gt;1.2{{e|-42342|text}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}}, which will display {{green|1.2&amp;nbsp;&amp;times;&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;-42342&lt;/sup&gt;}} instead of {{green|1.2{{e|-42342}}}}. This can also be used as an alternative to explicitly display the plus sign ({{green|&lt;nowiki&gt;1.2{{e|+4|text}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;}} gives {{green|1.2{{e|&amp;#43;4}}}}), but remember that you also lose delimitation if you do it this way.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Detention of things search==
Property seized under s. 489.1 while executing a search warrant can be detained on ex parte application to a justice of the peace under s.490:
{{quotation|
'''Detention of things seized'''&lt;br&gt;
490. (1) Subject to this or any other Act of Parliament, where, pursuant to paragraph 489.1(1)(b) or subsection 489.1(2), anything that has been seized is brought before a justice or a report in respect of anything seized is made to a justice, the justice shall,
:(a) where the lawful owner or person who is lawfully entitled to possession of the thing seized is known, order it to be returned to that owner or person, unless the prosecutor, or the peace officer or other person having custody of the thing seized, satisfies the justice that the detention of the thing seized is required for the purposes of any investigation or a preliminary inquiry, trial or other proceeding; or
:(b) where the prosecutor, or the peace officer or other person having custody of the thing seized, satisfies the justice that the thing seized should be detained for a reason set out in paragraph (a), detain the thing seized or order that it be detained, taking reasonable care to ensure that it is preserved until the conclusion of any investigation or until it is required to be produced for the purposes of a preliminary inquiry, trial or other proceeding.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Further detention'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) Nothing shall be detained under the authority of paragraph (1)(b) for a period of more than three months after the day of the seizure, or any longer period that ends when an application made under paragraph (a) is decided, unless
:(a) a justice, on the making of a summary application to him after three clear days notice thereof to the person from whom the thing detained was seized, is satisfied that, having regard to the nature of the investigation, its further detention for a specified period is warranted and the justice so orders; or
:(b) proceedings are instituted in which the thing detained may be required.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Idem'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) More than one order for further detention may be made under paragraph (2)(a) but the cumulative period of detention shall not exceed one year from the day of the seizure, or any longer period that ends when an application made under paragraph (a) is decided, unless
:(a) a judge of a superior court of criminal jurisdiction or a judge as defined in section 552, on the making of a summary application to him after three clear days notice thereof to the person from whom the thing detained was seized, is satisfied, having regard to the complex nature of the investigation, that the further detention of the thing seized is warranted for a specified period and subject to such other conditions as the judge considers just, and the judge so orders; or
:(b) proceedings are instituted in which the thing detained may be required.

==Forfeiture of things seized==
The property seized under s. 489 and , such as counterfeit products or proceeds of crime, can be forfeited to the Attorney General by way on an application to a court of competent jurisdiction under s.490(9). Section 490(9) is found in Part XV of the Code titled &quot;Special Procedure and Powers&quot; which states:
{{quotation|
s. 490...&lt;Br&gt;
'''Disposal of things seized'''&lt;br&gt;
(9) Subject to this or any other Act of Parliament, if
:(a) a judge referred to in subsection (7), where a judge ordered the detention of anything seized under subsection (3), or
:(b) a justice, in any other case,
&lt;P&gt;
is satisfied that the periods of detention provided for or ordered under subsections (1) to (3) in respect of anything seized have expired and proceedings have not been instituted in which the thing detained may be required or, where those periods have not expired, that the continued detention of the thing seized will not be required for any purpose mentioned in subsection (1) or (4), he shall
:(c) if possession of it by the person from whom it was seized is lawful, order it to be returned to that person, or
:(d) if possession of it by the person from whom it was seized is unlawful and the lawful owner or person who is lawfully entitled to its possession is known, order it to be returned to the lawful owner or to the person who is lawfully entitled to its possession,
&lt;P&gt;
and may, if possession of it by the person from whom it was seized is unlawful, or if it was seized when it was not in the possession of any person, and the lawful owner or person who is lawfully entitled to its possession is not known, order it to be forfeited to Her Majesty, to be disposed of as the Attorney General directs, or otherwise dealt with in accordance with the law.

}}

Section 490(9) can be used to forfeit crime-tainted cash seized during an investigation. Thus, this provision can be used in much same manner as Part XII.2 provisions for proceeds of crime.&lt;ReF&gt;
R v Daley (2001) 156 CCC (3d) 225 (Alta. CA)&lt;/ref&gt; It was clearly determined that s. 490(9) does not affect and is not affected by the similar powers found in Part XII.2.&lt;REf&gt;
British Columbia (AG) v Forseth, (1995) 99 CCC (3d) 296 (BCCA), [http://canlii.ca/t/1ddf3 1995 CanLII 364] at 24 to 26&lt;/ref&gt; 

In order for an application under s.490(9) to be made, all parties must have an &quot;opportunity to call or present evidence and be heard&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;British Columbia (AG) v Forseth, (1995) 99 CCC (3d) 296 (BCCA), [http://canlii.ca/t/1ddf3 1995 CanLII 364] at 30&lt;/ref&gt;

This section in no way requires that there be a conviction before the application for forfeiture can be made.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Zamora, [2000] BCJ No. 1480 (PC) at para. 31, 42&lt;/ref&gt;

For all property seized under s. 490, there is a presumption of lawful entitlement based on possession. It is not for the possessor to prove that the property was not tainted by criminal activity. The crown must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the possessor is not entitled to the property.&lt;Ref&gt;
Re Mac and the Queen, (1995) 97 CCC (3d) 115 (Ont.CA) at para 31 citing R v Flemming [1986] 1 SCR 415
&lt;/ref&gt;

To forfeit under s. 490 the crown should prove that the property &quot;are proceeds of crime or sufficiently associated with criminality that they should be forfeited.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
R v Hicks [2000] BCJ No 2653 (PC) at para 34&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the Crown can still have property forfeited even where there are underlying criminal charges where there was an acquittal.&lt;Ref&gt;
eg. R v Horne, [1997] AJ No 71 (CA) - acquitted for robbery but evidence of property connected to a crime&lt;/ref&gt;

For a provincial court judge to have jurisdiction to consider an application under s. 490(9), there must have been an initial application for detention. Without such application, there is no jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;APC Music &amp; Video Inc. v. The Vancouver Police Department and Sergeant Doug Fisher, [http://canlii.ca/t/1jfzs 2004 BCSC 1657] at 28,34&lt;/ref&gt;

For an application under s. 490(9) to succeed the applicant must establish;&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Gill, [http://canlii.ca/t/1qtwq 2007 ABPC 69] at para 28 in the context of money&lt;/ref&gt;
# items were ordered detained under s.490(1);
# that the items seized is no longer required for a purpose set out in s. 490(1);
# the period of detention ordered under s.489 has expired;
# the item either does not have a lawful owner or the lawful owner is unknown, ''or'' the item is tainted by criminality and as such possession is unlawful.

The burden is upon the applicant to establish the elements beyond a reasonable doubt.&lt;Ref&gt;Canada (A.G.) v. Luther, [http://canlii.ca/t/4tz6 2002 NSSC 100] at 5&lt;/ref&gt;

There is varying case law on whether the normal rules of evidence in criminal matters applies, prohibiting the court cannot consider hearsay evidence.&lt;Ref&gt;
Refusing hearsay: &lt;br&gt;
Canada (A.G.) v. Luther, [http://canlii.ca/t/4tz6 2002 NSSC 100]&lt;br&gt;
Admitting hearsay:&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Allan [http://canlii.ca/t/1hkvm 2003 CanLII 1935] (ON SC), (2003), 64 O.R. (3d) 610 (S.C.)&lt;br&gt;

==Return of Things Seized==
The initial possessor of the items can apply under section 490(7) to have the items returned to them. Section 490(7) states:
{{quotation|
'''Application for order of return'''&lt;br&gt;
(7) A person from whom anything has been seized may, after the expiration of the periods of detention provided for or ordered under subsections (1) to (3) and on three clear days notice to the Attorney General, apply summarily to
:(a) a judge of a superior court of criminal jurisdiction or a judge as defined in section 552, where a judge ordered the detention of the thing seized under subsection (3), or
:(b) a justice, in any other case,
&lt;P&gt;
for an order under paragraph (9)(c) that the thing seized be returned to the applicant.

&lt;!-- EDIT TEMPLATE DOCUMENTATION BELOW THIS LINE --&gt;

==Purpose==
This template is used to easily present values in [[w:scientific notation|scientific notation]], including uncertainty and/or units. It wraps the entire result in a {{tl|nowrap}} block, so that it never gets broken into separate pieces at the end of a line. 

== Arguments ==
There are four ways this template can be used:
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;val|''number''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; - for displaying values without uncertainty/significance.
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;val|''number''|''uncertainty''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; - for displaying values with uncertainty like so {{val|1234|56}}.
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;val|''number''|''upper uncertainty''|''lower uncertainty''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; - for displaying values with uncertainty like so {{val|1234|+56|-78}}.
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{&lt;/nowiki&gt;val|''number''|(''significance'')&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; - for displaying values with significance like so {{val|1234|(56)}}.
They all take roughly the same arguments:
{|
|style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;| '''1'''  || The value (must be a valid number)
|-
|style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;| '''2'''  || The (upper limit of) uncertainty (must be a valid number) or significance (must be a valid number in parenthesis)
|-
|style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;| '''3'''  || The lower limit of uncertainty (must be a valid negative number)
|-
|style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;| '''e'''  || The exponent for the power of 10 (optional). This will show up in the result as &quot;&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10{{su|p=e}}&quot;.
|-
|style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;| '''u''' / '''ul'''   || The units for the number (optional, with/without a link to the page about the unit respectively).
|-
|style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;| '''up''' / '''upl''' || The units per for the units (optional, requires '''u''' to be specified, with/without a link to the page about the unit respectively).
:Units (specified by '''u''', '''ul''', '''up''' and '''upl''') are replaced by a more aesthetically pleasing HTML representation and get a link ('''ul''' and '''upl''' only, if they are in the list found in {{tl|val/units}} or if they are supported by {{tl|convert}}). You can specify units using just '''u'''; a good example is &quot;ul=m/s&quot;, which gets translated to &quot;[[w:Metre per second|m·s&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;]]&quot;, or you can use '''u''' and '''up''', as in &quot;u/up&quot;; a good examples if &quot;ul=m|up=s&quot;, which gets translated to &quot;[[w:Metre|m]]/s&quot;.
|-
|style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;| '''p'''  || A prefix for the value (such as ∆, ⌀, etc.; optional).
|-
|style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;| '''s'''  || A suffix for the value (such as %, optional).
:Prefixes (specified by '''p''') and suffixes (specified by '''s''') are put in front of or behind the value ''as is'': this includes spaces. They are inside the ''nowrap'' block and will always be on the same line as the value. The parameters that previously provided this functionality ('''h''' for header and '''f''' for footer) are ''deprecated'' and will be ignored.
|-
|-
|style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;| '''end''' || Appends something after the main value. For example, &lt;nowiki&gt;{{val|123.24|end=...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; gives {{val|123.24|end=...}}
|-
|style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;| '''errend''' || Appends something after the uncertainty. For example, &lt;nowiki&gt;{{val|123.23|end=...|2.34|errend=...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; gives {{val|123.23|end=...|2.34|errend=...}}
|-
|style=&quot;vertical-align:top;&quot;| {{nowrap|'''+errend'''}} &amp; {{nowrap|'''-errend'''}} || Appends something after the positive/negative uncertainties. For example, &lt;nowiki&gt;{{val|123.23|end=...|+2.34|+errend=...|-1.23|-errend=...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; gives {{val|123.23|end=...|+2.34|+errend=...|-1.23|-errend=...}}
|}

== Errors ==
There is strict checking on the validity of arguments; any incorrect use will result in an error, which is displayed using {{tl|Formatting error}}.

== Format convention ==
{{tl|val}} should produce formatting compliant with the ''U.S. Government Printing Office Style Manual'', in [http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=2008_style_manual&amp;docid=f:chapter12.pdf rules 12.9e and 12.14], which requires that the [[w:decimal separator|decimal separator]] be a [[w:full stop|full stop]]; i.e. “decimal point” (.), requires comma-delimiting to the left of the decimal point for numbers with four or more digits to the left (values of {{val|1000}} or more), and also requires space-delimiting to the right of the decimal point for numbers containing five or more digits to the right (e.g., {{val|0.12345}} and {{val|5.12345}} and {{val|125.12345}}).

Note that if &lt;nowiki&gt;{{val}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; is used on numbers simultaneously comprising four or more digits to the left of the decimal point ''and'' five or more digits to the right, the resultant expression will delimited with commas left and spaces (actually non-selectable, non-breaking, narrow gaps) right (see below).

== Examples ==
:{|
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{val|1234567890}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;||&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;||{{val|1234567890}}

|}

==Performance impact==
For most uses, in the text of pages, Template:Val will not restrict performance, but when used inside the wikitext markup of large templates, there are some restrictions. When displaying integer amounts, Template:Val has an internal [[m:Help:Expansion depth|expansion depth]] of 15 levels, but for numbers with decimal portions, it uses 22 levels, or more.

'''Application for restraint order'''&lt;br&gt;
490.8 (1) The Attorney General may make an application in accordance with this section for a restraint order under this section in respect of any offence-related property.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Procedure'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) An application made under subsection (1) for a restraint order in respect of any offence-related property may be made ex parte and shall be made in writing to a judge and be accompanied by an affidavit sworn on the information and belief of the Attorney General or any other person deposing to the following matters:
:(a) the indictable offence to which the offence-related property relates;
:(b) the person who is believed to be in possession of the offence-related property; and
:(c) a description of the offence-related property.&lt;br&gt;

'''Restraint order'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) Where an application for a restraint order is made to a judge under subsection (1), the judge may, if satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the property is offence-related property, make a restraint order prohibiting any person from disposing of, or otherwise dealing with any interest in, the offence-related property specified in the order otherwise than in the manner that may be specified in the order.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Property outside Canada'''&lt;br&gt;
(3.1) A restraint order may be issued under this section in respect of property situated outside Canada, with any modifications that the circumstances require.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec490.8 CCC]
}}

Under s. 490.8(1), the Attorney General may make an application for a restraint order against &quot;offence-related property&quot;. 

Under s. 490.8(2), the application can be made ex parte and consist of an affidavit which includes:
#the indictable offence to which the offence-related property relates;
#the person who is believed to be in possession of the offence-related property; and
#a description of the offence-related property.

To make the order, the judge must be satisfied that &quot;that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the property is offence-related property, make a restraint order prohibiting any person from disposing of, or otherwise dealing with any interest in, the offence-related property specified in the order otherwise than in the manner that may be specified in the order.&quot;(s. 490.8(4))

==Forfeiture of Property on Conviction==
Section 490.1(1) permits the forfeiture of &quot;offence-related property&quot; on application of the crown:
{{quotation|
'''Order of forfeiture of property on conviction'''&lt;br&gt;
490.1 (1) Subject to sections 490.3 to 490.41, if a person is convicted of an indictable offence under this Act or the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act and, on application of the Attorney General, the court is satisfied, on a balance of probabilities, that any property is offence-related property and that the offence was committed in relation to that property, the court shall
:(a) where the prosecution of the offence was commenced at the instance of the government of a province and conducted by or on behalf of that government, order that the property be forfeited to Her Majesty in right of that province and disposed of by the Attorney General or Solicitor General of that province in accordance with the law; and
:(b) in any other case, order that the property be forfeited to Her Majesty in right of Canada and disposed of by the member of the Queen’s Privy Council for Canada that may be designated for the purpose of this paragraph in accordance with the law.
|[http://www.canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec490.1 CCC]
}}

Under s. 290.1(2), for property to be forfeited, the court must be satisfied that the offence convicted was &quot;committed in relation to property in respect of which an order of forfeiture would otherwise be made under subsection (1) but the court is satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the property is offence-related property, the court may make an order of forfeiture under subsection (1) in relation to that property.&quot;


{{reflist|2}}

==''In Rem'' Forfeiture==
{{quotation|
'''Application for in rem forfeiture'''&lt;br&gt;
490.2 (1) If an information has been laid in respect of an indictable offence under this Act or the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act, the Attorney General may make an application to a judge for an order of forfeiture under subsection (2).
&lt;br&gt;
'''Order of forfeiture of property'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) Subject to sections 490.3 to 490.41, the judge to whom an application is made under subsection (1) shall order that the property that is subject to the application be forfeited and disposed of in accordance with subsection (4) if the judge is satisfied
:(a) beyond a reasonable doubt that the property is offence-related property;
:(b) that proceedings in respect of an indictable offence under this Act or the Corruption of Foreign Public Officials Act in relation to the property were commenced; and
:(c) that the accused charged with the offence has died or absconded.&lt;br&gt;

|[http://www.canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec490.2 CCC]}}

The application can be made to a provincial court or superior court judge.&lt;ref&gt; s. 490.2(5)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Considerations in Forfeiture of Dwelling-House==
Where the matter sought to be forfeited is a dwelling-house, the court must take into consideration further factors:
{{quotation|
'''Factors in relation to dwelling-house'''&lt;br&gt;
(4) Where all or part of the property that would otherwise be forfeited under subsection 490.1(1) or 490.2(2) is a dwelling-house, when making a decision under subsection (3), the court shall also consider
:(a) the impact of an order of forfeiture on any member of the immediate family of the person charged with or convicted of the offence, if the dwelling-house was the member’s principal residence at the time the charge was laid and continues to be the member’s principal residence; and
:(b) whether the member referred to in paragraph (a) appears innocent of any complicity in the offence or of any collusion in relation to the offence.&lt;br&gt;

===Vehicles===
The vehicle used to transport drugs that were the subject of a CDSA conviction is offence-related property and so can be seized.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Kopp, [http://canlii.ca/t/fpbml 2011 MBPC 74] &lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}

==Forfeiture of Offence-related Weapons==
Section 491 requires the forfeiture of weapons:
{{Quotation|
'''Forfeiture of weapons and ammunition'''&lt;br&gt;
491. (1) Subject to subsection (2), where it is determined by a court that
:(a) a weapon, an imitation firearm, a prohibited device, any ammunition, any prohibited ammunition or an explosive substance was used in the commission of an offence and that thing has been seized and detained, or
:(b) that a person has committed an offence that involves, or the subject-matter of which is, a firearm, a cross-bow, a prohibited weapon, a restricted weapon, a prohibited device, ammunition, prohibited ammunition or an explosive substance and any such thing has been seized and detained,
&lt;br&gt;
the thing so seized and detained is forfeited to Her Majesty and shall be disposed of as the Attorney General directs.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Return to lawful owner'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) If the court by which a determination referred to in subsection (1) is made is satisfied that the lawful owner of any thing that is or may be forfeited to Her Majesty under subsection (1) was not a party to the offence and had no reasonable grounds to believe that the thing would or might be used in the commission of an offence, the court shall order that the thing be returned to that lawful owner, that the proceeds of any sale of the thing be paid to that lawful owner or, if the thing was destroyed, that an amount equal to the value of the thing be paid to the owner.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Application of proceeds'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) Where any thing in respect of which this section applies is sold, the proceeds of the sale shall be paid to the Attorney General or, where an order is made under subsection (2), to the person who was, immediately prior to the sale, the lawful owner of the thing.
&lt;br&gt;
R.S., 1985, c. C-46, s. 491; 1991, c. 40, s. 30; 1995, c. 39, s. 152. |
[http://www.canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec491 CCC]
}}

Under 491(1), the court shall order the forfeiture of weapons or ammunition where it is determined that:
# a weapon was used in the commission of an offence and the weapon has been seized by police, or
# an offence involved or the subject-matter is a firearm, a cross-bow, a prohibited weapon, a restricted weapon, a prohibited device, ammunition, prohibited ammunition or an explosive substance and it has been seized

If so, the thing seized is to be &quot;forfeited to Her Majesty and shall be disposed of as the Attorney General directs.&quot;

__NOTOC__
=== Usage ===
:::: {&amp;#123;'''Val/delimitnum/fraction''' |0.123456 |6}} &amp;nbsp; &amp;rarr; {{Val/delimitnum/fraction |0.123456 |6}}

'''[[Template:Val/delimitnum/fraction]]''' is used by template {{tl|Val}}. It formats a positive number lower than 1, using a given number of decimal digits after a decimal dot. It does not show the dot (&quot;.&quot;), only the digits, in groups of 3 or 4, separated by thin spaces (small gaps).

=== Parameters ===
Parameter 1 is the required positive value to display lower than 1 (i.e. the fractional part of a positive real, with no spaces). Note that its value is not restricted in this template, as it is assumed to be valid (see {{tl|Val/delimitnum}} for how it is computed). The amount in {1} could be an entire number (3400.65), but only the decimal portion will be displayed (&quot;65&quot;).

Parameter 2 is the number of decimals to display (the count of digits after the decimal dot).

=== Examples ===
:* {&amp;#123;Val/delimitnum/fraction|0.12345|5}} &amp;rarr; {{Val/delimitnum/fraction|0.12345|5}}
:* {&amp;#123;Val/delimitnum/fraction|0.12345|4}} &amp;rarr; {{Val/delimitnum/fraction|0.12345|4}}
:* {&amp;#123;Val/delimitnum/fraction|0.54321|8}} &amp;rarr; {{Val/delimitnum/fraction|0.54321|8}}
:* {&amp;#123;Val/delimitnum/fraction|0.98765432101234|14}} &amp;rarr; {{Val/delimitnum/fraction|0.98765432101234|14}}
:* {&amp;#123;Val/delimitnum/fraction|560.123|3}} &amp;rarr; {{Val/delimitnum/fraction|560.123|3}}
:* {&amp;#123;Val/delimitnum/fraction|99000800.7|1}} &amp;rarr; {{Val/delimitnum/fraction|99000800.7|1}}

===Messages===
The following messages might appear:
:* &lt;span style=&quot;color:#818181&quot;&gt;'''Too many digits'''.&lt;/span&gt; - when parameter 2 &gt; 14.
:* &lt;span style=&quot;color:#818181&quot;&gt;'''Expression error: Unexpected number'''.&lt;/span&gt; - when invalid spaces in number &quot;0.123 456&quot;.
:* &lt;span style=&quot;color:#818181&quot;&gt;'''Expression error: Unrecognised punctuation...{'''.&lt;/span&gt; - if exceeded [[m:Help:Expansion depth|expansion depth limit]].

===Performance impact===
Template:Val/delimitnum/fraction limits the count of decimal digits to 14, based on the limit of computer math for the server computers. For higher counts, it shows: &lt;span style=&quot;color:#818181&quot;&gt;'''Too many digits'''.&lt;/span&gt;. In most uses, within the text of articles, using the template will not restrict performance, but when used inside the wikitext markup of very large templates, there are some restrictions. To display just 1 decimal digit, Val/delimitnum/fraction has an internal [[m:HELP:Expansion depth|expansion depth]] of 4 levels, adding 1 level for each digit of the decimal portion.

For a 7-digit decimal (such as: 0.1234567), it uses a depth of 10 levels (4+6). At the maximum, for a 14-digit decimal (such as: 0.98765432101234), it uses a depth of 17 levels (4+13). In the rare event of exceeding the expansion depth limit, an expression error will be displayed, such as: &lt;span style=&quot;color:#818181&quot;&gt;'''Expression error: Unrecognised punctuation character &quot;{&quot;'''.&lt;/span&gt; In general usage, most numbers rarely have more than 5 decimal digits (expansion depth of 8 levels).

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;
Outputs an error message in red into the page. An anchor (FormattingError) is inserted at the start of the error message, so you can find any errors on a page easily by adding '''#FormattingError''' at the end of the URL (e.g.&amp;nbsp;Blah#FormattingError). Used in complex templates that check their arguments for validity, so incorrect use can be spotted while editing a page or afterwards.

=== Usage ===
* &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Formatting error|&lt;/nowiki&gt;''error message''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

This template can be evaluated using the &lt;code&gt;{{#iferror}}&lt;/code&gt; parser function:
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#iferror:{{val|XX}}|error|OK}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; → &lt;code&gt;{{#iferror:{{val|XX}}|error|OK}}&lt;/code&gt;

===Purpose===
Subtemplate for turning an easily typeable name for a unit into a proper scientific notation for the unit ''without'' a link to a page about the unit. See {{tl|val/unitswithlink}} for a version that provides a link to the unit as well. If the template does not have an entry for the unit, it is returned &quot;as is&quot;.

This template is used by {{tl|val}} to translate the '''u''' and '''up''' arguments. When adding a unit of the type X/Y (eg. m/s), please consider adding a X·Y{{sup|-1}} version as well (and name it ''X*Y-1'').

===Arguments===
:'''1'''   = The easily typable name of the unit.

===Examples===
{|
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{val/units|m/s}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; || &amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp; || {{val/units|m/s}}
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{val/units|m*s-1}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; || &amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp; || {{val/units|m*s-1}}
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{val/units|MeV}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; || &amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp; || {{val/units|MeV}}
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{val/units|kg}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; || &amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp; || {{val/units|kg}}
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{val/units|whatever}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; || &amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp; || {{val/units|whatever}} ''(unimplemented)''
|}

Feel free to add new units if they are not implemented.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==


The purpose of the forfeiture of offence-related property under the CDSA is &quot;to ensure that offence-related property is not returned to the offender and the interests of innocent third parties and persons with valid interests in the property are protected&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Scotia Mortgage Corp. v. Leung, 2006 BCSC 846 (CanLII) at para. 18 &lt;/ref&gt;

The purposes are to (1) &quot;punishes the offender by taking away the property that was used in the commission of the designated substance offence&quot;, with the effect upon the profit of the trade; (2) provide deterrence through &quot;“rais[ing] the stakes” by imposing a “very real cost” to those who either use, or permit their property to be used, in the commission of a designated substance offence&quot;; (3) ensure &quot;that the property is no longer available for continued use in criminal activities&quot;, that is, to take it out of circulation&lt;ref&gt;
Scotia Mortgage Corp. v. Leung at para. 18 citing Canada (Attorney General) v. Huynh, 2005 BCPC 431 (CanLII), [2005] B.C.J. No. 2168&lt;Br&gt;
See also R. v. Cook, [2010] O.J. No. 4413,at paras.39-45&lt;/ref&gt;

The Attorney General may apply at any time after conviction forfeiture of offence-related property.
They must show on a balance of probabilities that the property is &quot;offence-related property&quot; in relation to the offences convicted.(s. 16(1)) The AG may also obtain an order if they can prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the property is &quot;offence-related property&quot; but not in relation to any particular conviction. (s. 16(2))

Innocent persons with property interests in the goods may apply usually during a forfeiture hearing for the return of the items. (s. 19)

{{reflist|2}}

==Offence-related Property==
Offence-related property is defined in s.2 of the CDSA:
{{quotation|
“offence-related property” means, with the exception of a controlled substance, any property, within or outside Canada,
:(a) by means of or in respect of which a designated substance offence is committed,
:(b) that is used in any manner in connection with the commission of a designated substance offence, or
:(c) that is intended for use for the purpose of committing a designated substance offence;
}}

==Forfeiture on Conviction==
Section 16 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act provides a power of forfeiture on conviction similar to s. 490.1 of the Criminal Code:
{{quotation|
'''Order of forfeiture of property on conviction'''&lt;br&gt;

(2) Subject to sections 18 to 19.1, where the evidence does not establish to the satisfaction of the court that the designated substance offence of which a person has been convicted was committed in relation to property in respect of which an order of forfeiture would otherwise be made under subsection (1) but the court is satisfied, beyond a reasonable doubt, that that property is offence-related property, the court may make an order of forfeiture under subsection (1) in relation to that property.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vtc#sec16 CDSA]}}

==''In Rem'' Forfeiture==
{{quotation|
'''Application for in rem forfeiture'''&lt;br&gt;
17. (1) Where an information has been laid in respect of a designated substance offence, the Attorney General may make an application to a judge for an order of forfeiture under subsection (2).

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;
===Purpose===
Subtemplate for turning an easily typeable name for a unit into a proper scientific notation for the unit, including a link to a page about the unit. See {{tl|val/units}} for a version that does not provide a link. If the template does not have an entry for the unit, it is returned &quot;as is&quot;.

This template is used by {{tl|val}} to translate the '''ul''' and '''upl''' arguments. When adding a unit of the type X/Y (eg. m/s), please consider adding a X·Y{{sup|-1}} version as well (and name it ''X*Y-1'').

===Arguments===
:'''1'''   = The easily typable name of the unit.

===Examples===
{|
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{val/unitswithlink|m/s}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; || &amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp; || {{val/unitswithlink|m/s}}
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{val/unitswithlink|m*s-1}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; || &amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp; || {{val/unitswithlink|m*s-1}}
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{val/unitswithlink|MeV}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; || &amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp; || {{val/unitswithlink|MeV}}
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{val/unitswithlink|kg}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; || &amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp; || {{val/unitswithlink|kg}}
|-
|&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{val/unitswithlink|whatever}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; || &amp;nbsp;&amp;rarr;&amp;nbsp; || {{val/unitswithlink|whatever}} ''(unimplemented)''
|}

Feel free to add new units if they are not implemented.

__NOTOC__
===Purpose===
Determines whether something is valid in a certain context. Currently only implemented for determining if a number is within the precision that Wikibooks expressions can handle.

===Returns===
'''true''' if the argument is valid, '''false''' if it is not.

===Examples===
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{valid|number=A}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; = {{valid|number=A}} ''(not a number)''
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{valid|number=1234}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; = {{valid|number=1234}}
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{valid|number=+1234}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; = {{valid|number=+1234}}
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{valid|number=-1234}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; = {{valid|number=-1234}}
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{valid|number=(1234)}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; = {{valid|number=(1234)}} ''(one pair of parenthesis is allowed)''
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{valid|number=--1234}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; = {{valid|number=--1234}} ''(incorrect sign use)''
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{valid|number=1234567890}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; = {{valid|number=1234567890}}
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{valid|number=12345678901234567890}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; = {{valid|number=12345678901234567890}} ''(too large)''
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{valid|number=1.234567890}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; = {{valid|number=1.234567890}}
:&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{valid|number=1.2345678901234567890}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; = {{valid|number=1.2345678901234567890}} ''(too many decimals)''

===Performance impact===
Template:Valid returns &quot;true&quot; for a valid, single number (2+2 gives &quot;false&quot;), and allows [[w:scientific notation|scientific notation]] (such as: -3.45E-07). The precision limit is determined live, for whichever server is formatting the page, typically allowing 14-digit precision (plus trailing zeroes), but it does not detect extreme precision problems dropping minor end-digits:
:* cannot reject: -10020030040050000000000000000.70, treated as -1.002003004005E+28
The template has been written with minimal markup text, and could be used 50,000-13,000 times per page, or less when all 30-digit numbers. Template:Valid is typically used at upper levels of other templates, so it is unlikely to trigger expansion-depth problems. However, it has an [[m:Help:Expansion depth|expansion-depth]] of 8 levels, and returns &quot;false&quot; if used when nested too deep inside other templates, such as at level 33 when the expansion depth limit is 40.

=== Purpose ===
'''EVAL'''uate, but '''N'''o '''S'''cientific notation.

This template can be used to evaluate an expression, if the result has to be suitable as input for further expressions.

=== Returns ===
If the output is not valid as input, the expression is just reproduced, enclosed in parentheses. Otherwise it returns the number returned in the evaluation of the specified expression.

So this template just has the same effect as calling &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#expr: ...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; directly, except that parentheses will appear around the source expression if that expression cannot be evaluated (for example a missing parameter value without a default), avoiding the error message generated by &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#expr: ...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{evalns|1 + {{evalns|1234567890*{{{missingparameter}}}*1234567890}}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; gives {{evalns|1 + {{evalns|1234567890*{{{missingparameter}}}*1234567890}}}}.
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#expr:1 + {{#expr:1234567890*{{{missingparameter}}}*1234567890}}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; gives &lt;strong class=&quot;error&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Pfunc_expr_unexpected_operator&quot;&gt;Expression error: Unexpected &amp;lt; operator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;.

=== Examples ===
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{evalns|3*4}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; gives {{evalns|3*4}}.
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{evalns|1234567890*12}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; gives {{evalns|1234567890*12}}.
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{evalns|1234567890*1234567890}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; gives {{evalns|1234567890*1234567890}}.

Note: the scientific notation of result numbers are no longer a problem when these results are further inserted in other expressions. So this version no longer invalidates numbers in scientific notations, as they are directly evaluatable. The protection of parentheses is not even needed, due to numeric operator precedences for the &quot;e&quot; operator (which multiplies a number by a power of 10 given by a (possibly negative) number in its second operand:
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{evalns|1 + {{evalns|1234567890*1234567890}}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; gives {{evalns|1 + {{evalns|1234567890*1234567890}}}}.
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{evalns|{{evalns|1234567890*1234567890}} + 1}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; gives {{evalns|{{evalns|1234567890*1234567890}} + 1}}.
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{evalns|2 * {{evalns|1234567890*1234567890}}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; gives {{evalns|2 * {{evalns|1234567890*1234567890}}}}.
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{evalns|{{evalns|1234567890*1234567890}} + 1}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; gives {{evalns|{{evalns|1234567890*1234567890}} * 2}}.

Using &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#expr: ...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; directly produces the same result :
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#expr:1 + {{#expr:1234567890*1234567890}}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; gives {{#expr:1 + {{#expr:1234567890*1234567890}}}}.
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#expr:{{#expr:1234567890*1234567890}} + 1}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; gives {{#expr:{{#expr:1234567890*1234567890}} + 1}}.
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#expr:2 * {{#expr:1234567890*1234567890}}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; gives {{#expr:2 * {{#expr:1234567890*1234567890}}}}.
* &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#expr:{{#expr:1234567890*1234567890}} + 1}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; gives {{#expr:{{#expr:1234567890*1234567890}} * 2}}.

=== Source code ===
(simplified and formatted, removing the &quot;subst&quot; parameter stuff which is also included)
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{#if: {{#ifexpr: {{#expr: {{{1}}} }} }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt; | ({{{1}}})&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt; | {{#expr: {{{1}}} }}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
 &lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
This first tries to evaluate the expression, which may return either a number, or a special value like INF or NAN, or an error message. Then the #ifexpr reevaluates this string : only numbers will pass, but as there's no return expression, an empty string will be returned ; if there's an evaluation error (including when evaluating INF or NAN values), only an error message will be regenerated. Finally the #if just test for the presence or not of the error message. If there's one, the parameter 1 could not be evaluated to a finite number, so the parameter is returned between parentheses ; otherwise, the parameter is reevaluted to return its value

Note that if the expression in parameter 1 is just a simple number, it will be with those zeroes stripped, and exponents will be normalized : &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;{{#expr:1.50}}&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt; = &quot;{{#expr:1.50}}&quot;, &lt;nowiki&gt;&quot;{{#expr:.00001}}&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt; = &quot;{{#expr:.00001}}&quot;. Numbers are returned with at most 13 significant digits, either as integers or fractional numbers if possible, but using normalized the exponential notation for all numbers whose absolute value is lower than {{#expr:1E-4}} or higher than or equal to {{#expr:1E15}}.

===Usage===
This template converts a decimal expression into scientific notation.  
:e.g. {{&lt;code&gt;scinote|12345&lt;/code&gt;}} gives &quot;{{scinote|12345}}&quot;
To round to a given number of significant figures, specify this number as the second unnamed parameter.  
:e.g. {{&lt;code&gt;scinote|12345|3&lt;/code&gt;}} gives &quot;{{scinote|12345|3}}&quot;
For engineering notation set &lt;code&gt;fn=eng&lt;/code&gt;.
:e.g. {{&lt;code&gt;scinote|12345|fn=eng&lt;/code&gt;}} gives &quot;{{scinote|12345|fn=eng}}&quot;
Trailing zeros are preserved.
:e.g. {{&lt;code&gt;scinote|0.001234500&lt;/code&gt;}} gives &quot;{{scinote|0.001234500}}&quot;

This subtemplate gives ''a''&lt;span style=&quot;margin-left:0.2em&quot;&gt;×&lt;span style=&quot;margin-left:0.1em&quot;&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt; where ''a'' and ''b'' are given by unnamed parameters {{{1}}} and {{{2}}} respectively.  {{{2}}} must be numerical, negative values are displayed with a proper minus sign.  The multiplication sign is spaced with thin non-breaking spaces.

Example:
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{scinote/e|2|3}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{scinote/e|2|3}}

Compare {{tl|e}}:
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{e|3}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{e|3}}

===Usage===
This template rounds {{{1}}} to {{{2}}} decimal places (goes the other way for negatives) and includes trailing zeros.  Scientific notation is used for numbers greater than or equal to 1{{e|9}}, or less than 1{{e|−4}}.

Compare:
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{rnd|2.0004|3}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{rnd|2.0004|3}}
**whereas &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#expr:2.0004 round 3}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{#expr:2.0004 round 3}}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{rnd|0.000020004|7}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{rnd|0.000020004|7}}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{rnd|0|8}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{rnd|0|8}}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{rnd|154268|-3}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{rnd|154268|-3}}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{rnd|1200004|-1}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{rnd|1200004|-1}}
**whereas &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#expr:1200004round-1}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{#expr:1200004round-1}}, even though &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#expr:1300004round-1}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{#expr:1300004round-1}} (see [[m:Help:Format produced by expr]]) 
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{rnd|1300004|-1}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{rnd|1300004|-1}}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{rnd|4.1e6|9}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{rnd|4.1e6|9}}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{rnd|4.1e6|10}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{rnd|4.1e6|10}}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{rnd|1542689271|-7}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{rnd|1542689271|-7}}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{rnd|1542689271|2}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{rnd|1542689271|2}}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{rnd|7e9|-9}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{rnd|7e9|-9}}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{rnd|-123|1}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{rnd|-123|1}}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{rnd|-1200007|-2}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{rnd|-1200007|-2}}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{rnd|-1234567899|-7}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{rnd|-1234567899|-7}}

As with #expr, the total number of significant digits is not more than 14:
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{rnd|1234567890.123456789|10}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{rnd|1234567890.123456789|10}}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{rnd|123456789.0123456789|10}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{rnd|123456789.0123456789|10}}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{rnd|.0001234567890123456789|20}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{rnd|.0001234567890123456789|20}}

===Internal details===
The template uses three subtemplates:
*{{tl|rnd/-}} — for trailing zeros
*{{tl|rnd/e+}} — for scientific notation for numbers greater than or equal to 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; or less than or equal to −10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;
*{{tl|rnd/e−}} — for scientific notation for numbers greater than −10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; and less than 10&lt;sup&gt;−4&lt;/sup&gt; but not equal to zero

This subtemplate of {{tl|rnd}} adds trailing zeros.  It takes two parameters.
#the number to be displayed
#the number of significant figures to be displayed after the decimal point

*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{rnd/-|2|3}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{rnd/-|2|3}}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{rnd/-|1E+5|3}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{rnd/-|1E+5|3}}

It's used by {{tl|rnd}}.
*&quot;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{#expr:2.0004 round 3}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; gives &quot;{{#expr:2.0004 round 3}}&quot;
*&quot;&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{rnd|2.0004|3}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;&quot; gives &quot;{{rnd|2.0004|3}}&quot;

This is a subtemplate of {{tl|rnd}}.  It displays large numbers using scientific notation.  It takes three parameters.
#the number to be displayed
#the precision to which it is to be displayed to
#the order of magnitude
It calls {{tl|rnd/-}} with as parameters the significand and the number of decimals of the significand to be displayed, to add trailing zeros.

===Usage===
This template calculates the (decimal) [[w:order of magnitude|order of magnitude]] of numbers within the ranges 10&lt;sup&gt;300&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;−300&lt;/sup&gt; and −10&lt;sup&gt;−300&lt;/sup&gt; to −10&lt;sup&gt;300&lt;/sup&gt;.

The acceptable input and the output produced are optimized for use in other templates. 
*The hyphen (not a true minus sign) is used for negative numbers.
*No separator is used for thousands. 
*The template gives 0 for 0.  Although, strictly speaking, this is mathematically incorrect it has been designed this way so as to be more useful in other templates.  An important example of this is that when used by {{tl|convert}} 0&amp;nbsp;°C or 0&amp;nbsp;°F is considered to be on the same order of magnitude as ±1&amp;nbsp;°C or ±1&amp;nbsp;°F respectively.

===Examples===
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Order of magnitude|123400}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{Order of magnitude|123400}}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Order of magnitude|12340}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{Order of magnitude|12340}}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Order of magnitude|1234}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{Order of magnitude|1234}}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Order of magnitude|123.4}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{Order of magnitude|123.4}}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Order of magnitude|12.34}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{Order of magnitude|12.34}}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Order of magnitude|1.234}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{Order of magnitude|1.234}}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Order of magnitude|.1234}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{Order of magnitude|.1234}}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Order of magnitude|.01234}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{Order of magnitude|.01234}}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Order of magnitude|0}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{Order of magnitude|0}}
*&lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Order of magnitude}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt; → {{Order of magnitude}}

===Incorrect usage===
The input must be an unformatted number, or the template will emit errors:
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Order of magnitude|}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; → &lt;strong class=&quot;error&quot;&gt;Expression error: Unexpected = operator&lt;/strong&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Order of magnitude|123,400}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; → &lt;strong class=&quot;error&quot;&gt;Expression error: Unrecognised punctuation character &quot;,&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;
*&lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Order of magnitude|foo}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; → &lt;strong class=&quot;error&quot;&gt;Expression error: Unrecognised word &quot;foo&quot;&lt;/strong&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Book Rename ==
You should definitely consider renaming the work. To something line Using SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer) or Exploring SDL (Simple DirectMedia Layer).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 22:06, 7 May 2012 (UTC)

How do I go about renaming the wikibook? I have searched the help pages and only found username rename. Thanks.

:Use page move do not include the &quot;(Simple DirectMedia Layer)&quot; you can add that to the title later (see the title as a file/directory name). I had a similar problem with the [[The World of Peer-to-Peer (P2P)]] I later regretted the name choice but there were already too many subpages.
:You can provide the root/cover page the full text using &lt;nowiki&gt;{{DISPLAYTITLE|&lt;title&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;. For instance the first page may use Simple DirectMedia Layer and the rest SDL. (See the source of the p2p book for usage if you have a problem)
:This means that if you use something like &quot;Exploring SLD&quot; you can still make the title page read &quot;Explore the Simple DirectMedia Layer&quot; or variations, subpages will still use the Exploring SLD/Page Name path the reverse would imply using the longer file path name... 
:In any case it it your choice.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 23:10, 9 May 2012 (UTC)

== Book revision ==

While this wikibook is far from complete and hasn't been updated in a while, I am currently devising a revision of this tutorial to include the latest SDL release (SDL 2.0.3 as of this edit). The differences between 1.2 and 2 are significant enough to require a overhaul of this book. More to come as time permits.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Nota Bene: The TI 83/84 uses any nonzero number to represent true (most often it is 1) and zero to represent false.
==Test Conditions==
Test Conditions are used to compare different values and form the basis of  [[Conditional Functions]].
===Equal===
{{bCommand|{{=}}|TEST:TEST:1}} returns true if two input values are equal and false if not equal.
====Syntax====
{{bcode:Syntax|
:''Value 1'' {{=}} ''Value 2''
|
*Where Value 1 and Value 2 are both variables of the same type.
}}
====Example====
{{TIB:Program|TEMP|
:0→X
:If X{{=}}0
:Disp &quot;True&quot;
|
True
}}
===Not Equal===
{{bCommand|≠|TEST:TEST:2}} returns true if two input values are not equal true if they are equal.
====Syntax and Example====
''See Equal''
===Greater Than===
{{bCommand|&gt;|TEST:TEST:3}} returns true if first input value is larger than second input value and false if it is less than or equal.
====Syntax and Example====
''See Equal''
===Greater Than or Equal To===
{{bCommand|≥|TEST:TEST:4}} returns true if the first input value is larger than or equal to the second value and false if it is greater than.
====Syntax and Example====
''See Equal''
===Less Than===
{{bCommand|&lt;|TEST:TEST:5}} returns true if the first input value is smaller than the second and returns false if it is greater than or equal to.
====Syntax and Example====
''See Equal''
===Less Than or Equal To===
{{bCommand|≤|TEST:TEST:6}} returns true if the first input value is smaller than or equal to the second input value and returns false if it is greater than.
====Syntax and Example====
''See Equal''
==Logical Operators==
Logical Operators help combine multiple boolean valued statements into one.
===And===
In order for an &quot;and&quot; conditional function evaluate to true, both parts of the statement have to be true or else it returns false.
====Syntax====
{{bCommand|and|TEST:LOGIC:1}}
{{bcode:Syntax|
:''Boolean 1''  and  ''Boolean 2''
|
*Where Boolean 1 and Boolean 2 are both expressions that can be evaluated to true or false.
}}
====Example====
{{TIB:Program|TEMP|
:0→X
:1→Y
:If X{{=}}0  and  Y{{=}}1
:Disp &quot;TRUE&quot;
|
TRUE
}}
===Or===
In order for an &quot;or&quot; conditional function to evaluate to true, at least one of the parts of the statement have to be true or else it returns false.
====Syntax and Example====
{{bCommand|or|TEST:LOGIC:2}}

''See And''
====XOr====
In order for an &quot;xor&quot; conditional function to evaluate to true, exactly one of the values has to be true. If both of the values are true or false it evaluates to false.
====Syntax and Example====
{{bCommand|xor|TEST:LOGIC:3}}

''See And''
===Not===
The &quot;not&quot; operator is a little different from the others, it only takes one value and it evaluates to the opposite.
====Syntax====
{{bCommand|not(|TEST:LOGIC:4}}

{{bcode:Syntax|
:not(''valueA'')
|
}}
* ''valueA'' can be almost anything. It can be a single number since numbers represent true and false, or it can be a boolean expression that evaluates to true or false.
====Example====
{{TIB:Program|TEMP|
:0→X
:If not(X≠0)
:Disp &quot;X DOES NOT NOT EQUAL ZERO&quot;
|
X DOES NOT NOT EQUAL ZERO
}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">Pictures are a relatively easy concept to understand. A picture on your calculator is simply a state of the graph that has been saved as an image. Picture variables can be accessed under VARS:4.
==Storing Pictures==
To store the current graph as an image you simply go to DRAW:STO:1 press enter, then choose a number 0-9 and press enter again. The 0-9 just determines what picture variable you're using (i.e. Pic1).
{{bcode:Syntax|
StorePic 0
       OR
StorePic Pic0
}}

==Displaying Pictures==
To display a picture you go to DRAW:STO:2 press enter, then choose the picture 0-9 you want to display. WARNING: This will overlay the picture over the current graph, it will not clear the graph first.
{{bcode:Syntax|
RecallPic 0
      OR
RecallPic Pic0
}}

==Creating More Complex Pictures==
Sometimes one graph window is not enough to completely draw your picture. Fear not there is a way around this. The first step is to get as much of your picture on the graph as possible. Then save this as a picture. Clear the graph and finish the rest of your picture, overlay the previous picture and save the whole thing as its own picture variable. This can be done several times to create very intricate pictures.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Graph Databases (GDB) are a convenient way to store all of the settings about a current graph. A graph database will include all of the aspects necessary to reproduce the current graph as is, including the input functions, the window settings, and the graph format. GDB variables can be accessed under VARS:3.
==Creating a GDB==
To create a GDB you first want to set up your graph as you want it to be saved. Then access the StoreGDB method under DRAW:STO:3 press enter to bring the method to the home screen. Then enter a number 0-9 or choose a GDB variable and press enter.
{{bcode:Syntax|
StoreGDB 0
         OR
StoreGDB GDB0
}}
==Recalling a GDB==
To recall a GDB you use the RecallGDB method found under DRAW:STO:4 then choose your GDB either with a number 0-9 or a GDB variable.
{{bcode:Syntax|
RecallGDB 0
         OR
RecallGDB GDB0
}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">Recursion in programs involves calling up the program to run again from the beginning. If not done carefully it can create infinite loops of code that won't terminate. If you run a program that gets stuck in a loop you can press the On button; the On button terminates execution of any program.
==How to do it==
Writing code that does is simple, within the program you simply have a call to the current program. The syntax is PRGM:EXEC then whatever program.
{{bcode:Syntax|
PROGRAM:TEMP
://code
://code
:pgrmTEMP
}}
If you use recursion you always want to have some condition that has to be met in order for the recursive call to happen. An easy way to do this is to encapsulate the recursive call in an &quot;If&quot; statement or a while loop.
==Example==
In this example we will write a simple counting program. Before we run this program we have to set X to a number, for this example we will assume it has been set to 0.
{{TIB:Program|COUNT|
:While X≤3
:Disp X
:X+1-&gt;X
:prgmCOUNT
(Note: End is not needed here since the while already loops)
|
       0
       1
       2
       3

--NOTE A1: This template processes a number, for display, by

--     as &quot;-6000&quot; with a full minus sign rather than hyphen.
--     In 99% of Wikipedia usage, there are no fractions.
--
--NOTE D2: The check, for fraction parts, uses parser-function
--     #titleparts to split the number at &quot;/&quot; (if any) and
--     then checks part 2 (the denominator, after the slash)
--     to trigger use of {{Convert/numdisp/fracparts}}. Hence,

--NOTE N3: This template uses minimal expansion depth of the
--     if-else logic by checking for &quot;/&quot; before invoking the
--     nested subtemplate {{Convert/numdisp/fracparts}}. The
--     check for a negative number increases the nesting depth
--     by 1 level to apply abs({1}) in a nested {#expr:} parser
--     function, to use the absolute value of the amount {1}.
--
--NOTE Z4: Any end-zeroes on a decimal are preserved by not
--     using positive amounts in an expression, and for rare
--     negative amounts, the &amp;minus with inverse -{1} is padded
--     by {padright:} with end-zeroes &quot;0&quot; to {strlen_short} but
--     uses #ifexpr:{1}0={1} and floor({1})={1} to put &quot;.&quot;.

'''[[Template:Convert/numdisp]]''' processes a number, for display, by checking to display a fraction part (at &quot;/&quot;), else it just uses [[mw:Help:Extension:ParserFunctions|parser-function]] &lt;nowiki&gt;{{formatnum:{{{1|6000}}}}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to add commas, such as to show &quot;6,000&quot;.
: '''Usage:'''&amp;nbsp; &lt;nowiki&gt;{{convert/numdisp|6+3/8}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; &amp;rarr; {{convert/numdisp|6+3/8}}
:::&lt;nowiki&gt;{{convert/numdisp|-4-1/2}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; &amp;rarr; {{convert/numdisp|-4-1/2}}
:::&lt;nowiki&gt;{{convert/numdisp|23500}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; &amp;rarr; {{convert/numdisp|23500}}
:::&lt;nowiki&gt;{{convert/numdisp|2300+643/1250}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; &amp;rarr; {{convert/numdisp|2300+643/1250}}
:::&lt;nowiki&gt;{{convert/numdisp|14+6/ }}&lt;/nowiki&gt; &amp;rarr; &lt;strong class=&quot;error&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;Pfunc_expr_unexpected_operator&quot;&gt;Expression error: Unexpected &amp;lt; operator&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;

===Implementation===
The check, for fraction parts, uses parser-function &lt;nowiki&gt;{{#titleparts:xx/xx|1|2}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to split a number at &quot;/&quot; (if any, as in: 6+3/8) and then checks if part 2 (the denominator, after the slash) contains a number, to trigger use of {{tl|Convert/numdisp/frac}}). Hence, the template uses:
::: &lt;nowiki&gt;#if: {{#titleparts:{{{1|6+3/8}}}|1|2}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
That if-expression will be true if a denominator exists (such as &quot;8&quot; in 6+3/8).

--============================================================
-- Process fraction parts by negative/zero/positive (-1,0,1)
--============================================================

--&gt;{{documentation|content=This subtemplate is called by {{tl|convert/numdisp}} and by {{tl|convert/and/frn1}} to process fractions according to whether the whole number part (i.e. the ''a'' in {{frac|''a''|''b''|''c''}}) is positive, negative or zero calling {{tl|convert/numdisp/frac1}}, {{tl|convert/numdisp/frac-1}} or {{tl|convert/numdisp/frac0}} respectively.}}&lt;!--


--&gt;&lt;/noinclude&gt;{{convert/numdisp/frac{{
  #expr:( {{{2|-6-3}}}*0&gt;0) - ( {{{2|-6-3}}}*0&lt;0) }}

--NOTES:
--    [ These comments are skipped by &lt;noinclude&gt; and not sent
--      in formatted Internet pages, only during edit. ]
--
--NOTE A1: This template handles a number+fraction, for display,
--     based on amount as negative/0/positive, using -1/0/1 as
--     suffix: #expr:( {{{2|6+3}}}*0&gt;0) - ( {{{2|6+3}}}*0&lt;0) so
--     positives are /frac1, zero as /frac0, negatives /frac-1
--     without using a nested if-statement to choose 1/0/-1.
--     During 2009-2010 templates were restricted to if-logic
--     nested within depth of only a 40-level limit.
--
--NOTE P2: The parameters, as fraction parts, expect input like
--     #titleparts splitting a number at &quot;/&quot; (slash), where
--        parameter 1 - is the original number (like 6+3/8)
--        parameter 2 - is left of slash (6+3)
--        parameter 3 - is after slash (8) as the denominator.
--
--NOTE S3: Parameters here should NOT have spaces or split on
--     separate lines: {{Convert/numdisp/fracparts|0|6+3 |8}}
--     would put a space after 3, as &quot;3 /8&quot; in the displayed
--     fraction. The MediaWiki parser appends a newline ending
--     a parameter when &quot;|&quot; is on the next line (in 2010).

--NOTES
--
-- NOTE A1: Unlike most Convert subtemplates, Convert/hand
--      has 4 sections of special calculations to transform
--      amounts in &quot;hands.inches&quot; notation, for x-to-hands,
--      hands-to-x, range-to-hands, or hands-to-range of other
--      units.
--
-- NOTE D2: The logic changes any fractional hands into the
--      decimals .1, .2 or .3 by checking parameter 2 to have &quot;(&quot;
--      using {{padleft:|1|{{{2|(62)}}}&amp;nbsp;}} and resets
--      parameter 2, with the fraction multiplied by 100 &amp;
--      divided by 250, as one-tenth the multiple of 25.
--
-- NOTE E3: For ranges, to extract prior conversion factor {b},
--      then {4} is decoded as having 3 values: (r)+(s)+{b}.
--      The trick: b = ( {4}*2 - ( {4} ) ), where end-amount
--      {b} doubles as b*2 in &quot;(r)+(s)+ {b}*2&quot; so subtracting
--      {4} yields {b}*2-{b}, and hence {b} is extracted.
--
-- NOTE R4: When hands are rounded, the markup checks if the
--      result remainder +0.6 &gt; 1 to add 1, rather than show
--      x.35 rounded up to x.4, or rounded to the nearest whole
--      hands as x.35 being x rather than x+1 as it should be.
--      For single amounts, {3} contains the rounding level
--      from &quot;|0&quot; while {4} contains the sigfig=n number.
--      For ranges, {3} contains the second number of the range
--      while {4} contains (r)+(s)+{b}, where r is round &quot;|0&quot;
--      and (s) is from sigfig=n. The {b} is prior conversion
--      factor from the input unit (such as cm with b=0.0254).
--

--HISTORY:
--07Sep2008 Created to convert hands as decimal amounts.

The '''[[Template:Convert/hand]]''' converts [[w:Hand (unit)|hands]] of [[w:horse|horse]] height, such as with [[w:inch|inch]]es, [[w:metre|meters]] or cm. The conversion is 1 hand = 4 inches.&lt;ref&gt;
   &quot;Horse Height Conversion&quot;, Onlineconversion.com, web:
   [http://www.onlineconversion.com/horse_height.htm OC-horse].
&lt;/ref&gt;
A fraction indicates inches, so &quot;13.2&quot; denotes 13 + 1/2 hands, rather than 2/10 or 1/5 hand. Examples:
:*{&amp;#123;convert|57|in|hand}} &amp;rarr; {{convert|57|in|hand}}
:*{&amp;#123;convert|2|m|hand}} &amp;rarr; {{convert|2|m|hand}}
:*{&amp;#123;convert|9.1|hand|in}} &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;rarr; {{convert|9.1|hand|in}}
:*{&amp;#123;convert|14.1|hand|in}} &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; &amp;rarr; {{convert|14.1|hand|in}}
:*{&amp;#123;convert|14.1|hand|cm}} &amp;nbsp; &amp;rarr; {{convert|14.1|hand|cm}}
:*{&amp;#123;convert|14.1|hand|in cm}} &amp;rarr; {{convert|14.1|hand|in cm}}
:*{&amp;#123;convert|14.1|-|14.6|hand|cm}} &amp;rarr; {{convert|14.1|-|14.6|hand|cm}}
:*{&amp;#123;convert|50|-|57|in|hand}} &amp;rarr; {{convert|50|-|57|in|hand}}
:*{&amp;#123;convert|2|-|3|m|hand}} &amp;rarr; {{convert|2|-|3|m|hand}}
:*{&amp;#123;convert|57|or|59|in|hand|abbr=on}} &amp;rarr; {{convert|57|or|59|in|hand|abbr=on}}
:*{&amp;#123;convert|137|-|139|cm|hand|lk=on}} &amp;rarr; {{convert|137|-|139|cm|hand|lk=on}}
:*{&amp;#123;convert|37|–|162|cm|hand|2|abbr=in|lk=out}} &amp;rarr; {{convert|37|–|162|cm|hand|2|abbr=in|lk=out}}

Unlike most Convert subtemplates, Convert/hand has 4 sections of special calculations to transform amounts in &quot;hands.inches&quot; notation, for x-to-hands, hands-to-x, range-to-hands, or hands-to-range of other units. The logic changes any [[w:fraction|fraction]]al hands into decimals .1, .2 or .3 by checking parameter 2 to have &quot;(&quot; using {&amp;#123;padleft:|1|{{{2|(62)}}}&amp;nbsp;}} then resetting parameter 2, with the fraction multiplied by 100 &amp; divided by 250, as one-tenth the multiple of 25. This is the first Convert subtemplate to calculate numbers which are not in decimal format (where &quot;.1&quot; is {{convert/numdisp|1/4}} not {{convert/numdisp|1/10}}), as would be a complex format also for [[w:hexadecimal|hexadecimal]] or binary numbers.

This '''[[Template:Convert/LoffAonSoff]]''' invokes [[Template:Convert/outsep]] to display the converted result and unit symbol (if any), with {sep} to control wrapping. A number &lt; 1,000 is not wrapped, or if the unit symbol is used, then only numbers above 20,000 can wrap at the unit symbol. If the unit symbol {{{u}}} is not set (such as with &quot;acre&quot;), then it passes both the singular unit name {{{n}}} and plural, {{{l}}}, or &quot;{{{n}}}s&quot; when no specific plural name has been defined.

The [[Template:Convert/-]] (for ranges using &quot;-&quot;) is invoked as the first template below {Convert}, for converting ranges such as {Convert|2|-|4|ft|m}. It immediately invokes Convert/{4}, for the input unit {4}, passing the range of input numbers as &quot;{1}|-|{3}&quot;. Having obtained all 8 parameters, {1}|-|{3}...{8}, it sets the precision &quot;s&quot; from either parameter {5}, {6} or {8} (depending on whichever is the numeric round-number); otherwise, the precision is set as: &lt;nowiki&gt;s=(0.5)+(0{{{s}}})&lt;/nowiki&gt;. It passes {d} down as Dual/{d} to invoke subtemplate Convert/Dual/{d} which displays the dual-range (rather than a typical single amount). For any customization, such as disp=x, the parameters {6} and {7} are passed as {5} and {6} (or null if none).

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

The subtemplate is called by {{tl|precision}} (the main template page). This main page will have determined whether the input is in the form of a fraction or decimal/integer.
*For fractional input it returns the base ten logarithm of the numerator.
*Otherwise it determines whether the input is a decimal or integer and calls either {{tl|precision/1}} or {{tl|precision/0}} accordingly.

The '''[[Template:Convert/-/AonSoff]]''' displays a range of numbers with en-dash &quot;&amp;ndash;&quot; and the unit symbol abbreviation (if any), else it displays the unit name, as singular or plural for the 2nd amount. An example of a unit which has no unit symbol is the unit acre, which always shows either &quot;acre&quot; or &quot;acres&quot;. This template is used to show either the input range numbers or the output range numbers, which might contain commas or x10 notation.

'''[[Template:Convert/-/AoffSoff]]''' displays a range of two numbers separated by an en-dash &quot;&amp;ndash;&quot; followed by the unit name, as singular or plural for the 2nd amount. If the 2nd amount is a negative number, then spaces are added around the en-dash, as &quot;&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash;&amp;nbsp;&quot;.

This template is used to show either the input range numbers or the output range numbers, which might contain commas or x10 notation. Optional parameters {amt1} &amp; {amt2} could be used for numeric tests of the results, as passed with formatted results {1} and {2} from {&amp;#123;[[Template:Convert/Dual/rnd|Convert/Dual/rnd]]}}, {&amp;#123;[[Template:Convert/Dual/prnd|Convert/Dual/prnd]]}}, etc.

:*'''Drawing Window''': The area you construct drawing. The system defaults into four-view form. The one in the left upper corner is front view, in the left lower corner is top view, in the right upper corner is side view, and in the right lower corner is isometric view.
:*'''Command Window''': Where you can input command.
:*'''Status Bar''': Display cursor coordinate and mode status.
:*'''Construction Graph Screen Menu''': Most common Construction Graph commands.

==Chapter 2 2D Design==
===Interface===
:The interface of 2D design is shown as below: 
:
:The interface includes:
:'''Menu''': All commands can be found in menu
:'''Toolbar''': Shortcut icons of main commands can be found
:'''Design Wizard''': Showing the steps of design 
:'''Drawing space''': Where you can draw the floor plan 
:'''Furniture library''': includes Yuan Fang system library and manufacturer’s customized library. Left click to unfold each category and call certain piece of furniture

===Common Operation===
:*Usage of the Mouse
::'''Left click''': Most commands are accomplished by left click. For example: selecting pull-down menu, clicking icon on toolbar and etc. 
::'''Right click''': Some commands are ended by right click. For any existing object, right click it and the edit command will be shown.
::Note: No matter what command is being executed, right click and the command will exit.  
:*Two Operation Rules
::Rule No.1: Select command first. Then follow the prompt to execute further operation. 
::Rule No.2: Select object first. Then right click, and the exclusive edit menu towards the selected object will be shown. Note: every object has its unique edit menu. This menu cannot be found in the tool bar.

===File Menu===
:*New File
::Create a new drawing file.
::'''Basic operations''':Click '''''File / New''''' in menu bar.
::'''Note''': If any changes have been made to the current file, the system will ask you whether to save it. Click Yes, the system will save the file. If it is a new file, the file will be saved as a new file.Click No, the system will open a new file without saving the current file.If Cancel, the system will not open a new file.

==Chapter 10 Online Cloud Library==
Online Cloud Library is a brand new system developped by YFCAD, aiming to provide more efficient customized modeling service to individual users. &lt;br/&gt;
Online Modeling Service contains 3 parts: Make Model, Check Model, and Recharge.
:•	Make Model. This is for submitting model information. 
:•	Check Model. This is for checking the progress of modeling. Users can also send their feedbacks about the model to YFCAD.
:•	Recharge. This is for the basic cost of the service.
===Basic Operations:===
=====Part1: Make Model=====
=====Part2: Check Model=====

      <text xml:space="preserve">== remove numbers of users and edits? ==

I have added a {{tlx|Hide in print}} template to remove the sentence about the numbers of users and edits in the print version because they were not correctly resolved when producing the PDF. Shouldn't this sentence be removed completely since the only purpose of this page is to be added to a PDF or printed book? --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 09:21, 8 May 2012 (UTC)

:I commented out the sentence for the reasons mentioned above. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 12:29, 16 May 2012 (UTC)

== removed warning template ==

The warning template didn't print, resulting in the loss(!) of the warning message in the PDF version. I removed the template in order to have the message in the PDF version. I start to wonder whether anyone cares at all about the content of this page. ;) --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 09:27, 8 May 2012 (UTC)

== note to users of this page ==

I got a book from PediaPress today and noted that the following text is printed on the 2nd page (right after the title page):

There is some overlap with the Collections Preface; thus, in some cases this automatically included text might be sufficient and it's unnecessary to include the Collections Preface. --[[User:Martin Kraus|Martin Kraus]] ([[User talk:Martin Kraus|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Martin Kraus|contribs]]) 12:29, 16 May 2012 (UTC)</text>

== Manual of Style ==

Hello, please take some time to read the help pages linked above on how to format your book. The main two points for now are that the book's chapters should be &quot;sub pages&quot; of the main page, not independent articles like Wikipedia is. If you look at how your book has been amended you'll see how to do this. Secondly if you want to add your book to a category this is done by adding {{tlx|subjects}} to the main book page and {{tlx|BookCat}} to the subpages - there's no need to edit the category. In particular editing the category description is problematic as you changed the purpose of the category from general purpose business software to specific to your book. No problem as it has been changed back now. Have fun. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 09:51, 8 May 2012 (UTC)

Could you try not to create links like this &lt;nowiki&gt;[[chapter name]] and instead create them like this [[/chapter name/]]&lt;/nowiki&gt; when putting them on the main page of your book. If you do the former all the pages will be created in the wrong place and will need deleting by an admin - annoying for them and for you too. If this isn't clear, please ask - thanks. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 15:28, 8 May 2012 (UTC)

Okay, I've see you've chosen to ignore me again. If you persist with your approach and create pages named as per the red links in your main page they will be deleted. &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 16:17, 8 May 2012 (UTC)</text>
