      <comment>/* Transactions */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=== The Role of Accounting ===
Accounting is concerned with the uses of a business's financial information. It deals with:
* Bookkeeping - recording financial activities and transactions that take place in a business
* Summarising and organising this information in order to make it useful
* Analysing and interpreting the information in the form of financial statements
* Communicating the results to the business and other parties

Accounting provides a means of analysing, controlling and improving a business's performance, as well as being an aid to planning and decision-making. Information found as a result of accounting is used by the management of a business, along with other external parties, including suppliers, competitors, future investors, and the government.

== The Accounting Equation ==
; Capital : Resources put into a business by its owner(s) (also referred to as Equity)
; Assets : Resources that a business owns
; Liabilities: Obligations that a business owes to other parties

The accounting equation is:
'''Assets = Capital + Liabilities'''

On the left side is the resources that are in and owned by the business. This must equal the right side, which shows who supplied these resources - either the owner (capital) or other businesses (liabilities).

Every business transaction includes items that fall under each of these three categories. As a result, the accounting equation can be applied to every financial transaction.

== Double Entry Bookkeeping ==
=== Transactions ===
Every transaction affects two things. For example, imagine you go to the local shop and buy a chocolate bar. Your capital (money) will go down, as you have exchanged it for the chocolate. Also, your asset (chocolate bar) will go up. The converse is true from the shop's point of view - their stock has gone down, and their cash has gone up.

So, for every transaction, there is:
* A '''DEBIT'''. Debit refers to an increase in the asset side of the accounting equation or a decrease in the equity/liability side of the accounting equation. For example, you receive a payment for services provided, which increases the cash balance (debit cash).
* A '''CREDIT'''. Credit refers to a decrease in the asset side of the accounting equation or an increase in the equity/liability side of the accounting equation. Using the same example as above, the other side of the transaction recording receiving a payment for services provided would increase revenue (credit revenue).

In the first example above, your asset account is debited with the chocolate bar, and your cash account is credited with how much you paid for it.

=== The Double Entry System ===
A business will record each transaction in its books, which contain all the accounts where transactions have occurred throughout the accounting period. Because every transaction affects two things, we need to show this in the books where the two things have changed, therefore two accounts show the same transaction. This is why the process is called '''double entry bookkeeping'''.

Transactions which occur are entered into a set of ''accounts'' in the accounting books. An account is where all financial activities regarding a particular asset or liabilitity, or capital, is recorded. For example, there will be an account for office equipment, where all the financial activities regarding office equipment are entered.

=== T Accounts ===
In terms of bookkeeping at A Level you only need to know simple account layouts known as '''T Accounts'''. Each account is shown separately in a different T account, and in accounting books each T account will be shown on separate pages. The T account divides the page into two halves.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;border-top:3px solid black&quot;
|+ Title of account written here
!style=&quot;border-right:3px solid black&quot;|Left-hand side!!Right-hand side
|-
|style=&quot;border-right:3px solid black&quot;|'''Debit''' entries||'''Credit''' entries
|}

For every transaction, there is a debit and a credit entry. For example, imagine you pay your £30 rent. The two T accounts - Bank and Rent - would show the following:

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Basic Concept of Paper Chromatography==

Though this is a different kind of chromatography, it still separates mixtures of substances into the individual components, molecules, even atoms. The size and concentration of the component is determinant of the component's rate. The stationary phase, which is either a solid or a liquid supported by a solid, is absorbed in a uniform manner in paper chromatography. On the contrary, the mobile phase, being gas or liquid, serves as the solvent. Compounds can travel as far as the solvent does when the paper is dipped in a container filled with solvent. These compounds travel at different rates and separated into distinctly colored dots on the paper. The solvent that is used can be either nonpolar or polar. These properties affect the solubility of the compounds and components in the particular mixture. Polar components will be attracted to the water molecules attached to the cellulose (paper) and not attracted to a nonpolar solvent. The chromatogram will not contain the polar components, given that it doesn't climb up the paper with the nonpolar solvent. These components spend more time in the stationary phase rather than the mobile phase therefore the rate of moving up the paper is slow. If it were the opposite and nonpolar components were in a polar solvent, then the same thing will occur. The mobile phase can be various organic solvents or mixture. The compound can be stained with iodine in order to visualize where they have traveled easily. &lt;ref name=&quot;Paper Chromatography&quot;&gt;[http://www.chemguide.co.uk/analysis/chromatography/paper.html Chromatography], &lt;/ref&gt;

The stationary phase can be called a paper chromatogram. Usually, one will split the paper into individual lanes so that multiple trials can be done with one paper. Also it will allow the experimenter to compare the differences or similarities present in each lane depending on how far the compound has traveled. &lt;ref name=&quot;Paper Chromatography&quot;&gt;[http://www.chemguide.co.uk/analysis/chromatography/paper.html Chromatography], &lt;/ref&gt;

The paper is placed in a container with a shallow layer of a suitable solvent or mixture of solvents in it. Sometimes the paper is just coiled into a loose cylinder and fastened with paper clips top and bottom. Then the cylinder stands in the bottom of the container.
The container is covered to make sure that the atmosphere in the beaker is saturated with solvent vapor. Saturating the atmosphere in the beaker with vapor stops the solvent from evaporating as it rises up the paper.
As the solvent slowly travels up the paper, the different components of the ink mixtures travel at different rates and the mixtures are separated into different colored spots.

The distance travelled relative to the solvent is called the Rf value. Its formula is: Rf = distance travelled by compound / distance travelled by solvent. Thus, the higher the Rf value, the further the compound has traveled up the paper. The main benefit of the Rf value is that we can now compare values similar values and conclude that they are indeed the same compound&lt;ref name=&quot;Paper Chromatography&quot;&gt;[http://www.chemguide.co.uk/analysis/chromatography/paper.html Chromatography], &lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* Side Effects */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">
==Overview==

The drug Luvox is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)  with the generic name Fluvoxamine Maleate and the chemical name : 5-methoxy-4’-(trifluoromethyl)valerophenone-(E)-O-(2-aminoethyl)oxime maleate (1:1). It can be used in the treatment of chronic depression, obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and social anxiety disorders.  The drug works to increase the amount of serotonin in the brain in order to ward off feelings of depression, anxiety, and fear. Serotonin is a naturally produced neurotransmitter in the body that maintains mental balance and feelings of calm or happiness.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0000955/&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Structural Biochemistry/Medicine &amp; Drug Design|drugs]] comes in a tablet form and has approximately 80% of fluvoxamine bound to plasma [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|protein]], consisting of mostly albumin, over a concentration range of 20 to 2000&amp;nbsp;ng/mL. The absolute bioavailability of fluvoxamine maleate is 53%. The tablet should be taken orally by mouth without crushing or chewing them. Dosages are usually prescribed by doctors starting with low doses and gradually increasing the amount over time. The full effect of the drug may take up to several weeks to start working.

==Biochemical Interactions==

Fluvoxamine maleate is extensively metabolized by the liver. The main human metabolite is fluvoxamine acid and the drug has a half-life of 15.6 hours in the body. The drug targets chemical imbalances in the brain to help treat chronic depression. 

Between the synapse and a nerve cell, there is an exchange of neurotransmitters. Serotonin is one of these neurotransmitters that can send messages between nerve cells. The nerve cells contain reuptake channels that can reabsorb neurotransmitters when their job has been performed and they are no longer needed.  When the message exchange is faster, serotonin spends less time in the synapse as it is taken back up faster, which is believed to cause depression. If the levels of serotonin in the body become unbalanced, OCD or other anxiety disorders can occur. SSRI drugs, like Luvox, can selectively bind to the reuptake channels of serotonin, therefore blocking the reuptake channels from reabsorbing serotonin. This causes the serotonin to remain in the synapse, thus helping to fight off feelings of depression.  Studies have proved that Luvox is an effective drug to treat OCD in both adults and children.&lt;ref&gt;http://anxiety.emedtv.com/luvox/luvox-p2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Side Effects==

Some serious side effects include seizures, fever, and increased thoughts of suicide. Some of the more serious side effects include chest pain, coordination issues, dizziness, hallucinations, pain, loss of consciousness, difficulty breathing, and vomiting or excreting blood. 

Other signs of an allergic reaction listed below may be encountered when taking this medication:
* skin rash or hives
* difficulty breathing
* swelling of face, lips, tongue, or throat

Individuals should immediately call the doctors if any new or worsening symptoms such as mood or behavior changes, anxiety, trouble sleeping, panic attacks, or if feeling impulsive. If you stop taking fluvoxamine suddenly, you may feel some withdrawal symptoms, which include irritability, dizziness, headaches, changes in mood, pain, difficulty in sleeping, or tingling in the extremities. Doctors should assist in decreasing doses gradually before you stop taking the drug.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0000955/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:serotonin.jpg]]

==Precautions==
Before taking fluvoxamine, it is important to inform the doctor or pharmacist if any kind of allergic affect can happen because this kind of medication contains inactive ingredients that can cause allergic reactions or other serious problems. Be wise when taking this kind of medicine. Remember to always tell the doctor of pharmacist of one's medical history especially that of family history disorder, personal history disorder, etc. 

When taking this medication, remember that driving may be dangerous because dizziness may occur. Therefore, do not use machinery and do not drive. Also do not do any kind of activity that requires a good sense of alertness until one is sure that it is safe to perform that certain activity. Remember to never drink alcoholic beverages when taking fluvoxamine.

People of different ages may have different side effects of this drug. For example, older adults may be more sensitive to the side effects, especially that of bleeding. Taking water pills, older adults many develop a type of mineral imbalance in their body. Just like older adults, young people such as children may be more sensitive to the side effects of this drug. Children may encounter a lost of appetite and weight loss. Hence, it is important for parents to monitor their children weight and height while taking this medication. 

Pregnant women who are taking fluvoxamine may harm their unborn baby in the stomach. Therefore, it is always better to ask the doctor before actually taking it. If a mother notice their three month baby having any of this symptoms listed below, they should immediately contact their baby doctor:
* feeding/breathing difficulties
* seizures
* muscle stiffness
* constant crying
Breast feeding mother should contact doctor.

==Introduction to Signal-Transduction Pathways==
Signal transduction is the chain of events that occurs when a cell converts a message to ultimately a physiological response. The message comes in the form of a particular molecule in the cell’s environment. Some examples of signal transduction are as follows. Upon release of epinephrine in response to stress, the cells in the body receive the message, then responds by preparing to use stored energy and improving cardiac function. After a meal, insulin is released into the bloodstream, indicating to cells to take in the glucose. In a wound, epidermal growth factor is released and simulates certain cells to proliferate.

Signal transduction is an important process since it occurs through the communication between difference domains and coupling of information. It is also important to know that ligand induced conformational changes are important to many aspects of protein function. Its importance is demonstrated when an enzyme binds a substrate because the act of binding causes changes in the protein’s structure to enable catalysis. 

== Ligand Binding ==

Signal transduction is an important process since it occurs through the communication between difference domains and coupling of information. It is also important to know that ligand induced conformational changes are important to many aspects of protein function. The importance of these conformational changes is demonstrated when an enzyme binds a substrate; the process of binding causes changes in the protein’s structure to enable catalysis. In addition, the binding of allosteric ligands can lead to the occurrence of more conformational changes as well. 

Ligand binding often leads to changes in both the structure and dynamics with changes in the dynamics often occurring at different locations on the same proteins. The binding of a ligand to one site can often influence the structure, dynamics, and binding affinity at another site on the same protein. This demonstrates that coupling can often be achieved through many different ways. Many times, the effects of ligand binding on protein activity can be explained in terms of more common thermodynamic concepts; the fact that the transition of an active versus resting state depends on several factors such as the free energy difference between the two states, the protein affinity of the ligand, and the ability of a ligand to induce a transition once fully bound to the protein. In the case when a ligand binds to both an activated and resting conformation, incomplete activation often results. A ligand is considered to trigger activation when it binds with higher affinity to an active versus an inactive state. 

The free energy difference, ΔGgap, can also be modified by environmental factors such as membrane composition. An example of this is demonstrated by the fact that the voltage dependent potassium channels exist in equilbrium only in an “on” or “off” conformations. These differ not only in their conductance characteristics but also in the number of charged groups on the two sides of the electrically impermeable membrane. 

The K+ channels and M2 proton channels both share some similarities in their thermodyamic and structural coupling properties. For example, they are similar in the sense that both channels have dual gates to regulate the ion diffusion into the channel versus through the channel. In addition, they are able to achieve a high selectivity by binding multiple copies of permeablet ions. 
The entry of ions through channels is also very tightly regulated to prevent leakage; leakage can be harmful to the life of the organism.

==Signal-Transduction Cascade==
Signal transduction relays a message to a certain physiological response by way of certain key steps. In the first step, an event or condition stimulates the release of the signal molecule, otherwise known as the primary messenger. Generally, primary messengers do not enter cells, and thus work by binding to the cell’s membrane protein on the extracellular side. In the second step, the primary messenger binds to a receptor protein that spans across the membrane, causing conformational change. In the third step, the signal is relayed into the cell by way of conformational change on the receptor protein. This initiates a change in concentration of certain small molecules inside the cell. The small molecules are called second messengers, and they relay the signal inside the cell by activating other receptor-ligand complexes within the cell. In the fourth step, the secondary messengers activate the effectors that directly produce a physiological response. This physiological response can be activation/inhibition of enzymes, membrane channels, or gene-transcription factors. In the final step, after the physiological response is completed, the signal is terminated 

Second messengers provide certain advantages for the signal transduction. A signal can be amplified significantly by generating second messengers. Small amounts of membrane receptors can be activated, but large amounts of second messengers can be generated. Each activated receptor can produce many secondary messengers. Low concentrations of primary messengers in the extracellular environment can give rise to a large signal due to amplification by secondary messengers. Also, second messengers are able to influence other processes in the cell by diffusing to other compartments. In addition, a common secondary messenger can signal for multiple pathways. This is called cross talk. 

==Heterotrimeric G Proteins==
Epinephrine produces signals by binding as a ligand to a membrane protein called β-adrenergic receptor, which from a class of receptors called the seven-transmembrane-helix receptors. These receptors contain seven helices that cross the membrane seven times, thus also referred to as the serpentine receptors. The binding of a ligand on the extracellular side induces a conformational change on the seven-transmembrane-helix receptor on the cytoplasmic side. The conformational change on the intracellular side of the receptor activates G protein. Activated G proteins then binds to and promotes the activity of adenylate cyclase, which is a membrane bound enzyme that converts ATP to cAMP.  cAMP can then move across the cell as the secondary messenger to initiate physiological response. cAMP activates protein kinase A (PKA). Activated PKA activates other proteins that directly produce a physiological response.

Unactivated G protein is bound to GDP and exists as a heterotrimer protein, consisting of the α-, β-, and γ- subunit. The GDP is bound to the α-subunit. To activate the G protein, the GDP is released and GTP binds to the α-subunit. Once GTP binds, the α-subunit dissociates from the βγ dimer. The activated α-subunit then binds and activates adenylate cyclase. The α-subunit has an intrinsic GTPase that slowly hydrolyzes the bound GTP to GDP. Once hydrolyzed to GDP, the α-subunit is deactivated and reassociates with the βγ dimer. The deactivation of G protein is a time dependent process, based on the kinetics of the intrinsic GTPase.
Aside from activating the cAMP cascade, the seven-transmembrane-helix receptor can also activate the phosphoinositide cascade. There are different types of G proteins. The β-adrenergic receptor functions with the Gs protein. The angiotensin II receptor activates the Gq protein. The mechanism of activating the G protein is the same in both cases. However, with the Gq protein, the α-subunit activates the enzyme phospholipase C, which catalyzes the cleavage of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate on the membrane. Inositol trisphosphate and diacylglycerol is formed. Inositol trisphosphate diffuses away from the cell membrane and bind to the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. The calcium ion channels are opened and calcium ions enter the cytoplasm. Calcium ions are signaling molecules and ultimately stimulate release of vesicles and contraction of smooth-muscles. Diacylglycerol remains in the cell membrane, where it helps activates protein kinase C. Calcium ions are also needed to activate the protein kinase. Once activated, protein kinase C activates certain proteins by phosphorylation to produce physiological responses. 

Calcium ion is a secondary messenger in many signaling processes because of several properties. The changes in calcium ions in the cell are easily detected. The calcium ion concentration inside cells is kept at a low level to avoid precipitation. Once calcium ions are released from the endoplasmic reticulum, the concentration of calcium ion in the cell increases by several orders of magnitude. This increase is readily felt by the cell. Calcium ions also bind tightly to proteins and induce a conformational change. Calcium ion can coordinate with several negative charged amino acid residues and thereby inducing a conformational change to activate proteins. 

==Phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C(PLC)==

PLC is an type of enzyme that binds to the inositol phospholipids in eukaryotes by hydrolyzing lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate and creating inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate and diacylglycerol (DAG). The importance of PLC is its ability to stimulate hosphoinositide metabolism and calcium signaling.

PLC is complex and are capable of covering a wide domain of protein. There are three subtypes of PLC: β, γ, and δ. Studies have shown that the DNA structure of δ were first found in single-celled eurkaryotes which are now similar to yeast, fungi, and mold. On the other hand, the β and γ were found to be more similar between plants and animals.

These enzymes are used for catalysis and since PLC have modular domains, they form catalyic α/β barrels from the X and Y regions. At the end of the barrel, there is catalytic and hydrophobic residue that allow substrates to come in and out of the mouth of the barrel. PLC hydrolyzes oxygen and phosphate bonds that contribute to binding phosphoinositol to DAG. This is done by the substrate forming the cyclic 1,2-phosphodiester intermediate and from here, catalysis begins.

PLC regulates cellular activity such as the binding of G protein subunits, the Rho and Ras of the GTPases, lipids, and tyrosine kinases. These enzymes have certain properties that allow them to regulate protein. Its structure was made to target PLC isozymes which led to the ability to solely control what the PLC does during protein-protein or protein-lipid interaction. During this process,

==Serine/Threonine Kinase Transmembrane Receptors TGF beta RI and II==
Serine/Threonine kinase's are enzymes that catalyze the addition of a phoaphate group to a serine or threonine (which have similar side-chains). Many of these receptors are vital to signal pathways that result in the alteration of gene expression. These receptors have two parts that are separated when they are not in contact with their extracellular. Once the signaling molecule complexes to the correct part of the receptor, a conformational change in this part of the receptor enables it to complex to the second separated part of the receptor. This form of the receptor-signal complex also activates the enzymatic activity of the cytoplasmic part of the receptor which results in a signaling cascade. Figure 1 shows these steps for the particular example of Serine/Threonine Kinase Transmembrane Receptors TGF beta RI and II. [[File:TGF beta 1.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A]] 

One particular set of Serine/Threonine Kinase Transmembrane Receptors are TGF beta receptors I and II (TGF beta RI and II). The signal for these transmembrane receptors is Transformation Growth Factor beta (TGF beta), a cytokine that contols many numerous cellular responses like proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and migration. In this case, before the signaling molecule can bind its receptor it needs to be activated. Activation of TGF beta is necessary since it is usually secreted from the source cells as an inactive complex that is referred to as the large latency complex (LLC) composed of TGF beta, latency associated peptide (LAP), and latent TGF beta binding protein (LTBP). When TGF beta is within this complex it is not able to bind to its receptors, TGF beta RI and II. [[File:TGF II.jpg|thumb|right|alt=A]]

One mechanism by which TGF beta is released from the LLC involves the aid of integrins and the extracellular membrane (ECM) component fibronectin (Figure 2). In this mechanism the LTBP anchors to fibronectin in the ECM. Then, the LAP portion of the LLC anchors to an integrin. After this, a pulling force generated by a part of the cytoskeleton that is associated to the integrin protein results in a conformational change of the part of the LLC that is bound to the integrin. This results in TGF beta to be released from the LLC and will eventually find its receptors TGF beta RI and II.

==Insulin Signaling==
There is a class of signal-transduction cascade that uses a receptor that intrinsically contains a protein kinase. One example of this type of signal-transduction cascade is insulin. The insulin receptor is composed to two identical chains connected by disulfide bonds. The receptor has an α-subunit on the extracellular side of the plasma membrane. This receptor extends across the membrane, where the β-subunit lies in the intracellular side. Insulin binds to its receptor by interacting with the α-subunit. With the two ‘arms’ made from identical chains, the α-subunit essentially wraps around insulin. The β-subunit on the cytoplasmic side primarily consists of a tyrosine kinase, which transfers a phosphoryl group from ATP to tyrosine residues. The tyrosine kinase is intrinsic to the receptor, and thus the insulin receptor is often referred to as the receptor tyrosine kinase. 

The insulin receptor is activated when the α-subunit wraps around insulin. When the α-subunit closes around insulin, it causes the β-subunits in the intracellular side to come together. When the two ‘arms’ of the β-subunits come to close proximity, the intrinsic tyrosine kinase becomes active. The tyrosine residues on the β-subunit become phosphorylated, causing a dramatic conformational change on the intracellular end of the receptor. Phosphorylating tyrosine on the receptor also serve to generate docking sites for other substrates, such as insulin-receptor substrates (IRS). Upon docking, the tyrosine residues on IRS are phosphorylated by the receptor. In this form, IRS works as an adapter protein, where IRS binds to lipid kinases and moves them to the membrane. The lipid kinase phosphorylates phosphoinositol bisphosphate to generate phosphatidylinositol trisphosphate. This phosphorylated lipid then activates a protein kinase PDK1, which then also activates another protein kinase: Akt. All of the kinases mentioned above are either anchored to the receptor or the membrane, except for Akt. Akt can move across the cell and cause the movement of glucose transporter GLUT4 to the cell membrane. Once at the membrane, GLUT4 can transport glucose from the extracellular environment into the cell. 

To terminate the signal, the activated receptor is returned to its deactivated state. Specifically, the phosphorylated tyrosine residues on the receptors need to be have the phosphoryl group removed. However, the phosphorylated residues are stable and do not spontaneously hydrolyze back to their original form. Specific enzymes are used to hydrolyze phosphorylated proteins and convert the protein back to their inactive form.

==Two-Component Systems==
Bacteria and archea utilize a two-component system for signal transduction. These systems are absent in animals, and serve as an interesting source for developing antibacterials. The two component system mainly contains a membrane-bound sensor histidine kinase in addition to a response regulator that targets which genes the bacteria expresses in response to certain stimuli. Furthermore, they are linear signal transducers, modifying and amplifying transductions by adding extra modules and using extra proteins called connector proteins. Signal transduction occurs with the phosphorylation of a histidine kinase residue. 
The first step in phosphorylation is histidine's autophosphorylation. The γ-phosphate is attacked by the exposed histidine in the DHp domain, and forces the CA domain to undergo different positions with respect to the histidine residue. Also, histidine phosphorylation is prevented with the binding of the RR to the ATP lid. This fixes the lid's position in between the nucleotide and histidine, preventing phosphorylation. In the entire histidine kinase, there are 2 mobile phosphorylating domains (otherwise known as CA domains) and 2 phosphoacceptors histidine residues. Evidence for both  cis-autophosphorylation and trans-autophosphorylation have been seen, showing that this reaction and undergo both types. Current assumptions on determining cis or trans is based on the length of the hinge between the DHp and CA domains and the connection between the helices in the DHp domain. This knowledge can be obtained by studying phosphotransfer systems lacking autokinase activity, also called histidine phosphotransferases (HPts). Observations studying this system can transfer over to histidine autophosphorylation because the active center for phosphoryl transfer is very similar in both systems. Therefore, the data obtained from this system can be applied to any two-component system.
The phosphatate reaction is when the histidine kinase component catalyze the dephosphorylation of the P~RR, essentially the reserve of RR-phosphorylation. Phosphotransfer and phosphotase reactions occur in different complexes due to their opposite nature. If they were to react in the same complex, they essentially cancel each other out and render the signal ineffective. Not all histidine kinases can catalyze this dephosphorylation, and those that cannot rely on a protein to assume this role. 
Histidine kinases have antiparallel transmembranes helices that aids in signaling from the membrane to the cytoplasm. Signal receptors on the membrane can trigger the helices into a combination of movements that relays the signal further deeper into the cell. Many complexes also have additional domains such as PAS and HAMP modules in between. For example, the HAMP module is composed of 4 helices in a bundle that contributes to the movement of signals by altering its structure in helical rotation and twisting.
There remains much to be learned about two component systems, such as determining a fine definition of what causes cis and trans autophosphorylation. The roles of many different proteins in their structure also remains a mystery. In order to reach these discoveries, more detailed imaging techniques needs to be developed to view the structures on an atomic level.

== Connected Hubs of Signal Transduction Pathways ==
Components of signal transduction pathways have become connected hubs, which bind to specific partners depending on factors such as affinity. One of the hubs is Ras and it is affected by change (no matter the pace and size of the change) which allows information to be carried out. Ras is very complex in recognizing its structure and it makes it difficult to create a model of Ras joining to its effector. By understanding its model, we are to understand the biological what Ras does such as how it specific about binding domains of its effectors.

==Sirtuin Regulation of Mitochondria==
A sirtuin is a very conserved group of proteins that can increase the life span of simple organisms, and control the metabolic and stress pathways. In mammals there are seven sirtuins of which 3 are located in the mitochondria. 
===What is a mitochondria===
	Mitochondria is a very versatile organelle in cells that function as the primary site of oxidative phosphorolation  and plays a role in apoptosis and intracellular signaling. The mitochondria can change its function, morphology and the number in a cell depending on the outside conditions of the cells. The mitochondria has its on set of DNA referred to as mtDNA which encodes for the proteins that are involvement in the electron transport and ATP synthesis.
===Sirtuins and the mitochondria===
	Sir 2 or Silent information regulator and its orthologs SIRTS 1-7 are called sirtuins. The seven in mammals have been conserved in the sirtuin domain in DNA. The sirtuins are used as regulatory proteins in the mitochondria that bind to NAD+ which is a co-factor in the for the proteins the sirtuins are bound to. The activity level of sirtuins is directly related to the increase in levels of NAD+ [[File:Mitochondria and sirtuins.jpg|thumb|Mitochondria and sirtuins]].
===Sirtuins and apoptosis===
	“Apoptosis is the cellular process of programmed cell death. Mitochondria play an important role in apoptosis by the activation of mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization, which represents the irrevocable point of no return in committing a cell to death (article).” There is no clear line on how sirtuins controls apoptosis but it can seen that when a cell does not have SIRT 3 then there is less likely that the cell will be stress induced apoptosis, showing that sirtuins are important to apoptosis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Overview==

Allegra has generic name Fexofenadine and is classified as a Histamine H1-receptor antagonist. It is manufactured by Advancis Pharmaceutical Corporation and has chemical name (±)-4-[1 hydroxy-4-[4-(hydroxydiphenylmethyl)-1-piperidinyl]-butyl]-, -dimethyl benzeneacetic acid hydrochloride. One of the main uses is to treat symptoms caused by allergies. Fexofenadine hydrochloride is 60% to 70% bound to plasma [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|protein]], primarily albumin and 1-acid glycoprotein. Approximately 5% of the total dose of fexofenadine hydrochloride is eliminated by hepatic metabolism through metabolite terfenadine. The half-life is 14.4 hours for 60 mg. The [[Structural Biochemistry/Medicine &amp; Drug Design|drugs]] works by competitively inhibiting the H-1 receptor site and preventing histamine-1 from attaching the receptor sites to cause allergy symptoms. Histamine-1 is released by mast cells in the presence of certain stimulus that the body is allergic to. The drug does not prevent the release of histamine-1 by the mast cells but rather competes with the histamine-1 substrates for positions at the receptor sites. 

[[File:Antihistamine.jpg]]


==Why prescribe this?==
Fexofenadine is prescribe to relieve allergy symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis such as hay fever. Some allergy symptoms in children over 2 years old and adults include runny nose; sneezing; red, itchy, or watery eyes; or itching of the nose, throat, or roof of the mouth. It is also used to relieve symptoms of urticaria such as red, itchy raised areas of the skin, including itching and rash in children 6 months and over and adults. In all, Fexofenadine is in a class of medications called antihistamines. Antihistamines blocks the effects of histamine, a substance in the body that cause allergy to happen. Fexofenadine is known only for controlling the symptoms of seasonal allergic rhinitis and urticaria but it is not a cure for these conditions. 

==How should this medication be used?==
Fexofenadine comes as a tablet or liquid to take by mouth. People who are taking this medication normally take it with water once or twice a day depending on how bad their allergy symptom is. Do not take any kind of fruit juices, such as orange, grapefruit, or apple juice because the performance of fexofenadine in the body system will not be as effective. Remember to take this medication at around the same time(s) every day. Carefully read what the prescription label states and follow it accordingly. Do not take more or less of it or take it more often than prescribed by the doctor. If fexofenadine is use in liquid form, it is crucial to shake the bottle well before use.

==Side Effects==
Taking fexofenadine may cause certain side effects. When any of these side effects listed below are severe and do not go away it is important to quickly consult with the doctor.
* headache
* dizziness
* diarrhea
* vomiting
* pain in the arms, legs, or back
* pain during menstrual period
* cough
Note: Serious side effects and should call doctor immediately are hives, rash, itching, difficulty breathing or swallowing, and swelling in face area or lips.

==Synthesis==
Fexofenadine may be synthesized as shown from piperidine-4-carboxylate ester and 4-bromophenylacetonitrile.&lt;ref name=Lednicer1999&gt;{{cite book

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Definition of Fluorescence=

Fluorescence is the process where light, such as visible light, is absorbed by a molecule and re-emitted at a longer wavelength to generate distinct colors. It is a physical phenomena based on excitation of electrons in an atom or molecule; and emission is at a longer wavelength. Fluorescence allows us to see how things interact in a cell, as well as the localization and pathways taken.

==Introduction==

Fluorescent proteins were first discovered through extraction from the jellyfish ''Aequorea Victoria''. It has been instrumental to studies of cellular biology. Fluorescent proteins contain various color variants that emits various colors at different wavelengths thus allowing functioning as valuable probes that can be used for live cell imaging. The proteins can be used as markers in vivo for whole body imaging and detection of cancer along with in organelles where protein fusion could be done to monitor intracellular dynamics and aspects of transcription. The important aspects that enable that contribute to the fluorescent properties of the protein is both its structure which consist of various Amino acids depending on the protein and the local micro environments. A variety of derivatives of fluorescent proteins have been created for the use of various markers with most widely used being Green Fluorescent Proteins, which was the topic Roger Tsien, a scientist from UCSD, received the Nobel Peace Prize.

==Structure==

Understanding the protein structure allows one to understand further protein function. This is the case for the structure of fluorescent proteins. For green fluorescent proteins, it is made up of a beta barrel structure, which consists of a β-Helix and alpha helices and which surrounds the fluorophore. The fluorophore is a part of the molecule responsible for its color. The fluorophore for the helix is formed by three amino acids that form a tripeptide Ser65–Tyr66–Gly67. The cyclicization of the amino acid residues is what forms the imidazolidone ring. However, an important property of the tripeptide is that the amino acid sequence is not the intrinsic property that leads to fluorescence as the same amino acid sequence is found in other proteins that do no have fluorescence. Further oxidation of imidazolidone ring causes the conjugation of the ring with Tyr-66 contributing the maturation of protein in terms of fluorescence. A key component of the fluorophore also is the fact that it is in two states. One state of the fluorophore is the protonated state or the predominated state, which has an excitation maximum of 395 nanometers. The other state of the fluorophore is the unprotonated state, which has an excitation maximum of 475 nanometers. Because of the complexity of the fluorophore for green fluorescent proteins, the molecule can accommodate modification. One feature that is significant is the packing of amino acid residues in the beta barrel is stable resulting in a high fluorescent quantum yield. The tight protein structure contributed by H-bodning also has resistance to pH, temperature, and denaturants such as urea.    

==Variations in Fluorescent Proteins==

'''Yellow Fluorescent Proteins '''

These fluorescent proteins are represented by the mutation in one of the amino acid residues of the fluorophore. The tyrosine found in Green fluorescent proteins (GFP) is found to have an mutation, which results in the stabilizing of the dipole movement and the shift in wavelength of the excitation/emission spectra resulting in the yellow fluorescence. Furthermore, the yellow fluorescent proteins was found to have a new threonine residue 203 near the fluorophore. Further modification of the yellow fluorescent protein, can enhance the brightness of the protein, which makes it a Enhanced Yellow Fluorescent Protein (EYFP). Because of the brightness of the fluorescence, the protein is an important tool in multicolor imaging. These proteins are derived from the jellyfish Aequorea Victoria and is modified to create a different emission of fluorescence different from the original Green Fluorescent Protein. 

Yellow fluorescence protein '''TagYFP''' is a bright yellow fluoresence recommended for protein labeling in protein localization and interaction studies. It may also be used for cell and organelle labeling and for tracking promoter activity, although TurboYFP anf Phl-Yellow proteins are preferred. It is a monomeric protein successfully used for fusions and was developed under the bassis of GFP-like protein from the jellyfish ''Aequorea macrodactyla''. TagYFP has a fast maturation phase along with high pH-stability and photstability. It's high pH stability allows it to be more stable that EYFP while its fast maturity allows it to give a brighter fluorescent signal. TagYFP has also been proven to generate stable transfected cell lines.

'''Blue and Cyan Fluorescent Proteins'''

Blue and Cyan Fluorescent Proteins result from the modification of the Tyr 66 residue located in the fluorophore. The conversion of the Tyr to histidine leads to the emission of blue fluorescence at a wavelength of 450 nanometers. Another modification is the conversion of Tyr to tryptamine resulting in a different fluorescence at a wavelength of about 480-500 nanometers. Additionally, genetic markers which uses these fluorescent proteins are expressed as TagBFP. One of the advantage of this protein is the ease at which it can be express and detect in a wide range of organisms. Mammalian cells transiently transfected with TagBFP expression vectors give bright fluorescent signals within 10-12 hrs after transfection. No cell toxic effects and visible protein aggregation are observed. TagBFP performance in fusions has been demonstrated in the β -actin and α-tubulin models. It can be used in multicolor labeling applications with green, yellow, red, and far-red fluorescent dyes.  A problem though of these modifications is that that they require secondary mutations to increase not only folding efficiency, but also brightness. Fortunately, the genome modification is not life-threatening.

'''Red Fluorescent Proteins'''

Various derivatives of Red Fluorescent proteins have been derived in hopes to find a protein that exceeds or equals the fluorescence ability of GFP (green fluorescent protein). One derivative of protein has been from the coral ''Dicosoma striata'' also known DSRED. When it is matured, the protein is found to have an emission spectrum of about 583 nanometers. Further modification of DSRED has led to the formation of DSRED2 which have mutations at the peptide terminus preventing formation of protein aggregates and reduce toxic levels. Also, the DSRED2 is found to be more compatible with GFP as well. These proteins are also represented by its tetramer structure.

''''Green Fluorescent Proteins''''
The green fluorescent protein (GFP) is derived from about 200+ amino acid residues. This protein will exhibit green fluorescence when under to blue light. This GFP is mainly isolated from a marine biological organism: the jellyfish Aequorea victoria. This GFP has three main excitation maximums. An intense one at wavelength 395, a smaller one at 475&amp;nbsp;nm, and the emission peak which is at 509&amp;nbsp;nm which is what gives this protein a distinct vibrant green color. Another organism from the sea pansy has another excitation peak around 498&amp;nbsp;nm. This GFP gene is important for biosensing and reporting locations of gene expression. It can be transformed into other organism's genome through breeding, invitro injection, or through transformation. The GFP gene is introduced into a variety of bacteria, yeast, fungi, and other multicellular organisms. The story of how GFP became a research tool began in 1992, when Martin Chalfie of Columbia University showed that the gene that makes GFP produced a fluorescent protein when it was removed from the jellyfish genome and transferred to the cells of other organisms. Chalfie, a developmental biologist, first put the gene into bacteria and roundworms, creating glowing versions of these animals. Martin Chalfie, Osamu Shimomura, and Roger Y. Tsien were awarded the 2008 Nobel Prize in chemistry on 10 October 2008 for their discovery and development of the green fluorescent protein. Since then, researchers have transferred the GFP gene into many other organisms and even human cells growing in a lab dish.The GFP is unique amongst natural pigments for its ability to autocatalyse its own chromophore, through atmospheric conditions.  In this way, a single protein acts as both substrate and enzyme.  Other natural pigments require multiple enzymes for their production.  Biotechnology has taken advantage of this unique feature of GFP, putting it to use as an in vivo marker of gene expression and protein localisation. 
'''Monomeric Fluorescent Protein Variants'''

Fluorescent Proteins originally in its natural states exist as dimers, tetramers, and oligomers. Also, the theoretical possibility of fluorescent proteins forming dimers in cellular compartments due to possible high protein concentrations contributing to dimerization. Thus, the use of monomeric fluorescent protein variants has been sought after. One problem however is that the first few monomeric fluorescent proteins had reduced fluorescence capability. Furthermore, the production of the monomers required around 30 amino acid changes to the structure. There are improvements though in the development of these proteins that have increased quantum yields and photostability.

==Function==

Fluorescent tags are used to label molecules such as proteins, DNA, and antibodies. Fluorescent labeling works with fluorophore reacting with a functional group on the target molecule. Probes are produced from this type of molecular labeling. Western blot assays identify and separate proteins therefore these fluorescent tags are crucial. Size exclusion chromatography removes fluorophore on the target molecules. Fluorescent dyes can be used to specify which organelle of the cell is present in order to distinguish their unique structure and further explore their individual functions. These tags and dyes are important in microscopy and reverse photobleaching because they are less harmful to living cells than quantum dots. Fluorescent dyes have hydrophobic properties hence specific dye columns are used in separations of molecules with dyes. 

Example: Western Blot Assay

The purpose of a Western Blot is to locate and determine proteins on the basis of their ability to bind to certain antibodies.  A Western Blot analysis allows one to detect a protein of interest from a mixture of a number of proteins.  After completing a Western Blot, the information gained from the process is the size of the protein and the expressed amount of protein.  
A Western Blot analysis can be done on any protein sample, ranging from cells to tissue, to recombinant proteins synthesized in vitro. A condition the Western Blot is dependent on is the quality of the antibody that is used to probe for the target protein.  The antibodies used in a Western Blot must be specific to the protein of interest.

==Uses==

'''X-Ray Fluorescence Microscopy:'''

  
Hard X-Ray fluorescence microscopy is useful to investigate the trace metal distributions within a whole, unstained, biological tissues. 

 

Trace metal elements are integral to many life forms.  Metals help catalyze functions and sometimes even play a structural role within the cell.  Take for example zinc finger domains, where Zinc ions help to bind nucleic acids and proteins. Metals are recognized for having influential effects on human health and disease.  Therefore, the study of these trace elements can provide important information and reasoning for the functions and pathways of metalloproteins.  These studies may even find therapeutic approaches to quantitatively study the intracellular distribution of these trace elements.

 

These X-ray fluorescence has been used to create tomographs to visualize the structure of a 10-μm cell.  Despite the usefulness of using these high penetration X-rays for tomography, there have been limitations that affect the length of time of experiments as well as the accuracy of these images.  Due to these limitations in X-Ray fluorescence microscopy, there have been ongoing research to develop better X-ray resolution, detector speed, cryogenic environments, and the pursuance of a auxiliary signals.  Thus, there will be many helpful new approaches in X-ray fluorescence tomography in the future.

  

Hard X-ray fluorescence, also called XRF, microscopy is a useful tool to trace metal distributions in various biological systems.  For transition metals such as copper, zinc, and other relevant trace elements, XRF has provided attogram sensitivity at spatial resolutions down to 150&amp;nbsp;nm.  Nowadays, 10-15 elements have been able to be mapped simultaneously.  This simultaneous mapping of elements leads to precise elemental colocalisation maps.

  

Structural visualization has been improved even further with the use of hard X-ray fluorescence, but several technical challenges have presented themselves to lead to two-dimensional and low-definition realizations.  Current developments have allowed scientists to overcome some of the most major limitations, and now the scientific world is able to create sub-500-nm resolution XRF tomography.  Tomographs with this resolution can provide extreme detail in the realm of elemental specificity.  These recent progresses in XRF tomography will definitely be utilized soon.  Other developments in progress are cryo-microprobges, which are able to accommodate frozen-hydrated specimens.  

The process of X-ray fluorescence is extremely fit for quantifying trace elements.  XRF is unique because it does not rely on artificial dyes or flurophores to determine the structure of proteins, rather, X-ray fluorescence can be excited by exposing molecules to particles (electrons and protons) or X-ray beams.  With the use of X-ray excitation, the bremsstrahlung background becomes unnecessary, allowing WRF microscopy to show high spatial resolution.  Because X-ray penetration enables scientists to have sample thicknesses of tens of microns, XRF microscopy is an ideal method for form tomographic visualization of biological samples.

 

Due to many technical challenges and the analytical complexities  involved in XRF tomography, the method has not found general application.  Regardless, recent developments have provided advancements in 3D resolutions down to a few 100&amp;nbsp;nm for specimen up to 10&amp;nbsp;µm in size.  This means 3D elemental maps of multiple elements can be visualized with high spatial resolution.  
There is a bright future ahead for XRF with its recent advancements.  Combined with the demand from the biological, environmental, materials, and geological communities, XRF seems very promising.

  

&lt;b&gt;XRF Tomography: 

&lt;/b&gt;

The term ‘tomography’ is derived from Greek and means ‘slice imaging’, meaning that it is a technique that gets its data from a single slice within its specimen.  A 3D reconstruction is made of slices of a specimen from tilted angles.  The task of reconstruction can be quite strenuous and time consuming, given that serial sectioning is the direct approach to tomography.  This direct method of actually physically sectioning can lead to significant artefacts, which is a defined as a man-made object that taken as a whole. As an alternative to physically sectioning, non-destructive techniques can be utilized because they reduce specimen preparation requirements and are also significantly easier and simpler to perform.    In comparison to other methods of tomography, only XRF microtomography is able to map trace elemental distributions in direct relevance to biology.

  
&lt;b&gt;

Full-field tomography: &lt;/b&gt;

  

Recently, X-ray fluorescence tomography has been demonstrating by using full-field imaging and structured detector approaches.  However, these novel full-field imaging and structured detector approaches have their pros and cons as well.  These nascent technologies have spatial resolution between 2 and 200 μm, an sensitivity levels between 100ppm to percent levels.  They also have a wide range of different elemental contrasts, making them ill prepared to be used routinely in studying the cells of biological specimens.

  

&lt;b&gt;Projection Tomography:

&lt;/b&gt;  

Projection tomography is the technique that makes a tomographic reconstruction algorithm by using projections of the specimen as its input data.  There is an energy-dispersive detector that is sensitive to any signal that is produced along the column.  2D data is measured over a range of positions, measurements are made at several angles, and an analytic approach helps to construct a 3D map of the specimen.  What distinguishes X-ray fluorescence micrographs from other tomographic methods is its self-absorption effects.  This encompasses  the re-absorption of the fluorescence by the specimen and the absorption of the incident beam.  The self-absorption effects are increased for thick specimens when X-ray micrographs are done using low fluorescent energy.

  

Self-absorption has significant effects on XRF tomography.  To combat this issue, good correction algorithms are required for image clarity they also will expand the specimen size domain, to lower fluorescence energies and maintain accurate data. Absorption maps can be used to estimate the self-absorption at various fluorescence energies.  Using the energy-dispersive detector, inelastic and elastic signals were recorded.  These inelastic and elastic signals provide access to major light element distributions that are normally hard to attain. 

&lt;b&gt;

Confocal Tomography:  

&lt;/b&gt;

Confocal tomography is known as a direct-space approach to scanning the XRF tomography when axial resolutions are below 5&amp;nbsp;µm.  In this approach, the signal derives from only a small portion of the illuminated column because the collimator confines the field view of the energy-dispersive direction. 

Confocal tomography only gives a direct access to a small region of the specimen.  Unfortunately, this can make it quite difficult to target the features of interest within a specimen.  Researchers have suggested another approach to dealing with this issue:  using projection tomography for a low-resolution overview and then following by using a confocal study of the region of interest.  

=Fluorescence imaging and cell function=

One of the biggest goals of structural biology is to understand how cells function, and how they sense and process external and internal signals. Genetically encoded fluorescent proteins (FPs) and fluorescent sensors can help researchers visualize how cellular processes work. 
Cells, the basic building blocks of all living systems, rely on complex internal processes. These processes take place on the micrometer scale in different membrane compartments and cytoskeletal locations. Fluorescence imaging, employing green fluorescent protein (GFP) from the jellyfish Aequoria victoria and its relatives can help scientists further explore these cellular processes. GFP can be used as an important molecular imaging tool because of its fluorescence, or its capacity to produce a light of a different color other than the illuminating light. GFP and fluorescence can monitor cellular processes over time. Furthermore, GFP is encoded by a single portable DNA sequence that can be easily be fused to a protein of interest and expressed within living cells. Before GFP, researchers relied on fluorescent antibody techniques to examine the proteins and nucleotide sequences, but this could only be done on dead, fixed cells or tissue sections. 

As GFP became a more and more popular molecular imaging tool, improvements and advances of GFP also arose. Mutagenesis of GFP caused an increase its brightness ad folding efficiencies and a decrease in its oligomerization. Mutagenesis also created forms of GFP that are photoactivable or photconvertable. It was discovered that GFP is just one member of a bigger family of homologous fluorescent proteins, mainly from marine corals, with different colors resulting from variations in structure and environment. Directed mutagenesis of the FP from these species resulted in a palette of FPs, covering the entire range of visible spectrum. Multiple colors allow for simultaneous imaging of multiple sets of proteins inside cells. 

GFP developments ultimately gave rise to different imaging techniques such as fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, fluorescence correlation spectroscopy, FRET, fluorescence cross correlation spectroscopy, total internal reflection microscopy, fluorescence lifetime imaging, and photoactivation localization microscopy (PALM). These imaging techniques allow for in vivo analyses of cell function. 

For example FP reporters can be used to monitor the behavior of tagged signaling molecules and their organization as well as detect specific pools of each component in a signaling pathway. This can be done by photobleaching, where an area of the cell is photobleached with a high intensity laser pulse and the movement of unbleached molecules from neighboring areas into the bleached area is recorded by time-lapse microscopy. The kinetic properties of a protein within a cell, such as its movement between compartments, can also be seen when tagged with a genetically encoded FP. In both photobleaching and photactivation, the overall functions of an FP fusion protein can be determined without disturbing other pathways or cell function. 

Use of FPs in fluorescent imaging methods also enables protein-protein interactions to be resolved.  This can be done through FRET measurements, which allow for mapping of protein-protein interactions within cells in real-time. In FRET, one reporter is a donor fluorophore, the other reporter is a longer wavelength acceptor fluorophore. The readout is energy transfer from the donor to acceptor. By incorporating GFP variants, these reporters can be attached to different proteins to test for their interaction. 

Further processes developed include using probes for monitoring GTP hydrolysis and cell cycle events. One strategy is to use small molecules that can be induced to form dimers. Probes can be used to drive specific biological activities at selected times and places in cells. Another strategy involves optically inducible switches, which employ light to activate signaling molecules. Probes can also react with zinc and nitric oxide indicators, which are inorganic species that drive physiological processes or trigger pathology. 

Reporter technologies allow for real-time visualization of biochemical processes in living systems and offer a means to obtain insights into spatial organization and regulation of intracellular signaling networks underlying biological processes. 

=Fluorescent Imaging of Kinase Action=
Molecular imaging approaches have been developed in order to analyze the actions of phosphorylation in live cells.  These involve the use of recently introduced fluorescent reporters that allow for high resolution imaging of phosphorylation in the cells.  This molecular imaging provides us with understanding and insights of timing and cellular localization of signaling networks.  Before the development of these fluorescent imaging techniques, measurements of kinase action was oten done through analysis of enzymatic activities ex post facto (meaning retroactive) through techniques of immunoprecipitation or immunocytochemistry.  The delayed measurements are not as effective as they have problems of specificity and the inability for reports on the kinase action in real time.  In addition, obtainment of information after the kinase action can cause  the loss of key information only found in live cells.  As such, fluorescent reporters have been developed for the purpose of real time analysis in complex mixtures or living cells.

===Protein Biosensors===
Biosensors for peptides are often used to measure phosphoylation events with good resolution in vitro with the potetial for live cell imaging.  These biosensors follow a basic design of synthetic flurophore into peptides or proteins.  These properties change upon phosphorylation which allows for the analysis through a shift in wavelength (increases, decreases, or even both in quantum yield).  There are four main types of bio sensors: environmentally sensitive, deep quench, self-reporting, or metal chelation enhanced.

Environmentally sensitive biosensors generally have a phosphospecific amino acid domain that complexes with the phosphoylated peptide.  This type of biosensor is often used for Ser/Thr or Tyr phosphorylation.  When activated, fluorescence is increased sevenfold.

Deep quench biosensors have a noncovalently attached quencher that shields the fluorescence until phosphorylation.  When the molecule is phosphorylated the biosensors obtains a phosphospecific amino acid that separates the quencher from the fluorophore causing an increase in fluorescence.  This often has around a 64-fold increases in fluorescence.

Self-reporting biosensors are used to detect tyrosine phosphorylation.  For instance, tyrosine can be used to quench a fluorophore through pi-pi stacking interactions.  When phosphorylated, the quench is lost and the fluorescence is increased by fivefold.

Lastly, metal chelation-enhanced biosensors use the nonnatural amino acid Sox, chelation-enhanced fluorophore and a series of biosenors for protein kinase activities that repsond to Mg2+.  These generally have a eightfold increase in fluorescence upon phosphorylation.

These biosensors are generally used in vitro kinase assays and allow for the detection of an initial lag phase.  These biosensors also generally monitor activities of several kinases.  There is also the possibility of using these biosensors to analyze live cell assaays but these are more difficult.  While these methods are good for analysis of the protein kinases, they are not as widely adopted as believed as they rely on specilizaed equipment and the instability of peptides and cellular perturbation can occur.

===FRET-based Biosensors===
FRET (stands for Forster (fluorescence) resonance energy transfer) is a mechanism to describe energy transfer between proteins.  
Most imaging techniques have the difficulty of getting the biosensor into living cells or have limitations that restrict use.  FRET-based reporters generally overcome entering the cell as it has the cell manufacture the biosensor itself.  These reporters are genetically encoded and can be transferred into cells as DNA.  A notable example of these generically encoded biosensors is GFP (Green Flurorescent Protein).  The changes in FRET can be seen as changes in emission rations between the fluorophore fluorescence; this is gernally the change in emission between donor and acceptor fluorophores.  

FRET imaging is done through photochemical properties of donors using FLIM (Fluorescent lifetime imaging microscopy) which detects shortened fluorescence decay of the donor pair of FRET in the presence of the acceptor.  This is advantageous as lifetime measurements are independent of the fluorophore cocentration and photobleaching and allow for the distinguishing of actual FRET efficiency and probe concentration.

The FRET pair is selected to generate a maximum dynamic range.  A domain is selected on the basis of the phosophoamino acid that is to be detected by the biosensor.  The substrate part of the biosensor is what controls the specificity of the reporter.  This is generally a short consensus peptide to be specifically recognied and efficiently phosphorlated by the target kinases but inert to other kinases.  This method has given rise to a number of successfully genetically encoded biosensors.  These have also been modified to include other features such as sequences to target a specific area of the cell or more genertion of the biosensors inside the cell.  

These FRET based biosensors provide us with the means to image phosphoyrlation in living cells more efficiently and effectively than before.

===Applications of Genetically Encoded Reporters===
Genetically encoded reporters can provide sufficient sensitivity when compared to the fluoresence in peptide-based biosensors and are able to provide more useful information aboue the phosphorylation and regulation of signalling pathways.  These reporters can be used to study specific kinases and influence activity.  These can also target specific reporters to find correlations between phosphorylation of specific proteins to other features of the cells.  

One of the more exciting applications of kinases reporters are through the usage of high throughput chemical screens.  These can help pharmaceuticals as the reporters can ensure compounds achieve efficient cell entry and provide kinetic information of protein inhibition.  This is a big change as these screens are generally done through in vitro and is unclear is these compounds can target the intracellular kinases.  Through the usage of the in-cell kinases reporters, senveral novel PKA inhibitors were able to be identified.  This was all done through the analysis of FRET.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Drum tabs are great, but the more complicated the rhythms get, the harder they are to read. They can quickly get very confusing. Musical scores are great for reading music quickly and accurately. Although learning to read sheet music is more involved than learning to read tabs, there is a lot more you can do with sheet music once you are fluent in reading it. Reading sheet music is not strictly necessary for you to be a skilled drummer. However, sheet music is a powerful tool that is useful to learn and will probably benefit you in many situations, especially when collaborating with other musicians.

== Why learn to read sheet music? ==
Drum tabs are a very imprecise way of explaining how to play a passage of music. You can use tabs to find out a rhythm to play, but tabs will usually leave out such things as: time signature, accents, tempo, number of times to repeat a passage, and more. Sheet music has a higher learning curve for you to overcome than tabs because there are more symbols and pieces to understand. However, just like with playing drums, practice makes perfect.

One of the best uses of sheet music is aiding in communication. For example, say you are playing drums for a musical and the piano player is trying to tell you that you need to play an accent at a certain part of a song. The pianist could mention that you play the accent when a certain melody comes along, but what if that melody comes about several times? It sure would be handy to have a way to denote exactly the point in a song the pianist is talking about...

Sheet music to the rescue! With sheet music you can refer to a specific measure number to find out when a certain part of the song is supposed to be played. This makes things easier for you and the pianist. Rather than saying, &quot;Play the accent when this melody comes in&quot;, now we can say &quot;Play this accent at measure 23&quot; which is much more precise. Also, this makes it easy to make a note on your sheet music at that measure.

And a final note before we get started. Reading sheet music fluently allows you to instantly know things about how to play some music you've never heard before. Rather than being stuck playing only what you've previously heard, now you will be able to play music just by mentally translating notes on paper into physical drum hits. If you become skilled at this, your range of opportunities for having fun with music will expand, which is always a good thing.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== GANGSTA+ ==

GANGSTA+ is a combinatorial algorithm for non-sequential structural alignment of proteins and similarity search in databases. This method uses a combinatorial approach on the secondary structural level to find similarities between two protein structures based on contact maps. Different SSE (Secondary Structure Element) assignment modes can be used for this program. This assignment of SSEs can be performed with respect to the sequential order of SSEs in the polypeptide chain of the considered protein pair (sequential alignment), or by ignoring this order completely (non-sequential alignment). SSE pairs can also be aligned in reverse orientation if desired. The highest ranking SSE assignments are transferred to the residue level by a point matching approach. In order to obtain an initial common set of atomic coordinates for both proteins, pairwise attractive interactions of the alpha carbon atom pairs are defined by inverse Lorentzians and the energy is minimized. The [http://agknapp.chemie.fu-berlin.de/gplus/  GANGSTA+ database can be found here.]

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Allosterism''' a characteristic of certain enzymes.  These particular enzymes can have its effectiveness altered by the enzyme changing its tertiary structure.  This change in tertiary structure alters the reactivity of other binding sites, possibly increasing substrate affinity at these other sites.  As a result, the binding can become cooperative, which means that binding at one site can increase the chances of a substrate binding to other sites.  This leads to sigmoidal graphs of substrate concentration versus reaction velocity.  On a side note, these allosteric enzymes do not obey Michaelis-Menten Kinetics. They do not obey the Michaelis-Menten Kinetics because the rate of product v.s substrate concentration resembles a &quot;S&quot; curve and a sigmoidal kinetics. And that sigmoidal kinetics result from cooperativity, which is the binding of substrate to an active site will facilitate the binding of other substrates to other active sites. 

An example of '''Allosterism''' is the '''Allosteric effectors''' of Carbon Dioxide and Hydrogen ions in red blood cells. The Allosteric Hemoglobin has hydrogen ions and Carbon dioxide that will bind to other sites on hemoglobin that will alter the actual active sites of the hemoglobin. In this case, the hydrogen ion and Carbon dioxide will bind to hemoglobin that will result in the decrease of the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Gene Expression==
Gene expression is the process where information from a gene is used in the synthesis of a functional gene product.  These products are often proteins, but in non-protein coding genes such as rRNA genes or tRNA genes, the product is a functional RNA.  The process of gene expression is used by all known life – eukaryotes (including multi-cellular organisms), prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) and viruses – to generate the macromolecular machinery for life.
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Gene Expression.gif|thumb|alt=Gene structure and gene expression in higher organisms.|Eukaryote Gene Expression.]]
&lt;br&gt;
Genes are expressed when they translated into proteins after transcription into RNA. Some genes are expressed at all times, these genes are subject to constitutive expression. Many genes are not expressed at all times but only for certain situations, either in a specific cell or under a particular condition. These genes are subjected to regulated expression.
&lt;br&gt;
[http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OEWOZS_JTgk A video by Genome British Columbia demonstrating gene expression]

===Control of Gene Expression===
Gene expression is controlled during transcription. Whether or not a gene is transcribed is mainly determined by the interplay between specific DNA sequences and the specific proteins that bind to these sequences. Genes are located in specific positions within the genome, but these sites do not have any distinguishing features. Gene regulation is controlled by regulatory sites that can be close or far away to the region of DNA that is being transcribed. 
To initiate gene transcription, regulatory proteins recruit RNA Polymerase to sites within the genome, this happening in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. 

&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Gene expression control.png|thumb|alt=Gene structure and gene expression in higher organisms.|Gene Expression Control.]]

&lt;br&gt;
==Regulatory Sites==
Genes, which are located in a specific position in a genome, do not possess any distinguishing feature that allows regulatory system to recognize them, instead, other sequences in the genome contributes to its regulation. These sites, binding sites for specific DNA- binding proteins, are often close to the DNA being transcribed but its proximity it's not necessary.
These proteins, when successfully bound to the sites, control whether a protein is expresses or not. 

Regulatory sites were first discovered in E. coli bacteria. In the presence of sugar lactose, E. coli express a gene encoding for and enzyme that can process lactose into the use of an energy source. The nucleotide sequence for this enzyme is a nearly perfect inverted repeat. 

5'-...TGTGTGGAATTGTGAGCGGATAACAATTTCACACA...3'

3'-...ACACACCTTAACACTCGCCTATTCTTAAAGTGTGT...5'


Symmetry regulatory sites like this usually correspond to the symmetry in the protein that binds the site.

=====Regulatory Sites in Operons=====
The Operon Model was proposed by Francois Jacob and Jacques Monod after a series of experiments as a common mechanism of expression of genes. The model consists of a regulator gene, the operator site which functions as a regulatory DNA sequence, and a set of structural genes. The Regulator gene encodes a repressor protein that will bind to the operator site preventing transcription. The operator site and the set of structural genes both form what is called the Operon. The Operon is a common regulatory unit in prokaryotes.

====Regulation of Transcription====
The main method of Gene control is regulating transcription. Transcription can be regulated by various strategies.
* Specificity Factors-  alter the specificity of RNA polymerase for a promoter by changing the likelihood of binding.
* Repressors- bind to the non-coding sequences on that are close to or overlapping the promoter region of the DNA. It impedes RNA polymerase's progress, which blocks the expression of the gene. 
* General transcription factors- These factors place RNA polymerase at the start of a protein-coding sequence and release the polymerase to transcribe the mRNA.  
*Activator- speed up the rate of gene expression
*Enhancers- bring a specific promoter to start the complex

==Expression System==
An expression system is a system where the production of a gene product of choice is specifically designed.  Such a system consists of a gene, normally encoded by DNA, and the molecular machinery required to transcribe the DNA into mRNA and translate the mRNA into protein using provided reagents.  Although this process is utilized in every single cell, the term is more commonly used in reference to laboratory work.  On the other hand, expression systems are fundamentally a natural process.


==Living without 30 nm chromatin fibers==

Firstly, chromatin fibers refer to strings of nucleosomes which often deal with coiling for compaction and the fitting of the genome into a cell's nucleus. According to various researchers, these strings of nucleosomes, also known as 10 nm chromatin fibers, make up the template of material that are transcriptionally active. Nowadays, with newly developed experiments such as with the chromatin conformation capture and the cryo-electron microscopy, the question of whether the in situ evidence for the 30 nm chromatin fiber emerges. 

====The Hierarchy of DNA Organization====
A researcher named Roger Kornberg has been able to isolate the chromatin subunit which contains a histone-DNA complex, which later became known as the nucleosome. These same chromatin subunits signified the &quot;beads-on-a-string&quot; of the 10 nm chromatin fiber. Some experiments, such as X-ray diffraction, neutron scattering, and energy loss electron microscopy have allowed researchers to observe that 10 nm fibers illustrated the wrapping of DNA 1.75 turns around the nucleosome core. Some important observations to consider regarding the 10 nm chromatin fiber are that: a) the histones possess a positive charge which cause the core of the DNA to be positive, balancing out the charge with the DNA's negative backbone and b) Compaction occurs due to the wrapping of DNA around the histone core, which allows for the genome to reside within. 

Additionally, another researcher named Aaron Klug brought up that a huge amount of the genome possess 30 nm fibers, but produced from the coiling of 10 nm fiber into a solenoid through compaction. This compaction often depends on various proteins and divalent metal ions such as magnesium.

====30 nm chromatin fiber models====
There are various models that allow us to observe these chromatin fibers. These models are the one-start solenoid, the two-start helix zigzag, the cross-linker, and the supranucleosome model. 

1) The solenoid model = Deals with the coiling of the 10 nm fiber around an axis of symmetry with nucleosomes closely packed to one another. 

2) The two-start zigzag model = Deals with the zigzagging of two nucleosomes, subsequently causing them to form and col into a helical conformation.

3) The cross-linker model = Deals with the DNA crisscrossing back and forth across the helical axis with the presence of closely packed nucleosomes located across from each other. This model is very similar to the two-start zigzag model. 

4) The supranucleosome model = Deals with the clumping of nucleosomes separated by linker sequences.

--Out of these various models, only the solenoid model and the two-start zigzag model have gained wide acceptance and consistency.

==Various Techniques and Experiments for Observation==
One of the first experiments to observe the 30 nm fiber was done with starfish sperm and this was practiced in vivo through Electron Microscopy and Electron Spectroscopic Imaging. These studies have suggested that the 10 nm fiber dealt with folding and twisting into a width of 30 nm. 

1) Cryo-EM: Another technique done was cryo-EM which allowed researchers to observe mitotic chromosomes and their lack of 30 nm fibers in a fully condensed form of the chromatin. With this particular technique, there are actually advantages such as the fact that the samples are completely hydrated and do not require chemical fixation with cross-linking agents. This makes it easier for researchers to observe the chromatin and it also infers that the 10 nm chromatin may be more energetically favorable since they are present in a fully condensed state. 

2) Model Tweezers Experiment: With this, single force spectroscopy is utilized to measure the force required to convert a 30 nm chromatin fiber, which contains of 25 nucleosome repeat arrays, into an extended 10 nm fiber. This experiment provides sub-pico Newton force resolution which allows for the precise mathematical modeling of transitions between chromatin fiber configurations.

3) EM studies in vitro: These experiments had to do with the reconstitution of nucleosome arrays. This supports the two-start and the solenoid models. The downfall with this particular model though is that it is a bit unclear about how the regular spacing of the 30 nm solenoid chromatin fiber could accommodate the irregular nucleosome spacing that is present in vivo. 

4) Electron Spectroscopic Imaging (ESI): This is a high-contrast technique that does not depend on heavy metal contrast agents. It is based only on the electrons that have interacted with specific elements in the specimen, producing a dark field image of high contrast, which can subsequently be utilized to observe nucleosomes. 

5) Chromosome conformation capture (3C) technique: Illustrated that the subchromosomal domain within the yeast genome did not exist as a compact 30 nm fiber, but instead as an extended fiber. The linear mass density found with this technique was less than in the FISH experiment, which was inconsistent with a 30 nm chromatin fiber. This technique has only the possibility to figure out the long-range chromatin interactions from a locus of interest, causing it to have technical limitations. 

6) DNA fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH): In this technique, it has been assumed that the 30 nm fiber is the lowest order of chromatin folding in vivo. This is usually done in yeast in which you can observe a flexible 30 nm-like polymer. However, it is argued that this technique may lack sufficient resolution to conclude a highly bent and kinked 10 nm fiber in comparison to a less bent or kinked 30 nm fiber. 

7) Hi-C technique: This technique was done by Lieberman-Aiden and was an adaptation of the 3C method that allows for the unbiased identification of long-range chromatin interactions, to a human lymphoblastoid cell line. In this technique, there is the digestion of cross-linked DNA with a restriction enzyme to create 5' overhangs filled with nucleotides.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction to acid base catalysis reactions==

This type of catalysis involves proton donors or acceptors other than water. There is then a nucleophilic or electrophilic attack. Finally, the enzyme is then restored. 

The donation or acceptance of protons is generally to stabilize the transition state. A corollary to this is metal ion catalysis which involves a metal ion that stabilizes the transition state with its positive charge. Some acid base catalysis reactions also use metal ions. One common amino acid present in most enzymes that acts as an acid or a base is histidine, since its pKa is close to that of the surrounding pH. Thus, it can act as either an acid or a base. 

One example is with carbonic anhydrase that breaks down carbonic acid into a proton and a bicarbonate ion.

H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;-(with carbonic anhydrase)-&gt; H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

There is a part at the active site of carbonic anhydrase that contains a Zinc ion (Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;) that is coordinated to a few histidine R groups. The Zinc also coordinates with the oxygen of a water molecule. When Zinc is coordinated with a water molecule, the pKa reduces from 15.7 to about 7. Thus, this means that at the physiological pH, the water molecule readily deprotonates. Now this Oxygen atom acts as a nucleophile, attacking the carbon of a carbon dioxide. This creates a complex coordination compound attached to the Zinc ion, resembling the bicarbonate ion. In the final step, another water molecule replaces the biocarbonate ion, and the enzyme is reformed, ready to react again.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ubiquitin (Ub) is a 76 amino acid protein that tags proteins for destruction by proteasomes. It is found in all eukaryotic cells and is involved in various signaling pathways including cell cycle, endocytosis, transcription, DNA repair, signal transduction, apoptosis, and the immune response. The proteins degraded through ubiquitin are regulatory proteins. Ub-activating enzymes (E1), Ub-conjugating enzymes (E2), and Ub ligases (E3) are essential in protein ubiquitylation, which is most commonly known for its ability to execute controlled protein degradation by the 26S proteosome. However, ubiquitylation can not only induce protein degradation, but it can also control protein behavior, modulate subcellular localization, and moderate protein-protein interactions.
Ubiquitin medications can signal irreversible proteolytic events (such as degradation through Lys&lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;) and reversible nonproteolytic events. The nonproteolytic events utilize mono-ubiquitin and poly-ubiquitin chains connected through Lys&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; or Lys&lt;sup&gt;63&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Ubiquitylation Pathway ==
E1 activates ubiquitin through a thiol-ester bond between the cysteine found in its active site and ubiquitin's carboxyl-terminal glycine. The now activated ubiquitin is transferred to E2 through transesterification. E3 brings the ubiquitin-charged E2 and relevant substrate to facilitate the formation of an isopeptide linkage between ubiquitin's carboxyl-terminal glycine and the ε-amino group on the substrate or an ubiquitin attached to the protein.

E3s are the ones responsible for substrate specificity, which correlates to the relatively large amount of E3s in respect to E1s and E2s.
==Mechanism==
Ubiquitin attaches to a protein by covalently forming isopeptide bonds, using energy from ATP. Ubiquitin is normally found inactive, but a Ub activating enzyme (E1) links the carboxyl group of Ub to its sulfhydryl group. The enzyme binds an ATP-activated Ub complex where a transfer of the Ub to the a cysteine residue on E1 forms the thioester bond and releases AMP. Ub is then transferred to a Ub-conjugating protein (E2) and finally that protein complex is recognized by a Ub-protein ligase (E3). E3 enzymes recognize N-terminal residues that signal the protein for degradation. The complex then binds the particular protein and the E2-Ub complex, facilitating the transfer of Ub to tag the protein.

A protein marked with a Lys&lt;sup&gt;48&lt;/sup&gt;-linked poly-ubitquitin chain is recognized by the 19S cap of the 26S proteasome and is ultimately degraded. These proteases are composed of a 20S catalytic subunit and a 19S regulatory subunit. The 19S regulatory subunit normally blocks access to the 20S subunit's active site. 19S subunits recognize and bind only ubiquinated molecules, thus moderating the degradation by the 20S catalytic core. Six ATPases are required for the regulatory complex to function: ATP hydrolysis likely causes a conformational change in the 19S subunit which is transferred to the 20S subunit, allowing the active site to become available for substrate binding. 

The 20S subunit is composed of two outer 7 subunit rings (alpha rings), and two inner 7 subunit beta rings. The beta subunits contain N-terminal threonine whose hydroxyl group is activated to attack the carbonyl groups of peptides. Reminiscent of serine proteases, these threonine residues also form acyl-enzymes. The degradation is completed by removal of the Ub molecules by an isopeptidase of the 19S regulatory unit. These ubiquitin molecules are then released to tag more proteins.
== Regulation ==
Post-translational modifications are a method for regulating ubiquitylation. These modification consist of phosphorylation, oxidation, sumoylation, acetylation,and neddylation. Phosphorylation creates binding sites for E3s on substrates, oxidation is associated with ubiquitylation targeting, sumoylation blocks ubiquitylation sites, acetylation competes with ubiquitylation in modification of ubiquitylation sites, and neddylation increases E3 activity by increasing ubiquitin-loaded E2 affinity.

Deubiquitylating enzymes (DUBs) also play a role in ubiquitylation regulation. These enzymes essentially undo the work of the E2s and E3s. Examples of DUBs are ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolases (UCHs) and ubiquitin-specific processing proteases (UBPs). UCHs hydrolyze the carboxyl-terminal ester and amide bonds of ubiquitin. UBPs take apart the polyubiquitin chains.
== Mono and Poly Ubiquitylation ==
'''Mono-ubiquitylation''' is a regulatory modification that is a contributing factor in transcription, histone function, endocytosis, and membrane trafficking. It acts as a signal for endocytosis receptors and for lysosomal targeting. These are all proteasome-independent mechanisms. 
Lys&lt;sup&gt;63&lt;/sup&gt;-linked '''poly-ubiquitylation''' is engaged in signalling DNA repair, the stress response, endocytosis, and signal transduction. Poly-ubiquitin chains with varying linkages signal different effects. 
==Disease==
Because ubiquitin is an enzyme and protein regulatory system, errors in tagging lead to various diseases.
Several neurological diseases such as juvenile and early onset Parkinsons, Huntingtons, and other chronic neurological diseases have been linked to errors or decreased activity of the ubiquitin-protein ligase (E3) and its consequences: inability of the ubiquitin and proteasome duo to remove damaged or malfunctioning proteins leads to aggregation and Lewy bodies - aggregates of protein inside neurons that displace functioning cellular components. 

Viruses and other invasive pathogens may inappropriately activate the ubiquitin system to destroy immune response such as in HPV, leading to the formation of tumors or other diseases.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Cancer''' is a set of diseases in which cells escape from the control mechanisms normally limiting their growth. Cancer cells ignore the normal signals that operate the cell cycle and affect the body by dividing uncontrollably and invading surrounding tissues. The gene regulation systems that go wrong during cancer turn out to be the very same systems that play important roles in embryonic development, the immune response, and many other biological processes.The genes that normally regulate cell growth and division during the cell cycle include genes for growth factors, their receptors, and the intracellular molecules of signaling pathways. mutations that alter any of these genes in somatic cells can lead to cancer. 

Nearly all cancers are caused by abnormalities in the genetic material of the transformed cells. These abnormalities may be due to the effects of carcinogens, such as tobacco smoke, radiation, chemicals, or infectious agents. Other cancer-promoting genetic abnormalities may be randomly acquired through errors in DNA replication, or are inherited, and thus present in all cells from birth. The heritability of cancers is usually affected by complex interactions between carcinogens and the host's genome. New aspects of the genetics of cancer pathogenesis, such as DNA methylation, and microRNAs are increasingly recognized as important.

Cancer is simply the gain of [[#Oncogenes|oncogenes]] and the loss of [[#Tumor Suppressor Genes|tumor suppressor genes]]. Genetic abnormalities found in cancer typically affect two general classes of genes. Cancer-promoting oncogenes are typically activated in cancer cells, giving those cells new properties, such as hyperactive growth and division, protection against programmed cell death, loss of respect for normal tissue boundaries, and the ability to become established in diverse tissue environments. Activated oncogenes result form different types of mutations including point mutations, chromosomal translocations, promoter translocations, and amplifications. Point mutations increase proteins' activity and prevent it from being turned off. Chromosomal translocations encode fusion proteins that are hyperactivated or inappropriately regulated or localized. Promoter translocations drive abnormally high levels of expression. Amplifications increase the copy number and expression of a gene. Tumor suppressor genes (TSG) are then inactivated in cancer cells, resulting in the loss of normal functions in those cells, such as accurate DNA replication, control over the cell cycle, orientation and adhesion within tissues, and interaction with protective cells of the immune system. Tumor suppressor genes can be inactivated by missense mutations that decrease the protein's activity, deletions, frameshifts, and promoter methylation. 

Diagnosis usually requires the histologic examination of a tissue biopsy specimen by a pathologist, although the initial indication of malignancy can be symptoms or radiographic imaging abnormalities. Most cancers can be treated and some cured, depending on the specific type, location, and stage. Once diagnosed, cancer is usually treated with a combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. As research develops, treatments are becoming more specific for different varieties of cancer. There has been significant progress in the development of targeted therapy drugs that act specifically on detectable molecular abnormalities in certain tumors, and which minimize damage to normal cells. The prognosis of cancer patients is most influenced by the type of cancer, as well as the stage, or extent of the disease. In addition, histologic grading and the presence of specific molecular markers can also be useful in establishing prognosis, as well as in determining individual treatments.


==History of Cancer==

The word cancer comes from the Greek physician Hippocrates. He used the Greek words &quot;carcinos&quot; and &quot;carcinoma&quot;, meaning crab in Greek, to describe cancer because he believed that tumors resembled crabs. The two words were combined into one: &quot;karkinos&quot;.

The oldest record of cancer is from the Egyptians around 1500 B.C. The Edwin Smith Papyrus documents 8 cases of breast tumors treated with cauterization, a method of destroying tissue with a hot instrument called a &quot;fire drill&quot;. Records indicate that there were no treatments for the disease. In addition, archaeological finding has discovered mummies with fossilized bone tumors suggestive of bone cancer. Also in the Papyrus, it is suggested that Egyptian physicians could differentiate malignant tumors from benign tumors. 

Later, the city of Constantinople became the Medical Center of the World. During this time period, the cause of cancer was attributed to an excess of black bile. This was based on Hippocrates's idea that the human body was composed of four different types of bodily fluids: blood, phlegm, yellow bile and black bile. Any excess or deficiencies in either fluid would cause disease, and in this case, excess of black bile was believed to cause cancer. This was the knowledge for the next 1400 years, through the Middle Ages, and went unchallenged since religious superstition at the time prohibited doctors from performing autopsies.

In the 15th Century Renaissance, physicians began to acquire more knowledge on human physiology. Giovanni Morgangni, in the 16th century, began to do autopsies on the bodies of the deceased in order to discover a pathological relationship between disease and death. Also, during this time, a Scottish physician named John Hunter suggested that cancerous tumors may be removed by surgical means. In the 17th Century, the Black Bile theory was replaced with another theory called the Lymph theory. The idea was that cancer was caused by degenerating and fermating lymph.

In the 19th Century, Rudolf Virchow, who is considered the father of cellular pathology, linked the clinical course of illnesses with pathological findings. This discovery allowed physicians to not only assess the damage of a particular cancer on the body, but also laid the foundations of cancer surgery. Tissues removed from the infected area could rapidly and quickly assessed to determine the type of cancer and also to elucidate whether or not the tumor was completed excised. 

The 20th Century saw a rise in cancer knowledge. Research on carcinogens, radiation therapy, and better means of identification were discovered. There was tremendous scientific improvement on the understanding of cell growth and division mechanisms.

==Types of Cancer==

There are many different kind of cancer diverse by the type of cell that made up the tumor and therefore the tumor is known as the origin of cancer. A '''benign tumor''' is a lump of abnormal cells that do not spread to other cells or other parts of the body, but rather remains at the original location that it was formed. However, a '''malignant tumor''' is a more dangerous form because it is able to invade and damage the functions of other cells and organs.
# When cancers are derived from the epithelial cells whose genome has altered or damaged, we called it '''Carcinoma'''. It is the most common type of cancer occurring in humans and it begins in a tissue that lines the inner or outer surfaces of the body. The cells will begin to exhibit abnormal malignant properties. The most common example is the breast, lung, prostate cancers. 
# The second type is called '''Sarcoma''' which the cancers are arising from the connective tissue. It develops develop from cells originating in mesenchymal cells outside the bone marrow. Therefore Sarcoma includes tumors of bone (osteosacrcoma), fat (liposacrcoma), muscle (leiomyosarcoma) and vascular. There are two classes of cancer arise from the blood forming cells. 
# '''Leukemia''' is a type of cancer of the blood or bone marrow characterized by an abnormal increase of white blood cell. The cause of such cancer is also by mutation in the DNA that can trigger leukemia by activating oncogenes or deactivating tumor suppressor genes. 
# '''Lymphoma''' is a cancer that develops in the immune system. It usually presents to be a solid tumor in the lymphoid cells. The malignant cells often originate in the lymph node and presents as an enlargement of a tumor. It will also affect other organs such as skin, brain, bowels and bone. 
# Cancer also appears in the pluripotent cell in the testicle or the ovary. This is called the '''germ cell tumor'''. There are two types of germ cell tumor either cancerous or non-cancerous. It may cause by error in development of the embryo. 
# The last type is the '''Blastoma''' which is developed from immature embryonic tissue. This is most common in children.

==Hallmarks of Cancer==

*'''Uncontrolled Cell Division''' Cancer cells ignore signals that would regulate cell growth and division in the body. Since the cells grow and divide uncontrollably, it leads to the production of more and more cancer cells within the body.

*'''Evading Apoptosis''' Cancer cells are able to avoid the process of apoptosis for normal cells. Apoptosis is the process of programmed death carried out in normal cells, but cancer cells are able to evade the process and can therefore continue to progress.

*'''Independent from Growth Regulation''' Cancer cells are self-sufficient and do not require external signals to regulate its growth and division. Cancer cells are also capable of ignoring negative signals from its neighbors and can therefore continue to grow and divide on its own.

*'''Angiogenic''' The cancer cells that make up the tumor need a system to provide nutrients and dispose of waste. Therefore cancer cells have learned to become angiogenic, in which the tumor attracts blood vessels to grow into the tumor mass and nourish the cancer cells.

*'''Immortality''' Cancer cells have developed the ability to proliferate indefinitely. By doing so, cancer cells have become immortalized and are capable of indefinite growth and cell division.

*'''Invasion and Metastasis''' Cancer cells are capable of entering the stage of metastasis and invade surrounding cells and tissues. By learning how to invade and metastasize, cancer cells are able to spread and establish the disease in other areas of the body and not just the original location.

==Causes==

===Viruses===
In 1910, an American researcher, Peyton Rous, discovered that the ''Rous sarcoma'' virus (Rous virus)could cause cancer and he studied how this cancer could spread in chickens. He performed three experiment to test how this cancer spread.
# He took out cancerous cells from one chicken and injected into a healthy chicken. He observed that the healthy chicken became afflicted with cancer. 
# He purified the cell to create cell-free extracts. He then injected the extract into a healthy chicken. Again, the chicken contracted cancer. 
# He used a special filter, that had holes too small for viruses to pass through, to filter the cells. He inject this extract into healthy chickens and discovered that they did not contract cancer, and remained healthy. 
From his experiments, he concluded that viruses can cause cancer. 
Later, scientists discovered that the ''Rous virus'' is a retro-virus. A retro-virus can insert its gene into a host DNA and uses host protein mechanisms to reproduce. The viral DNA inside of the host cell causes uncontrollable cell division, cell growth, etc.

===Oncogenes===
[[Structural Biochemistry/Proto-oncogene|Oncogenes]] are genes that have the potential to cause tumors. &lt;ref name=&quot;Wilbur&quot;&gt;Wilbur, Beth, editor. The World of the Cell, Becker, W.M., et al., 7th ed. San Francisco, CA; 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Classification'''

Although there are several different systems for classifying the oncogenes, these classifications are yet to be accepted standard.  Some are grouped spatially or chronologically. The first category, growth factors (mitogen), include cancer genes such as fibrosarcomas, osteosarcomas, breast carcinomas, and melanomas. These genes induce cell proliferation. The growth factors from specific cells trigger cell proliferation not only in themselves but also nearby and distant cells.  The Receptor tyrosine kinases cause breast cancer, non-small-cell lung cancer and pancreatic cancer.  These receptor tyrosine kinases genes transduce signals for cell growth. The receptor tyrosine kinases add phosphate groups to other proteins.  This can either turn the proteins permanently on or off. The cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases category include breast cancers, melanomas, ovarian cancers, head and neck cancers, blood cancers and brain cancers.  These genes are in charge of the responses back and forth from active receptors of the cells that mediate proliferation, migration, differentiation and survival. The cytoplasmic serine/threonine kinases are responsible for malignant melanoma, colorectal cancer, and ovarian cancer. These genes are involves in cell cycle regulation, cell proliferation, cell survival, and apoptosis.  More than 125 of the human protein kinases are serine/threonine kinases. The regulatory GTPases genes are involved in leading pathways to cell proliferation.  An example of the regulatory GTPases include the Ras protein.  The Ras hydrolyses GTP into GDP and phosphate and is responsible for adenocarcinomas of the pancreas and colon, thyroid tumors, and myeloid leukemia. Lastly, the transcription factors regulate the transcription of genes that trigger cell proliferation.  For example, the myc gene can cause cancers such as small cell lung cancer, breast cancer, acute myeloid leukemia and malignant T-cell lymphomas.

==Cancer Diagnosis==
Cancer cannot be diagnosed accurately by one single test. A complete and thorough history and physical examination along with several diagnostic tests must be performed in order to evaluate whether the patient has cancer or other conditions are being misinterpreted as symptoms of cancer.

An effective procedure of testing can be used to confirm or exclude the presence of cancer, determine the disease process and preliminary plan for treatments. Tests needed to be repeated if the patient’s symptoms have changed or the testing sample is not qualified or the test results show abnormality. 

Diagnostic procedures for cancer may include imaging, laboratory tests, tumor biopsy, and endoscopic examination.

===Diagnostic imaging===
Diagnostic imaging is the process of obtaining pictures of body structures and organs. It is used to detect tumors and other abnormalities and their extent. It is also the most applicable way to determine the effectiveness of the treatments. 
*'''Transmission imaging''' In transmission imaging, a beam of photons with high energy is generated and allowed to pass through the body structure being examined. 
*'''X-ray''' X-rays use electromagnetic energy beams to produce images of internal tissues, bones, and organs on film. Based on the images, tumor or cancer cells can be located.
*'''Computed Tomography scan (CT scan or CAT scan)''' A CT scan is more detailed than general X-ray scan. By combining x-rays and computer technology, images of bones, muscles, fat, and organs in the body are showed with more details.
*'''Bone scan''' Bone scans are pictures of X-ray or CT scan taken of the bone after a dye has been injected to bone tissue. These scans are used to detect tumors and abnormalities in the bone structure.
*'''Lymphangiogram(LAG)''' Lymphangiogram is an image that can detect cancer cells or abnormalities in the lymphatic system and structures after a dye is injected into the lymph system.
*'''Mammogram''' A mammogram is an x-ray image of the breast. It is used to detect and diagnose breast disease in women by locating abnormal area. A biopsy is required for further diagnosis.
*'''Reflection Imaging''' In Reflection Imaging, images are produced by high-frequency sounds bouncing off of the surface of body tissues and structures at varying speeds, depending on the density of the tissues present. The bounced sound waves are then analyzed by a computer and a visual image is produced. 
*'''Emission Imaging''' MRI combine a large magnet and a computer to produce detailed images of the heart, brain, liver, pancreas, male and female reproductive organs, and other soft tissues.

===Laboratory tests===
*'''Blood Tests''' Blood tests are used to check the levels of substances that are indicative of how healthy the body is and whether infection is present. Other tests check for the presence of electrolytes such as sodium and potassium that are critical to the body's healthy functioning. 
*'''Urinalysis''' Urinalysis breaks down the components of urine to check for the presence of drugs, blood, protein, and other substances. 
*'''Tumor markers''' Tumor markers are substances released by cancer cells or substances created by the body in response to cancer cells.
'''Prostate-specific Antigen (PSA)''' An elevated PSA level in the blood may indicate prostate cancer, but other conditions such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostatitis can also raise PSA levels.

'''CA 125''' Ovarian cancer is the most common cause of elevated CA 125, but cancers of the uterus, cervix, pancreas, liver, colon, breast, lung, and digestive tract can also raise CA 125 levels. 

'''Prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP)''' In addition to prostate cancer, elevated levels of PAP may indicate testicular cancer, leukemia, and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, as well as some noncancerous conditions.

'''Human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG)''' If pregnancy is ruled out, HCG may indicate cancer in the testis, ovary, liver, stomach, pancreas, and lung. 

'''Carcinoembryonic Antigen (CEA)''' Colorectal cancer is the most common cancer that raises this tumor marker. Several other cancers can also raise levels of carcinoembryonic antigen.

'''Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)''' In men, and in women who are not pregnant, an elevated level of AFP may indicate liver cancer or cancer of the ovary or testicle. Noncancerous conditions may also cause elevated AFP levels.

'''CA 19-9''' Elevated levels of CA 19-9 may indicate advanced cancer in the pancreas, but it is also associated with noncancerous conditions, including gallstones, pancreatitis, cirrhosis of the liver.

'''CA 27-29''' Cancers of the colon, stomach, kidney, lung, ovary, pancreas, uterus, and liver may also raise CA 27-29 levels. Noncancerous conditions associated with this substance are first trimester pregnancy, endometriosis, ovarian cysts, benign breast disease, kidney disease, and liver disease.

'''CA 15-3''' Elevated levels of CA 15-3 are also associated with cancers of the ovary, lung, and prostate, as well as noncancerous conditions such as benign breast or ovarian disease, endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, and hepatitis. Pregnancy and lactation also can raise CA 15-3 levels.

'''Neuron-specific enolase (NSE)''' NSE is associated with several cancers, but it is used most often to monitor treatment in patients with neuroblastoma or small cell lung cancer.

===Tumor Biopsy===
A '''biopsy''' is the removal of tissues or cells from the patient’s body for examination under a microscope. Biopsies are usually performed to determine whether a tumor is cancerous or just an infection or inflammation.

*'''Endoscopic biopsy''' This type of biopsy is performed through a fiberoptic endoscope (a long, thin tube that has a close-focusing telescope at the end for closeup observation) through a natural body orifice or a small incision. The endoscope is used to view the organ in question for abnormal or suspicious areas, in order to obtain a small amount of tissue for study.

*'''Bone marrow biopsy''' This type of biopsy is performed either from the sternum or the iliac crest hipbone. A needle is inserted into the marrow, and cells are taken for study.

*'''Excisional biopsy''' This type of biopsy is often used when a wider or deeper portion of the skin is needed. Using a scalpel, a full thickness of skin is removed for further examination. 

*'''Fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy''' This type of biopsy involves using a thin needle to remove very small pieces from a tumor. FNA is not used for diagnosis of a suspicious mole, but may be used to biopsy large lymph nodes near a melanoma to see if the melanoma has metastasized (spread). 

*'''Punch biopsy''' Punch biopsies involve taking a deeper sample of skin with a biopsy instrument that removes a short cylinder of tissue. 

*'''Skin biopsy''' Skin biopsies involve removing a sample of skin for examination under the microscope to determine if melanoma is present.

===Endoscopic Examinations===
An '''endoscope''' is a small, flexible tube with a light and a lens on the end used to look into the esophagus, stomach, duodenum, colon, or rectum. It can also be used to take tissue from the body for testing or to take color photographs of the inside of the body.
*'''Colonoscopy'''
Colonscopy involves inserting a colonoscope, which is a long, flexible, lighted tube, in through the rectum up into the colon. It allows the physician to view the entire length of the large intestine, and can often help identify abnormal growths as well as inflamed tissue, ulcers, and bleeding. The physician can also remove tissue for further examination.

*'''Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)'''
ERCP is a procedure that allows the physician to diagnose and treat problems in the liver, gallbladder, bile ducts, and pancreas. The procedure combines x-ray and the use of an endoscope. The scope is inserted through the patient's mouth and throat, then through the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum.  

*'''Esophagogastroduodenoscopy (EGD)'''
An EGD is a procedure that allows the physician to examine the inside of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. An endoscope is guided into the mouth and throat, then into the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. The endoscope allows the physician to view the inside of this area of the body, as well as to insert instruments through a scope for the removal of a sample of tissue for biopsy.

*'''Sigmoidoscopy'''
A sigmoidoscopy is a diagnostic procedure that allows the physician to examine the inside of a portion of the large intestine, and is helpful in identifying the causes of diarrhea, abdominal pain, constipation, abnormal growths, and bleeding. A short, flexible, lighted tube, called a sigmoidoscope, is inserted into the intestine through the rectum. The scope blows air into the intestine to inflate it to have a better view of the inside.

*'''Cystoscopy'''
An examination in which a scope is inserted through the urethra to examine the bladder and urinary tract for structural abnormalities or obstructions, such as tumors or stones.

==Treatment==
===Surgery===
Surgery is one of the initial treatments used to operate on cancer cells. Cancer surgery attempts to prevent the spread of cancer cells by locating the tumor and removing it along with any possible lymph nodes that are near the source location. This method is commonly used for cases with benign tumors because the mass of cancer cells are typically located in one area. Surgery may be the only treatment needed for some cancer cases, but if a few cancer cells have broken off or get left behind, then it would only be a matter of time before the disease returns and more treatments are needed.

===Chemotherapy===
Chemotherapy is another treatment used in addition to surgery if cancer cells still remain in the body. Chemotherapy is used to treat cancer cells that have entered the stage of metastasis, in which the cells have spread from their original location. The treatment utilizes drugs that are toxic to interfere and kill cells that divide. The goal is to kill the cancer cells faster than the normal dividing cells in the body because cancer cells divide more rapidly. Even though chemotherapy has been proven to be effective, the side effects include hair loss and nausea because the treatment is blasting every cell being divided including the normal cells.

===Radiation===
Radiation therapy for cancer utilizes a beam of high-energy particles to kill off the cancer cells located in the body. This treatment targets the cancer areas by marking the skin, thus enabling the beam of high-energy particles to directly hit and destroy the cancer cells. The radiation from this therapy can shrink the tumors and also relieve the symptoms caused by the cancer. Although this therapy benefits cancer patients, it still has side effects and risks of causing new problems for these patients. The side effects caused by the radiation depends on the area of the body that undergoes the therapy; and this area is also the main location of the side effects.The radiation focuses on the tumor, but since the ray of high-energy particles targets the skin as well, a common side effect caused from radiation therapy is that the skin that was marked turns red and gradually may look more dark or tan over the years. The skin may also dry and flake, like a burn to the skin, during the period of recovery after the radiation therapy.

===Monoclonal Antibodies===
Monoclonal antibodies serve as a method in cancer therapy to enforce the immune system and aid in diagnosis. Monoclonal antibodies are created by injecting human cancer cells into mice so that they are able to produce antibodies against the foreign antigens invading their immune system. From there, the murine cells producing the antibodies are then removed and combined with laboratory-grown cells. This combination creates hybrid cells called hybridomas, which in turn is capable of producing large quantities of these pure antibodies so that the human body is able to process and use these antibodies to fight off the cancer cells.

===Tumor Suppressor Genes===
[[Structural Biochemistry/Tumor suppressor genes|Tumor suppressor proteins]] protect cells from being cancerous.

===Using Minicells to Treat Tumors===

[[File:Cytokinesis.png|thumb|In a prokaryote that divides by the use of a Z-Ring, such as E. coli, the Z-Ring would form at the interface between the two dividing daughter cells. The dotted lines above would be the site of the Z-Ring in E. coli.]]

'''What are Minicells'''

Minicells are small non-chromosomal &quot;cells&quot; that result from abnormalities during cell division in prokaryotes. They do not contain any of the original DNA present in its larger sister, but may contain proteins and copies of transformed plasmids that were present in the are in the original cell when the minicell formed. First discovered over 70 years ago, minicells are becoming of interest to researchers in their potential as anti-tumor agents&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;. In order to understand how minicells form, it is important to understand how most prokaryotes mediate cell division. During the cytokinesis stage of cell division, a framework of proteins form at the site of division. The main protein involved in this process, FtsZ, forms what is called a Z-Ring around the septum of division. FtsZ is &quot;tethered&quot; to the membrane by a series of other proteins involved in the process of cytokinesis. The Z-Ring usually aligns itself at the middle of the enlarged cell as a systems of proteins inhibit the formation of the Z-Ring at the poles of the cell. Abnormalities in this regulatory system for cytokinesis results in the formation of the Z-Ring near the poles of the cell. This results in two dimorphic daughter cells: one larger with all of the bacterial DNA, and another smaller one with no chromosomal DNA. It is important to note that not all prokaryotes divide in cytokinesis by the use of a Z-Ring, and the mechanism by which they divide is still unknown. Minicells can form under certain growth conditions or from mutations. E. coli is usually used to make minicells.

'''Using Minicells to Treat Tumors'''

Brahmbhatt et al. reported that minicells can be used in treating drug resistant tumors by using siRNA and cytotoxic drugs&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, what follows is a summary of their findings. The goal of the research was to demonstrate that minicells could be targeted to tumor cells, and release cytotoxic drug and siRNA specific to drug resistant genes. It is known the RNA interference caould be a powerful tool in fighting cancer, however there is a need to find an efficient method to transfer siRNA or microRNA to cancerous cell in vivo without them being degraded or causing adverse effects. It was observed that minicells had the ability to uptake cytotoxic drugs and siRNA. The minicells could also contain plasmids encoding siRNA by harvesting them from bacteria (E. coli) transformed with that specific plasmid. Minicells have the ability to uptake siRNA and to contain it for long periods of time. Specific antibodies (BsAB) could also be incorporated into the minicell to help target tumor cells. They had showed previously that minicells could bind to the tumor cells via specific antibodies, and initiate endocytosis via receptors on the cell surface. Once inside the cell, the drug contained in the minicells could be released. The same idea was again applied to siRNA with the ability to interfere with drug resistance genes in the tumor cells. The minicells would contain siRNA, or siRNA encoding plasmids, and would use the same antibody to bind to the receptors of tumor cells. It was shown that in vitro, the siRNA delivery via minicells could diminish drug resistance in cells containing a drug resistance gene. [[File:Mechanism of RNA interference.jpg|thumb|siRNA is capable of inhibiting the expression of a certain gene by splicing the transcribed mRNA that originates from that gene. The siRNA discussed here interferes with the mRNA of MDR1 (multi drug resistance gene.)]]

This was done by delivering the minicells full of siRNA to a type of colon cancer cell overexpressing MDR1 (multi drug resistance gene), and then treating the cells with drugs in order to measure toxicity of the drug to the cell. This resulted in a highly significant increase of toxicity. In vivo experiments were done on human cancer xenografts in mice and showed that the tumor cells treated with a wave of siRNA containing minicells, experienced a knockdown of the drug resistance gene which was targeted. The results were confirmed by performing a Western Blot on protein in the cells. 

The next step was to show the efficacy of first treating mice with a wave of siRNA and the cytotoxic drug using minicells. Mice with the Caco-2/MDR1 (colon cncer cells with multi drug resistance gene) were treated siRNA containing mincells to reverse drug resistance by knocking out the MDR1 and thereafter treatment with drug containing minicells. Their analysis showed that all the mice which had under gone this dual treatment exhibited a significant inhibition of cancerous growth and complete survival. This result also showed that after the initial minicell treatment with siRNA, the tumor cells were still able to process the next wave of minicells (no adverse effects on the cellular machinery). However, the mechanism by which siRNA is loaded with minicells or possible effects on the immune system are not yet known, especially since they originated from bacteria. No adverse effects were reported in the in vivo studies, however. It was also concluded that overall, using this sequential method of treating the tumors with minicells, a smaller amount of drug is needed than for the case in which the drug is administered without the siRNA containing minicells.

===PKM2 Regulator in cancer===
	PKM2 is an enigmatic enzyme that catalyzes the last step of glycolysis, converting phosphoenolpyruvate to pyruvate and phosphorylating ADP to Atp. There are four types of PK in mammals, all encoded by these two genes: PKLR and PKM2.
	PK has not much evolved during evolution, as the four isoforms in mammals are very similar in sequence. In cancer cells, PKM2 takesover the PK isoform until it becomes the main isoform, which supports the idea of tumorigenesis. A study was then in which PKM2 was replaced with PKM1, and tumor growth was delayed, supporting the hypothesis. However, tumor cells can also switch the expression of PKL/R to PKM isoforms, but this hypothesis has not been scientifically validated. So the specific PKM isoform in primary tumors still need to be identified. PKM2 can jump between two states: a tetrameric form and a dimer. The dimer is present in cancer cells. The tetramer may in fact be a dimer of the dimer. Though PKM2 is highly present in cancer cells, it may not be the only PK isoform in cancer, and it may not be cancer specific. 
	Other isoforms are allosterically regulated. In PKM2, it is the main PK isoform, and the ratio between the active and inactive forms mold the usage of glucose for energy production or anabolic precursors. PKM2 is complex regulator. It has been shown to also be phosphorylated on tyrosine residues in the low activity state. In the high activity state, PKM2 also forms complexes with other glycolytic enzymes such as GADPDH, PGAM, and LDH. It can also control pyruvate and induce lactate production. Tyrosine phophorylated polypeptides can also inhibit PKM2 binding, releasing activator FBP. These events are seen often in cancer and can control glucose metabolism. There are many mechanisms to inhibit PKM2, which is useful for survival under cell stress and can explain why PKM2 is the main enzyme in cancer cells. PKM2 also is regulated by nutrients and other growth factors, which allows it to meet the demands metabolcity of cancer cells. 
	PKM2 is also present in the nucleus, due to a nuclear localization signal in the C0terminal domain. The functions of nuclear PKM2 are not clear. It is required for cell survival after interleukin stimulation, but is also necessary for agoptosis. Nuclear PKM2 also can interact with transcription factors and epidermal growth factors. PKM2 binds to phophorylated beta catenin and promotes transcription in the nucleus. It is activated by HIF-1. However, in cancer cells, a regulatory feedback mechanism seems to occur where instead, PKM2 activates HIF-1 instead, leading to activation of genes for glucose transporters and glycolytic enzymes.  
	In cancer treatment, PKM2 is a target, so an understanding of its regulation can improve pharmaceutical drugs aimed to counteract or mimic its effects. PKM2 is highly expressed in cancer cells, but many post-translational modifications also suggest that inhibiting PKM2 may promote cell proliferation. Therefore, both PKM2 inhibiting and activating drugs have been synthesized to target tumor cells. A study suggested that replacing PKM2 isoform with PKM1 may also result in a significant reduction of cancerous cell growth, but no evidence of PKM2 activators providing a efficient treatment have yet been performed. Thus, many challenges remain in this field of research today.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Adenylation, also known as adenylylation or AMPylation, is the process of attaching an AMP molecule to a protein side chain by covalent bonding. It has two main functions: 1) to regulate enzyme activity via post-translational modication and 2) to produce unstable intermediates of a protein, peptide or amino acids to allow reactions that are not thermodynamically favored to occur.

==Adenylation Applications==
Adenyaltions has a particular application when it involves the adenylation of RNA. There is a known procedure that allows for RNA 5' adenylation using T4 DNA ligases. Basically this is an approach to adenylate RNA so that it becomes a 5',5'-adenyl pyrophosphoryl cap structure. This new adenylated RNA structure is desirable in the sense that it can investigate certain natural biochemical pathways that require such intermediates. The 5' adenylated RNA is also useful for a certain amount of in vitro selection procedures to identify nucleic acid enzymes that specificially use the 5' adenlyated RNA as a reactive RNA substrate. This is particularly favorable given that the adenylated RNA is considered a transition state molecule which has evolved to become the most favorable of states when it comes to enzyme substrate complexes. in other words, the adenylation of the 5' RNA allows for a better enzyme substrate complex due to its nature of being a transitional state substrate for biochemical pathways that wish to be observed. In addition to being a RNA substrate for selective catalysis reactions, there are also applications to RNA '5 capping and 5' labeling. It was shown in the &quot;Efficient RNA5' adenylation by T4 DNa ligase to facilitate practical applications&quot; paper that the protein enzyme T4 RNA ligase was used along with some DNA oligonucleotides to create a net transfer of the AMP group onto a monophosphorolyated terminus of the desired RNA substrate.

==Formation of Unstable Intermediates==

[[File:Adenylylation.png|Proteins can be modified by adenylylation to create unstable intermediates, which in turn allows thermodynamically unfavorable reactions to take place.|thumb]]

Carboxyl groups of small molecules or amino acids may be adenylated to form unstable intermediates as shown in the diagram to the left. 

For many decades, the example of glutamine synthetase has been used to explain the principles of adenylation, but recent discoveries in adenylation of Rho and Rab GTPases have shown potential in revealing the other aspects of adenylation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Methylation is a regulatory process that can prevent certain processes such as degradation or catalysis from occurring. In the restriction-modification system of bacteria, the bacterial DNA is methylated at adenine bases by methylase, thereby preventing the DNA from being degraded by restriction endonucleases. These restriction enzymes have active sites that recognize the specific amino acid-based conformations in DNA. The enzymes can bind and cleave the phosphodiester bonds of the backbone at recognized (cognate) DNA. Methylated groups lose one hydrogen bond linkage with the enzyme and thus decrease the binding energy, resulting in a lower enzyme affinity and no cleavage.

Methylation also occurs in amino acid synthesis and in gene expression. In the latter, cytosine is methylated at C5. This 5-methylcytosine interferes with the proteins that bind to start transcription. In amino acid synthesis, methylases and other methyl group carriers attach methyl groups.

==DNA Methylation Overview==
Eukaryotic cellular DNA is usually stored in the nucleus, is wrapped around by a chromatin, which is a histone octamer. The chromatin is a crucial part in genetic modification in cells with the help of enzymes in order to make suitable changes to the cell, DNA, RNA, and proteins, such as the modification of transcription, or even the complete inactivation of a gene. One of these chromatin histone mechanism modifications can be a direct change on the mechanism of DNA methylation, an epigenetic mechanism. Proper DNA methylation is extremely important in functional cellular health, as no methylation (or even too much (hypermethylation) or insufficient methylation) could lead to serious diseases such as the creation of carcinogenic cancer cells.

==DNA Methyltransferase==

[[Image:PDB 1nw8 EBI.jpg|thumb|left||200px|alt=DNA Methyltransferase|Ribbon representation of a DNA Methyltransferase]]
Enzymes that add methyl groups to DNA are called '''DNA methyltransferases'''.  The mechanisms of DNA methyltransferases vary for each organism, but the enzyme generally binds unspecifically before traveling along the DNA strand to find the specific sequence to be methylated.  As stated above, methylation of DNA is carried out so that the cell can differentiate between foreign and infectious DNA, and for gene expression purposes.  But methylation of the wrong sequence may lead to chromosomal problems, including unfavorable interactions with Histone proteins that are essential for chromosomes to fold properly.  Hence these enzymes are highly specific.  DNA methyltransferases are present in most organisms including mammals.

Methyltransferases attach methyl groups to specific sequence in conjunction with endonucleases that must scan for DNA sequences that are intended for cutting. Methyltransferases belong in several different types that have different functions.  Although their domain sites may have structural differences, DNMT3 which is similar to DNMT1 contains a regulatory region attached to a catalytic domain. Among types, there are also subcategories that can mediate methylation-independent gene repression. Others may be used for genomic imprinting. Some enzymes may methylate strictly RNA and not DNA. DNMT1 identifies methylate groups and perform nucleophilic attacks among marked nucleotides.

==The Role of Methylation in Gene Expression==
Meythlation is extremely important when it comes to gene expression. not all genes are active at all times which is why DNA methylation is one of the several mechanics that allow cells to control gene expression. Although there ar emanby ways that a gene can be expressed in particularly eukaryotes, the methylation of DNA is a common epigenetic signaling tool that can allow cells to lock genes in the off position. Key experiments were needed in order to provide the early clues for what the role of methylation had on gene expression. One such experiment was conducted by McGhee and Ginder in 1979 where they compared the methylation status of beta-globin loci in cells that did and that did not express the gene. By utilizing restriction enzymes that distinguished between methylated and unmethylatd DNA, the two scientists were capable of dictating that the beta globin locus gene was not being expressed in the cells that were unmethylated. In addition to this experiment, more supporting evidence suggested the same conclusion. The same mechanism was performed on 5-azacytidine, a chemical analog of the nucleoside cytidine, in mouse cells. Similiar observations were found with this experiment in the sense that the cytosine residues that were not methylated on the nucleoside prevented the gene to be expressed. 

DNA methylation is the addition of a methyl group to the 5th carbon in cytosines in DNA into a covalent bond. This mechanism is catalyzed by DNMTs (DNA methyltransferases) by utilizing the CpG dinucleotide sequence. CpGs that aren’t methylated usually contain ahigher GC base concentration and are clustered together, forming CpG islands, which are usually found at the starting sites for transcription and promoter binding. DNA methylation at CGI promoters have been known to cause gene expression silencing, such as the silencing of mechanisms such as X-chromosomes and genomic imprinting. DNA methylation can silence DNA through various mechanisms, such as utilizing 5meC to inhibit transcription factor binding or usting Methyl Binding Domain Proteins (MDB) to repress the DNA using repressive chromatin-modifying complexes.
Overall, DNA methylation is responsible for important cellular functions involving the genetic sequence of eukaryotes, such as genetic modification and even silencing.


==How and Where are Genes Methylated==
Now that it is understood that DNa methylation is key for gene expression, the questions comes about where exactly must methylation occur on the gene to induce expression. Today researchers know that DNA methylation occurs primarily at the cytosine bases of eukaryotic DNA, which are converted to 5-methycytosine by DNA methyltransferase (DNMT) enzymes. These altered cytosine residues are normally adjacent to guanine nucleotides (due to base pair mechanics) which essentially results in two methylated cytosine residues that sit diagonally from each on opposing DNA strands. 

The roles and targets of DNA methylation varies among the kingdoms of organisms. For examples, among Animalia, mammals tend to have distributed CpG methylation patterns as mentioned above, however in invertebrate animals, a mosiac pattern of methylation is found where regions of heavily methylated DNA are interspersed with nonmethylated regions. In other words, no distinc pattern is seen in this kingdom of species. It should also be noted that surprisingly the kingdom plantae are organisms that are found to have the highest amount of methylation, up to 50% of cystosine residues undergoing methylation. 

==DNA methylation and Disease==
When one considers the magnitude of importance DNA methylation has upon gene expression, one must also ask of the consequences of errors found in methylation and what can arise from such error. Errors in methylation give rise to a number of devastating consequences, including various disease associated with tumor suppressor genes. It has been found that tumor suppressor genes are often turned off in cancer cells due to hypermethylation of cytosine residues. hypermethylation is also found at other very critical gene expressions such as in the cell cycle regulatory genes, the tumor cell invasion genes, DNA repair genes and other genes that involve the propogation of metastasis. In addition, the genomes of cancel cells have also shown a decrease in methylation, or hypomethylation, compared to normal healthy cells (with the exception of hypermethylation found on the for mentioned genes). The combination of hypomethylation and hypermythelation describes the potent nature of a cancer cell. 

==Gene-Body DNA Methylation==
DNA methylation in active genes can be analyzed with the use of bisulfites to sequence the DNA and methyls attached to the DNA. With bisulfite sequencing, it was discovered that CpG methylation occurred in active genes and much downstream the sites of transcription (as long as the methylation didn’t silence the gene). These discoveries showed that DNA methylation can occur and various promoters (like human X chromosomes, which has many transcribable regions). Due to the fact that bisulfite sequencing is unbiased, it also showed methylated as well as non-methylated CpG sites, showing that; with MeDIP-Seq and MRE-Seq, non-methylated CpG is prevalent at most promoters.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== MAMMOTH Introduction ==

MAMMOTH stands for '''MA'''tching '''M'''olecular '''M'''odels '''O'''btained from '''TH'''eory. This program was originally developed for comparing models produced from structure prediction since it is tolerant of large unalignable regions. However, it has proven to work well with experimental models, especially when looking for remote homology. Benchmarks on targets of blind structure prediction and automated GO annotation have shown it to tightly rank correlated with human curated annotation. A largely complete database of MAMMOTH based structure annotation for the predicted structures of unknown proteins covering 150 genomes facilitates genomic scale normalization.

== MAMMOTH Method ==

MAMMOTH based structure alignment methods decompose the protein structure into short peptides (heptapeptides for example) which are compared with the same length peptides of another protein. Similarity scores between the two polypeptides is then calculated using a unit-vector RMS (URMS) method. These cores are stored in a similarity matrix, and with a hybrid (local-global) dynamic programming, the optimal residue alignment is calculated. Protein similarity scores calculated with MAMMOTH are derived from the likelihood of obtaining a given structural alignment by chance.

== MAMMOTH-mult ==

MAMMOTH-mult is an extension of the MAMMOTH algorithm used to align related families of protein structures. This algorithm is very quick and produces consistent high quality structural alignments. Multiple structural alignments calculated with MAMMOTH-mult produce structurally implied sequence alignments that can be further used for multiple-template homology modeling, HMM-based (Hidden Markov model) protein structure prediction, and profile-type PSI-BLAST searches.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== RAPIDO ==

RAPIDO stands for '''R'''apid '''A'''lignment of '''P'''roteins in terms of '''DO'''mains. RAPIDO is a web sever for 3D alignment of crystal structures of different protein molecules in the presence of conformational changes. Similar to CE's first step, RAPIDO identifies fragments that are structurally similar in two different proteins using an approach that uses difference distance matrices. The MFPs (Matching Fragments Pairs) are represented as nodes in a graph which are chained together to form an alignment by means of an algorithm for identification of the longest path on a DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph). The last step of refinement is performed to improve quality of the performed alignment. After aligning the two structures, the server applies a genetic algorithm for identification of conformationally invariant regions. These regions correspond to groups of atoms with constant inter atomic distances (within a defined tolerance). By doing this, RAPIDO takes into account variation in the reliability of atomic coordinates by employing weighting-functions based on the refined B-values. The regions that are identified as conformationally invariant by RAPIDO represent reliable sets of atoms for the superposition of the two structures that can be used for detailed analysis of changes in the conformation. RAPIDO can identify structurally equivalent regions even when these consist of fragments that are distant in terms of sequence and separated by other movable domains.

      <text xml:space="preserve">ADP-ribosylation is a posttranslational modification of [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|proteins]] that involves the addition of one or more ADP and ribose moieties. 

These reactions are involved in cell signaling and the control of many cell processes, including DNA repair and apoptosis.

==ADP-Ribosylation Enzymes==
This protein posttranslational modification is produced by ADP-ribosyltransferase enzymes, which transfer the ADP-ribose group from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD+) onto acceptors such as arginine, glutamic acid or aspartic acid residues in their substrate protein. In humans, one type of ADP-ribosyltransferases are the NAD: arginine ADP-ribosyltransferases, which modify amino acid residues in proteins such as histones by adding a single ADP-ribose group. 

These reactions are reversible; for example, when arginine is modified, the ADP-ribosylarginine produced can be removed by ADP-ribosylarginine hydrolases.

As well as the transfer of single ADP-ribose moieties, multiple groups can also be transferred to proteins to form long branched chains, in a reaction called poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation. This protein modification is carried out by the poly ADP-ribose polymerases (PARPs), which are found in most eukaryotes, but not prokaryotes or yeast. The poly(ADP-ribose) structure is involved in the regulation of several cellular events and is most important in the cell nucleus, in processes such as DNA repair and telomere maintenance.

==Bacterial Toxins==
ADP-ribosylation is also responsible for the actions of some bacterial toxins, such as cholera toxin, diphtheria toxin, and pertussis toxin. These toxin proteins are ADP-ribosyltransferases that modify target proteins in human cells. For example, cholera toxin ADP-ribosylates G proteins, which causes massive fluid secretion from the lining of the small intestine and results in life-threatening diarrhea.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Myristoylation is an irreversible, co-translational (during translation) [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|protein]] modification found in animals, plants, fungi and viruses. In this protein modification a myristoyl group (derived from myristic acid) is [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Covalent bonds|covalently]] attached via an amide bond to the alpha-amino group of an N-terminal amino acid of a nascent polypeptide. It is more common on glycine residues but also occurs on other [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acids]]. The modification is catalyzed by the enzyme N-myristoyltransferase (NMT), and occurs most commonly on glycine residues exposed during co-translational N-terminal methionine removal. Myristoylation also occurs post-translationally, for example when previously internal glycine residues become exposed by caspase cleavage during apoptosis.

Myristoylation also plays a vital role in membrane targeting and signal transduction in plant responses to environmental stress.

      <text xml:space="preserve">THE BASIS OF SABBATH KEEPING

Due to the fact that the &quot;Church&quot; has come under the influence of Hellenestic and Roman philosophy and has lost contact with its Hebraic roots, another 'gospel' has been spawned that is based on misconceptions about the practises of the early assembly.
  
When the New Testament was being written,  the entire &quot;Christian Church&quot; throughout the known world of that time was part of the established structure of Judaism and was regarded as a sect of Judaism, and observed the Sabbath day. As late as the 80's and 90's of the first century,  when the last words of the New Testament were being written, the New Testament assembly universally observed the seventh day Sabbath. 

The Hebraic Roots of the Early Assembly
The believers in Messiah had all grown up attending synagogue and had learned to read the Scriptures in synagogue schools.  The Sabbath was the fourth of the Ten Commandments.   It was the heart and core of the nation's covenant with Yahweh  (Exodus 20:8-11). 

For the Jewish believers of those days,  the Sabbath lay at the very heart of the identity of their God. The Sabbath, then,  was not merely a sign of who the Jews were, but the sign that identified who their God was - by name. &quot;Verily my Sabbaths you shall keep: for it is a sign between me and you throughout your generations; that you may know that I am Yahweh.&quot;    Exodus 31:13

For a Jew in that time and place, changing the Sabbath was unthinkable.   It would be tantamount to changing his God.
The Sabbath was not going away. It was a perpetual covenant to last forever.   It even carried the penalty of death for a presumptuous violation. For a Jew of the first century, the Sabbath could not be taken lightly. They all knew from Ezekiel's prophecies that the failure to keep the sign of the Sabbath was a direct reason why they had spent 70 years in Babylonian exile. So they had no questions about the Sabbath or when it was. It was perhaps the most crucial of all their laws and customs. 

When Y'shua walked onto the scene, the seventh day, Sabbath was an established and honored tradition in every sect of Judaism.   There were Pharisees, Sadducees, Essenes, and others and they were divided on many issues, but they were not divided on the importance of the Sabbath day or on the observance of the Sabbath on the day appointed, as the identifying sign that they were worshiping Yahweh and not another deity.

Keeping the Sabbath had been drilled into the conscience of every Jew, it was woven into their faith. It was not a mere &quot;doctrine&quot; that could be changed.   The new covenant was a fulfillment of the promises made to them by the prophets, so rather than a change to the basic foundations of their faith, the new covenant was built upon the foundation of the apostles of Y'shua and the prophets of old.    Jeremiah 31:31-34;   Ephesians 2:20

So there was no change - that was the whole basis of the preaching of Peter on the day of Pentecost and later Stephen to their brethren, that  &quot;this is that&quot; of which the prophets spoke.    Acts 2:22-36; 3:19-26; 7:51-53

For over twenty years after the ascension of Messiah,  the 'Church'  was still composed entirely of Jews and proselytes (Gentile converts to the Jewish religion).   There was no wholesale conversion of Gentiles until Paul and Barnabas went on their first missionary journey in Acts 13.   With their preaching to the non-Jews in each place,  after the Jews had either received or rejected the message, the first 'Gentiles' began to come into the kingdom.
This was the commencement of 'Gentiles' being admitted into the faith without becoming proselytes and converting to Judaism.    Note that with their entrance, there is no instructions making obsolete the Torah of Judaism (and hence Sabbath-keeping),  excepting that which was done away by the sacrifice of Y'shua,  which applied both to Jew and to Gentile.
This silence is highly significant.

At the Jerusalem Council in Acts 15, they were given four mandatory things from which they were told to abstain, on the understanding that they would learn the Torah (Yahweh's instructions) as they continued to hear Moses preached in the synagogue wherever they lived, week by week on the Sabbath day.   Acts 15:20-21

Everywhere, especially in the East of the Roman Empire, there were Jewish Messianic believers whose outward way of life would not be markedly different from that of the Jews. They took for granted that the gospel was continuous with Judaism; for them the new covenant, which Y'shua had set up at the last supper with his disciples and sealed by his death, did not mean that the covenant made between Yahweh and Israel was no longer in force. They still observed the feasts of Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles; they also continued to keep the weekly Sabbath and the Mosaic regulations concerning food. 	(W.D. Davies, &quot;Paul and Jewish Christianity&quot;, 1972, p. 72)

Preaching/Evangelism on the Sabbath
When Paul in his unconverted state was persecuting the believers, it was to the synagogues that he went to take hold of them. See Acts 9:1-2. This is proof, that as they were attending the synagogue, they were still keeping the Sabbath.  When Paul was himself arrested, he made a revealing remark  -
&quot;.. I said, Lord, they know that I imprisoned and beat in every synagogue them that believed on you.&quot;   Acts 22:17- 19

And we see the pattern after he was converted that it was to the synagogues that he went to preach the gospel.

As Paul and Barnabus went preaching from place to place that they continued to do so on the Sabbath and there is no record of it being done on another day -
&quot;But when they departed from Perga, they came to Antioch in Pisidia, and went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and sat down.  And after the reading of the law and the prophets the rulers of the synagogue sent unto them, saying, Ye men and brethren, if you have any word of exhortation for the people, say on. Then Paul stood up, and beckoning with his hand said, Men of Israel, and you that fear God, give audience.&quot;   (Acts 13:14- 16)

The Gospel had to go to the Jew first, and naturally on the Sabbath.   There is no indication of a change to the Sabbath, if there had been there would have been an outcry against Paul with something as fundamental as the sabbath being violated, and there is no such record, whereas we do have recorded accounts of the Jews rejecting Paul's message regarding Messiah.

&quot;And when the Jews were gone out of the synagogue, the Gentiles besought that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath. Now when the congregation was broken up, many of the Jews and religious proselytes followed Paul and Barnabas: who, speaking to them, persuaded them to continue in the grace of God. And the next Sabbath day came almost the whole city together to hear the word of God. But when the Jews saw the multitudes, they were filled with envy, and spake against those things which were spoken by Paul, contradicting and blaspheming.    Acts 13:42-45
(This uproar was not because of a change in the day of assembly and worship.  This was on the Sabbath day) 
    
&quot;Now when they had passed through Amphipolis and Apollonia, they came to Thessalonica, where was a synagogue of the Jews:  And Paul, as his custom was, went in unto them, and for three sabbaths reasoned with them from the scriptures, explaining and demonstrating,  that the Messiah had to suffer, and rise again from the dead;  and saying,  this Y'shua, whom I preach unto you,  is the Messiah.&quot;  Acts 17:1-3   NKJ
(At this late date, it was still Paul's &quot;manner,&quot;  to go to the synagogue on the Sabbath (Acts 17:2).   The word is the same as the word used for Y'shua of His &quot;custom&quot; to go to the synagogue on the sabbath. (Luke 4:16)   Yes, Paul went to the synagogue, because that was where the Jews were, so he could preach to them.   But that is not why Luke says he went there.   Luke says that going to synagogue on the Sabbath was still Paul's custom.)

Misconceptions of Sunday Worship
Many have understood that in the instances where &quot;the first day of the week&quot; is mentioned that this refers to Sunday and that the disciples were meeting for worship on that day.However , this is incorrect.

In Hebrew, days of the week were not identified in that manner. The Hebrew manner of designating Sunday was to call it  &quot;the morrow after the Sabbath&quot;,  and not the first day of the week.  That is not what is used in the text in these verses.
   
Second, in every case, the word used for &quot;week&quot; is &quot;Sabbaths&quot; in the plural, and the word &quot;day&quot; is missing altogether -  in every one of these eight instances. So, it is an erroneous translation as &quot;first day of the week&quot;.

The New Testament was written in Greek, but there is no Greek word for &quot;week&quot; in any of those eight scriptures. In fact, there is no Greek word for &quot;week&quot; found in the New Testament at all. In every case where the word &quot;week&quot; is found in the English translation, the word for it in Greek is derived from SABBATON, a Greek transliteration of the Hebrew word, Sabbath. The very idea of &quot;week,&quot; to a Jew, was based on the Sabbath and all the other days related to it.

There are eight occasions where this phrase &quot;first of the weeks&quot; occurs in the new covenant scriptures,  and six of them refer to the one occasion.
This is how the first instance of this phrase reads in the NKJV: &quot;Now after the Sabbath, as the first day of the week began to dawn, Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.&quot; ( Matt. 28:1)   

And here is how it reads literally translated from the Greek:  &quot;Now after the Sabbath, as the first of the Sabbaths (plural) began to dawn,  Mary Magdalene and the other Mary came to see the tomb.&quot;

What does the expression &quot;first of the Sabbaths began to dawn&quot;  mean seeing it was a Sunday morning?

If we understand the plural of the word &quot;Sabbath&quot; as used here to refer to &quot;weeks&quot; (not the singular &quot;week&quot;), then what we are looking at is &quot;The first day of the weeks.&quot;  (it is probably correct to insert the word &quot;day&quot; in this passage)

There are seven weeks, seven Sabbaths between this day and the Feast of Pentecost (Lev. 23:14-15). The day that is being referenced here is the first day of the 50 day countdown leading to Pentecost.   So this was not merely a day of the week. It was a special day of the year - the day that began the early harvest. It was the day when the firstfruits were offered to God  (Lev. 23:10-11). The day of Y'shua' presentation to the Father as the first of the firstfruits from the dead, was we suppose, close to the the end of the Sabbath or the commencement of the next day (Saturday night). (John 20:17)  They cut the sheaf on the eve of the Sabbath -  i.e. Saturday afternoon near sunset.

Six of these eight scriptures refer to the same events on the same day - this day of Y'shua's first appearance to His disciples after His resurrection.    Mark 16: 1-2, 9; Luke 14: 1 John 20: 1, 19
Interpreting this phrase from a western mindset, a misleading idea has formed, that the believers were meeting on the first day of the week.  However, they were gathering together more because of fear of the hostile Jewish element than otherwise.

There are only two references left with which to establish a new day of worship on the first day of every week.  The two other passages that use this expression &quot;first day of the week&quot; in our translations are 1 Corinthians 16: 2, and Acts 20: 7.

Analysing the two occasions
No.1  -   &quot;Now concerning the collection for the saints,  as I have given order to the churches of Galatia,  even so do you. Upon the first day of the weeks,  let every one of you lay by him in store, as God hath prospered him,  that there be no gatherings (collections) when I come.&quot;   1 Corinthians 16:2

There are a couple of important things to notice here. First, this is precisely the same idiom we saw in the previous six instances. It is a reference to the first day of the seven weeks of harvest, and therefore is the first opportunity they will have to store up grain for the &quot;collection for the saints.&quot;   This was famine relief for the saints in Jerusalem. Notice the instruction that each of them was to &quot;lay by&quot; himself &quot;in store&quot; his offering of food so it would be ready to go when Paul got there. This would be in accord with the pattern followed in the land of Israel of storing an offering from the produce of the harvest to be given to the poor when the harvest was over, at the feast of Pentecost.

It was not a collection of money given as a tithe on a day of worship,  as our western mindset would interpret it.

Seeing business activities and money matters were not engaged in on the Sabbath, such offerings which may even involve the carrying of a heavy load (produce of grain etc.),  would have been delegated to another occasion,  the believers would probably meet first thing in the evening after Shabbat and thus “do these things on the first day of the week”
(Saturday night was the commencement of the first day of the week, from sundown to sundown on Sunday)

We know in fact that they did meet after the sabbath (Saturday night) to discuss the Synagogue readings of the day.

No.2   -   &quot;And upon the first day of the weeks,  when the disciples came together to break bread,  Paul preached unto them,  ready to depart on the morrow;  and continued his speech until midnight.&quot;   Acts 20:7

This is the only passage in the New Testament that suggests the possibility that the believers met on the first day of the week, and even here it is Saturday night,  not Sunday, because in those times,  days began at sunset, not midnight and also the daylight portion of Sunday would have been a work-day - it was only through Constantine that Sunday was made a day of rest and a holiday, a non-work day.

It became a practice for the believers to meet after the Sabbath was finished to share the teaching from the synagogue, and here Paul is preaching to them before departing. Also it is the same idiom as used in the other instances and it is clear that it was the same time of the year. Paul had been in Phillipi for the days of Unleavened Bread and then left to go to Troas  (Acts 20:6) where he stayed seven days. After he left Troas he was hurrying to be at Jerusalem for the feast of Pentecost travelling by ship to get there.  (Acts 20:16)   [the time of the feast here in Troas would fall about a week after the Days of Unleavened Bread in Jerusalem as the harvest had to begin later in Asia Minor [modern-day Turkey] because of the latitude]

Misconception of Worship Changed to His Resurrection Day 
The writers of the New Testament did not anticipate our problem of understanding a Sunday resurrection as a reason to abandon the Sabbath, so they didn't validate the continuance of Sabbath in the light of this.   Rather, the Sabbath was such an integral part of the faith that no one considered the possibility of such a change.

But although we have no direct teaching on it,  we do have a basis to establish that Y'shua did not rise from the dead on the Sunday as later tradition would tell us.

Y'shua stated that He would be three days and three nights in the earth as a sign  (Matthew 12:40)

Counting from the time He was put in the tomb, there is simply no way to get three days and three nights between Friday afternoon and Sunday morning, which is the traditional belief regarding His death and resurrection.   If you accept what Y'shua said, then you have to start with the time He was buried.   They rushed to get Him in the tomb, so the count starts at the end of the day of his death. (John 19:40-42)   This alone indicates that the resurrection should have been about sundown, not morning. Y'shua was placed in the tomb late Wednesday afternoon and lay there Wednesday night, Thursday, Thursday night,  Friday, Friday night,  and all day Saturday, but not Saturday night - three days and three nights.    

A Wednesday and not Friday for the 14th Nisan, is established by astronomical calculations for 30 AD.  (i.e. Tuesday sundown to Wednesday sundown).   Tradition places the crucifixion on Friday because the Scriptures say that Y'shua was crucified on the preparation day, the day before the Sabbath  (John 19:42)   To those not understanding Hebrew idiom, that means Friday.   But that isn't a correct interpretation.   John makes it clear that this was not the preparation for the weekly Sabbath when He was buried, but the &quot;Preparation of the Passover.&quot;     (John 19:14)

The first day of the Passover season (the &quot;Days of Unleavened Bread&quot;) was a high day - a Sabbath - as well (Lev. 23). Y'shua was crucified on the day before the Sabbath, but that Sabbath was a high day - the first day of the Feast of Unleavened Bread. That year, that particular 'Sabbath'  was a Thursday.

On the Friday, after the High Sabbath, the women bought spices and prepared them, and then on the &quot;first day of the week&quot; they went to the sepulchre  (Mark 15:47- 16:2), after having rested on the weekly Sabbath.  (Luke 23:55-56)
They bought the spices after a Sabbath. They prepared those spices before a Sabbath  (Mark 16:1 &amp; Luke 23:56.  There had to be two Sabbaths that week with a day in between (Thursday and Saturday). So if Y'shua was three days and three nights in the heart of the earth, then He left the tomb Saturday evening after sunset, not Sunday morning.

One of the most dramatic of all Y'shua's miracles was the raising of Lazarus from the dead. (John 11:1)   What makes it so dramatic is that Y'shua was determined that everyone should be certain that Lazarus was really dead.   When Y'shua told them to take away the stone covering the tomb, &quot;Martha, the sister of him that was dead, said unto him, Lord, by this time he stinks:  for he hath been dead four days.&quot;  John 11:39

The New International Version Study Bible says that   &quot;Many Jews believed that the soul remained near the body for three days after death in the hope of returning to it.   If this idea was in the minds of these people, they obviously thought all hope was gone - Lazarus was irrevocably dead.&quot;
It was important that Y'shua be in the grave three days and three nights to prove that He had not merely revived, but was really  dead. So, theories that portions of a day were sufficient to give a three day and three night count are invalid, as it could have been argued that He had not really died, but that point was never raised at that time.

Because of these misconceptions, many “Christians,” now think of the first day of the week as “The Christian Sabbath.”  However,  this change was never authorised in scripture at any time. According to many traditions, Y'shua appeared (after His resurrection) to His disciples on four occasions, which were on the first day of the week, today’s Sunday.   This became one of the major reasons for calling the first day  the “Lord's Day,” and believing that it replaces the Sabbath. However the scripture, His Word,  is silent on this.  The changes came in through the influence of sun-worship (hence Sun-day),  identifying the Resurrection of the Son with the rising of the sun, and incorporating the pagan practices of honouring the sun by meeting together before dawn to greet the rising sun on its day - Sunday.  This was somewhat motivated by the desire to differentiate themselves from the Jewish sector from 70-135 AD onwards and establish a different identity.

Constantine brought in many changes, one of which was abolishing Sabbath-keeping and any identification that remained of the believers with their Hebraic/Jewish roots.    But in spite of this many still adhered to Sabbath-keeping accepting martyrdom rather than the violation of their conscience toward God.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The circulatory system is made up of the vessels and the muscles which help and control the flow of the blood around the body. The main components of the circulatory system are the heart, the blood and the blood vessles. It also includes the pulmonary circulation, a loop through the lungs for the blood to be oxygenated and the systemic circulation.

It serves to move blood to a site or sites where it can be oxygenated, and where wastes can be disposed. Circulation then serves to bring newly oxygenated blood to the tissues of the body. The waste produces diffuse into the blood cells to be carried away, when oxygen and other chemicals spread out of the blood cells and into the fluid surrounding the cells of the body's tissues. Blood circulates through organs where wastes are removed, and back to the lungs for a fresh dose of oxygen, and then the process repeats itself. 

Open Circulatory Systems
In higher animals, there are two primary types of circulatory systems -- open and closed. In an open circulatory system, blood leaves the blood and flows freely within the tissues. There is neither a true heart nor capillaries as are found in humans. Instead, there are blood vessels that act as pumps to force the blood along. Instead of capillaries, blood vessels join directly with open sinuses. A fluid called hemolymph, is forced from the blood vessels into large sinuses, where it actually baths the internal organs. Other vessels receive blood forced from these sinuses and conduct it back to the pumping vessels. This is a very inefficient system. Insects can get by with this type system because they have numerous openings in their bodies that allow the &quot;blood&quot; to come into contact with air. 
Closed Circulatory Systems
The closed circulatory system separates the tissue fluid from blood. The blood is pumped through a closed system of arteries, veins, and capillaries. Capillaries surround the organs, making sure that all cells have an equal opportunity for nourishment and removal of their waste products. 

The simplest type of closed circulatory systems is an earthworm. Earthworms have two main blood vessels, a dorsal and a ventral vessel, which carry blood towards the head or the tail. Blood is moved along the dorsal vessel by waves of contraction in the wall of the vessel. In the anterior region of the worm, there are five pairs of vessels, that connect the dorsal and the ventral vessels. These connecting vessels function as basic hearts and force the blood into the ventral vessel. There are also special organs in the earthworm for the removal of nitrogenous wastes. Still, blood can flow backward and the system is only slightly more efficient than the open system of insects.

The closed circulatory system has more advantages over the open circulatory system. 

1.The blood transfers faster in the closed system, thus oxygen, nutritients, and wastes transport fast also.

2.Specialized cells help carry nutrients.

3.The blood and the tissue fluid are distinguished easily.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== SABERTOOTH ==

SABERTOOTH uses structural profiles to perform structural alignments. The underlying structural profiles express the global connectivity of each residue. Although the vectorial representation is extremely condensed, this program recognizes the structural similarities with accuracy and quality comparable to established alignment tools based on coordinates. Also, the algorithm has favorable scaling of computation time with chain length. Since the algorithm is independent of the details of the structural representation, the framework can be generalized to sequence-to-sequence and sequence-to-structure comparisons within the same setup, and is therefore more general than other tools. SABERTOOTH can be accessed online via [http://www2.fkp.tu-darmstadt.de/bioinf/sabertooth/| this website.]

      <text xml:space="preserve">THE HISTORICAL OBSERVANCE OF THE SABBATH

Y'shua Kept the Sabbath
It is evident that the seventh day Sabbath was the universally recognized day of rest and worship among all Jews when Y'shua came on the scene and it was His custom, His ethos, to attend synagogue on the Sabbath which we call Saturday.

&quot;And He taught in their synagogues  (in Galilee), being glorified of all.&quot;   Luke 4:15

&quot;So He came to Nazareth, where he had been brought up: and, as His custom was, He went into the synagogue on the Sabbath day, and stood up for to read.&quot;   Luke 4:16   (this was when Isaiah's prophecy was fulfilled).

&quot;Then they went into Capernaum, and immediately on the Sabbath He entered the synagogue and taught.&quot; Mark 1:21 

Y'shua customarily kept the Sabbath.  He taught in synagogues and explained that the Sabbath was not supposed to be a burden, but rather a blessing.  Because the Jews recognized that Jerusalem had been destroyed and their ancestors carried into captivity for Sabbath breaking, some built a hedge of rules around the Sabbath which tried to dictate its observance in minute detail.  They made the strict keeping of the Sabbath according to their rules more important than the well-being of human beings:
Y'shua constantly clashed with the religious leaders on account of this as He did the Father's will and implemented the Sabbath in the right context and not according to the legalistic interpretation of the Pharisees.

At one time Y'shua went through the grainfields on the Sabbath and His disciples were hungry, and they began to pluck heads of grain and to eat.  When the Pharisees saw it, they rebuked Him, and He responded by likening their actions to the example of David when he ate the showbread, as being blameless because of their need, and also in relation to the fact that the priests &quot;profane&quot; the Sabbath, and are blameless according to the law. 
  
He reproved them for their legalistic and unmerciful attitude toward those in need, saying that it was &quot;lawful to do good on the Sabbath&quot; (v.12)  and that He was &quot;Lord of the Sabbath&quot; (v.8)  Matthew 12:1-13

Also when healing the woman with an infirmity He recited how they would even save an animal if necessary on the Sabbath  (Luke 13:10), and again with the man with dropsy (Luke14:1)
The religious leaders took great offence at Him for He not only broke the Sabbath according to their tradition, but also said that God was his Father, making himself equal with God.   John 5:18;  7:23, 24

Although some of the Pharisees accused him of breaking the Sabbath (John 5:18; 9:16), He was in fact showing that the Sabbath should be kept, but in a different way than the Jews had been taught. Y'shua upheld the sanctity of the Sabbath and expanded upon the way it should be observed.

Sabbath-Keeping in the Early Assembly
It was obvious that those who followed Y'shua and had received His teaching kept the Sabbath. This is evident in the women waiting until the Sabbath had passed before going to the tomb  (Luke 23:55; Mark 15:47- 16:2)
Paul and Barnabas when they set off on their ministry together went to the synagogues on the Sabbath day to preach the Word.  (Acts 13:14) . . . &quot;And when the Jews went out of the synagogue (rejecting the Word), the Gentiles begged that these words might be preached to them the next Sabbath. ..  ..
On the next Sabbath almost the whole city came together to hear the word of God&quot; in Antioch of Pisidia  (Acts 13:42, 44)

The Scriptures above show without a doubt that Paul and Barnabas continued to keep the Sabbath and assemble on it to worship and teach about Y'shua. After preaching the risen Messiah to the Jews and Gentile proselytes in the synagogue, they spoke to those who had believed their message after the Sabbath service ended. The Gentiles, in particular, begged that more of this good news be preached to them.

If Sunday had replaced the Sabbath as the day for Christian fellowship and worship, Paul would have undoubtedly told the Gentiles that there was no need to wait until the next Sabbath to gather together to hear the gospel.   Instead he met with them on the next Sabbath.

The example that Y'shua set was customary worship on the Sabbath day,  in obedience to the commandments of God. This was what Paul and the other disciples of Y'shua also did.  The book of Acts shows several more examples of Sabbath observance:    Acts 16:13 in Phillipi;  Acts 17:1-2 in Thessalonica;  Acts 18:1-4 

The scriptures show that Paul and the other disciples of Y'shua continued to keep the Sabbath after Messiah's death and resurrection.   Nowhere in the New Testament is the commandment to observe the Sabbath negated.  Instead, the New Testament shows that the Sabbath was still kept by the early believers.   There is no other command regarding another mandated day of worship.   Such a change could not have been made without it being recorded in the scriptures.
The first Believers in Y'shua were loyal Jews. They worshiped daily in the Temple at Jerusalem; they attended services in the synagogue; they revered the Torah. Paul is recorded in the book of Acts as having, for all of his life, the habit of observing the Sabbath.   In the early years of the faith,  the early assembly appeared  to be nothing more than another Jewish sect. They not only observed the same Sabbath as the Jews, they observed the same holidays.  They planned their travel according to the Jewish calendar.   (Acts 20:4-6)   They still observed the feasts of Passover, Pentecost, and Tabernacles;  they also continued to keep the weekly Sabbath and the Mosaic regulations concerning food.    Paul also gives instruction to the assembly at Colossae regarding their observance of the festivals   (Col. 2:16-18)

From the beginning of the New Testament all the way through the 12th chapter of Acts, the Church was composed entirely of Jews and circumcised proselytes.   And there is not a word of any major change in practice during this entire time. For example, when Paul went hunting for Christians to arrest, he went to the synagogues to find them.   (Acts 9:1-2; 22:17- 19)
The Gentile believers in Damascus didn't have a 'church' of their own. They were still in the synagogues and if they were still attending synagogue, they were still keeping the Sabbath.  
    
First Century Changes
Acts 18: &quot;After these things Paul departed from Athens, and came to Corinth; And found a certain Jew named Aquila, born in Pontus, lately come from Italy, with his wife Priscilla; (because that Claudius had commanded all Jews to depart from Rome:) and came unto them.&quot;  

In the year A.D. 49 the Emperor Claudius ... expelled the Jews from Rome since they rioted constantly at the instigation of Chrestus (a probable erroneous transcription of the name of Christ). The fact that on this occasion converted Jews like Aquila and Priscilla were expelled from the city together with the Jews (Acts 18:2) proves,  as Pierre Batiffol observes, &quot;that the Roman police had not yet come to distinguish the Christians from the Jews.   Fourteen years later, however, Nero identified the Christians as being a separate entity, well distinguished from the Jews.
 
By this time, 'Christianity' in Rome was taking on a rather different cast from 'Christianity' in the east, particularly in Palestine. The political structure of Rome gave both Jews and Gentiles good reason to separate themselves from one another, something that had not happened elsewhere.
This suggests the possibility that the abandonment of the Sabbath and adoption of Sunday as a new day of worship may have occurred first in Rome as a part of this process of differentiation from Judaism. 	(Sam Bacchiocchi's , &quot;From Sabbath to Sunday.&quot; (pp. 167ff, 169.)

During the first century, Messianic Hebrews (believers) continued the practice of observing the Seventh day of the week.  Many first century Jewish (non-Messianic) sources speak of the “Nazarenes” or “Ebionites” (Ebionites which was a term non-believing Hebrews called those who believed in Y'shua at that time) whether Gentile or Hebrew, as observing forms of worship almost identical to their own, with the only distinctive difference being the teaching that Y'shua is the Messiah.  

The Nazarene movement observed the seventh day Sabbath, not Sunday. It was only in the 2nd century C.E., under the pressure of a strongly anti-Jewish, anti-nomian, pagan sentiment which had developed in the Western churches, that “Christians” substituted Sunday for the Sabbath and began to lose touch with the Judaic or Torah roots of the Nazarene faith.   This has all been carefully documented by recent scholars.

Toward the end of the first century, relations between the Jews and the Roman Empire had deteriorated drastically. The Romans had previously recognized Judaism as a legitimate religion and had even shown a level of respect and even admiration for the religious principles of the Jews. But the Jewish wars that began from 66 - 135 A.D. changed all that.

Militarily, the statistic of bloodshed as provided by contemporary historians, even allowing for possible exaggerations, is a most impressive evidence of the Romans's angry vengeance upon the Jews. Tacitus (ca. A.D. 33-120), for instance, gives an estimate of 600,000 Jewish fatalities for the A.D. 70 war. . . Besides military measures, Rome at this time adopted new political and fiscal policies against the Jews. Under Vespasian (A.D. 69-79) both the Sanhedrin and the office of the High Priest were abolished and worship at the temple was forbidden.   Hadrian (A.D. 117-138).... outlawed the practice of the Jewish religion and particularly the observance of the Sabbath. (ibid. p. 173)

Such circumstances invited Christians to develop a new identity, not only characterized by a negative attitude toward the Jews, but also by the substitution of characteristic Jewish religious customs by new ones.   These would serve to make the Roman authorities aware that the Christians,  as Marcel Simon emphasizes, &quot;liberated from any tie with the religion of Israel and the land of Palestine,  represented for the empire irreproachable subjects.&quot;  

This internal need of the Christian community to develop what may be called an &quot;anti-Judaism of differentiation&quot; found expression particularly in the development of unwarranted criteria of scriptural interpretation through which Jewish history and observances could be made void of meaning and function. (ibid. p. 183)

Thousands of law-observant Jews became followers of the &quot;Way&quot; in the early years, and they attended temple and synagogue functions,  yet they also had meetings for believers only. They discussed the scriptures, shared meals, prayed and sang hymns related to their Messianic experiences. Initially, they met daily (Acts 2:46). 

Many of their meetings were on the Saturday evening (the traditional Havdallah service),  after the Sabbath had ended and the teaching on the scriptures that had been read the previous day would be discussed,  especially if they had messianic significance. As the faith spread  to Jewish communities in Antioch,  Alexandria and Rome,  similar situations would foster the development of post-Sabbatic meetings. 

When Gentiles began to be added to the assemblies, they attended synagogue readings and would also need an after-Sabbath meeting time for worship and further exposition of the Torah.   Eventually Gentiles from pagan backgrounds were also added, e.g., in Alexandria, Ephesus and Rome.   These converts were not already attending synagogue,  and as persecution developed a pattern developed that they would only attend the believers' meetings after the Sabbath. Thus two groups emerged,  those who went to the synagogue and met after the Sabbath, and those who did not and met only after the Sabbath to receive the teaching from those who went.   

As the 'Gentile' content of the assemblies increased and they became the majority,  the meetings became led by them and together with the rising anti-Jewish sentiment and the strong desire to establish separateness from Judaism because of persecution from being identified with them, they drifted away from their Jewish/Hebraic roots. 

The custom of after-Sabbath meetings would have been spread by travelling evangelists, and the tradition would have been maintained even in areas without Sabbath meetings.  Even in areas with synagogues, meeting on the Sabbath would become less important, since synagogue readings had to be interpreted, and the interpretations were given in the after-Sabbath meeting.  The desire for attendance at the synagogue would become further reduced when Christian groups obtained their own copies of the Scriptures which began to happen in the second century.

This explains how an initially Sabbath-keeping Jewish/Hebraic group could become a Sunday‑keeping Gentile group within a few generations, and it explains how this could have been done throughout the empire (Rome) simultaneously with a minimum of controversy.   (Andrews University Seminary Studies 17 (1979): 85-104)

Second Century Practice Until Constantine
The second-century writers show that many believers met on Sunday and in some areas they did not keep the Sabbath.  

According to Irenaeus,  Ignatius was Bishop of Antioch at the time of Trajan (A.D. 98-117). The Bishop argues against the Judaizing tendencies of his territory,  which, not far geographically from Palestine,  had suffered the influences of the synagogue and of the &quot;Judaeo-Christians.&quot;  His language suggests that the separation from Judaism was in progress, though the ties had not yet been severed. In fact the tenacious survival and veneration of Jewish institutions such as the Sabbath is explicitly mentioned, and the necessity to renounce Jewish customs  (ch. 8:1,2 &amp; 10:3).   
&quot;Let us therefore no longer keep the Sabbath after the Jewish manner, and rejoice in days of idleness.11 . . . But let every one of you keep the Sabbath in a spiritual manner, rejoicing in the meditation on the law, not in the relaxation of the body, admiring the workmanship of God, and not eating things prepared the day before, nor using lukewarm drinks, nor walking within a prescribed space, nor finding delight in dancing and plaudits which have no sense in them.&quot; 

The fact that Ignatius urges Christians to stop &quot;practicing Judaism&quot; (Magnesians 8:1) or &quot;living like the Jews&quot; (10:3) and to follow the example of the prophets in not judaizing on the Sabbath,  implies that many Christians were still following traditional Jewish customs,  especially in the matter of Sabbath-keeping.   It is reasonable to assume that believers in Asia were still keeping the Sabbath and were resisting the change to Sunday. 

We have indications, however, that in the East the substitution of the Sabbath by Sunday worship was gradual since Jewish observances there constituted, as A. P. Hayman points out it was, &quot;a perennial attraction . . . for the Christian.&quot;
 
In the West, particularly in Rome, however, we have found that the break with Judaism occurred earlier and more radically, causing the replacement of Jewish festivities such as the Sabbath and Passover. 
But even in Lombardy (Italy) a group of Sabbath-keeping believers was established in 120 AD and continued under persecution for many centuries.   
They held to two principles   -   The first was a notion that the observance of the Law of Moses, in everything except the offering of sacrifices, was obligatory upon Christians; in consequence of which they ... Abstained from those meats, the use of which was prohibited under the Mosaic economy, and celebrated the Jewish Sabbath. The second tenet that distinguished this sect was advanced in opposition to the doctrine of three persons in the divine nature.  (Eccl. Hist., Cent 12, Part 2, Ch. 5, Sec. 14, p. 127: as quoted by Dugger and Dodd, )

The Epistle of Barnabas, dated by the majority of the scholars between A.D. 130 - 138, was written by a pseudonymous Barnabas probably at Alexandria, a cosmopolitan cultural center where the conflict between Jews and Christians was particularly acute. This contains the first explicit reference to the observance of Sunday, denominated as &quot;eighth day&quot;,  and it also reveals the social and theological tensions which existed between Jews and believers.
The Epistle of Barnabas reveals that the author purposes to demonstrate the total repudiation on the part of God of Judaism as a true religion. While Ignatius condemns the &quot;judaizing&quot; of some Christians.

Epiphanius (ca. A.D. 315-403) suggests that until A.D. 135 Christians everywhere observed Passover on the Jewish date, namely, on Nisan 15, irrespective of the day of the week. If our informer is correct, this would mean that prior to that time, no necessity had been felt to institute a Sunday memorial (whether annual or weekly) to honor the resurrection. 

Justin Martyr the next writer, is of Greek background. He lived, taught and wrote his Apologies and Dialogue with Trypho in Rome under the reign of Antoninus Pius (A.D. 138-161). He gives the first extensive treatment of the Sabbath and the first detailed description of Sunday worship and how the problem of Sabbath and Sunday worship was felt in the capital city.    His testimony, coming from Rome, confirms what we have already gathered from other sources, namely the existence of deep anti-Judaic feelings. The adoption of a new day of worship appears to have been motivated by the necessity to evidence a clear dissociation from the Jews.  

Sabbath observance was widespread and appears to have been opposed from Rome. It was kept in Egypt as the Oxyrhynchus Papyrus (c. 200-250 AD) shows:
Except ye make the sabbath a real sabbath [Gr. sabbatize the Sabbath], ye shall not see the Father (The Oxyrhynchus Papyri, Pt. 1, p. 3, Logion 2, verso 4-11, London: Offices of the Egyptian Exploration Fund, 1898).

Origen also enjoined Sabbath-keeping:
After the festival of the unceasing sacrifice [the crucifixion] is put the second festival of the Sabbath, and it is fitting for whoever is righteous among the saints to keep also the festival of the Sabbath. There remains therefore a sabbatismus, that is, a keeping of the Sabbath, to the people of God [Hebrews 4:9] (Homily on Numbers 23, para. 4, in Migne, Patrologia Græca, Vol. 12, cols. 749, 750).

Similarly the Constitution of the Holy Apostles (Ante-Nicene Fathers, Vol. 7, p. 413; c. 3rd century) states:
Thou shalt observe the Sabbath, on account of Him who ceased from His work of creation, but ceased not from His work of providence: it is a rest for meditation of the law, not for idleness of the hands.

The Sabbatati of Europe were not an inconsiderable force. The Church established in Milan kept the Sabbath.
It was the practice generally of the Eastern Churches; and some churches of the West ... For in the Church of Millaine [Milan]; ... it seemes the Saturday was held in a farre esteeme ... Not that the Easterne Churches, or any of the rest which observed that day were inclined to Iudaisme [Judaism]; but that they came together on the Sabbath day, to worship Iesus [Jesus] Christ the Lord of the Sabbath (Dr. Peter Heylyn History of the Sabbath, London 1636, Part 2, para. 5, pp. 73-74; original spelling retained).

The Influence of Constantine
Constantine introduced a very strong element of anti-Semitism into the &quot;Christian&quot; church.  Constantine forbade those who believed in Y'shua, on pain of death, from worshiping on the Sabbath.

Sunday worship was a convenient means of excluding Jewish believers from continued fellowship with Gentile Believers. His reason for excluding them was clear - they would not compromise their principles and accept Constantine, who continued to worship the Roman Sun Idol,  as having any right to exert authority among those who believed in Messiah. There was great trauma suffered by Jews-under the banner of &quot;Christ&quot; and under the depiction of a cross.   Many of those persecutions focused on the Jewish practice of Sabbath worship.

In 321 A.D. The emperor of Rome, Constantine, by decree, changed the Sabbath of Yahweh, Saturday (the 7th day)  to a Sunday,  in order to worship Constantine’s beloved “sun god mithra or tammuz.” (the mother of tammuz is now the current “lady of fatima,” better known as “the queen of heaven.”)   
Constantine declared,  “On the venerable day of the Sun (meaning the Sungod Mithra) let the magistrates and people residing in cities rest.”  Then, in 364 A.D. the Council of Laodicea ordered that  “Sunday is the new Sabbath,”  and declares,  “Christians shall not Judaise and be idle on Saturday, but shall work on that day.” 
The changes had taken place over a rather long period of time.

About 417 A.D,  Pope Innocent I,  wrote a decretal which became canon law that the church should absolutely not observe the sacraments on Friday or Saturday.   Which reveals,  of course,  that up until this time,  a lot of people did.  Two contemporary historians,  Sozomen (about 440) and Socrates (about 439) confirm this.

According to Socrates : &quot;Although almost all churches throughout the world celebrated the sacred mysteries on the Sabbath of every week, yet the Christians of Alexandria and Rome, on account of some ancient tradition, have ceased to do this.&quot; 

So as late as the fifth century, there were still those who kept the Sabbath and a minority of churches in the areas of Alexandria and Rome,  had Sunday observance well established. The Roman church was determined to inhibit Sabbath observance and sought to establish Sunday as the day of worship throughout the empire.   They ordered fasting on the Sabbath as a way to curtail the true observance of the Sabbath, and this practice continued among some until after 1000 AD. (ibid. p. 192)    

Even though the opposition to Sabbath-keeping was strong, the traditions handed down from the apostles prevailed in many areas and keeping the Sabbath continued to be practiced up to the seventeenth century in some of those places.

The believers in Ethiopia have to this present day, maintained the traditions handed down to them from the eunuch in Acts 8 who received them directly from Phillip the evangelist when he went to worship in Jerusalem.

Observing Sunday as a kind of “substitute sabbath” robs one of the profound and positive impact of Yahweh's original Testimony - the sign of His covenant.

      <text xml:space="preserve">THE PRINCIPLE OF REST
The Sabbath Day is a memorial to Messiah as Creator and Sustainer of the universe.  It testifies to His unique activity as the Creator of all things and that the Sabbath was a celebration of the finished work of creation.  He did not need rest after six days of creating (Isaiah 40:28),  and Adam should not have needed to rest immediately following his creation at the end of the sixth day, but his first day of existence was the seventh day of rest,  the Sabbath.  Y'shua said it was created for man.

The Hebrew word Shabbat (Sabbath) is related to the word shevet - to dwell.  On the Sabbath,  God made the world His dwelling-place, with the man that He had created.   

Adam's first experience in life was in union and fellowship with Yahweh God!
Adam entered into His rest in the Sabbath and enjoyed the fruit of His Creator's labour in creation.
The Sabbath Day is vitally connected to knowing and understanding God as the Creator and experiencing His Presence.

The main Sabbath commandment is rest - not doing - i.e. a cessation from activity! He ceased His activity of creating on the seventh day and rested.   In so doing He ceased exercising His power and authority over the universe on that day and in like manner, so we are to cease asserting our dominance over it through our abilities and skills to conform it to our will.   We are to be at peace with the world on that day and leave it at rest, as it is. 
 
&quot;There are six days when you may work but the seventh day is a Sabbath of rest, a day of sacred assembly.  You are not to do any work; wherever you live, it is a Sabbath to Yahweh.&quot;  Leviticus 23:3 
   
The Sabbath was the first festival observed by God Himself in the book of Genesis,  as well as being the first to be observed by man, even before the revelation at Mount Sinai when the other festivals were commanded.  It was also the first festival to be outlined by Yahweh to Moses in the book of Leviticus.  The setting apart of Shabbat acknowledges the physical need of humanity for a Sabbath of rest.  The functioning of our bodies is so constituted that they need a rest one day in seven.   

Moses said to the congregation  &quot;These are the things that Yahweh has commanded you to do: Six days shall work be done, but on the seventh day you shall have a holy Shabbat of solemn rest to Yahweh; whoever does any work on it shall be put to death. You shall kindle no fire in all your dwellings on the Sabbath day&quot;.   Exodus 35:1-3)

This command to not do any work on Shabbat (Exodus 20:10) is repeated in other passages about the Sabbath in Exodus -31:14-15,   in Leviticus 23:3 and in  Deuteronomy 5:14.  This key word - &quot;work&quot;,  which is not only the principal theme on Shabbat but also on the other Holy Days of the calendar (see Exodus 12, Leviticus 23)  means something akin to &quot;activity&quot; and is first used in the description of God's creation of the world in Genesis 2: 2-3. 
How do we distinguish activities which are acceptable on Shabbat from those which are not?
:The meaning of the word 'work' is in Hebrew  M'lakhah (Strongs 4399;  TWB 1068b).
:Strongs says that it comes from a root 'to despatch as a deputy'   &quot;prop. 'to deputyship'  i.e. ministry; gen. employment or work 	(never servile)&quot;   In that category business, industry, occupation, workmanship, thing made.
:The Theological Wordbook says that &quot;m'lakah could refer either to the activity of working, the requisite skills of work, or to the 	result of work. .. this term emphasises work as involving skill and benefits&quot; not that which comes from toilsome, laborious work.

This therefore has to include all creative activity, all skilled occupations and all engagements involved in one's purpose and interests in this life and is not just servile work.  This also includes maintenance of our possessions and livelihood.

So it is a time of disengagement with the pursuits of this life to withdraw back into the eternal purposes for our existence.

The concept of 'work', or ceasing from work, is related to our reverence of His Presence among us.  
Shabbat is a day of worship and fellowship, set aside even from non-secular activities connected to our worship of Him. So even those things involved with the dwelling-place of Yahweh on earth for the purpose of worship,  must cease on Shabbat.
&quot;You shall keep my Sabbaths and reverence my sanctuary: I am Yahweh.&quot;   Leviticus 19:30, 26:2

Any activity which was an integral part of the construction of the Tabernacle or it's maintenance, was defined as work (M'lakhah) and was therefore, prohibited on Shabbat.  Only the duties involved in worship itself, such as the sacrifices were continued.  With the introduction of the Tabernacle in their midst, His Presence became manifest among His people, therefore their reverence for His Presence took precedence over the activities centered around the maintenance of the means whereby they engaged in worship of Him.  So reverencing His presence has priority above serving Him on the Sabbath.

THE PRINCIPLE OF SPIRITUAL RELATIONSHIP
God commands us, &quot;Sanctify (make separate) My Sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between Me and you, that you may know that I am Yahweh your God&quot; (Ezekiel 20:20, 44:24).

Yahweh is saying that the Sabbath would be a sign  through which they would know that He had set them apart to Himself. The identifying mark of their being His people in the world,  was their observance of the Sabbath. It was also their identifying mark (sign) to Him that they were His people.   Exodus 31:13, 17
We signify both to the world and to our Creator/Redeemer that we identify ourselves as His people by keeping Shabbat. 

For that reason, the traditional Jewish rabbis, interpret the Biblical statement that &quot;God blessed the sabbath day and hallowed/ sanctified it&quot; (Genesis  2: 3),  as meaning that He wedded/betrothed the Sabbath to His people.  That is, He bonded them together in a spiritual covenantal union by which they became one.  In that sense the Sabbath and His people are wedded to one another as part of the covenant bond through a spiritual union on that day.  

In setting aside the seventh day as the day in which He would bless those who would come into spiritual union with Him, He set that particular day aside for spiritual communion with His people. It is the day He has chosen from creation to fellowship with the man He has created, as He did with Adam.  He has placed a special blessing on that particular day.

The Hebrew word for “sign” indicates a pledge or a token of what is promised.  So in keeping the Sabbath we are displaying a visible token of our faith in the pledge which He has made in the covenant with us, to fulfill what He has promised. Shabbat is an eternal focal point and sign of our ongoing encounter with Him and a sign of His constant Presence with us when His shekinah comes to rest upon His tabernacle.   (1 Corinthians 6:19)

Since Shabbat is the sign of a special relationship between Yahweh and His people in a &quot;shared experience&quot;, this special &quot;place in time&quot; must be guarded carefully. It is now more than just resting  and avoiding 'work'  -  it is a precious segment of time to be guarded and kept set apart for Him,  to be with Him. Only His covenant people can enter into the experience of Shabbat.  Shabbat is regarded as an encounter between Yahweh and His people where they commune with each other as the lover and beloved, of the Song of Songs. It is a designated set-apart time of Yahweh coming to dwell with His betrothed.   Hence the custom of reading this beautiful love song in the Song of Songs every Friday evening at the onset of Shabbat.

The day is kept &quot;holy&quot; by not treating it as ordinary time. Isaiah speaks of calling the Sabbath a delight, a day to be honored. To “pursue one’s own affairs” is considered “trampling” on the day (Isaiah 58:13, see Nehemiah 13:15-18).  

The keynote of the Sabbath day is joy and rest. It is a wonderful “sanctuary in time,” carved out of the mundane activities and surroundings of our everyday lives to spend time in spiritual refreshment personally, and with family and other believers in fellowship and worship. It is a vital part of the “restoration of all things”. The Prophet Jeremiah tells us to seek the “ancient paths where the good way is, and walk therein, and you will find rest for your souls” (Jeremiah 6:16). 

In Leviticus  23:2-4, the Bible tells us that Shabbat is not only a mo'ed but that it is also a holy convocation. 
:The Hebrew word mo'ed is the Strong's word 4150 in the Hebrew dictionary and means &quot;an appointment, a fixed time or season, 	a cycle, an assembly, an appointed time, a set time or an exact time.&quot; 
:The Hebrew word for holy is the Strong's word 6944 in the dictionary and is the word kodesh. The Hebrew word kodesh means 	&quot;to consecrate, dedicate, hallow, set apart.&quot;  
:The Hebrew word for convocation is the Strong's word 4744 in the dictionary and is the word miqra. The Hebrew word miqra means, &quot;a public meeting, an assembly, a rehearsal.&quot; 

Therefore, God  is telling us in His Word that Shabbat is a mo'ed (an appointed time, a set time) during the week (from Friday sundown to Saturday sundown) which is a kodesh (holy, consecrated, dedicated and set apart) miqra (a public meeting, an assembly of people, a rehearsal). 
  
Shabbat is a commandment which Yahweh wants His people to keep as a rehearsal (a miqra) because it is an appointed time or set apart time (mo'ed), a holy convocation   --  i.e. a celebration. 

If the Sabbath  is a celebration rehearsal, what is it that we are to rehearse?   

Shabbat is a rehearsal of all the things that will be enacted in the Messianic Age. It is a foretaste of life in the Kingdom, in the spiritual realm of eternal realities, and it gives us a foretaste of the future redemption of Messiah in the life to come. 
 
We separate ourselves from the natural in order that we may enter into the spiritual and refresh ourselves in His Presence. We make it our delight to embrace this day and prepare for it in anticipation of a special encounter with the honoured Guest of the day whom we invite to come and take up His abode with us in kingdom power.

PRIORITIES FOR THE SABBATH
The sabbath was made for man, not man for the sabbath.   It's observance is for man's spiritual and physical benefit and not for man to become legalistic in the manner of keeping it.Therefore in situations where the maintenance of life or a person's redemption is a priority, the principle to follow is that the preservation or restoration of a man's health or life takes precedence over abstaining from engaging in an activity that would save his health or life, on the Sabbath.

This is the standard which Y'shua set in all He did on the Sabbath day.  
This principle of doing life-giving redemptive activities on Shabbat is what Y'shua was following in healing on the Sabbath. He acted against the prevailing misconceptions that originated from the laws which the Rabbis had instituted, in order to restore the Sabbath to its true meaning and function.

Not everything was forbidden on the Sabbath.  The priests still carried on with their Tabernacle/Temple duties in order to perform the required sacrifices.   Circumcision was performed on the Sabbath if it was the eighth day after the child's birth, in order to extend to the newborn child the salvation of the covenant.    Exodus 16:23
Y'shua defended the legality of the “working” that He and His Father performed on the Sabbath.   In John, He appealed to the example of circumcision to silence the echo of the controversy over the healing of the paralytic (John 7:22-24).  

He argued that if it was legitimate on the Sabbath for the priests to care for one small part of a person’s body by administering circumcision to effect redemption (according to rabbinic reckoning, circumcision involved one of man’s members),  there is no reason to be “angry” with Him for restoring on that day the “whole body of man”. 

It was understood that on the Sabbath they were to be compassionate toward the less fortunate,  and in the priesthood especially,  they legitimately performed on the Sabbath works forbidden to other Israelites,  because such works had a redemptive function.

In spite of the accusations which the Rabbis made against Y'shua, they understood these precepts from the teaching on Shabbat.  The various rulings which they had made for the people to observe were according to the letter of the law and not according to the purpose for which the Sabbath was given.   It's purpose was to be life-giving to His people, so therefore that which pertains to the necessity of life is permissible on Shabbat. 
 
In John 5:17 where Y'shua healed on the Sabbath),  Y'shua said,  &quot;My Father has been working until now, and I have been working&quot;. What Y'shua is saying,  is that though God rested on the Sabbath at the completion of creation,  because of sin He has been “working until now” to bring the promised Sabbath rest to fruition. For that same purpose Y'shua was also working the works of God to fulfill the Father's redemptive work, the completion of which will be the final and perfect Sabbath of which the initial creation Sabbath was the prototype.   

So although the commands that Y'shua gave to each of the men He healed in order to have them act upon their healing,  “Rise, take up your pallet, and walk” (John 5:8);  “Go, wash in the pool of Siloam” (John 9:7))  broke the laws which the Rabbis had made for the Sabbath,  they were not contrary to the Father's commandment,  and He repudiated the Pharisees charge against Him  each time concerning it (John 5 :10, 16; 9:14-16).  In both instances He argued that His works of salvation were not contrary, but rather were contemplated by the Sabbath commandment.    (John 5:17; 7:23; 9:4)

The redemptive nature of the works of God are evident in the healing of the blind man since the act is explicitly described as the manifestation of “the works of God” (John 9:3).   The redemptive purpose is also evident in that He looked for the healed men on the same day and, having found them, He ministered to their spiritual needs.  (John 5:14; 9:35-38)

Y'shua appeals to the “working” of His Father not to nullify, but to clarify the function of the Sabbath.  To understand His defense, one must remember that the Sabbath is linked both to creation (Gen 2:2-3; Ex 20:11) and redemption (Deut 5:15). While in Exodus 20:11 the reason given for observing the Sabbath is the completion of creation in six days, in Deuteronomy 5:15 the reason is deliverance from the Egyptian bondage,  i.e. - redemption.  The physical and spiritual aspects of life.

For this reason, His disciples plucking grain on the Sabbath was also exempted, in that there was a physical need for the sustenance of their life  (Matthew 12: 1-8).  Y'shua likens them to priests whose service to God renders them blameless.

Therefore we as His people do not engage in activities which originate out of the desire of our own heart on Shabbat, nor do we initiate or get involved in activities which seek to promote the extension of His kingdom on Shabbat,  but we are called to act redemptively in situations where the responsibility for another person's physical or spiritual life and well-being rests upon us to be compassionate and extend assistance to them in their need.

[[image:Fischer esterification mechanism.svg|thumbnail|300px|In acid-catalyzed Fischer esterification, the proton binds to oxygens and functions as a Lewis acid to activate the ester carbonyl (top row) as an electrophile, and converts the hydroxyl into the good leaving group water (bottom left). Both lower the kinetic barrier and speed up the attainment of chemical equilibrium.]]
General acid/base catalysis' rate determining step is the proton transfer step. Therefore, general acid catalysis has its reaction rate depending on all the acids present; similarly, the general base catalysis has its reaction rate depending on all the bases present. The preferred reaction environment is neutral PH for both reactions, because high concentration of H+ or OH- can damp out the catalytic contributions from other acids and bases, thus, turning the &quot;general&quot; acid or base reaction into &quot;specific&quot; acid or base catalysis. 

Since the proton transfer step determines the rate of the reaction, it is important to examine the effectiveness of the general catalysis. The effectiveness of the general catalysis can be determined from Bronsted equation, which is written as, &lt;br /&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; \log k_\text{HA} = \alpha \log K_\text{HA} + \text{Constant}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
::
::&lt;math&gt;k_{HA}&lt;/math&gt;, the rate constant of the catalysis&lt;br /&gt;
::
::&lt;math&gt;K_{HA}&lt;/math&gt;, the dissociation constant of HA&lt;br /&gt;
::
::&lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, the sensitivity of the catalytic step to the acid dissociation step. &lt;br /&gt;

The relationship can be easily seen by graphing logk(HA) vs. log K(HA), and so the slope, which is the alpha, can be analyzed graphically. Each dot on the graph represents different acids. Since efficiency cannot exceed 1, the rage of the slope is bounded between 0 and 1. A slope of 1 indicates that the rate increases with every acid dissociation and that the proton transfer is effective. A slope of zero means every acid dissociation contributes the same effect to the catalysis, and the transfer of proton is not effective. On the other hand, the sensitivity graph for the specific acid/base catalysis may appear as a nonlinear relationship between k(HA) and K(HA).

== Overview ==

'''General acid-base catalysis''' involves a molecule besides water that acts as a proton donor or acceptor during the enzymatic reaction. Acid-base catalysis facilitates a reaction by stabilizing the charges in the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Transition state|transition state]] through the use of an acid or base, which donates protons or accepts them, respectively.  Nucleophilic and electrophilic groups are activated as a result of the proton addition or removal and causes the reaction to proceed. Many acid-base catalysis reactions involve histidine because it has a [[Structural Biochemistry/pH|pH]] close to 7, allowing it to act as both an acid and a base. When a functional group accepts a proton, it will release or donate a proton by the end of the catalytic cycle, and vice versa. Functional groups that participate in reaction are His imidazole, alpha-amino group, alpha-carboxyl group, thiol of Cys, R group of carboxyls of Glu and Asp, aromatic OH of Tyr, and guanidino group of ARG. The protonation of these functional groups are dependent on the pH, therefore the enzymatic catalytic activity is sensitive to the pH level.

General acid-base catalysis is involved in a majority of enzymatic reactions, wherein the side chains of various amino acids act as general acids or general basis. General acid–base catalysis needs to be distinguished from specific acid–base catalysis.

Specific acid–base catalysis means specifically, –OH or H+ accelerates the reaction. The reaction rate is dependent on pH only (which of course is a function of –OH and H+ concentrations), and not on buffer concentration.
General acid - partial transfer of a proton from a Brønsted acid lowers the free energy of the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Transition state|transition state]] rate of reaction increases with decrease in [[Structural Biochemistry/pH|pH]] and increase in [Brønsted acid].

-Specific acid - protonation lowers the free energy of the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Transition state|transition state]] rate of reaction increases with decrease in [[Structural Biochemistry/pH|pH]].

-Specific base - abstraction of a proton (or nucleophilic attack) by OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; lowers the free energy of the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Transition state|transition state]] rate of reaction increases with increase in [[Structural Biochemistry/pH|pH]].

In General acid–base catalysis, the buffer aids in stabilizing the transition state via donation or removal of a proton. Therefore, the rate of the reaction is dependent on the buffer concentration, as well as the appropriate protonation state.
-General base - partial abstraction of a proton by a Brønsted base lowers the free energy of the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Transition state|transition state]] rate of reaction increases with increase in [[Structural Biochemistry/pH|pH]] and increase in Brønsted base.

An example of acid-base catalysis is peptide hydrolysis by [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme Catalytic Mechanism/Proteases/Chymotrypsin|'''chymotrypsin''']]. [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme Catalytic Mechanism/Proteases/Chymotrypsin|Chymotrypsin]] uses a histidine residue as a base catalyst to increase the nucleophilicity of serine.
[[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme Catalytic Mechanism/Proteases/Chymotrypsin|Chymotrypsin]] uses a histindine residue as a base catalyst to help to strengthen the nucleophillic property of serine, whereas a histindine residue in [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme Catalytic Mechanism/Carbonic Anhydrase|carbonic anhydrase]] helps the removal of hydrogen ion from zinc bound water molecule to generate OH&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;.

The pKa of Histidine is close to neutral thus making it the most effective candidate for general acid or base because it can either donate or accept protons. His 119 plays the role of a general acid that donates a proton to 5'-hydroxyl of nucleoside. On the other hand, His 12 acts as a general base which accepting a proton from the 2'-hydroxyl of 3'-nucleotide. As a result, a 2’-3’ cyclic phosphate intermediate is formed. When water replaces the nucleoside, the roles of His 119 and His 12 are reversed. In the end, the original Histidine protonation states are restored.

In the picture, serine acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl group of the substrate, while histidine accepts the proton from serine and the tetrahedral intermediate is formed. The collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate forms the acyl [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzyme]]. Water loses a proton to histidine and attacks the acyl [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzyme]] and the oxyanion hole is formed. The reaction ends with the release of a carboxylic acid. The cycle then continues with a new substrate.

Another example of acid-base catalysis is the reaction with [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme Catalytic Mechanism/Carbonic Anhydrase|'''carbonic anhydrase''']]. His residues in [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme Catalytic Mechanism/Carbonic Anhydrase|carbonic anhydrase]] facilitates the removal of a hydrogen ion from zinc-bound water to generate a hydroxide ion.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Site-Directed Mutagenesis=


'''''Mutagenesis''''' is a broad term that is defined as the alteration of the genetic material of an organism in a stable manner. 


Site-directed mutagenesis is when the amino acid sequence of a given enzyme molecule or other protein may be altered by deliberately and precisely mutating the cloned gene encoding that molecule. It is a very useful technique that can be used in the study of protein function, the identification of enzymatic active sites, and the design of novel proteins. With this technique, it is possible to exchange a single amino acid in the sequence of a protein for another amino acid with different chemical properties. In this way, the function of the specific amino acid at this site can be examined. The basic protocol for this process was developed by Michael Smith, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1993 &quot;for his fundamental contributions to the establishment of oligonucleotide-based, site-directed mutagenesis and its development for protein studies&quot; (1)


In order to carry out site-directed mutagenisis, a DNA primer must be designed at the site of interest. The primer should contain the necessary nucleotide differences in order to affect the change in the protein sequence. For example, consider the case where a protein sequence reads Tyr-Leu-His-Val, corresponding to a genetic sequence of UACCUG'''CAC'''GUC. If the experimentalist intends to mutate the histidine residue to a leucine residue, they might design a primer with the sequence UACCUG'''CUC'''GUC. This primer is then hybridized to the complementary single stranded DNA molecule and extended using a DNA polymerase. A mutated double stranded DNA molecule encoding the (mutated) protein is obtained in this way, and this DNA molecule is cloned into a host cell. Host cells are allowed to grow and mutants are selected. In this way, proteins that are generated by this DNA sequence will contain the desired mutation. A similar procedure can be carried out with the use of PCR (PCR site-directed mutagenisis)

[[File:Site Directed Mutagenesis.png|Site Directed Mutagenesis]]

===An example of site-directed mutagenesis: catalytic triad===
Site-Directed Mutagenesis is a method used to dissect the amount of catalytic power by each of the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Catalytic Triad|catalytic triad]] in a [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzyme]]. This is done by converting each of the triad into a common [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acid]] and measure the catalytic power differences.  

For example, in subtilisin, the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Catalytic Triad|catalytic triad]] that is studied by this method are aspartic acid 32, histidine 64, and serine 221.  Each of the [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acids]] in the triad will be converted into alanine and thus, the ability of the mutant [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzyme]] to cleave a substrate is examined.  The result by this method shows that serine 221 into alanine reduces the catalytic power as much as histidine 64 into alanine. The value of the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Kcat/Km|k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;]] for serine 221 and histidine 64 becomes one-millionth of its original value.  As for aspartic acid 32, the catalytic power is reduced but not as much as for serine 221 and histidine 64.  The [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Kcat/Km|k&lt;sub&gt;cat&lt;/sub&gt;]] value is 0.005% of the original [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzyme]].  Thus, the result of using the site-directed mutagenesis shows that the serine-histidine pair makes a nucleophile that has the capability to attack the carbonyl carbon atom in the [[Structural Biochemistry/Organic Chemistry/Important Organic Reactions in Biochemistry/Peptide Bonding|peptide bond]]. Site-directed mutagenesis can be used to change particular base pairs in a piece of DNA. There are a number of methods for achieving this. The approach described here is adapted from the Stratagene site-directed mutagenesis kit, the manual can be found here. Even when using a kit it will be necessary to design primers that are suitable for the specific changes you want to make to your DNA. Most of the contents of the kit can be found in your favorite labs stocks so you may not need to buy the kit itself. If you have problems with this procedure, you can try 'Round-the-horn site-directed mutagenesis which uses PCR to amplify the desired mutant product. 


[[image:Subtilisin catalytic power graph.jpg|thumb|The bar graph shows the amount of catalytic power when each of the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Catalytic Triad|catalytic triad]] is converted into alanine.  As seen above, both serine 221 and histidine 64 account for similar amount of catalytic power unlike aspartic acid 32.]]


[[Structural Biochemistry/DNA recombinant techniques/Mutagenesis|Mutagenesis]] has been used in terms of DNA recombinant technique.

      <text xml:space="preserve">THE MUSCULAR SYSTEM

==Fundamental Components of muscles==

Muscle cells consist of myofibrils which are in turn made up of repeating subunits called sarcomeres. Sarcomeres each contain two Z-bands which make up the walls of the sarcomere to which the actin molecules are connected. In between each pair of actin bands is a myosin molecule. When the sarcomere contracts, myosin and actin pull the two z bands closer together shortening the overall length of the sarcomere. The distance that the sarcomere is capable of contracting is called the I band, and is the space in between the z-band walls of the sarcomere, and the start of the myosin molecules.

When muscles are stressed i.e. exercise, the number of sarcomeres and myofibrils in each myocyte are increased, instead of the myocyte numbers themselves. This leads to a stronger contractile strength for each individual myocyte with out increasing the overall cell population.

==Muscle Types==

[[File:Illu muscle tissues.jpg‎|thumb|Muscle Types]] 

There are three main muscle types: cardiac, smooth, and skeletal.

Cardiac: Only found in the heart and works involuntarily throughout the human body. These muscles are controlled by the medulla oblongata, which is located at the lower section of the human brain. The heart cells come in long strips with a single nucleus in each cell. They are located at the walls of the heart.  Their main function is to propel blood into circulation. Contraction of the cardiac tissue is caused by an impulse sent from the medulla oblongata to the SA nerve located at the right atrium of the heart.

Smooth: Work involuntarily. Our internal organ muscles are mostly made up of smooth muscles, such as the stomach-hyper link, throat-hyper link, and small intestine-hyper link. Maintains homeostasis in our body. only the heart is not a smooth muscle. Smooth muscles are spherical in shape and contain one nucleus.

Skeletal: Also known as striated muscle tissue. The structure involves a parallel network of fibers of actin and myosin and the formation of actin myosin crossbridges. The movement of skeletal muscle is described by sliding filament theory in which actin filament slide against myosin heads during the process of contraction. Energy is induced from the ATP released by myosin heads when they slide against the actin filaments, changing its conformation from &quot;cocked&quot; to its &quot;resting&quot; state. This process is also known as powerstroke. When calcium level is high in the sarcoplasmic reticulum and ATP is available, contraction of muscles continues. Work voluntarily for our body. They are the muscles that move the bones and show external movement. Skeletal muscles contain multiple nuclei, which account for their large size. Skeletal muscle cells also contain multiple nuclei in order to synthesize actin and myosin efficiently. They measure up to several feet in length.

==Muscle-Bone interaction==
Skeletal muscles do not work alone. When muscle is attached to the skeleton, the connection will determine the force, speed, and range of movement, which is produced by contraction of a muscle and modified by attaching the muscle to a lever. A lever is a rigid bar, such as the bone, that moves on a fixed point called fulcrum. Each bone is a lever, and each joint is a fulcrum. The fulcrum helps to support the lever. Levers can change the direction of applied force when body in exercise, the distance and speed of movement affected by the force, and the effective strength of the applied force. Therefore, the movement of the muscle is based upon the type of joint. Joint helps skeleton muscles to expand or contract the muscles.

==Myosin-actin interactions underlying muscle fiber contraction==
(1) The myosin head is bound to ATP and is in its lower-energy configuration
(2) The Myosin head hydrolyzes ATP to ADP and inorganic phosphate and is in its high-energy configuration
(3) The myosin head binds to actin, forming a cross-bridge
(4) Releasing ADP and an inorganic phosphate, myosin returns to its lower-energy configuration, sliding the thin filament
(5) Binding of a new molecule of ATP release the myosin head from actin, and a new cycle begins

==Function of Myosin and the Powerstroke==

Important structural domains of myosin include the motor region, the lever, and the tail.  Heavy chain subunits form the major structural units of the motor region, lever and tail, with light subunits working to stabilize the major components of the myosin functional unit.  Each of the over 35 myosin subclasses has minor structural variations on this theme, but in most cases, the light chains simply serve to stabilize the structure.  

As its name suggests, the motor function confers the mobility to the myosin motor domain and is involved in forcibly moving the lever domain.  Regions that bind actin are divided by a cleft, that when closed, initiates a strong bond with actin elements.  During an active powerstroke, the myosin changes from an up conformation to a down conformation.  A central region dubbed the transducer region strained under certain conditions and a relaxation of this strain contributes to the generation of the powerstroke.  

The sequence of the powerstroke involves several steps.  First, the myosin head binds to the actin filaments, then the conformational shift from up to down is accomplished, then a phosphate group is released, triggering a return to the up conformation. ATP can be hydrolyzed only in the up conformation, a step that leads to lever priming and firing.  The conformational shift of the lever that forms the basis of the powerstroke is thought to be the rate-determining step, a process that does not occur when there has been no bind to actin.

==Skeletal Muscle Contraction==
(1) Aceylcholine are released at synaptic terminal diffuses across synaptic cleft and binds to receptor proteins 
(2) Action potential is propagated along plasma membrane and down T tubules
(3) Action potential trigger calcium ions to be released from the sarcoplasmic reticulum
(4) Calcium ions bind to troponin complex in thin filament
(5) Proteins bound along the actin strands shift position
(6) Myosin binding site exposed
(7) Myosin cross-bridges alternately attach to actin and detach, pulling thin filament toward center of sarcomere; ATP powers sliding of filaments
(8) Cytoslic calcium ion is removed by active transport into sacoplasmic reticulum after action potential ends
(9) tropmyosin blockage of myosin-binding sites is restored
(10) contraction ends, and muscle fiber relaxes

==How Muscles work==

Bones interact with muscles through tendons.  Movement happens when muscles contract and pull the attached bones to bend joints.  Vertebrates have three kinds of muscles:

'''Skeletal muscles''' are also called striated muscles.  They are associated with the skeletal system and are primarily involved in voluntary movement.  A vertebrate has conscious control over these muscles.  Each skeletal muscle cell contains many nuclei.  They make up the bulk of muscle in the body and constitute about 40% of total body weight. They are responsible for positioning and moving the skeleton. Skeletal muscles are usually attached to bones by tendons made of collagen. The origin of a muscle is the end of the muscle that is attached closest to the trunk or to the more stationary bone. The insertion of the muscle is the more distal or more mobile attachment. 

When the bones attached to a muscle are connected by a flexible joint, contraction of the muscle moves the skeleton. If the centers of the connected bones are brought closer together when the muscle contracts, the muscle is called a flexor, and the movement is called flexion. If the bones move away from each other when the muscle contracts, the muscle is called an extensor, and the movement is called extension. Most joints in the body have both flexor and extensor muscles, because a contracting muscle can pull a bone in one direction but cannot push it back. Flexor-extensor pairs are called antagonistic muscle groups because they exert opposite effects. 

Muscles function together as a unit. A skeletal muscle is a collection of muscle cells, or muscle fibers, just as a nerve is a collection of neurons. Each skeletal muscle fiber is a long, cylindrical cell with up to several hundred nuclei on the surface of the fiber. Skeletal muscle fibers are the largest cels in the body, created by the fusion of many individual embryonic muscle cells.

The fibers in a given muscle are arranged with their long axes in parallel, and each skeletal muscle fiber is sheeted in connective tissue. Groups of adjacent fibers are bundled together into units called fascicles. Collagen, elastic fibers, nerves, and blood vessels are found between the fascicles. The entire muscle is enclosed in a connective tissue sheath that is continuous with the connective tissue around the muscle fibers and fascicles and with the tendon holding the muscle to underlying bones.    

'''Smooth muscle''' is found in the walls of the internal organs.  These organs include the stomach, intestines, and urinary bladder.  It is an involuntary muscle.  Although skeletal muscle has the most muscle mass in the body, cardiac and smooth muscle are more important in the maintenance of homeostasis. Smooth muscle is found predominantly in the walls of hollow organs and tubes, where its constriction changes the shape of the organ. Often smooth muscle generates force to move material through the lumen of the organ. For example, sequential waves of smooth muscle contraction in the intestinal tract move ingested material from the esophagus to the colon. 

Smooth muscle is noticeably different from striated muscle in the way it develops tension. In a smooth muscle twitch, contraction and relaxation occur much more slowly than in either skeletal or cardiac muscle. At the same time, smooth muscle uses less energy to generate a given amount of force, and it can maintain its force for long periods. By one estimate, for example, a smooth muscle cell can generate maximum tension with only 25~30 % of its crossbridges active. 

In addition, smooth muscle has low oxygen consumption rates yet can sustain contractions for extended periods without fatiguing. This property allows organs such as the bladder to maintain tension despite a continued load. It also allows some smooth muscles to be tonically contracted and maintain tension most of the time. The esophageal and urinary bladder sphincters are examples of tonically contracted muscles whose function is to close off the opening to a hollow organ. These sphincters relax when it is necessary to allow material to enter or leave the organ. 

Until recently, smooth muscle had not been studied as extensively as skeletal muscle for many reasons:
1. Smooth muscle has more variety.
2. Smooth muscle anatomy makes functional studies difficult.
3. Smooth muscle contraction is controlled by hormones and paracrines in addition to neurotransmitters.
4. Smooth muscle has variable electrical properties.
5. Multiple pathways influence contraction and relaxation of smooth muscle. 

'''Smooth Muscle vs. Skeletal Muscle'''
Smooth muscles are small, spindle-shaped cells with a single nucleus, in contrast to the large multinucleated fibers of skeletal muscles. In neurally controlled smooth muscle, neurotransmitter is released from autonomic neuron varicosities close to the surface of the muscle fibers. Smooth muscle lacks specialized receptor regions such as the motor end plates found in skeletal muscle synapses. Instead, the neurotransmitter simply diffuses across the cell surface until it finds a receptor. 

Most smooth muscle is single-unit smooth muscle (unitary smooth muscle), so called because the individual muscle cells contract as a single unit. Single-unit smooth muscle is also called visceral smooth muscle because it forms the walls of internal organs (viscera), such as blood vessels and the intestinal tract. All the fibers of single-unit smooth muscle are electrically connected to one another, so an action potential in one cell will spread rapidly through gap junctions to make the entire sheet of tissue contract. Because all fibers contract every time, no reserve units are left to be recruited to increase contraction force. Instead, the amount of calcium that enters the cell determines the force of contraction. 

Multi-unit smooth muscle consists of cells that are not linked electrically. Consequently, each individual muscle cell must be closely associated with an axon terminal or varicosity and stimulated independently. This arrangement allows fine control of contractions in these muscles through selective activation of individual muscle cells. As in skeletal muscle, increasing the force of contraction requires recruitment of additional fibers. 

Multi-unit smooth muscle is found in the iris and ciliary body of the eye, in part of the male reproductive tract, and in the uterus except just prior to labor and delivery. Interestingly, the multi-unit smooth muscle of the uterus changes and becomes single-unit during the final stages of pregnancy. Genes for synthesis of gap junction connexin proteins turn on, apparently under the influence of pregnancy hormones. The addition of gap junctions to the uterine muscle cells synchronizes electrical signals, allowing the uterine muscle to contract more effectively while expelling the baby.

'''Cardiac muscle''' makes up the heart.  These muscles are also involuntary and can contract without stimulation from the nervous system. Cardiac muscle shares features with both smooth and skeletal muscle. Like skeletal muscle fibers, cardiac muscle fibers are striated and have a sarcomere structure. However, cardiac muscle fibers are shorter than skeletal muscle fibers, may be branched, and have a single nucleus (unlike multinucleate skeletal muscle fibers). As in single-unit smooth muscle, cardiac muscle fibers are electrically linked to one another. The gap junctions are contained in specialized cell junctions known as intercalated disks. Some cardiac muscle, like some smooth muscle, exhibits pacemaker potentials. In addition, cardiac muscle is under sympathetic and parasympathetic control as well as hormonal control.  

Muscles can be thought of as participators in the nervous system.  Nerves will send messages to muscles through voluntary impulse or involuntary instinct.  Muscles take these messages and convert them into movement by either contracting or relaxing.

==Neuromuscular junction of skeletal muscles==
Skeletal muscles have neuromuscular junctions, which is a synapse of an axon terminal of a motorneuron. The NMJ is responsible for the movement of action potentials across the neurons to initiate a physical reaction from the muscles. 
The process begins with the release of acetylcholine from synaptic vesicles of an alpha motor neuron into the synaptic cleft. Vesicles containing acetylcholine fuse to the cell membrane, and by exocytosis, releases the chemical. Acetylcholine then diffuses throughout the synaptic cleft, and binds to acetylcholine receptors that are located on the motor end plate. These are nicotinic receptors, and are ligand-gated ion channels which means they respond when a ligand binds to it. The binding of the acetylcholine signals the opening of the channels, and sodium ions flow in while potassium ions flow out. This results in a neuron depolarization, which spreads across the muscle fiber's t-tubules. The depolarization causes activates voltage gated calcium channels (dihydropyridine receptors) in the T tubule membrane. Dihydropyridine receptors interact with calcium-release channels (ryanodine receptors) in the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This causes a release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, which is the holding cell for calcium. The release of calcium results in a muscle contraction when calcium binds to troponin of skeletal muscle.
Enzymes called acetylcholinesterase degrade acetylcholine by hydrolysis and the neurotransmitter is diffused away. This causes the ligand gated receptors to close.

==Regulation of Skeletal Muscle Contraction==
When signaled to, a synaptic terminal nearby the muscle fiber releases Acetylcholine (ACh) into the synaptic cleft. This neurotransmitter binds to receptor proteins on the muscle fiber’s plasma membrane, creating an action potential. This action potential is sent along the membrane and down through T tubule found on and within the membrane. The action potential triggers the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) to release Ca2+ into the cytosol of the muscle. This occurs when the plasma membrane depolarizes and an action potential sweeps along the membrane, the depolarization moves into the T-tubules and activates integral membrane proteins that are confined to T-tubule membranes in skeletal muscle fibers. The activated proteins are called dihydropyridine receprots (DHP receptors), which mechanically interact with particular proteins in the membranes of the sarcoplasmic reticulum. These proteins in the membranes of the ER are called ryanodine receptors. 

These ryanodine receptors are Ca2+ channels that when activated by DHP receptors, open and allow Ca2+ to diffuse out of the SR and into the cytoplasm, where it can bind to troponin. Within the myofibril, the calcium ions bind to the troponin complex, causing the tropomyosin, which is covering the mysosin binding sites, to shift, and thus exposing the myosin binding sites of the thin filament. With the aid of ATP, the myosin is able to form cross-bridges by binding to the actin. The attachment and detachment from the actin cause the sliding of the filaments, and thus the contraction of the muscle. When the motor input stops, and it is time for the muscle to relax, the filaments slide back to their original positions, with the tropomyosin blocking the myosin binding sites. The calcium ions are pumped back into the SR by transport proteins. The calcium ions accumulate in the SR until it is needed to respond to the next action potential.

Once the Ca2+ is able to bind to the troponin on the muscle fibers, the &quot;sliding filament&quot; theory takes place. This theory describes the mechanism of muscle contraction. In this theory, the myofilaments slide past one another when myosins bind to actins and &quot;row&quot; along the thin filaments (actin). When a myosin is bound to actin, the hinge between the head and the straight rod of the myosin molecule bends, which in turn releases ADP and Pi. As a result of this bending, the myosin molecule pulls itself along the actin, but actins are bound to Z-lines, so when an actin moves along myosins, they pull the Z-lines toward one another, shortening the sacromere, leading to contraction of the entire muscle as a whole. When the muscle is to relax, ATP attaches to the myosin head again, which breaks the thin filament to thick filament bonds. ATP binding is therefore the basis for relaxation of muscles. 

The bound ATP is hydrolyzed to ADP and Pi, returning the hinge between the head and the rod of the myosin back to its original conformation, continuing the cycle of muscle contraction and relaxation. At any one time, many myosin heads are attached to each actin filament. The amount of tension that is exerted during a contraction is proportional to the number of connectons between actin and myosin heads. 

The unitary response of a muscle fiber to stimulation is called a twitch (a brief contraction). A twitch occurs in response to a depolarization of the muscle membrane, either in response to electrical stimulation or as the result of and excitatory post-synaptic potential it the neuromuscular junction. These twitches sum to produce long, strong contractions at their tetanus points. As the frequency of a stimulation increases, the frequency of twtiches increases up to a maximum. Each summed twitch increases the magnitude of contraction because the elastic properties of the muscle are not sufficient to allow the muscle to return to resting length in the time between twitches. The maximum contraction in which there is no time for relaxation between stimuli is called tetanus. Therefore, the strength of a whole muscle contraction depends on the number of fibers in a muscle, because more fibers will bring a stronger contraction, the number of neurons that are active, and the frequency of contractions.

Summary of Muscle Contraction
Mechanism

When an action potential reaches the neurotransmitter junction, Acetylcholine gets released into the synaptic cleft. This results in the opening of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors and entrance of sodium ions. An action potential is generated in the T-tubule, then calcium is released from sarcoplasmic reticulum. This marks the step where contraction occurs.

Highlights

Calcium is removed by calcium pumps that pump the ion back into the sarcoplasmic reticulum. This is when relaxation occurs.
T-tubule contains voltage gated protein channels that open in response to depolarization. 

Sarcoplasmic reticulum has several calcium channels which open when there is stimulation by T-tubules. In addition, it contains many calcium pumps that maintain a high concentration of calcium inside the cell so that ions are able to flow out during the process of contraction. The flow of calcium activates troponin, which stimulates a power stroke and results in sarcomere contraction. 

There are two types of contractions:

A- Isotonic contraction which occurs when the muscle contraction is equal to the load on muscle. For example, when you lift an object and hold it in place.
B- Isometric contraction which occurs when the load on muscle exceeds the force of contraction. For instance, when you try to lift a very heavy object (the muscle contracts at a maximum rate)

==Oxidative and Glycolytic Fibers==
'''Oxidative fibers''' rely mostly on aerobic respiration. It is made this way to make sure a steady energy supply. It has many mitochondria, a rich blood supply, and a large amount of hemoglobin.
'''Glycolytic fibers''' uses glycolysis as their primary source of ATP. It has a larger diameter and less myoglobin than oxidative fibers and it fatigue much more readily. 

==Fast Twitch and Slow Twitch Fibers==
'''Fast-twitch fibers''' are used for brief, rapid, powerful contractions. Fast-twitch fibers are made up of white muscles, which depend on anaerobic glycolysis for energy. Although glycolysis is very quick, it is also inefficient at producing ATP. Glycolysis produces lactic acid as a byproduct, which leads to fatigue. The use of glycogen cycle is the reason why fast-twitch muscles tire out quickly. 
'''Slow-twitch fibers''' are used to maintain posture. A slow fiber has less sarcoplasmic reticulum and pumps calcium more slowly than a fast fiber. Since calcium remains in the cytosol longer, a muscle twitch in a slow fiber lasts about five times as long as one in a fast fiber. Slow-twitch fibers are usually found in the red muscles. The red muscles use oxidative phosphorylation to obtain ATP. Oxidative phosphorylation occurs in the red muscles because the process requires a lot of oxygen, and the red muscles contain high amounts of myoglobin. The process is  slower than glycolysis, but much more efficient, which is why slow-twitch muscles do not tire easily. 
Although it is still being debated, scientists believe that individuals are born with a set amount of fast-twitch fibers and slow-twitch fibers. Sprinting everyday will not convert some of the slow-twitch muscle into fast-twitch muscle, and vice versa. Marathon runners become marathon runners because they naturally have more slow-twitch fibers, allowing them to be effective in the sport. Likewise, sprinters are born with more fast-twitch muscles than others. Although this may be true, exercise can make both fast and slow-twitch muscles bigger, leading to better fitness results.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Palmitoylation is the covalent attachment of deprotonated fatty acid  palmitic acid to a cysteine residue on a membrane protein. Palmitoylation has many different functions in proteins. For instance, it functions as membrane attachment regulation, intracellular trafficking, and membrane micro-localization. 

Specifically, S-palmitoylation refers to the reversible thioester linkage, or bond between the sulfide on the cystine to the electron rich oxygen of the palmitate. N-palmitoylation is similar, however, when the cystine is located on the N-terminus of the protein, the palmitate temporarily bonds with the sulfur, like in S-palmitoylation, and then quickly binds to the amide of the cystine for stability. (4) 

Palmitoylated cystines share a few common features that narrow which cystines will and will not be palmitoylated such as: they are located in the cytoplasimc region, exposed in a peptide sequence so that they can be easily palmitoylated; they are sequenced next to or closely by hydrophobic or basic amino acids; they are often, but not exclusively, adjacent to prenylation and myristoylation sites. (5) 

Once a membrane protein contains a palmitate, the membrane protein can interact with other lipids and proteins in new ways, effectively altering some of the proteins functions such as intracellular sorting, membrane interactions, stability, and membrane micropatterning. (5) Palmitoylation enhances the hydrophobicity of proteins and contributes to their membrane association. Interestingly, S-palmitoylation is a reversible process, which allows for unique and complex modes of trafficking between membrane compartments. (4) This is in contrast to prenylation and myrisoylation, which are not irreversible. The specific function of palmitoylation depends on the particular protein being considered.

Palmitoylation also appears to play a significant role in subcellular trafficking of proteins between membrane compartments, as well as in modulating protein-protein interactions. The specific location of where palmitoylation occurs gives insight into what proteins are palmitoylated and for what reasons. A location with high amounts of palmitoylation occurring takes place near the golgi, where peripheral membrane proteins are palmitoylated. In post golgi compartments, specific substrates are palmitoylated for the purpose of regulation. (5)

==Palmitoylation in Action==
An example of a protein that undergoes palmitoylation is hemagglutinin, a membrane glycoprotein used by influenza to attach to host cell receptors. 

Since S-palmitoylation is a dynamic, post-translational process, it is believed to be employed by the cell to alter the subcellular localization, protein-protein interactions, or binding capacities of a protein.

The palmitoylation cycles of a wide array of enzymes have been characterized in the past few years, including H-Ras, Gsα, the β2-adrenergic receptor, and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS).

Another example of proteins that undergo palmitoylation is the cell’s ion channels. Throughout an ion channels life cycle, palmitoylation plays a crucial role in controlling and regulating its signaling pathways. From assembly of the ion channel to the recycling and degradation of the it, palmitoylation is controlled by the family of acyl palmitoyltransferases and a particular number of thioesterases. The NMDA receptors are palmitoylated at the golgi to keep these proteins anchored to the goli whereas palmitoylation of calcium- and voltage-activated potassium channels contributes to their cell-surface delivery. This demonstrates how dynamic and unique palmitoylation is, occurring at the same location for different proteins but with considerably different results. (6)

==Palmitoylation in Synaptic Plasticity==
Recently, scientists have appreciated the significance of attaching long hydrophobic chains to specific proteins in cell signaling pathways. A good example of its significance is in the clustering of proteins in the synapse. A major mediator of protein clustering in the synapse is the postsynaptic density (95kD) protein, PSD-95. When this protein is palmitoylated it is restricted to the membrane. This restriction to the membrane allows it to bind to and cluster ion channels in the postsynaptic membrane. 
Also, in the presynaptic neuron, palmitoylation of SNAP-25 allows the SNARE complex to dissociate during vesicle fusion. This provides a role for palmitoylation in regulating neurotransmitter release.

==DHHC Palmitoyl Transferases==

Internal cellular palmitoylation reactions are monitored by a palmitoyl transferase known as aspartate-histidine-histidine-cysteine, or more commonly known as DHHC. Researches have indicated that there are approximately 20 DHHC proteins that are present in mammalian genomes and have proven that they are crucial in cell function and physiology and pathophysiology influence.

Studies regarding yeast have established interesting characteristics of the DHHC protein family. For one, some DHHC proteins require protein cofactors. Second, DHHC play a very important role in cellular activity. Moreover, DHHC palmitoyl transferases are mobile to specific intracellular membranes. More precisely, the DHHC-CR domain is a prominent feature of palmitoyl transferases, and genes that are associated with DHHC proteins are found in organisms from yeast to humans. Approximately seven DHHC proteins are relevant for yeast organism, whereas more than 20 DHHC genes are discovered for mammalians. Most of the mammalian DHHC proteins have the tendency to catalyze palmitoylation independently of other protein cofactors.

There is not sufficient amount of data that has proven that DHHC proteins have achieved their respective intracellular localizations. However, a general scope of analysis has shown that a removal of a phenylalanine residue in the C terminus of DHHC21 repositions the proteins from the Golgi to ER membranes. Furthermore, mutations that occur at the 16-amino acid motif in the C terminus of DHHC proteins of yeast organisms cause a mis-localization from the vacuole membrane to the lumen. Protein degradation is based on the yeast vacuole functionality in the sense that there is consistency in the decreasing expression levels of mutant protein.
The analysis of DHHC proteins and their presence in cellular palmitoylation can be seen in the systematic experiment of S.cerevisae where a proteomic investigation of substrate palmitoylation profiles in deficiency in DHHC yeast strains imply a substrate selectivity. For instance, depletion in Akr1 led to an enormous downfall in palmitoylation of Yck1 and Yck2. Furthermore, it caused a removal of palmitoylation of Meh11, Yp199c, and Yk1047w. Conclusively, this experimental study has underlie that individual yeast DHHC proteins express a preference towards specific substrates (Akr1 target were soluble proteins that are exclusively palmitoylated; Erf2 substrates had a tendency to be modify by myristoyl or prenyl groups; and Swf1 contained a preference for cysteine residues.

Protein binding assays have determined locations of palmitoylated substrates that communicate with DHHC proteins. Studies have shown that short, minimal sequences from palmitoylated proteins process effective palmitoylation when expressed in cells. Even though yeast genetic studies have indicated characteristics that substrates are affiliated with the modifications of DHHC protein, this cannot be said about mammalian proteins. This is due to the fact that there is a lack of data that show the substrate interactions performed on mammalian DHHC substrates. Thus, DHHC protein-substrate specificity is a subject that is hard to generalize and contain many undeveloped areas of research.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Created for Man
The first place the words “seventh day” occurs, denoting a set apart period of created time by Yahweh in the scriptures, is in Genesis 2:2-3. The word “Sabbath” from the Hebrew verb Shabbat, means &quot;to rest from labor&quot;, the day of rest.
 
&quot;And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had made; and He rested on the seventh day from all the work which He had made. Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made. This is the history of the heavens and the earth when they were created, &quot;    Genesis 2: 2-4

Shabbat’s (the Sabbath) origins go back to creation, Genesis 2:1-3, where God worked for six days then rested on the seventh day. As with much of what the Bible presents to us,  Shabbat is a foreshadowing,  a reflection or picture of what exists in heaven and what those who follow Yahweh will enjoy one day in its heavenly spiritual reality on earth.

The Sabbath came into being as a final crowning part of the act of Creation. It was set apart at creation for the benefit of mankind.  The Sabbath (Shabbat) is a day of rest.

A Specific Creation
All the seasons, months, days and years are based on the movement of planetary bodies in relation to one another and to the sun.  The week of seven days has no such cycle or basis for existence related to our solar system, other than in the book of Genesis based on Yahweh's specific determined order of creation.  The “week” of seven days and the seventh day Sabbath of the week, is His personal creation solely for man and His purposes for man,  and it has no other basis for its existence, as do the days, the months and the yearly cycle.

The day is created by the revolution of the earth with its 24 hour cycle being determined by the length of time of that revolution, with day being created by the part of the earth that faces the sun receiving light, and night by that in darkness.

The months are created by the movement of the moon in its orbit around the earth of approx. twenty-nine and a half days.
The length of the year is established by the orbit of the earth around the sun, whereby also the seasons are created by the tilt of the earth's axis, but as stated there is no basis for a seven day week.

Yahweh ordered the work of creation, restoring it from chaos to order, completing it in six pre-determined days, setting aside a final seventh day for rest. He then finished His creation on the Seventh Day . 

God does not change.  Therefore, serenity and tranquility are part of His attributes.  On the Seventh Day, Yahweh added tranquility and harmony to the world.  It was no longer in the process of change, and so the creation and man partook of Yahweh's serenity, and became &quot;Holy and Blessed&quot;.

The Sabbath thus was able to partake of God's timelessness,  it became the Day of Eternity (Exodus 31:17). The Hebrew word Shabbat (Sabbath) is related to the word shevet - to dwell;  on the Sabbath, Yahweh made the world His dwelling-place.

The Sabbath is Holy
Since the Sabbath itself was &quot;created&quot; at the end of creation, when man was created, and was &quot;blessed&quot; and &quot;sanctified&quot; by Yahweh, and not any other day, He alone has the prerogative to choose and decide that day to be holy,   The Sabbath  is the day of Yahweh.   &quot;If you turn away your foot from the sabbath, from doing your pleasure on My holy day;&quot;    Isaiah 58:13-14

The Sabbath was made &quot;HOLY&quot; at creation-- not some 2,500 years later, during the time of Moses when Yahweh brought the nation of Israel out of Egypt and gave them the 'law' . Being made &quot;holy&quot; at the creation of man, it's ordinance therefore precedes the 'law' and is not solely for Israel, but for all mankind.

Yahweh blessed the Sabbath day and set it apart  - &quot;sanctified&quot; it from all other days!  This is a clear statement that the Sabbath is &quot;HOLY&quot; -- or &quot;sanctified.&quot;  (Genesis 2:3)

No other days are holy, but His designated Sabbath days! 
The only regular day of the week the Most High ever made holy is the seventh day.   No matter how hard we try, we cannot make another day holy to suit our lifestyle, because holiness is not dependent on our determinations.   Holiness is solely dependent on His determination. Many believers have thought to make certain religious days holy by the force of their celebration on that day.   

No person can choose any day they wish to celebrate the Shabbat, because it is only the seventh day has been made holy. Celebration of the Sabbath rest on any other day is a man-made invention and has no validity. 
There is not one place in the Bible where anything is holy, except that called holy by the mouth of the “I AM”, the Almighty One. Since He is holy, then the experience of keeping His Shabbat is holy. As we experience His Holy, set apart Day, then we enter into His set-apart holy experience of spiritual rest. All other commandments require our efforts to enter into them and be holy. On the Sabbath, when we rest, it is God that makes us holy: &quot;You shall keep My Sabbaths . . . that you may know that I am Yahweh, who makes you holy&quot; (Exodus 31:13).

Hebrews 4:9 says,  “There remains a Sabbath for the people of God.” 

The Sabbath an Example
God's Sabbath rest was a divine example for the benefit of man. 
Yahweh set Himself, on the seventh day of creation, as the ultimate example.   He rested from all His work, giving us an example to follow, a pattern for His creation.   How can we ignore this ultimate example?
God did not rest because He was tired, but rather to appreciate His work.   The rest of the Sabbath is a time-frame He allotted to punctuate a completed assignment of establishing the order of life for planet earth.   &quot;And God saw everything that He had made, and indeed it was very good.&quot; (Genesis 1:31)
This was not the end of all work undertaken by the Almighty, but an interim to enjoy that which He had made. As Y'shua said, &quot;My Father has been working until now,  and I have been working.&quot; John 5:17

Does the Creator no longer want to have His creation appreciated?

The Shabbat is rest from the labor of creative processes.   Because He stopped creating on the Sabbath, we stop also. When our mind and hands have stopped creating we have the time and ability to appreciate what has been created, especially by the Creator.  Only then are we are experiencing something He experienced. It is His ultimate intention for us that we enter into His joy, as He says &quot;My elect shall long enjoy the work of their hands&quot;, -  in His Millennial Sabbath  (Isaiah 65:22d)

The Intended Purpose
Seeing the Sabbath is a basic part of creation, specifically given for the benefit of man, keeping the Sabbath is for our benefit.   It is a demonstration of our Father God's love, and is intended as a partaking of His blessing.  If we do really love Yahweh, we will desire to spend time with Him and it will not be a burden, rather we should want to spend time with Him!

When Y'shua taught that, “The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath” (Mark 2:27), He was teaching that it is not intended as a legalistic observance with burdensome rules, but  a set-aside time of willing devotion.  It is for the benefit of man, to be taken advantage of.  Y'shua's words do not point back to the “Ten Commandments.”   They pointed to the original purpose and will of the Father in creating the Sabbath for the benefit of humanity in rest and refreshing. 

The natural man thinks that the keeping of the seventh day is not important,  because he cannot discern with his five senses why it would make any difference to keep one day above another.  But, &quot;the natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God: for they are foolishness unto him: neither can he know them, because they are spiritually discerned&quot; (1 Cor. 2:14).  

The spiritual man does not reason as to why it is important. The spiritual man knows that the Sabbath is most assuredly one of &quot;the things of the Spirit of God&quot; because He instituted it;  and that is its importance.

Keeping the Sabbath can cause blessings or adversity.  This is what the Bible teaches when it promises good things (&quot;blessings&quot;) for keeping the Sabbath and bad things (&quot;curses&quot;) for breaking it. (as with all His commandments)
We may not always see how the blessings or curses are the result of our having kept or broken the Sabbath, but there is an unseen spiritual dimension to life.  The spiritual man knows that his actions in the physical realm affect the unseen angelic and demonic powers that are at work in the spiritual realm, and we will reap according to either our obedience or our disobedience.

His Ordained Pattern
The New Testament teaches in Hebrews 8-10 that the earthly Tabernacle with its priesthood and worship was a &quot;shadow,&quot; patterned after a Tabernacle that exists in the heavenly realm, with its priesthood and worship.

God has a pattern for worship, and since the first week of Creation, that pattern has included the 7th day of the week as the Sabbath.   Some believe that the Sabbath is only a &quot;shadow,&quot; an outward symbol of the inward rest of the soul that Y'shua promised.   It is a shadow of the spiritual life,  but if one cannot keep it in the natural, there will not be a reality of it in the
spiritual.  The principle is, &quot;first the natural, then the spiritual&quot; (1 Corinthians 15:46)

If a person cannot cease from their own works for one day, then they will not live a surrendered lifestyle that has ceased from following one's own desires in fulfilling one's own works the other six days.   By keeping the Sabbath we consecrate a day to abstain from all self-interest and self-motivation and enter into His Sabbath rest.

This knowledge should motivate us to step into that shadow and enjoy its fruits by keeping the Sabbath.  The shadow has a solid reality behind it in the spiritual realm.  When we step into that shadow, our soul steps into the spiritual reality which is casting the shadow.  As the Bride says of the Bridegroom in the Song of Solomon, &quot;I sat down under his shadow with great delight, and his fruit was sweet to my taste&quot; (2:3)

Evidence of the Sabbatic Order before the Flood
The weekly cycle of seven days signified by the Sabbath, was clearly known from the beginning of humankind. Cain and Abel brought their offerings at the “end of days”, (literal translation) probably referring to the Sabbath (Genesis 4:3).  Noah and his sons enter the Ark precisely seven days before the flood commences (Genesis 7: 4, 10). Later when the flood is over, he sends out the doves over a period of several weeks, following the same seven-day weekly cycle (Genesis 8:10,12).
This evidences the fact that the weekly cycle of seven days was known to them as a pattern to follow.

Throughout the world the same seven-day weekly cycle has been known, from ancient to modern times.   From linguistic studies there is evidence that from ancient times the Sabbath was known in most major language groups. Hundred of languages actually name the seventh day with some derivative of the Hebrew word “Shabbat”. 

In Assyrian it is sabatu;  In Persian shambid;  In the Caucasus region samat;  In Central Africa assebatu;  In Hungary szombat; Abyssinia sanbat; Java saptu; Afghanistan shamba; Malta issibt; Turkey essabt; Borneo sabtu;  In Arabic assabt.  Even the Romance languages of Europe, though eventually Christianized, still maintain this ancient “Jewish” designation for Saturday, the seventh day;  Latin sabbatum;  French samedi;  Italian sabbato;  Romanian sambata. 

Yahweh reminds Isaac that Abraham was chosen because “He kept my commandments, my statutes and My laws” Gen. 26: 5.    See also Gen.18:19 - He not only kept the way Himself, but also ordered his household in the ways of Yahweh.
Although they did not know the Torah in the detailed form in which it was given to the nation of Israel later, they did understand the righteous way of life, which involved the ordained principles of Yahweh, which would have involved keeping all His ordained principles and that included Shabbat, since it was ordained in the beginning.  Genesis 18:19

Therefore the keeping of Shabbat is not intrinsically limited to the Mosaic Covenant, but it had been ordained long before Sinai. This is even evidenced in the very wording of Exodus 20:8 for the fourth commandment, “Remember--- the Sabbath .. .. ..”   - this admonition to &quot;remember&quot; indicates prior knowledge which had possibly been forgotten or set aside during the hard labour under the Egyptians.

The Mosaic covenant was a written contract between Yahweh and the nation of Israel of their agreement to His principles, statutes, testimonies and laws.   It set out that which the patriarchs had known and lived by, in an extended form for the whole nation. It established for them a standard of rule, law and authority, as against that which they had been subjected to under the Pharaohs.  But it was not new!   
His appointed times and seasons were understood from the beginning.Therefore the concept that the seventh day has been annulled and set aside by the establishment of the new covenant is invalid, as it was not instituted though Moses,  but rather began to be observed by Adam and continued by the godly line.

It is keeping the Sabbath on the seventh day according to His decree,  not on the first day of the week, that will bring the blessing and healing that His Body needs. God blesses and uses His people, even though they do not keep the Sabbath. 

He blesses and uses people in spite of their flaws and ignorance when it is not a result of willful rebellion.   He can and does bless His people every day. However,  there are some specific blessings which can be received only by stepping into the shadow of Yahweh's specifically appointed times.   He promises to those who will keep His Sabbath,
&quot;Even them will I bring to My holy mountain, and make them joyful in My house of prayer.&quot;

&quot;Then you shall delight yourself in Yahweh; and I will cause you to ride upon the high places of the earth, and feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father:  for the mouth of Yahweh has spoken it.&quot;   Isaiah 56: 7; 58:14

There are two basic concepts in all the accounts regarding the Sabbath, and they are,
To remember it,  and, 
To guard or keep it holy.

Each Sabbath day, week by week, we are brought together in a worldwide spiritual fellowship and solidarity that stretches back to Eden and forward to the coming Kingdom when the whole world will experience His true Sabbath rest and peace.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== TOPOFIT ==

The TOPOFIT method analyzes protein structures using three-dimensional Delaunay triangulation patterns derived from backbone representation. Structural related proteins have been found to have a common spatial invariant part, a set of tetrahedrons, mathematically described as a common spatial sub-graph volume of the three-dimensional contact graph derived from Delaunay tessellation (DT). Due to this property of protein structures, a novel common volume superimposition (TOPOFIT) method is presented to produce structural alignments of proteins. The superimposition of the DT patterns allows the common number of equivalent residues to be objectively identified. In other words, TOPOFIT identifies a feature point on the RMSD/Ne curve, a topomax point, until which two structures correspond to each other including backbone and inter-residue contacts, while the growing number of mismatches between the DT patterns occurs at larger RMSD (Ne) after the topomax point. The topomax point is present in all alignments from different protein structural classes. Therefore, the TOPOFIT method identifies common, invariant structural parts between proteins. The TOPOFIT method introduces new opportunities for the comparative analysis of protein structures and for more detailed studies on understanding the molecular principles of tertiary structure organization and functionality. This helps to detect conformational changes, topological differences in variable parts, which are particularly important for studies of variations in active/binding sites and protein classification.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Institution of the Sabbath
&quot;And on the seventh day God ended His work which He had done, and He rested on the seventh day from all His work which He had done.  Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it, because in it He rested from all His work which God had created and made.&quot;   Genesis 2:2, 3   NKJV

The Hebrew word translated &quot;and He rested&quot; in verse 2 comes from the root shabat (Eng. &quot;Sabbath&quot;), which later became the official name for the seventh day of the week. The word &quot;sanctified&quot; in verse 3 comes from the root qadash, which literally means &quot;to set apart as holy.&quot; 
The first place the word &quot;Sabbath&quot;  (from the Hebrew verb shabbat, meaning &quot;to rest from labor&quot;; the day of rest)  is used for the seventh day,  is in Exodus 16:23.

Re-Affirmation of the Sabbath to Israel
During the time of slavery in Egypt, the Sabbath was either abrogated or disallowed,  and/or the importance of it and its spiritual significance lost to the people. When they came out of Egypt it was re-instituted after the Red Sea crossing.

When Yahweh gives instruction regarding the gathering of manna, provision for the sabbath is included.   This gives us a very strong indication that the Sabbath may even have been kept beforehand by those who were faithful to the covenant made by the fathers.   At this time it became mandatory during the exodus for the whole nation before they came to Sinai and entered into covenant with Yahweh.  It was in existence therefore before the &quot;law&quot; (the Torah).

&quot;This is what Yahweh has commanded: 'Tomorrow is a day of solemn rest, a holy Sabbath to Yahweh; bake what you want to bake and boil what you want to boil, and all that is left over put aside to be kept until morning.'&quot;  Exodus 16:23 
&quot; So the people rested on the seventh day.&quot;   Exodus 16:19  NKJV  
As the previous passage clearly shows, the &quot;law&quot; being referred to in verse 4 is the command to keep the Sabbath holy.

&quot;Then Yahweh said to Moses, &quot;Behold, I will rain bread from heaven for you. And the people shall go out and gather a certain quota every day, that I may test them, whether they will walk in My law or not.&quot; (NKJV)    Exodus 16:4

The Sabbath command was codified by its inclusion in the Ten Commandments given to the Israelites by Yahweh Himself when the Israelites reached Mount Sinai,  but was already being observed,  exactly like the other Commandments.   It was a well-known principle.   It was generally understood to be a part of His plan for humanity.  

&quot;Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days shall you labor and do all your work,  but the seventh day is the Sabbath of Yahweh your God.   In it you shall do no work: you, nor your son, nor your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your cattle, nor your stranger who is within your gates. For in six days Yahweh made the heavens and the earth, the sea, and all that is in them, and rested the seventh day.  Therefore Yahweh blessed the Sabbath day and hallowed it.&quot; (NKJV)

God's Sabbaths were so important to Him that He made their observance a separate covenant with Israel after His initial covenant with them at Sinai  (Exodus 24:8).  The &quot;Sabbath Covenant&quot; was instituted in Exodus 31:13-17
'Surely My Sabbaths you shall keep, for it is a sign between Me and you throughout your generations, that you may know that I am Yahweh who sanctifies you.  You shall keep the Sabbath, therefore, for it is holy to you.   Everyone who profanes it shall surely be put to death; for whoever does any work on it, that person shall be cut off from among his people.  Work shall be done for six days, but the seventh is the Sabbath of rest, holy to Yahweh.   Whoever does any work on the Sabbath day, he shall surely be put to death.   Therefore the children of Israel shall keep the Sabbath, to observe the Sabbath throughout their generations as a  perpetual  covenant.   It is a sign between Me and the children of Israel forever; for in six days Yahweh made the heavens and the earth, and on the seventh day He rested and was refreshed.' &quot; (NKJV) 

That which is &quot;perpetual&quot; is eternal -- i.e. not a temporary covenant.  This is not the &quot;Old Covenant,&quot; which is passing away, according to the apostle Paul (Heb.8:13).   The Sabbath itself is A PERPETUAL, ETERNAL, EVERLASTING COVENANT which identifies the true people of Yahweh!    See also Exodus 20:12
It is a sign between Yahweh and His people &quot;FOREVER!&quot; 

By making it a perpetual covenant which they observed every week, they would always remember that they were a special set-apart people to God.   It was a weekly reminder that their God was the only true God, the One who had created all things. Therefore, the command to observe it is repeated many times: In Exodus 34:21;  35:2; Leviticus 23: 3; Deut. 5:12-17 etc.

The Codified Instruction of Yahweh
These Ten “Words,” or &quot;ten commandments&quot; as they are called, are much more than mere “commandments” which one might view in a superficial or legalistic way.   Each represents a topical heading, an entire Way of living, broken down into logical categories, e.g.,  idolatry, human sexuality, property rights, the sacredness of life, human speech, and so forth. 

They are amplified and expanded throughout the Scriptures.This fourth commandment is not some minor statute or ordinance to be changed or abrogated with the passing of time as the ten commandments are a codified instruction on His principles, and He never changes. It is an essential part of the Testimony and every bit as important, and as universal, as the commandments regarding murder, idolatry, or adultery. To our human way of thinking this statement sounds extreme and even absurd. But Yahweh's “thoughts” are not our “thoughts” (Isaiah 55:8).  (Breaking the Sabbath incurred the death penalty, as did murder and adultery.)

Paul, said,  &quot;Wherefore the law is holy, and the commandment holy, and just, and good&quot;   Romans 7:12. 
The Sabbath, we already saw in Genesis 2:1-3, is &quot;holy&quot; to Yahweh. It was made holy, or &quot;sanctified,&quot; at creation. Here Paul says the entire Law of Yahweh is &quot;holy,&quot; &quot;just,&quot; or fair, equitable, and &quot;good.&quot; There is nothing evil or bad about Yahweh's Law -- or, for that matter, His Sabbath day. It is PERFECT!  As David wrote, &quot;The law of Yahweh is Perfect&quot;

Since Yahweh's Law is just, and good, and holy, and perfect, including the Sabbath law -- should we break it?   To do so, would mean we are guilty of transgression -- SIN -- &quot;And the wages of sin are death&quot;     Romans6:23 

John tells us  &quot;Whosoever commits sin transgresses also the law: for sin IS the transgression of the law&quot;    I John 3:4. 
This is the definition of &quot;SIN.&quot;  Sin is the transgression, that is, the breaking and violation of -- &quot;the law&quot; of Yahweh! 

Since the Law tells us what sin IS, and the Law tells us to remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy, then to VIOLATE this commandment would constitute SIN -  i.e.  transgressing the law! 
Every time people break Yahweh's Sabbath day,  they are committing SIN!

The apostle James puts it this way: &quot;For whosoever shall keep the WHOLE LAW, and yet offend in one point&quot; -- such as the point of the Sabbath -- &quot;he is guilty of all&quot;   James 2:10
 
James goes on, describing what law he is talking about -- the Ten Commandments,  which includes the Sabbath.   
&quot;For he that says,  Do not commit adultery, said also, Do not kill. Now if you commit no adultery, yet if you kill, you are become a transgressor of the law&quot;  (James 2:11). 

Or, to put it another way, if you do not steal, but if you break the Sabbath day commandment, then you have broken one point of Yahweh's Law, and you are guilty of breaking the whole thing -- the whole system of law -- and are designated as a &quot;transgressor of the law&quot;! 

We must be DOERS of the Law!  faith without works, we are told, is dead (James 2:17).    See also James 1:22-25

Y'shua prayed that the family of God would be sanctified (consecrated, dedicated, set apart) by keeping His commandments.   In John  14:15, 17:1-4, 17 it is written,  &quot;If ye love me, keep my commandments&quot;. 
&quot;And this is life eternal, that they might know thee the only true God, and Jesus Christ, whom thou hast sent.  I have glorified You on the earth: I have finished the work which You gave me to do, sanctify them through Your truth: Your Word is truth.&quot;

When Y'shua prayed in John  17:17 that the family of the God of Israel would be sanctified through the Word of God which He called truth,  He was quoting Psalm 119:142 
&quot;Your righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and Your law (Torah) is the truth.&quot; 
The commandments given at Sinai which was the law, was the Word of God.

Y'shua testified that he did not come to abolish the Father's law, but to bring it into its fullness.  (Matt.5:17).  He added, &quot;Whosoever therefore shall break one of these least commandments and shall teach men so, he shall be called the least in the kingdom of heaven .. .. .. &quot; (Matt.5:19-20). 
It is those who do His commandments that have a right to the tree of eternal life  (Rev.22:12-15). 
    
Judgment for Breaking the Sabbath
&quot;Six days you shall labor and do all your work,  but the seventh day is a Sabbath to Yahweh your God. On it you shall not do any work, neither you, nor your son or daughter, nor your manservant or maidservant, nor your ox, your donkey or any of your animals, nor the alien within your gates, so that your manservant and maidservant may rest, as you do.  Remember that you were slaves in Egypt and that Yahweh your God brought you out of there with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm.  Therefore Yahweh your God has commanded you to observe the Sabbath day&quot;.   Deuteronomy 5:12 (NIV) 

In Deuteronomy 29 Moses warned God's people that if they disobeyed the commandments, they would go into exile.  The people disobeyed and went into exile. The Sabbath was not the only command they had disobeyed, but it was specifically mentioned by the Prophets as one of the major reasons for the foreign conquests and captivity. Isaiah had pleaded with them to keep the Sabbath. (See chapters 56 &amp; 58.)  Jeremiah told them Jerusalem would be spared if they would quit breaking the Sabbath.   (Jeremiah 17:1 9;  2 Chronicles 36:19 &amp; Jeremiah 25: 9-12)  

After they went into exile, Ezekiel was told to &quot;cause them to know the abominations of their fathers&quot; (Ezekiel 20:3; 22:2; 23:36).    One of the abominations that Ezekiel discussed at length was their refusal to keep the Sabbath, which, he reminded them, had been given to be a sign between God and His people.

&quot;Her priests have violated My law, and have profaned My holy things,&quot; Yahweh said through His prophet.  &quot;They have put no difference between the holy and profane, neither have they showed difference between the unclean and the clean, and have hid their eyes from My sabbaths, and I am profaned among them.&quot; (Ezekiel. 22:26)
 
&quot;Moreover, I gave them My Sabbaths, as a sign between Me and them, that they might know that I am Yahweh who sanctifies them. &quot;But the house of Israel rebelled against me in the wilderness: they walked not in my statutes, and they despised my judgments, which if a man do, he shall even live in them; and my sabbaths they greatly polluted:  then I said, I would pour out my fury upon them in the wilderness, to consume them.&quot;   Ezekiel 20:12-13 

&quot;But I said unto their children in the wilderness, Walk ye not in the statutes of your fathers, neither observe their judgments, nor defile yourselves with their idols:  I am Yahweh your God; walk in my statutes, and keep my judgments, and do them;  And hallow my Sabbaths; and they shall be a sign between Me and you, that ye may know that I am Yahweh your God.&quot;  Ezekiel 20:18-20;   See also Chapter 22:8; 23:38

The Reward of Shabbat
&quot;'If you turn away your feet from the Shabbat and from doing as you please on my holy day, and call the Shabbat a delight, the holy day of Yahweh honorable,  and if you honor Him,  not doing your own ways,  nor finding your own pleasure,  nor speaking your own words,  then you will delight (oneg) yourself in Yahweh,  and I will cause you to ride on the high hills of the earth,  and feed you with the heritage of Jacob your father.'  The mouth of Yahweh has spoken.&quot;    Isaiah 58:13,14.

&quot;Delight yourself in Yahweh and He will give you the desires of your heart,&quot; Psalm 37:4.

Everyone wants to know how to get the Most High to give them the desires of their heart.   Delighting in Yahweh is the way to receive that. What does it mean 'to delight in'  -   only one revelation of what this means is found in the Scriptures.

&quot;Delight&quot; here in Psalm 37:4 is the Hebrew word 'oneg', which is defined &quot;to treat as a delicacy.&quot;   There are very few places in the Scriptures where the word 'oneg' is used.  There is one place, and only one, where it tells us exactly how to delight in Yahweh, even using the word 'oneg'.   The only place where we are told what delighting in Him is, is in Isaiah 58:13, 14.  The only way we are told to delight in Yahweh is to honor and obey the seventh day Sabbath.  The reward for doing this is &quot;to ride on the heights of the land and to feast on the inheritance&quot; of Jacob.    

Spiritual high places and  ...  ....  ...  to enter our spiritual inheritance!
It is sealed as a promise from &quot;the mouth of Yahweh.&quot;   And that promise,  as it says in Psalms 37:4,  is to receive the &quot;desires of your heart&quot;.   In other words,  if you make His Sabbath a delight (oneg),  a delicacy in your life,  you will receive the desires of your heart.    The desires of your heart will be centred on spiritual things if you are delighting yourself in Yahweh, and the heritage of Jacob is to have spiritual authority with Yahweh to inherit those blessings.

The pre-requisite for attaining this state of delighting in Him is to cease from doing your own pleasure, seeking your own ways and speaking your own words.    To cease from your own works as God did from His.   This is entering into the spiritual rest of Yahweh wherein you are able to call the Sabbath a delight and honour Him on His day.

By the providence of our Heavenly Father we have a weekly ordained appointment, a time with our Beloved, a time to rejoice in Him and savour the delight of His love for us.    

A time made free of other commitments to enter the banqueting house and hear the voice of our Beloved saying to us  -  &quot;Rise up, my love, my fair one, and come away!&quot;  (S.Songs 2:14)  -   to rise up to the mountain tops where we can be hidden in the cleft of the Rock and behold His glory and see His face.
And know -  that &quot;My Beloved is mine, and I am His&quot;   -    I have ceased from my own works and have entered into His rest,  and My Beloved has come to make His abode with me.   (S.Songs 2:16 &amp; John 14:23; 17:24)  

This is the heritage of those who &quot;reign in life through the One,  Y'shua the Messiah&quot;    Romans 5:17

      <text xml:space="preserve">=='''Acetylation'''==

Acetylation introduces an [[w:acetyl|acetyl]] group to a molecule. More specifically, the reaction replaces a hydrogen from an alcohol group with an acetyl. An example is the synthesis of [[w:aspirin|aspirin]] from [[w:salicylic acid|salicylic acid]]:
[[Image:Aspirin_synthesis.png|right|thumb|Aspirin synthesis]]

Acetylation is an important post-translational protein modification and regulation. An example is the acetylation/deacetylation of [[w:histone|histone]] which subsequently express/inhibit genes since histone binds to DNA itself. [[w:Histone Acetyltransferase|Histone Acetyltransferase]] catalyzes the acetylation of lysine from the histone tail with an acetyl group from [[w:Acetyl CoA|Acetyl CoA]].

The acetylation of lysine in histone removes the positive charged ammonium group and renders the side chain neutral, which decreases the histone tail affinity for DNA and loosens the histone complex.

The now-acetylated histone can interact with an [[w:acetyllysine|acetyllysine]]-binding domain in many eukaryotic proteins called [[w:bromodomain]], an 110 amino acids protein with a four-helix bundle and a peptide-binding site at one end.



{{BookCat}}

Acetylation is the reaction in which an acetyl functional group is added to an organic molecule. In proteins, an acetyl group to either added to the N-terminus of proteins and at lysine residues as a post-translational protein modification.

'''N-alpha-Terminal Acetylation'''

The role of N-alpha-Terminal Acetylation is still relatively unknown and under research. However, it is known that this modification is actually widely prevalent in eukaryotes and yeast, though uncommon in prokaryotes, and is performed by a subgroup of acetlytransferases known as N-alpha-acetyltransferases (NATs). There are three major NATs (A,B,C) which perform the majority of the N-alpha-terminal acetylations of eukaryotes The reaction is begun with the cleaving of N-terminal methionine residues with small side chains containing, glycine, alanine, serine, cysteine, threonine, proline, and valine, by  methionine aminopeptidases (MAP), Map1p and Map2p. Subsequently, the NATs recognize and acetylate specific sequences of the cleaved proteins. 

'''Lysine Acetylation'''

One major area in which lysine acetylation is prevalent is in the acetylation of histones, which is performed by histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and deacetylases (HDACs). In both acetylation and deacetylation reactions that attach to the NH3+  tail from an acetyl group from Acetyl-Coenzyme A and remove the acetyl group from lysine onto Coenzyme A, respectively. The acetylation and deacetlyation of histones partake in gene regulation. Histones are packages of strongly alkaline protein around which DNA is wound to allow DNA to be stored in an orderly fashion. Since the acetylation occurs at the NH3+ tail of lysine, the charge of the protein is affected. When acetylated, the positive charge of lysine is eliminated. This decreases the histones affinity to the negatively charged DNA strand, thereby loosening the strand, and the reverse results occur with deacetylation. However, Lysine acetylation isn’t limited to histone acetylation. Among other things, it is also involved in the modification and regulation of non-histones such as cytoplasmic enzymes and p35, a tumor suppressor and involved with signal transmittance and signaling.

==Drug Acetylation==
Many of the drugs used today for common diseases require additional structuring in order for efficient metabolism in the body. Drugs that are significantly metabolized by acetylation include isoniazid, hydralazine, procainamide, phenelzine, and dapsone that are used to treat tuberculosis, cardiac failure/hypertension, ventricular arrhythmias, depression, and leprosy/skin infections respectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Capillary Exchange==

Capillary exchange is where an exchange between blood and extracellular fluid occurs. It contains small precapillary spincters by the ateriole end:
- When spincters are relaxed, there is more blood flowing through the capillary bed.
- When spincters are contracted, there is less blood flowing through the capillary bed.
- Constriction and dilation also impact capillary blood flow.

Hydrostatic pressure tends to be higher inside the capillary at the arteriole end and lower at the venous end. This causes fluid to move out of the capillaries at the arteriole end. On the other hand, osmotic pressure tends to be lower outside of the capillary at the arteriole end and higher at the venous end. This causes the fluid to enter the capillaries again at the venous end. The plasma proteins creates osmotic pressure and are unable to pass through the capillary wall, making the blood more concentrated. 

==Blood Composition==

Erythrocytes (red blood cells)
- Erythrocytes do not have any type or organelles. They transport oxygen and carbon dioxide and use glycolosis for metabolism. They look like a flat biconcave disk, which maximizes the surface area to increase diffusion of gases. Their life span is 3-4 months and a spherical shape is observed when they are ready to die.

Leukocytes (white blood cells)
There are different kinds of white blood cells:
Lymphocytes: play a role in defense and immunity, responsible for the production of antibodies
Monocytes: also participate in defense and immunity
Eosinophils: respond to allergic reactions
Neutrophils: fight infections and are usually inert
Basophils: participate in the secretion and storage of histamine

Platelets (fragments which trigger blood clotting)
Blood clotting is an example of a positive feedback loop. It is a mechanism that converts prothrombin to thrombin which in turn converts fibrinogen to fibrin. The main requirement for this mechanism is the presence of vitamin K and calcium.

Plasma (The plasma is made up of ions, plasma proteins, nutrients, water, hormones, and respiratory gases. The proteins found in the plasma include albumin, fibrinogen, and immunoglobulins).

==Respiratory System Function==

*The respiratory system's function is to allow gas exchange to all parts of the body. The space between the alveoli and the capillaries, the anatomy or structure of the exchange system, and the precise physiological uses of the exchanged gases vary depending on the organism. In humans and other mammals, for example, the anatomical features of the respiratory system include airways, lungs, and the respiratory muscles. Molecules of oxygen and carbon dioxide are passively exchanged by diffusion between the gaseous external environment and the blood. This exchange process occurs in the alveolar region of the lungs.

*Muscle action changes the volume of the rib cage and the chest cavity, and the lungs match these volume changes. The inner layer of the lung's double-walled sac adheres to the outside of the lungs, and the outer layer adheres to the wall of the chest cavity. A thin space filled with fluid separates the two layers. Because of surface tension, the two layers are like two plates of glass stuck together by a film of water: The layers can slide smoothly past each other, but they cannot be pulled apart easily. surface tension couples movement of the lungs to movement of the rib cage.

*Lung Volume increases as a result of contraction of the rib muscles and the diaphragm, a sheet of skeletal muscle that forms the bottom wall of the chest cavity. contraction of the rib muscles expands the rib cage by pulling the ribs upward and  the breastbone outward. At the same time, the chest cavity expands as the diaphragm contracts and descends like a piston.All these changes increase the lung volume, and as a result, air pressure within the alveoli becomes lower than atmospheric pressure. Because gas flows from a region of higher pressure to a region of lower pressure, air rushes through the nostrils and mouth and down the breathing tubes to the alveoli. During exhalation, the rib muscles and diaphragm relax, lung volume is reduced, and the increased air pressure within the alveoli forces air up the breathing tubes and out of the body.

==A More in Depth look at the Anatomy of the Respiratory System==

*The main purpose of breathing is in fact to simply supply the body with sufficient oxygen and remove excess amounts of Carbon Dioxide. The process of respiration can be observed at two levels, one large and one small. At the lungs (large level), gas exchange occurs through the process of breathing. At a more cellular level (small level), oxygen performs its role of transforming the food we eat into must needed energy, producing carbon dioxide as a certain by-product. 

[[Image:Right-nasal-airway-passage.jpg]]

==The Nose==

*The picture above gives a detailed look at the nose. It is important to note that the nose is not simply a passageway to our throat, but that the nose is a critical aspect of the skull that provides and extensive passage array with inner walls covered by mucus. These walls are supplied with heat-radiating blood vessels. As a matter of fact, the nose can be looked at as an air-conditioner that prepares prepares the air before being taken into the lungs. There are three processes that occur when air is brought in through the nose, which include warming, filtering, and humidifying. 

*Warming: The air is warmed by blood vessels, so that it is always at the right temperature before entering the lungs. As labeled on the figure above, the three turbinates (superior, middle, and inferior), serve a critical function in the nose: They are shelves at the side of the nose that warm inhaled air before it enters the lungs. They are also covered by millions of cilia that defend the body against irritants in the inhaled air. They seem to enlarge when someone catches a cold, but no matter how trouble these turbinates may cause, it is crucial not to just get rid of them. 

*Filtering: The dust particles taken in are trapped by tiny hairs in the nose in addition to mucus, so that the air is rather clean when taken into the lungs. The nasal septum, as shown above, actually separates the left and right airways of the nose, dividing the two nostrils that are involved throughout nose filtering. 

*humidifying: The air is 100% humidified by the mucus in the nose. After these three processes occur, the &quot;treated&quot; air is passed through the lungs and into the trachea. 

==The Bronchial Tubes==

*The inner lining of the bronchial tubes is a membrane called the bronchial mucosa. In terms of function, these tubes carry air into the tiny branches and smaller cells of the lungs after the air has passed through the mouth, nasal passages, and windpipe (trachea). There exists a layer of smooth muscle which is capable of contracting, thus producing airway narrowing. Mucus glands inside the layers of the bronchial tubes can produce a large amount of thick mucus when stimulated. 

==The Alveoli (Site of gas exchange)==

[[image:Alveolus diagram.svg]]

*At the end of the small bronchioles exist millions of air sacs or alveoli. They have large gas space in between with thin blood space provide surface area and is also necessary for air to diffuse. This is explained by the ratio between surface area to volume ratio where when dividing large area into small volumes, the surface area increases. In addition, the thin membrane allow for better diffusion. In a way that is easier to understand, these air sacs can compared to grapes hanging off a stem. The one cell thick walls of the alveoli allow oxygen and carbon dioxide to pass through. Outside the lungs exist a network of air sacs called capillaries which also have walls one cell thick. The alveoli contain oxygen rich air, but carbon dioxide depleted air. The blood in the capillaries, however, contain more carbon dioxide than oxygen. Gas tries to equalize pressure levels, as oxygen passes into the carbon dioxide rich capillaries. At the same time, carbon dioxide passes from the blood and into the alveoli. This allows for gas equilibrium. The next step involves the exit of carbon dioxide through exhalation. This particular gas exchange occurs at the large (lung) level. Oxygen is then bound to hemoglobin in the bloodstream, as it travels from the lungs to the heart. Hemoglobin then performs its role of being a very efficient oxygen carrier, as it is pumped throughout the body supplying oxygen to oxygen-depleted tissues and muscles. 

==The Second Level (Cellular Gas Exchange)==

*In contrast to the large (lung) level, tissue cells have high levels of carbon dioxide and low levels of oxygen. Though the process of equilibrium is the same, the tissue cells use oxygen to make energy and as a result, carbon dioxide and water are produced. They pass from the cell to the bloodstream and oxygen enters to produce energy. This particular gas exchange cycle repeats more than 60 times a minute at both large and small levels.

[[File:Action potential propagation animation.gif|thumb|The propagation of an action potential.]]

The nervous system is a network of specialized cells that coordinate the actions of an animal and send signals from one part of its body to another. These cells send signals either as electrochemical waves traveling along thin fibers called axons, or as chemicals released onto other cells. The nervous system is composed of neurons and other specialized cells called glial cells (plural form glia).

In most animals the nervous system consists of two parts, central and peripheral. The central nervous system contains the brain and spinal cord. The neurons of the central nervous system are interconnected in complex arrangements and transmit electrochemical signals from one to another. The peripheral nervous system consists of sensory neurons, clusters of neurons called ganglia, and nerves connecting them to each other and to the central nervous system. Sensory neurons are activated by inputs impinging on them from outside or inside the body, and send signals that inform the central nervous system of ongoing events. Motor neurons, situated either in the central nervous system or in peripheral ganglia, connect neurons to muscles or other effector organs. The interaction of the different neurons form neural circuits that regulate an organism's perception of the world and its body and behavior.

Nervous systems are found in most multicellular animals, but vary greatly in complexity. Sponges have no nervous system, although they have homologs of many genes that play crucial roles in nervous system function, and are capable of several whole-body responses, including a primitive form of locomotion. Radiata, including jellyfish, have a nervous system consisting of a simple nerve net. Bilaterian animals, which include the great majority of vertebrates and invertebrates, all have a nervous system containing a brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nerves.

A human nerve cell is composed of various components: the soma, or cell body (which has a nucleus), the axon (by which nerve signals travel), the myelin sheath, which provides conductivity and allows electrical signals to travel through nerve cells, dendrites, which receive signals from other nerve cells, and axon terminals, which nerve cells use to communicate with each other via the release and binding of neurotransmitters.

Neurons communicate with each other using neurotransmitters, which travel across synapses (the space between axon terminals of one nerve cell and the dendrites of another nerve cell) and bind to their appropriate receptors. However, inter cellular communication between nerve cells depends on action potentials, which are voltage differences across membranes. Action potentials are initiated by the movement of charged ions, such as potassium and sodium, across the cell membrane through voltage dependent ion gates. These gates are opened by binding of neurotransmitters to post-synaptic cells. Thus, when a neurotransmitter binds and causes the voltage dependent ion gates to open, ions flow across the membrane, causing a voltage difference which results in an action potential.

These action potentials travel along the axon, and axon terminals and dendrites allow these potentials to move through various nerve cells. Action potentials function on the all or nothing principle. In other words, if a particular stimuli or neurotransmitter concentration does not reach required levels, no action potential will occur. Thus, if a mosquito lands on your hand, you may not feel it because the pressure changed caused by the mosquito landing on you is not significant enough to generate an action potential. However, the pressure of, for example, a handshake, does, and therefore generates an action potential, causing you to feel the other hand. Under the all or nothing principle, action potentials either occur or they do not- an amplitude difference is irrelevant so long as the threshold for an action potential is reached. Instead, the varying feeling you get depends on the rate, or frequency, of action potentials. In other words, if someone threw a pencil at you, it would hurt less than if someone hit you with a car not because the amplitude of the action potential is higher when you are hit by a car, but because nerves are transmitting action potentials much faster.

The myelin sheath surrounding axons is critical to the propagation of action potentials. It essentially serves to maintain conductivity; without it, action potentials would travel much more slowly (so, for example, you would not be able to feel something hit you until after several seconds). This also improves efficiency and decreases the amount of energy required for nerve signaling. Multiple sclerosis is an example of disease caused by the degradation of the myelin sheath in nerve cells. The degradation of this sheath prevents nerve cells from communicating with each other by reducing the effect and velocity of action potentials. Because many important functions depend on a healthy nervous system, such as speech, movement, coordination, sensation, and vision, the degradation of the myelin sheaths can have a debilitating effect.

==Resting Potentials==
All neurons exhibit a resting membrane potential which is the membrane potential of a resting neuron. Recall the definition of electricity, there is a voltage difference between the inside of the neuron and the extracellular space. The difference, resting potential, is usually about -70 mV between inside and outside of the neuron. However, the system then would want to equilibrate to 0 mV. Neurons use selective permeability to ions and the Na+/K+ ATPase to maintain a negative internal environment.
The neuron also has a plasma membrane that is fairly impermeable to charged species. Ions are unlikely to cross the non-polar barrier, because it is energetically unfavorable. Inside the neuron, the concentration of potassium ion is high and concentration of sodium ion is low. Outside of the neuron has the opposite condition. The negative resting potential is generated by both permeability of the membrane to potassium ion compared with sodium ion. If potassium ion is more permeable and its concentration is higher inside, it will diffuse down its gradient out of the cell. In terms of charge movement, potassium ion is positively charged, so its movement out of the cell results in a cell interior that is negative. If we assume that the membrane starts at zero, and we take away a positive one, we end up with a negative one on the inside of the cell. Sodium ion cannot readily enter at rest, so the negative potential is maintained. 

The Na+/K+ ATPase is important for restoring the gradient after action potentials have been fired. They transport three Na+ out of the cell for every two K+ into the cell at the expense of one ATP with a Na+/K+ pump. ATP is qualified as active transport. Each time the pump works, it results in the inside of the cell becoming relatively more negative, as two positive charges are moved in for every three that moved out. 

'''''Are neurons the only cells with the resting membrane potential?'''''&lt;br /&gt;
No. All cell have the resting membrane potential. Neurons and muscle tissues are unique in using the resting membrane potential to generate action potentials.

'''Modeling of the Resting Potential'''&lt;br /&gt;
• Resting potential can be modeled by an artificial membrane that separates two chambers:  &lt;br /&gt;  --1.The concentration of KCl is higher in the inner chamber and lower in the outer chamber. &lt;br /&gt;  --2.  K+ diffuses down its gradient to the outer chamber. &lt;br /&gt; --3. Negative charge builds up in the inner chamber.&lt;br /&gt;
• At equilibrium, both the electrical and chemical gradients are balanced.&lt;br /&gt;
• The equilibrium potential (Eion) is the membrane voltage for a particular ion at equilibrium and can be calculated using the Nernst equation:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
'''Eion = 62 mV (log[ion]outside/[ion]inside)'''&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
• The equilibrium potential of K+ (EK) is negative, while the equilibrium potential of Na+ (ENa) is positive.&lt;br /&gt;
• In a resting neuron, the currents of K+ and Na+ are equal and opposite, and the resting potential across the membrane remains steady.

==Neurons, types of neurons, and supporting cells==
Neurons are the cell of the nervous systems. Neurons carry electrical signals and communicate with each other via junction called synapse. Neurotransmitters, mainly hormones (epinephrine), are chemical that is released at synapse. Neurons uses membrane potention. The resting neuron membrane potential is -70mV. A neuron is composed of a soma - the cell body, and lots of dendrites. There are three types of neurons: Sensory neurons, interneurons, and motor neurons. Sensory Neurons is found in the Peripheral Nervous System. It communicates the signals from the external and internal environment to the Central Nervous System. Interneurons can only comminucate between neurons. It is found in the Central Nervous System. It integrates signals and synapse with other neurons. Motor neurons carry out the signals from the Central Nervous System out to the effectors. 
Glial cells are supporting cells. Types of glial cells are astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, scwhwann cell,and myelination. Astrocytes are soociated with capillaries bed. It prevents capillaries bed from leaking. It forms the barriers between the blood and the brain and there is great selectivity. Oligodendrocytes form insulating myelin sheath in the Central Nervous System. Schwann cell are insulating myelin sheath associated with axon, it is found in the Peripheral Nervous System. Myelination wrap around axons and serves as electrical insulation. Multiple Sclerosis is a disorder caused by the deterioration of the myelin sheath. 

  


==Action Potentials==
Action potentials are a means of communicating between neurons. An action potential is started when the membrane is depolarized to a certain threshold. Action potentials are all or none, so depolarizations that do not meet the threshold do not do anything for the neuron. The threshold is a point when the charge is -55 mV. The resting potential of a neuron, which is the charge at equilibrium, is around -70 mV. The threshold is 15 mV above the resting potential, and only when the cell depolarizes to this point will the action potential initiate. 
The action potential starts when voltage gated sodium channels are activated. These channels allow an influx of sodium. Potassium channels also open up, which causes an efflux of potassium ions. The efflux of potassium ions causes the membrane to hyperpolarize
(makes more negative) the cell. If the current of potassium exceeds the current of sodium, then the voltage of the cell returns to -70 mV, which is the resting potential. If the voltage increases past the threshold level, then the sodium current is larger than the potassium current. This induces a positive feedback, where more sodium channels are opened (slowly) from this effect, and even more sodium ions enter the cell. This sharp increase in the flow of sodium ions causes the cell to depolarize rapidly, which results in the cell “firing”, which produces an action potential. 
The rapid depolarization is ended when the sodium channels open all the way. This causes the membrane voltage to reach a maximum. The voltage shuts the sodium channels off, and the channels are inactivated. At the same time, the voltage opens voltage gated potassium channels. The result of these two actions is the repolarization of the membrane. As potassium ions leak out and sodium channels can no longer diffuse across the membrane, the cell is brought to its equilibrium potential.

==Various phase of the action potential==
An action potential consists of various phases. 
(1) At the resting potential, voltage-gated sodium channels are closed. Some potassium channels are open, but most voltage-gated potassium channels are closed.
(2) When the membrane depolarizes, some voltage-gated sodium channels open, allowing the influx of sodium ions. The sodium ion influx causes further depolarization, which more voltage-gated sodium channels will open, causing more sodium ions to flow in.
(3) Once threshold is reached, an action potential will occur. The positive-feedback cycles of opening of sodium channels depolarize the membrane rapidly
(4) Voltage-gated sodium channels will inactive after opening, stopping the influx of sodium ions. Voltage-gated potassium channels will open and potassium ions will flow out.
(5) The gated potassium channels eventually close, and the membrane potential returns to the resting potential.
(6) The refractory period is a result of the closing of the sodium channels, which cannot be opened again until the refractory period is over.

[[File:Action potential.JPG|thumb|action potential.]]

==Postsynaptic Potentials==
Information transmitting occurs at the synapses. There are two types of synapses - Electrical synapses and Chemical synapses. At the electrical synapses, the electric current flows from one neuron to another neuron through gap junction. At the chemical synapses, chemical neurotransmitter carries the information through the synaptic cleft. 

==Central Nervous System==

The central nervous system consists of the brain and the spinal cord. The spinal cord is a long nervous tissue that extends along the vertebral column from the head to the lower back.  It is composed of many distinct structures working together to coordinate the body. The most important is the brain, which has several components:

The cerebrum is the largest portion of the brain and it controls consciousness.  It is in control of voluntary movement, sensory perception, speech, memory, and creative thought. 

The cerebellum helps to fine-tune voluntary movement, but is not directly involved in it.  It makes sure that movements are coordinated and balanced.

The brainstem is a part of the medulla oblongata and is responsible for the control and regulation of involuntary functions.  These functions include breathing, cardiovascular regulation, and swallowing. The medulla oblongata is needed to sustain life and processes a great deal of information.  

The hypothalamus is the source of posterior pituitary hormones and releasing hormones acting on the anterior pituitary. It is also responsible for homeostasis maintenance, which includes regulation of temperature, hunger, thirst, water balance, generation of emotion, as well as roles in sexual and mating behaviors. [[File:Cerebrum lobes.svg|thumb|cerebrum lobes]]

'''Brain'''

It is responsible for integration of sensory information, coordination of motor movement, and cognition. The myelination that we saw around axon is also present in the brain. Its presence allows us to distinguish between gray matter, which is unmyelinated, and white matter. The brain of all vertebrates develops from dividing it into the forebrain, the mid-brain, and the hindbrain. 

-Forebrain is the most recently acquired part of the CNS in terms of evolutionary development. It is further broken down into the telencephalon and diencephalon. Telencephalon consists of a pair of large left and right hemispheres that can be further sectioned into the frontal, parietal, occipital and temporal lobes. A group of structures located deep with the cerebrum that makes up the diencephalon. A large portion of the diencephalon is the cerebral cortex, a region of highly convoluted gray matter that can be seen on the surface of the brain. The cortex is responsible for the highest-level functioning in the nervous system, including creative thought and future planning. It also integrates sensory information and controls movement. Each hemisphere is independent, however, they do communicate through a large connection called the corpus collosum. 

-Midbrain serves as a relay point between more peripheral structures and the forebrain. It passes sensory and visual information to the forebrain, while receiving motor instructions from the forebrain and passing them to the hindbrain. 

-The hindbrain contains three “main structures” that are medulla oblongata, pons, and cerebellum. Together, they make the brainstem. Medulla oblongata is the most highly conserved part of the brain that is responsible for modulating ventilation rate, heart rate, and gastrointestinal rate. “The pons seems to serve as a relay station carrying signals from various parts of the cerebral cortex and cerebellum. The pons also participates in the reflexes that regulate breathing.” The cerebellum is a quality control agent that checks the motor signal sent from the cortex is in agreement with the sensory information coming from the body. It is what prevents us from falling over when we trip. It rapidly realizes that the motor signal to take a step was not successfully carried out, as we tripped. Instead of letting us fall on our faces, the cerebellum helps the cortex to adjust to the new situation so that we catch ourselves. 

'''The Spinal Cord'''

The spinal cord is divided into 4 distinct regions. These distinct regions in the spinal cord organize neurons segmentally. Within a single segment, neurons are grouped and located according to their function throughout the rest of the body. These four segments are the cervical region (8 segments), thoracic region (12 segments), lumbar region (5 segments), and the sacral region (5 segments). Each region is responsible for different parts of the human body. For example, the cervical region is responsible for controlling the arms and the lumbar region is responsible for controlling the legs. Axons usually enter the nerves near each segment in this innervated structure (e.g. fibers that innervate the arm run in the cervical spinal nerves while fibers that innervate the leg run in the lumbosacral spinal nerves). Sensory and motor neurons lie in separate portions of the spinal cord. In general, cells in the dorsal spinal cord and axons in the dorsal spinal nerves serve an afferent function (sensory fibers), while the cells in the ventral spinal cord and axons in the ventral spinal nerves serve as motor in function (efferent fibers). In specific, however, position of ascending pathways carrying fine touch, pressure, and information about the position of muscles and joints are found in the dorsal and lateral columns of each spinal segment. The dorsal column pathway runs on the same side of the spinal cord and crosses at the brain stem, goes through the medial lemniscus, and travels to the cerebral cortex. The position of fibers carrying pain information and pressure information are found in the anterolateral pathway. Information is carried in contralateral anterolateral tracts: the spinothalamic and spinoreticular tracts. Spinoreticular tract ends in the brain stem while spinothalamic tract ends in the thalamus. The anterolateral pathway crosses at the spinal cord and travels to the cerebral cortex. For motor information (efferent information), positions of descneding fibers are found in the dorsolateral and ventromedial columns. 

'''The Peripheral Nervous System'''

This system consists of a sensory system that carries information from the senses to the central nervous and then back to the body. Vertebrate PNS structurally consist of left and right pairs of cranial and spinal nerves and associated ganglia. The cranial nerves start from the brain and end mostly in organs of the head and upper body. The spinal nerves start in the spinal cord and spreads into parts of the body below the head. It also consists of a motor system that branches out from the central nervous system, so it targets certain muscles or organs.  The motor system can be divided into the somatic system and the autonomic system.   

'''The Somatic Nervous System'''

The ''somatic nervous system'' is responsible for voluntary movement. We described the interface between the neuron and muscle as the neuromuscular junction. Release of acetylcholine fom the nerve terminal onto the muscle leads to contraction. The acetylcholine binding to its receptor on the muscle ultimately leads to muscle depolarization. The somatic nervous system is also responsible for providing us with reflexes, which are automatic. They do not require input or integration from the brain o function. There are two types of reflex arcs: monosynaptic and polysynaptic. Reflexes usually serve a protective purpose. For example, we’d pull our hand away from a hot stove before our brain processes that it is hot.  

-Monosynaptic

In a monosynaptic reflex arc, there is a single synapse between the sensory neuron that received the information and the motor neuron that responds. An example will be the knee jerk reflex. When the patellar tendon is stretched, information travels up the sensory neuron to the spinal cord, where it interfaces with the motor neuron to contract the quadriceps muscle. The net result is a straightening of the leg, which lessens the tension to the patellar tendon. However, this reflex is responding to a potentially dangerous situation. If the patellar tendon is stretched too far, it may tear, damaging the knee joint. This reflex helps to protect us.  

-Polysynaptic

In a polysynaptic reflex arc, there is at least one interneuron between the sensory and motor neuron. An example will be your reaction to stepping on a tack, which involves the withdrawal reflex. The foot that steps on the tack will be simulated to jerk up (monosynaptic reflex). However, if we are to maintain our balance, we need out other foot to go down and plant itself on the ground. For this to occur, the motor neuron that controls the opposite leg must to be stimulated. Interneuron in the spinal cord provide the connection from the incoming sensory information on the leg being jerked up to the motor neuron for the supporting leg.

On the other hand, the ''autonomic system'' controls tissues other than skeletal muscles, such as cardiac muscle, glands, and organs.  This system controls processes that are involuntary, such as heartbeat, movements in the digestive tract, and contraction of the bladder.  Autonomic neurons are able to either excite or inhibit target muscles or organs.  This nervous system is subdivided into sympathetic division and parasympathetic division.  These 2 systems work antagonistically and usually have opposite effects.

'''The Autonomic Nervous System'''

The autonomic nervous system is a part of the peripheral nervous system that controls visceral functions. The autonomic nervous system affects heart rate, digestion, respiration rate, salivation, perspiration, diameter of the pupils, urination, and sexual arousal. Although most of this system's actions are voluntary, some actions, such as breathing, are involuntary. The autonomic nervous system is divided into the sympathetic nervous system and the parasympathetic nervous system. These two subsystems work together to produce homeostasis. Both subsystems are made up of a two-neuron chain between the central nervous system and the peripheral nervous system. 

In the sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems, pre-ganglionic neurons are in the central nervous system, but they synapse to post-ganglionic neurons in the peripheral nervous system. These post-ganglionic neurons will then synapse to the target cells.
 
In the sympathetic nervous system, the preganglionic transmitter is acetylcholine, and they bind to nicotinic cholinergic receptors on post-ganglionic cells. Post-ganglionic cells transmit nor-epinephrine, which bind to adrenergic receptors on target cells. The parasympathetic nervous system releases acetylcholine as well as the pre-ganglionic transmitter, and bind to nicotinic cholinergic receptors on post-ganglionic cells. The transmitter from these cells is acetylcholine, and they bind to muscarinic cholinergic receptors on target cells.

Increased activity in the sympathetic nervous system includes increase of heart rate, increase in blood pressure of smooth muscles, and decrease of gut motility. Parasympathetic activity decrease heart rate and increases gut motility.

'''Reflex Arcs'''

Occurs when a signal from the peripheral nervous system travels straight to another site in the body, triggering an involuntary reaction with the signal entering the central nervous system and traveling to the brain for processing before a reply signal is sent back. This results in a much faster reaction time and is typically used in situations where bodily harm is imminent.

 For example, when you pull your hand back after touching a hot surface, you don't have to think about it. In this case a reflex arc was activated allowing you to remove your hand from a damaging heat source faster, resulting in less damage to the cellular structure of your skin.

&lt;big&gt;Sympathetic Nervous System&lt;/big&gt;

The sympathetic nervous system controls the body's resources under stress, otherwise known as the fight-or-flight response. However, the sympathetic nervous system is constantly active in order to maintain homeostasis. An example would be that when heart beats faster, the liver would convert glycogen to glucose, bronchi of the lungs would expand to support increased gas exchange.

&lt;big&gt;Parasympathetic Nervous System&lt;/big&gt;

The parasympathetic nervous system controls activities that occur when the body is at rest such as salivation, lacrimation, urination, digestion, and defecation. It's actions are often described as &quot;rest and digest.&quot; It works in conjunction with the sympathetic nervous system to maintain homeostasis in the body. An example would be the increase activity in parasympathetic division decreases heart rate would increase glycogen production and enhance digestion.

What is Mental Inertia and what causes this symptom. It is the involuntary or the unwillingness to perform something. In the other hands, we can say it is slacking in people’s mind to think of something or come up with a plan. People usually call that in a normal way is laziness that is hidden somewhere inside each of us. And based on each person’s function, it will display different level of the laziness. Therefore, the immunity is also different. So when we can break this slacking and laziness, we can create the impulse. There are many types that that cause by mental inertia: 
-	By incorrectly established result
-	By adherence to a faulty technique
-	By the incorrect understanding of mechanism of action
-	By improper controls
Now we know what causes this symptom so we can find a way to overcome it. Here is just an example of how to overcome it. There are several ways to handle it. By mentally, try to see the result of our action and capture it. Then we will start moving to physically and let our brains follow the suit. We just try to start very slow to see the actual result from the small step. The most important thing is just believe in ourselves that we can do everything. It is very easy to break and control once we know how to overcome it.

==Nervous system disorders==

Depression is a disorder characterized by depression mood, for example, appetite, sleep and energy level.  There are two forms of depressive illness: major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder. Major depressive disorder maybe last many months with no pleasure and no interest. Bipolar disorder involves swings of mood form high to low and affects very rarely to people. 

Schizophrenia is a very rare yet severe mental disturbance characterized by psychotic episodes in which patients have a distorted perception of reality. People with this illness usually suffer from hallucination and delusions. 

Alzheimer’s disease is a mental deterioration, or dementia characterized by confusion and many other symptoms. This disease is progressive, with patients gradually becoming less able to function. The disease is mainly associated with the development of senility as a result of a buildup in β-ammyloid plaques.  However, the causes for the disease are not only genetically related, but they can stem from any damage to the axonal transport system which itself might arise from structural changes or even traumatic brain injury.  The resulting damage incurred into the axonal transport system has the potential for vesicles containing chemical precursors to build up and create damaging plaques, as is the case with Alzheimer’s disease.  Various other defects in axonal transport systems or mutations in gene coding can cause this neurodegenerative disorder. Which could lead to the death of neurons in many areas of the brain. 

Parkinson’s disease is characterized by difficulty in initiating movement and slowness of movement. Its symptoms result from the death of neurons in the midbrain. At present, there is no cure for Parkinson’s disease.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''&lt;big&gt;Prenylation&lt;/big&gt;''' ==


Prenylation, isoprenylation, or lipidation is the addition of [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Hydrophobic interaction|hydrophobic]] molecules to a protein. It is believed that prenyl groups (3-methyl-2-buten-1-yl) facilitate attachment to cell membranes [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids/Lipid Bilayer|membrane]], similar to lipid anchor like the GPI anchor, though direct evidence is missing. Prenyl groups have been shown to be important for protein-protein binding through specialized prenyl-binding domains.



Protein prenylation involves the transfer of either a farnesyl or a geranyl-geranyl moiety to C-terminal cysteine(s) of the target [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|protein]]. There are three enzymes that carry out prenylation in the cell.


----


&lt;big&gt;'''Farnesyltransferase and geranylgeranyltransferase I'''&lt;/big&gt;


Farnesyltransferase and Geranylgeranyltransferase I are very similar proteins. They consist of two subunits, the α-subunit which is common to both enzymes, and the β-subunit whose sequence identity is just 25%. These enzymes recognise the CaaX box at the C-terminus of the target protein. C is the cysteine that is prenylated, a is any aliphatic amino acid, and the identity of X determines which enzyme acts on the protein. Work reported in the journal Genome Biology in 2005 reports refinement of computational detection methods for identification of protein prenylation motifs and establishment of an on-line analysis facility entitled &quot;PrePS&quot;.


Proteins that undergo prenylation include Ras, which plays a central role in the development of cancer. This suggests that inhibitors of prenylation enzymes (e.g. farnesyltransferase) may influence tumor growth. Recent work has shown that farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) also inhibit Rab geranylgeranyltransferase and that the success of such inhibitors in clinical trials may be as much due to effects on Rab prenylation as on Ras prenylation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Residential Electricity ==

One might note about the gradual change in distributed voltages in the US.  The existing infrastructure has wire which has a given ampacity rating, or to say it has a maximum current limit.  Due to increases in power consumption, either V or I could be varied, but with the same wire voltage must be increased.  This is why the old &quot;110/220V&quot; basis became &quot;120/240V&quot;.  It may be increased more in the future for similar reasons.--[[User:Billymac00|Billymac00]] ([[User talk:Billymac00|talk]]) 03:44, 4 December 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Hello World! ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
use strict;     
use warnings;   

use Gtk2;      
Gtk2-&gt;init;

my $window = Gtk2::Window-&gt;new;
my $label  = Gtk2::Label-&gt;new('Hello World!');

$window-&gt;signal_connect('delete-event' =&gt; sub { Gtk2-&gt;main_quit });

$window-&gt;add($label);

$label -&gt;show;
$window-&gt;show;

Gtk2-&gt;main;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Breaking it down ==


&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
use strict;     
use warnings; 
&lt;/source&gt;

Because if someone hasn't told you to include these at the top of every Perl program you write, I'm telling you now.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
use Gtk2;      
&lt;/source&gt;

The Gtk+ libraries are included under the Gtk2 namespace.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;    
Gtk2-&gt;init;
&lt;/source&gt;

This method needs to be called from every Gtk2 application. It initializes the library for use, setting up things things like the color map and connecting the default signal handlers. This method also checks the arguments that have been passed to your application on the command line.  The following arguments are accepted by all Gtk applications. They will be removed from the argument list, leaving the rest for your application to handle.

    * --gtk-module
    * --g-fatal-warnings
    * --gtk-debug
    * --gtk-no-debug
    * --gdk-debug
    * --gdk-no-debug
    * --display
    * --sync
    * --name
    * --class

Instead of explicitly calling the init method yourself, you could call it implicitly like this.

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
use Gtk2 '-init';
&lt;/source&gt;



&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my $window = Gtk2::Window-&gt;new('toplevel');
my $label  = Gtk2::Label-&gt;new('Hello World!');
&lt;/source&gt;

These two lines create new &lt;b&gt;widgets&lt;/b&gt;. A widget is an element of the GUI. Windows, labels, buttons, menus, images are all examples of widgets. In this example we can see that the constructor to the window widget takes an argument telling it to make a top-level window, and the label widget can take some text to display. Different widgets accept different parameters to the constructor. Check the Gtk documentation for more information on specific widgets.



&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
$window-&gt;add($label);
&lt;/source&gt;

This line packs the label into the window. A window widget is an example of a container. A container widget is used to control how its children will be displayed on the screen. Container widgets have a variety of methods that can be used to add children. Here we are using a very basic example to display a label inside a window.



&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
$label -&gt;show;
$window-&gt;show;
&lt;/source&gt;
Can you guess what these lines do? 



&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
$window-&gt;show_all;
&lt;/source&gt;
We could have said this instead.



&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
Gtk2-&gt;main;
&lt;/source&gt;
Every Gtk application has must have a call to the main method. This turns control over the the Gtk main loop which waits for events to occur and then takes the proper action.



&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
$window-&gt;signal_connect('delete-event' =&gt; sub { Gtk2-&gt;main_quit });
&lt;/source&gt;

We didn't forget to cover this line. Here we attach a callback to the 'delete-event' of the window. A callback is a reference to a function. In this example we use an anonymous subroutine, which interrupts Gtk's main loop and returns control back over to the program. Any code after the call to Gtk2-&gt;main will be executed, in our example the program just closes. Had we not connected this callback to the 'delete-event', the window would have closed but our program would still have been running in the main loop, and the user would have no easy way to exit the application. (You could kill it with Ctrl+c.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">Adenylation is a form of enzyme regulation on tyrosine to produce glutamine synthetase. The adenylylation reaction is catalyzed by ''adenylyl transferase'' enzyme on a molecule such as tyrosine. 

During adenylation, the phosphodiester bond undergoes adenylation. A complex of ''adenylyl transferase'' and a regulatory protein causes an AMP unit to either attach to or be removed from the glutamine synthetase. The regulatory enzyme can exist in two forms, P&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; or P&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;. A complex of P&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; with ''adenylyl transerase'' catalyzes the attachment of the AMP unit to the glutamine synthetase, reducing its activity and forming an Adenylated glutamine synthetase. On the other hand, a P&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; and ''adenylyl transerase'' complex removes the AMP from glutamine synthetase, lowering its activity and creating a de-adenylated glutamine synthetase.

It is important to note that the regulatory enzyme can easily convert to its other form. P&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; can be converted to P&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; through the attachment of uridine monophosphate with help from ''uridylyl transferase'' while P&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; can convert to P&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; through hydrolysis. The rate of adenylation depends on the ratio of α-Ketoglutarate to Glutamine. α-Ketoglutarate stimulates ''uridylyl transferase'' to change P&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; to P&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; while at the same time inhibiting hydrolysis that changes P&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt; to P&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt;. The reverse is true for Glutamine. These catalytic activities are present only in the polypeptide chain, ensuring that the enzyme doesn't simultaneously catalyze uridylylation and hydrolysis.

Adenylation is an important form of regulation for amplifying signals such as for blood clotting and control of glycogen metabolism. Because Adenylation is an enzymatic cascade, it is easier for allosteric control as each enzyme can be a target for regulation. This is important for nitrogen metabolism in cells as it creates many regulatory sites, allowing a cell to fine tune its nitrogen production.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== What does this do? ==

Before running this script or reading the explanation below, read through though the program and see if you can tell what it does. After you think you figured it out, try running it. What happens when you press Alt+s or Alt+x? What do you notice when you change the size of the window?


&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
use warnings;
use strict;

use Glib qw(TRUE FALSE);
use Gtk2 '-init';

my $window = Gtk2::Window-&gt;new;
$window-&gt;set_title('Quick Note');

$window-&gt;signal_connect('delete-event'  =&gt; sub { $_[0]-&gt;destroy  });
$window-&gt;signal_connect('destroy'       =&gt; sub { Gtk2-&gt;main_quit });


my $hbox   = Gtk2::HBox-&gt;new;

my $label  = Gtk2::Label-&gt;new('Note');

my $entry  = Gtk2::Entry-&gt;new();

my $save_btn = Gtk2::Button-&gt;new_with_mnemonic('_Save');
$save_btn-&gt;signal_connect('clicked' =&gt; \&amp;save_note, $entry);

my $exit_btn = Gtk2::Button-&gt;new_with_mnemonic('E_xit');
$exit_btn-&gt;signal_connect('clicked' =&gt; sub { $window-&gt;destroy });

$hbox-&gt;pack_start($label   , FALSE, FALSE, 0);
$hbox-&gt;pack_start($entry   , TRUE , TRUE , 0);
$hbox-&gt;pack_start($save_btn, FALSE, FALSE, 0);
$hbox-&gt;pack_start($exit_btn, FALSE, FALSE, 0);

$window-&gt;add($hbox);

$window-&gt;show_all;

Gtk2-&gt;main;


sub save_note {
    my $save  = shift;
    my $entry = shift;
    my $text  = $entry-&gt;get_text;
    $entry-&gt;set_text('');

    open my $OUTFILE, '&gt;&gt;notes.txt'
        or die &quot;could not open notes.txt for appending&quot;;
    flock $OUTFILE, 2;
    print $OUTFILE join '|', time, $text . &quot;\n&quot;;
    close $OUTFILE;
}

&lt;/source&gt;

== What's new ==

In this script, we introduced a few new widgets. The HBox is a container widget which we used to control the layout of the other widgets in the window.  The two others are the Entry and Button widgets, which allow the user to interact with the program.

== Breaking it Down ==


&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
use Glib qw(TRUE FALSE);
&lt;/source&gt;
Glib is a dependency of Gtk. We include this line in our program to gain access to the constants TRUE and FALSE. You may simply use the Boolean values 1 and 0, but we will use TRUE and FALSE for clarity.



&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
$window-&gt;signal_connect('delete-event'  =&gt; sub { $_[0]-&gt;destroy  });
$window-&gt;signal_connect('destroy'       =&gt; sub { Gtk2-&gt;main_quit });
&lt;/source&gt;
You can see we took a slightly different approach when binding to our signals/events. Here we call the destroy method (which emits the 'destroy' signal) on the window when the 'delete-event' occurs. Connected to the 'destroy' signal, we have instructions to quit running in Gtk's main loop.  This approach was used because we want the program to exit when the application window is destroyed in any manner, not just when the user presses the close button in the window title bar. Later on we connect to the 'clicked' signal of $exit_btn to destroy the window, thereby exiting the application.

Despite using the same method to connect, there '''is''' a distinction between an event and a signal (these signals are not the same as Unix system signals, nor implemented using them, but the terminology is very similar). There will be more on this later.



&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my $save_btn = Gtk2::Button-&gt;new_with_mnemonic('_Save');
&lt;/source&gt;
This creates a new Button widget that has the label '&lt;u&gt;S&lt;/u&gt;ave'. Notice we used the method 'new_with_mnemonic' here. This sets up the keyboard shortcut Alt+s to fire the 'clicked' event on the button. The 'S' in 'Save' also becomes underlined to alert the end user to the existence of they keyboard shortcut.  

Because we are using the Perl bindings, we could have gotten away with saying:
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my $save_btn = Gtk2::Button-&gt;new('_Save');
&lt;/source&gt;
This is because the Perl bindings realize that we really want to be using the 'new_with_mnemonic' constructor that is supplied in the underlying C library.  Other widgets that also have 'new_with_mnemonic' or 'new_with_label' constructors usually allow you to do this as well. Many people still prefer to use the 'new_with_label' or 'new_with_mnemonic' constructors regardless.



&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
$save_btn-&gt;signal_connect('clicked' =&gt; \&amp;save_note, $entry)
&lt;/source&gt;
Here we use a reference to a subroutine instead of an anonymous one. The $entry will be passed in as an argument when the callback is executed.



&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my $exit_btn = Gtk2::Button-&gt;new_with_mnemonic('E_xit');
$exit_btn-&gt;signal_connect('clicked' =&gt; sub { $window-&gt;destroy });
&lt;/source&gt;
It should now be clear to you what these two lines do.



&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
$hbox-&gt;pack_start($label   , FALSE, FALSE, 0);
$hbox-&gt;pack_start($entry   , TRUE , TRUE , 0);
$hbox-&gt;pack_start($save_btn, FALSE, FALSE, 0);
$hbox-&gt;pack_start($exit_btn, FALSE, FALSE, 0);
&lt;/source&gt;
These lines pack our interface widgets into the HBox widget. The syntax is:
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
$container-&gt;pack_start($widget, $expand, $fill, $padding)
&lt;/source&gt;
If the $expand argument is FALSE, the container will be shrunk tight around the widget. If the $expand argument is TRUE, the container will expand around the widget to fill the space it's parent has allotted. When the $fill argument is TRUE, the extra space within the container is allocated to the child widget. When set to FALSE, the extra space is left as padding in the container widget. The $fill argument only has any effect when the $expand argument is TRUE as well.

In our example, the $entry object is packed with the $expand and $fill parameters set to TRUE. When you change the size of the window, the box around the $entry expands, allowing the $entry to fill the remaining area. The other objects, which were packed with FALSE $expand and $fill values, will remain their natural sizes.



&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
sub save_note {
    my $save  = shift;
    my $entry = shift;
    my $text  = $entry-&gt;get_text;
    $entry-&gt;set_text('');
 
    open my $OUTFILE, '&gt;&gt;notes.txt'
        or die &quot;could not open notes.txt for appending&quot;;
    flock $OUTFILE, 2;
    print $OUTFILE join '|', time, $text . &quot;\n&quot;;
    close $OUTFILE;
}
&lt;/source&gt;
If it is not clear to you what is happening here, it is suggested you prowl around [[Perl Programming]].

One of the common covalent modifications of protein activity found in animals, palnts, and some viruses. It's donor molecule are Myristoyl CoA which is commonly used to modify protein called Src, main function of signal transduction. The myristoyl group is covalently attached to the N-terminal amino acid of a polypeptide. It is then catalyzed by the N-myristoyltransferase enzyme. It also plays an important role in membrane targeting in response to environmental stress on plants.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Circulatory System==
[[Image:Circulatory System en.svg|thumb|The human circulatory system.]]

The Circulatory System is an organ system that transfers the body's essentials such as blood cells, nutrients, gases, and etc. to and from the cells in order to maintain homeostasis.  Under the circulatory system, there are two systems: cardiovascular system and the lymphatic system.  The cardiovascular system consists of the heart, blood, and blood vessels, while the lymphatic system is composed of the lymph, lymph nodes, and lymph vessels.

Not all organisms require a circulatory system. Its primary purpose is to distribute nutrients and essential elements like oxygen throughout the cell. Smaller organisms, or those with a high surface area relative to their volume, do not need a circulatory system because transfer can take place directly across their cellular membranes. Flatworms are an example of this; due to their size and shape, cells can obtain nutrients and remove waste without the need for an extensive circulatory system because diffusion is sufficient. Human beings, however, require a circulatory system due to their size; for example, oxygen would not be able to effectively diffuse into organ cells without a circulatory system because oxygen would have to go through our skin and into organ cells for them to receive oxygen. In such a case, an internal circulatory system, a network of blood vessels, veins, and arteries, is beneficial because nutrients and oxygen can be gathered at a central location and distributed throughout the body.

''Open/Closed Circulatory system''

In open circulatory system is the circulatory fluid bathes the organs directly. In these animals, the circulatory fluid, called hemolymph is the same as interstitial fluid. The heart pumps hemolymph thorugh vessels into sinuses, fluid-filled spaces where materials are exchanged between the hemolymph and cells. Arthropds and most molluscs have an open circulatory system. 

A closed circulatory system circulates blood entirely within vessels, so the blood is distinct from the interstial fluid. One or more hearts pump blood into large vessels that branch into smaller ones and the interstitial fluid bathing the cells. For example, annelids, such as earthworms have closed circulatory system. This is often called cardiovascular system.

===Blood Vessels===
Arteries, veins, and capillaries are the three main types of blood vessels. Within each type, blood flows in only one direction.
(1) Arteries carry blood away from the heart to organs throughout the body.
(2) Veins carry blood back to the heart
(3) Capillaries are microscopic vessels with very thin, porous walls.

===Chambers===
The hearts of all vertebrates contain two or more muscular chambers. The chambers that receive blood entering the heart are called atria. The chambers that pump blood out of the heart are called ventricles.

[[File:Illu pulmonary circuit.jpg|right|thumb|The pulmonary circuit.]]
==Single Circulation==
The blood passes through the heart once in each complete circuit. In single circulation, blood that leaves the heart passes through two capillary beds before returning to the heart. When blood flows through a capillary bed, blood pressure drops substantially. Fish undergo single circulation, they have a two chambered heart and single circuit. The blood must pass through two capillary beds. The capillary bed is where exchange takes place while oxygen is loaded and carbon dioxide is being unloaded. The blood collects in the first capillary bed and continues onto the second capillary bed. Two capillary beds are problematic because blood pressure decreases as it branches off into smaller branches and this occurs twice in single circulation causing blood pressure to decrease dramatically. The contraction of muscles and movement helps the system get blood back to the heart. This is why single circulation works for fish because they are constantly moving.

==Double Circulation==
The circulatory systems of amphibians, reptiles, and mammals have two distinct circuits.

===Pulmonary Circulation===
Pulmonary circulation is the portion of the circulatory system which carries oxygen-depleted blood away from the heart, to the lungs, and then returns oxygenated blood back to the heart. The pathway that blood takes in the pulmonary circuit starts at the right section of the heart. Oxygen-depleted blood from the body enters the heart through the right atrium where it pumped through the right atrioventricular valve and into the right ventricle. The blood is then pumped into the two pulmonary arteries, one for each lung, and travels into the lungs. The pulmonary arteries carry the deoxygenated blood to the lungs while the pulmonary veins carry oxygenated blood to the red blood cells. There they release carbon dioxide and then pick up oxygen during respiration. Now that the blood has been oxygenated, it leaves the lungs via the pulmonary veins and it returns to the left heart, completing the pulmonary cycle. The blood enters the left atrium and is pumped through the left atrioventricular valve and into the left ventricle. From here, the blood is distributed to the body via the systemic circulation before once again returning to the pulmonary circulation to pick up more oxygen.

===Systemic Circulation===
Systemic circulation, as indicated with the word &quot;system&quot; in the title itself, is all throughout the body. This circulation's key role is to provide nourishment to all of the tissues located throughout your body. However, it does not benefit the heart and lungs because they have their own systems. Nonetheless, systemic circulation is a vital supporting piece of the circulatory system as a whole. The blood vessels, which consist of the arteries, veins, and capillaries, are responsible for the delivery of oxygen and nutrients to the tissue. Oxygen rich blood enters the blood vessels through the heart's major artery called the aorta. There exists the application of forceful contraction of the heart's left ventricle which compels the blood to flow through the aorta and into smaller arteries to distribute throughout the body. As a matter of fact, the inside layer of an artery is very smooth, thus allowing blood to flow rather quickly. As the atrium contracts in the heart, more blood is filling the ventricles. Eventually, the atrioventricular valve closes. The ventricles undergo isovolumetric contraction, which is when the ventricles contract but the volume does not change. Once the pressure in the ventricles exceeds the pressure in the aorta will that aortic valve open. In comparison to the inside layer of the artery, the outside of the artery is relatively strong, allowing blood to flow forcefully. As the blood flows through the arteries, the velocity of flow is fast. This is because the cross-sectional area of the arteries is small, and linear velocity is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area. Once blood reaches the capillaries, the velocity decreases because capillaries have a large cross-sectional area. The second to last step of this systemic process involves oxygen-rich blood entering the capillaries where the oxygen and nutrients are then released. The process concludes with the collection of waste products and waste-rich blood that flow into veins to be taken back to the heart. The rest of the work is left to pulmonary circulation, which is mentioned in the section above. Other key aspects of systemic circulation include the fact that blood passes through the kidneys, which is known as renal circulation. During this phase, the kidneys filter as much of the waste from blood as possible. Blood also makes its way through the small intestine, which is known as portal circulation. In this phase, the blood from the small intestine collects in the portal vein which then passes through the liver. To explain with more specificity, the liver filters sugars from blood, storing them for later.

===Coronary Circulation===
While pulmonary and systemic circulation provide oxygen and nutrients for the rest of the body, it is crucial not to forget about the heart's everlasting desire for nutrients as well. This is pursued through coronary circulation which refers to the movement of blood through the tissues of the heart. Despite the fact that blood fills the chambers of the heart, the muscle tissue of heart which is referred to as myocardium, is so thick to the point that it requires blood vessels to deliver blood deep into it. These blood vessels, responsible for delivering oxygen-rich blood to the myocardium, are known as coronary arteries. The vessels responsible for the removal of deoxygenated blood from the heart muscle are known as cardiac veins. The coronary arteries, when healthy, are capable of autoregulation to maintain coronary blood flow at levels appropriate to the needs of the heart muscle. The critical nature of coronary arteries are illustrated by means of classification as the &quot;end circulation&quot; because they represent the only source of blood supply to the myocardium. 

{{BookCat}}

The coronary circulation of the heart consists of blood (a fluid that carries materials between the outside world and the cells of the body), a lot of blood vessels (carrying blood throughout the body to deliver those nutrients to the various cells), and the main component of the coronary circulation system, the heart (which forces blood into the blood vessels. The pressure that the heart produces to push blood through the blood vessels is called the blood pressure. If the blood pressure becomes inadequate to produce a large enough force for the blood to move into the vessels, certain cells become starved for Oxygen, a condition referred to as ischemia.

In coronary circulation, in order to understand how the heart and the blood vessels can respond to autonomic and endocrine input and how they change their behavior, it is essential to look carefully at each of the components in the cardiovascular system. The heart consists of two separate pumps, joined together. These two halves of the heart are connected by parallel sets of blood vessels in series with one another. The right heart receives blood from most of the body and pumps the blood into the vessels of the lungs (the pulmonary circulation); the left heart receives blood from the lungs and pumps the blood into vessels into the rest of the body (the systemic circulation). Both the right and left heart are separated in themselves into two subsections, the atriums and ventricles. Veins leading to the right heart are connected to the right atrium at first. The bloods that enters the right atrium is then pumped into the right ventricle, which is separated from the right atrium by the bicuspid valve. Once in the right ventricle, the blood circulates through arteries and veins in the pulmonary circulation into the left atrium. Once in the left atrium, the blood is allowed into the left ventricle as the mitral (tricuspid) valve opens and closes due to blood pressure differences in the two compartments.

 
After release into the left ventricle, blood is propelled past the aortic valve to flow to the rest of the body. For the reason that the left ventricle must produce enough force to send the blood through the rest of the body, the muscles of the left ventricle are much stronger than the muscles of the right ventricle.

The output of blood in the two halves of the heart must be exactly equal to one another on a minute-to-minute basis or else blood will be backed up in either the systemic or pulmonary circulation, which leads to major problems for the entire circulatory system. Damage to the heart results in a heart pump with less efficiency. In congestive heart failure, the left heart forces more blood than the right heart, a condition that is referred to as systemic edema. This condition can be treated with drugs that increase fluid excretion and that increase the strength of the heart as a whole. In left heart failure, the right heart pumps more blood than its counterpart, a condition referred to as pulmonary edema. This condition interferes with gas exchange in the lungs and can produce suffocation. If the heart becomes extremely weak overall, a condition referred to as congestive heart failure occurs. In congestive heart failure, residual blood pressure in the heart causes the heart to become abnormally full, greatly stretching the heart muscles. Under this condition, the heart becomes unable to even contract strongly and is unable to force any blood into the great arteries. This situation must be remedied immediately or death follows.

==Body Fluids==

Body fluids are primarily distributed among three major compartments in the circulatory system. These three compartments are the volume inside of the cells (the intracellular compartment), the volume inside the circulatory system itself (the plasma compartment), and the volume that lies between the circulatory system and the intracellular compartment (the interstitial compartment). Under normal conditions, the three different compartments are in osmotic equilibrium with one another, but they do contain different distributions of solutes. There is a lot of organic anion (mostly proteins) inside cells, essentially none in the interstitial fluid, and a little in the plasma. Sodium and potassium ions are distributed with the inverse concentration profiles across cell membranes. The total number of millimoles of solute is equal in each of the three compartments. Cell membranes separate the intracellular and interstitial compartments. Capillary walls separate the interstitial and plasma compartments. Materials that must be exchanged between the different compartments must cross these barriers in order to reach the other side. 

In all cases, the basic techniques of measuring body fluids consists of diluting an appropriate marker molecule (Evan's blue, inulin, H2O) into the volume that you would like to measure, allowing it to mix thoroughly in the compartment, and then measuring the concentration of the marker. The basic calculation is based on the equation volume = (quantity/concentration). There are, however, several possible sources of error tin this method.These errors include an inadequate mixing of the marker within the compartment, loss of the molecule marker by metabolism or excretion, and leakage into other compartments. an ideal marker substance for these measurements has the characteristics of going only into the compartment that is measured, is broken down or excreted very slowly compared to mixing time, and is lost as a simple exponential function of time (therefore allowing the extrapolation back to its initial concentration from the data. the plasma volume is measured using Evan's blue, which binds to blood cells and plasma proteins. The interstitial volume is measured using molecules that equilibrate between the plasma and the interstitial fluid, but that won't enter cells (inulin). Total body water is measured by deuterated or tritiated H2O, and with subtraction an intracellular volume is measured. 

Body fluid compartments are separated by layers composed of cells that are arranged side-by-side with one another. The layer of cells that solutes and water traverse as they move between compartments are epithelia cells or endothelia cells. Chemical species move across there cell walls driven by concentration gradients or pressure gradients. These chemical species may traverse the capillary walls by either a transcellular pathway of through a paracellular pathway, or even both. Most cells of the epithelial layer are polarized, meaning that the properties of the cell membrane facing the interstitial fluid are different from the properties of the cell membrane of the very same cells facing the lumen of the tube. Chemical species can cross the paracellular pathway if there is a driving force on them and if they aren't too big. Passage through the transcellular pathway is more complex in that a transporter molecule may be needed to facilitate diffusion across the cell membrane.

===Blood===
The composition of mammalian blood is 55% plasma and 45% cellular elements.

'''Plasma'''
Plasma is about 90% water, the dissolved salts are an essential component of the blood. Some of these ions buffer the blood, which in humans normally has a pH of 7.4.

'''Cellular elements'''
Two classes of cells: red blood cells, which transports oxygen, and white blood cells, which function in defense. Blood also contains platelets, fragments of cells that are involved in the clotting processes.

==Mammalian Heart==
One complete sequence of pumping and filling is a cardiac cycle. The contraction phase of the cycle is called systole while the relaxation phase is called diastole. 

===Cardiac Cycle===
For an adult human at rest with a heart rate of about 72 beats per minute, one complete cardiac cycle takes about 0.8 second.
(1) During when atria and ventricle are in diastole, blood returning from the large veins flow into the atria and ventricle through the AV valves.
(2) A brief period of atrial systole then forces all blood remaining in the atria into the ventricles.
(3) During the remainder of the cycle, ventricular systole pumps blood into the large arteries through the semi-lunar valves.

===Maintaining heart beat===
# Sinalatrial (SA) node depolarizes.
# Electrical signal is passed to the AV node.
# Depolarization spreads to atria.
# Depolarization is passed down the bundle of Hiss to the apex of the heart.
# Depolarization spreads upward from the apex, through the bundle branches. The bundle branches divide into left and right bundle branches.
# The message is passed through the Purkinje fibers, causing the ventricles to contract.
The SA node is called the pacemaker of the heart because it has the fastest rhythm, about 80beats per minute. Every time the SA produces an action potential, the message is relayed the heart as described above. If the SA node becomes damaged and the message is not passed down, the AV node will take over as the heart's pace maker. The AV node beats a lot slower, only about 40beats per minute. Although this will be enough to keep a person alive, contraction will be too slow for strenuous activity. Doctors will recommend putting in an artificial pace maker in such a case.

==Electrocardiogram==

The electrical activity of the heart, as described above, is measured with an electrocardiogram, or an ECG. This measurement is taken using electrodes on the skin, which are capable of picking up electrical fields from signals conducted within the heart. Because body fluids are saline, they can conduct signals well. ECG's are recorded from limb or chest leads. A typical ECG consists of a P wave, QRS wave (complex), and a T wave. ECG's are small potentials and are only a few milivolts in amplitude. The P wave correlates to atrial depolarization, which occurs just before atrial contraction. The QRS complex correlates to ventricular depolarization, which occurs just before ventricular contraction. The final T wave is due to ventricular repolarization which occurs during ventricular relaxation. There is a temporal relationship between te cardiac action potentials and the ECG record. 

ECG's are valuable because they are non-invasive methods to monitors the condition of the heart in a realtively simple way. Vector analysis is used to analyze the heart as well and can indicate the position of damage to the heart. 

There are several issues that can occur in the conducting paths of the heart, which overall cause an ECG to look much different:

In a first-degree block, there is a delay in the depolarization of the ventricles, therefore making the P-R interval prolonged. 
In a second-degree block, the P waves are sometimes not followed by the QRS-complex or could be completely missing. 
In a third-degree block, the P waves and QRS complex occur completely independent of each other. 

In atrial fibrillation, the waves can all be out of order, but this is not as big of an issue because the ventricles are still functioning normally and are simply having the wrong atrial impulses. This would make an irregular heartbeat occur. The 
In ventricular fibrillation, the waves are scattered all around and this is a fatal heart problem if not taken care of immediately.

===Pacemaker cells===
Pacemaker cells help initiate the rhythmic depolarization of the heart. It is what leads the heart to beat in a rhythmic pattern. The heart does not receive transmitters from the nervous system to function it to contract. Instead, the heart has a combination of pacemaker cells and conducting fibers to maintain autonomic depolarization. The two pacemaker cells are sino-atrial node and atrio-ventricular node. Conducting fibers such as the Bundle of His and Purkinje Fibers help take the electrical current to all the ventricular muscle system. This process is important because the heart contracts synchronously and without the transmission of electrical current through the conducting fibers, the heart would not function properly. Pacemaking cells also contribute to the pacemaking potential, in which the depolarization occur differently than normal cardiac action potential.

===Control of the Heart Rhythm===
The SA node in the heart is made up of a group of cells which is also called a pacemaker because it sets the timer at which all the cardiac muscles contract. The pacemaker generates a wave of signals that conduct through the atria and causes both atria to contract simultaneously. Signals travel from the SA node to the AV node, another group of cells that receives the current from the first node. There is a delay that takes place at the AV node because the atria must empty completely and all the blood must flow in before the ventricles are able to contract. After the delay, the AV node is now able to send the current through the bundle branches into the apex of the heart where it spreads throughout the ventricles of the heart through Purkinje fibers triggering a contraction.

===Patterns of Blood Pressure===
There are three properties including cross sectional area, blood flow velocity and blood pressure that that explain the pattern of blood flow from arterioles into the capillaries. Blood flow from arteries to arterioles to capillaries slows due to the increase in total cross sectional area. The number of capillaries is extremely high making the cross sectional area much greater in the capillary beds than in arteries or any other part of the circulatory system. Blood flow here is also slow because the exchange of material is taking place. The increase of cross sectional area correlates to the decrease in the speed of blood flow because arteries must transfer blood to many capillaries. However, it is noted that there is a slight increase when the blood enters the vein again. This is because the veins and venules have a slightly larger cross sectional area than capillaries. As a result, the change in diameter aids in speeding up the blood flow into the veins. As blood enters the capillary bed, the capillaries have narrow diameter which produces resistance to blood flow. This resistance causes much of the pressure that is generated by the heart to disperse.  Arteries have the ability to keep blood pressurized at all times. The pressure in the arteries during ventricular systole is called systolic pressure and is the highest pressure in the arteries. Pressure in the arteries during diastole is called diastole pressure, which in comparison to systolic pressure is much lower. 

===Capillary Function===
In the capillary bed, there are two forces that are in charge of driving the diffusion of water outward or inward. These two forces are known as blood pressure and osmotic pressure, opposing forces in the capillaries. Osmotic pressure is established by the protein albumin which is always present in the blood. Albumin is too large of a protein to be transferred out of the blood, as a result the osmotic pressure is always constant because ultimately, the proteins cannot leave the capillary beds and they are the ones that maintain this pressure. The blood pressure is established by systolic and diastolic pressure in the arteries. When the blood pressure is higher than the osmotic pressure, there is an outward flow of fluid. On the other hand, when the osmotic pressure is higher than the blood pressure, there is an inward flow of fluid. There is usually more exchange leaving the capillary then coming back. Much fluid is lost that does not return to the circulatory system.

==Cardiovascular Disease==
Disorders of the heart and blood vessels. Cardiovascular diseases range from a minor disturbance of vein or heart valve function to a life-threatening disruption of blood flow to the heart of brain.
===Congestive Heart Failure===
One side of the heart is weaker than the other, causing unequal pumping of blood from the two halves of the heart. People can be born with the disease, but usually occurs when one side of the heart is damaged. 
# Right heart failure occurs when the left ventricle pumps more blood than the right ventricle. Blood becomes backed up and collects in the body, leading to a condition called systemic edema. The accumulation of excess fluid causes the arms to be swollen constantly. Fortunately, right heart failure is not very serious or life threatening. They can easily be treated with drugs that increase cardiac contraction.
# Left heart failure occurs when the right ventricle pumps more blood than the left ventricle. This causes blood to collect in the lungs, leading to pulmonary edema. The collection of blood can lead to suffocation, and possible death. Unlike right heart failure, left heart failure is very serious and must be treated immediately.
Both the left and right ventricles must be contracting the same amount of blood at all times. Even though left ventricle contraction is stronger than the right, the same amount of blood is pumped.

The leading causes of heart failure are diseases that damage the heart such as coronary heart disease (CHD), high blood pressure, and diabetes. Many of these risk factors cannot necessarily be changed or reversed. Leading risk factors that are capable of being changed in a lifetime include, tobacco use, unhealthy blood-cholesterol levels, physical inactivity, and being overweight/obesity. Leading risk factors that cannot be changed include heredity, aging, being male and ethnicity. 

Tobacco use harms the cardiovascular system in many different ways, such as by damaging the lining of the arteries and reducing the &quot;good&quot; cholesterol in the body. Nicotine in specific raises the heart rate and the blood pressure of the body. Depletion of the oxygen supply in the blood is caused by the inhalation of carbon monoxide. Those who smoke and those who are exposed to smoke are capable of experiencing heart-related problems. 


In the United States, heart failure is acknowledged as a common condition and affects about 5.8 million Americans. Heart failure has no cure however many treatments such as pharmaceutical medications and lifestyle modifications can help people relieve some symptoms and help them live longer. Current treatment options for advanced heart failure include the implantation of left ventricular assist devices (LVAD) to help the heart mechanically continue pumping blood. Currently, LVAD implants are being used as destination therapy or bridge to transplantation of artificial hearts.

===Atherosclerosis===
The hardening of the arteries by accumulation of fatty deposits. Healthy arteries have a smooth inner lining that reduces resistance to blood flow. Damage or infection can roughen the lining and lead to an inflammation. Leukocytes are attracted to the damaged lining and begin to take up lipids, including cholesterol.

The hardening process often accompanies the natural progression of aging. High blood cholesterol due to unhealthy lifestyle as caused by a diet high in fat content, alcohol use, and limited exercise can accelerate the hardening of arteries. Other risk factors for atherosclerosis include diabetes, high blood pressure, smoking, and family history of atherosclerosis. 

Diagnosis include a series of medical tests such as magnetic resonance arteriography (MRA), angiography (the use of x-rays to view the inside of arteries), and ultrasound doppler tests.

===Heart Attack===
Also called a myocardial infarction, is the damage or death of cardiac muscle tissue resulting from blockage of one or more coronary arteries. Since the coronary arteries are small in diameter, they are especially vulnerable to obstruction. Such blockage can destroy cardiac muscle quickly because the constantly beating heart muscle cannot survive long with oxygen.

A heart attack may be caused by blood platelets sticking to tears in the plaque and from a blood clot that blocks blood flow to the heart. Heart attack symptoms include chest pain, anxiety, cough, fainting, light-headedness, shortness of breath, and sweating.

===Stroke===
A stroke is the death of nervous tissue in the brain due to a lack of oxygen. Strokes usually result from rupture of blockage of arteries in the head. The effects of a stroke and the individual's chance of survival depend on the extent and location of the damaged brain tissue.

Strokes are also medically known as cerebrovascular disease, cerebral infarction, or cerebral hemorrhage. There are two main types of stroke called ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke.

#ischemic stroke: This type of stroke occurs when a blood vessel that supplies blood to the brain is blocked by a blood clot. The clot maybe in an already narrow artery and is called a thrombotic stroke. Another pathway by which a clot can form is through a dislodged clot from another blood vessel or another part of the body and travels up to the brain. This type of stroke is known as embolic stroke. These clots consist of fat, cholestrol that create plaque.
In ischemic stroke, there are two types of stroke that can occur; embolic and thrombotic. In embolic stroke, blood clots travel from somewhere in the body to the brain. In thrombotic stroke,  caused by thrombi, blood clots form where an artery has been narrowed by atherosclerosis.

#hemorrhagic stoke: This type of stroke occurs when a blood vessel in the brain is weakened and as a result, burst open. Blood starts to leak into the brain. People who already have defects in blood vessels of the brain are more likely to experience hemorrhagic stroke. 
In hemorrhagic stroke, there are two different types of stroke that can occur; subarachnoid hemorrhage stroke and intra-cerebral hemorrhage stroke. In subarachnoid, there is a bleed in between the brain and the skull which usually develops from an aneurysm. In intra-cerebral hemorrhage, there is a bleed in the brain from a blood vessel which is caused from high blood pressure and its damaging effects on arteries. 

The risk factors for stroke include family history, high cholesterol, age, race, unhealthy lifestyle and diet, and diabetes. Women over 35, smoke, and take birth control pills are at a very high risk of stroke.

==Angina==

Overtime, arteries that are narrowed by disease can still open enough to deliver blood to the heart. However, during exertion, the heart requires more oxygen to function properly, than the narrowed arteries can process succesfully. The result is called angina pectoris, which is severe chest pain. The pain can occur in the chest, shoulder, neck, arm, hand or back and usually is expressed as a tightness in one of those areas or heavy pressure. Angina can be controlled via drugs or surgical treatment but overtime can become a blocked artery or even lead to cardiac failure. 

==Coronary Bypass Surgery==

When an artery becomes blocked, it may become non-functional or could affect the overall blood supply to the heart. In this case, a vein would be grafted into an artery at the point above and the point below the obstructed segment.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''A. Introduction''' 

When dealing with enzyme substrate reactions, most involve a single substrate which is turned into a single product by an enzyme. However, for multi-substrate reactions there are more than one substrate involved. The reaction involves a complex reaction that not only tells where the substrates bind, but the sequence of binding as well. For instance if there were two substrates, one would be labeled substrate A and substrate B. On the basis that one of the substrate concentrations remains constant the entire time like substrate A, the enzyme would behave in the same manner as a single substrate enzyme. Because of this, the a graph of substrate concentration over velocity would produce values of both Km and Vmax for substrate B because substrate A is constant. The value of Km represents the substrate concentration at which the reaction is half its maximum velocity (Vmax). However, this is not always the case and when the concentrations of substrate A and substrate B are different the result of the enzyme-substrate interactions can be explained by two different mechanisms that will be described below. Furthermore, hypothetically, substrate A and substrate B would lead to two different products that can be labeled as P and R respectively. 


'''B. Ternary Complex Mechanism'''

In a Ternary Complex Mechanism two substrates bind to the enzyme (hypothetically substrate A and substrate B) to form a complex that is known as the EAB Ternary Complex. The order of the substrate binding can either be in a specific sequence (ordered) or random sequence as well. An enzyme that follows the ternary complex mechanism would have a Lineweaver-Burk Plot that has two lines that intersect on a reciprocal substrate concentration/velocity graph. The plot represents a linear graph of the reciprocals 1/S and 1/V.  A specific enzyme that has a ternary-complex mechanism is DNA polymerase. DNA polymerase functions to add nucleotides to DNA. 


'''C. Ping Pong Mechanism''' 

For this mechanism, an enzyme can be in two states. One of the states is labeled E and the other state that is also known as the intermediate and that is chemically modified is labeled E*. In this mechanism, the first substrate (substrate A) binds to enzyme turning it into E* by the transfer of a chemical group to the active site and then the substrate is released. Once substrate A is released, substrate is able to bind to the modified Enzyme (E*) forming the unmodified Enzyme once again (regeneration). When a Line-Weaver Burk plot is graphed, two sets of parallel will be formed opposite of the Ternary Complex Mechanism. Specific enzymes that follow this mechanism include oxidoreductases and serine proteases. Some of the serine proteases include the digestive enzymes of chymotrypsin and trypsin. For the example of the chymotrypsin, an acyl-enzyme is formed after the breakdown of the tetrahedral intermediate, which is formed after the nucleophilic attack of Ser to the carbonyl forming the intermediate. Once the intermediate breaks down, the acyl-enzyme is formed which  acts as the modified Enzyme (E*). The acyl-enzyme however breaks down later into the intermediate complex as the amine group of the acyl-enzyme (E*) leaves and hydrogen functions as a nucleophile to attack the carbonyl forming the tetrahedral intermediate once again.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Scarcity ==
The economic problem or scarcity is an issue all of us face.  We have limited means: limited time, skills and money.  We have limited time in that there are only so many hours in a day and many of these hours will be occupied by other activities we do.  Limited skills is also an issue: this means that we do not have the required ability in order to all the tasks we may wish to.  For example you may want to work as an economist; however there are certain skills you must first have in order to do this.  You will not be able to work in this type of role without prior training and the capacity and analytical skills to cope.  We also have limited money.  Even the Bill Gates and Warren Buffets of this world do not have unlimited money and as a result cannot simply buy anything.

For instance you may wish to play on the computer but you need to do a lot of homework.  As a result of your limited time you are not able to do both of these.  As a result you will need to make a choice.  If you decide to do homework you will not be able to to play on the computer.  This means that playing on the computer will be the opportunity cost of your decision - the next best alternative not chosen.  We make these choices according to our values.  These values are the principles that are important to us: if you place a high importance on hard-working this will probably mean you choose to do your homework.  Other such values include honesty, integrity, fair-dealing and so on.  Our values differ depending on various factors such as our peer-group, up-bringing, religion, socio-economic group and age.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Isomerases are enzymes that catalyze the formation of a substrate's isomer.  In other words, they facilitate the transfer of specific functional groups intramolecularly without adding or removing atoms from the substrate.  This conversion can be simply represented in the form  
A → B, where A and B are isomers.

Isomerases are used in many biochemical pathways, including the citric acid cycle and the glycolitic pathway.  All isomerases have Enzyme Commission numbers beginning in EC 5.  A variety of isomerizations can be carried out, including racemization, cis-trans isomerization, enolization, and many others.  Some examples of isomerases include [[/Enzyme/Isomerases/Triose Phosphate Isomerase|triose phosphate isomerase]], bisphosphoglycerate mutase, and photoisomerase.

Isomerases can help prepare a molecule for subsequent reactions such as oxidation-reduction reactions.  For example, in the conversion of citrate to isocitrate in the citric acid cycle, isomerization prepares the molecule for subsequent oxidation and decarboxylation by transferring the hydroxyl group of citrate from a tertiary to a secondary position. Additionally, isomerases can catalyze phosphorylation reaction pathways throughout the Krebb Cycle by preparing the molecule for oxidation states. The change in position is facilitated through Isomerases without affecting the overall chemical composition of the substrate or product.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Docking.jpg|thumb|right|Molecular docking]]
In the field of molecular modeling, docking is a method which predicts the preferred orientation of one molecule to a second when bound to each other to form a stable complex. Knowledge of the preferred orientation in turn may be used to predict the strength of association or binding affinity between two molecules using for example scoring functions.
Docking is frequently used to predict the binding orientation of small molecule drug candidates to their protein targets in order to in turn predict the affinity and activity of the small molecule. Hence docking plays an important role in the rational design of drugs. Given the biological and pharmaceutical significance of molecular docking, considerable efforts have been directed towards improving the methods used to predict docking. 
Molecular docking can be categorized into two main kinds as following:
'''Rigid-flexible docking''' (also rigid docking) is the molecular docking which allows only ligand (donor or small molecule) to change its orientation (depending on its torsional degree of freedom) during docking calculation.
'''Flexible-flexible docking''' (also flexible docking), in addition to rigid docking, macromolecule (protein enzyme) also change its orientation, especially around active site.

==Molecular Docking Based Theory==
Docking is based on equilibrium equation as following:
      '''&lt;big&gt;P(aq)   +  L(aq)  →    PL(aq)&lt;/big&gt;'''
           
      '''&lt;big&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;      =    &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{[PL]}{[P][L]}&lt;/math&gt; 	 ; binding constant&lt;/big&gt;'''
      '''&lt;big&gt;K&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;      =    &lt;math&gt;\tfrac{[P][L]}{[PL]}&lt;/math&gt;     	 ; dissociating constant&lt;/big&gt;'''

      '''&lt;big&gt;ΔG&lt;sub&gt;binding&lt;/sub&gt; = -RT lnK&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sub&gt;&lt;/sub&gt; = RT lnK&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt;    , where ΔG&lt;sub&gt;binding&lt;/sub&gt; is binding Gibb’s free energy&lt;/big&gt;'''
Binding energy indicates how good macromolecule and ligand can bind each other. Thus, even more negative binding energy, even more strength in binding between two molecules takes place. To succeed this case, K&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; should be great or K&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; should be low.
==Scoring Function==

Scoring functions are the answer to the first question, “How to calculate the interactions?” They can tell “how good” a ligand of specific conformation can bind to a receptor. Since the interaction between a ligand and a receptor is a “function of their conformations”, researchers have ideas of trying to “approximate the function” as closely as they can. The approximating functions constructed are called “scoring functions” which can be classified into two main group.
The first group of functions contains scoring schemes based on physical interaction terms, such as Van der Waals interactions or hydrogen bonding. The binding interaction is calculated by the Lennard-Jones pair potential.[[File:Argon dimer potential and Lennard-Jones.png|450px|center]]

[[Image:glycerone-phosphate_wpmp.png|thumb|alt=dihydroxyacetone phosphate|dihydroxyacetone phosphate]]
[[Image:D-glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate_wpmp.png|thumb|alt=D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate|D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate]]
'''Triose Phosphate Isomerase''' (TPI) is an [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme Catalytic Mechanism/Isomerases|isomerase]] that catalyzes the isomerization of dihydroxyacetone phosphate to and from D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.  It takes part in the glycolytic pathway, which is a biochemical pathway employed by many organisms.  In the pathway, TPI's action takes its place directly after the splitting of fructose 1,6-biphosphate by aldolase.  The objective of the glycolytic pathway is to metabolize glucose into two pyruvate molecules, also producing two ATP molecules.  Hence, TPI is an enzyme that contributes to the production of ATP, the molecules used as an energy source by all organisms.

TPI is an example of a &quot;kinetically perfect enzyme,&quot; which means that it catalyzes isomerization so quickly that the rate of reaction is determined by the diffusion rate of the substrate.  This means it isomerizes essentially every molecule of TPI specificity that it encounters.  TPI increases the rate of isomerization by ten degrees of magnitude.  Part of TPI's kinetic perfection comes from it being an isomerase; the enzyme does not have to wait for multiple substrates to bind to the active site.  Also, the mechanism (see below) involves few steps and involves the transfer of protons only.



=Mechanism=
The catalytic mechanism of TPI begins with the glutamate residue removing a hydrogen from one of the substrate's carbon atoms (see image), while the carbonyl oxygen deprotonates the nearby histidine residue, forming an enediol intermediate.  The negatively charged histidine then deprotonates the original hydroxyl group, which yields an enolate-like product.  The glutamic acid, now acting as an acid, adds a proton to the middle carbon to form the product, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.  The net result is the original carbon-hydroxyl bond and carbon-oxygen double bond switching places.

One important aspect of the catalytic behavior is the restraining of the enediol intermediate shown in the upper-right portion of the image below.  Under normal conditions this molecule loses its phosphate group, and this degradation occurs at a rate two orders of magnitude faster than the isomerization of the substrate.  To counteract this undesirable decomposition, a small loop of residues closes over the active site while the reaction takes place.  The reactive intermediate is enclosed in a conformation that does not favor its spontaneous decomposition.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In cell biology, pluripotency is defined as &quot;the potential of a cell to develop into more than one type of mature cell, depending on environment&quot;&lt;ref&gt;http://groups.molbiosci.northwestern.edu/holmgren/Glossary/Definitions/Def-P/Pluripotency.html&lt;/ref&gt;. So if a cell is pluripotent, it has the potential to transform itself into a lung cell, heart cell, etc. Pluripotency describes a cellular state of specific cells within the early embryo &lt;ref&gt;“Pluripotency and Nuclear Reprogramming” From Annual Review of Biochemistry Vol. 81 737-765, by Marion Dejosez and Thomas P. Zwakav&lt;/ref&gt;.
Stem cells represent a category of unspecialized cells that possess the unique capability of developing and maturing into a variety of specific types of cells with various functions.&lt;ref name=&quot;nih&quot;/&gt;  Through the maturation and cell division processes, stem cells can specialize, grow, and replace unhealthy cells within  living organisms.  After cell replication, these cells have the ability to either mature and specialize in function, or remain an unspecialized stem cell, which preserves the cell’s potential to specialize as it is needed in the body.  Not only are these cells able to specialize in function, but they are also capable of joining together to replace damaged tissues.  The two types of stem cells scientists are currently studying are: embryonic stem cells and adult stem cells.   In 1981, scientists first discovered  methods to derive embryonic stem cells from mouse embryos, and in 1998, scientists made further developments and developed methods to derive and harvest stem cells from human embryos.  Since stem cells are capable of self- replication, they offer great potential for treatment of diseases such as diabetes and heart disease.  The use of these cells for treatment of certain diseases is called reparative medicine, and is currently a topic of much debate in present society and culture. Stem cells also offer the potential for use in screening new drugs  as well as the study of how and why certain birth defects develop.   Stem cell therapy offers a great deal of insight into medicine as well as human growth and development, and research is currently underway in order to find methods to fully implement all the advancements these cells could provide to modern medicine.

Stem cells are characterized by their ability to differentiate into a diverse range of specialized cells and to grow indefinitely.  They have two properties:

*'''Self-renewal''': The ability to undergo cell division indefinitely while maintaining their undifferentiated state.  Stem cells are capable of doing so due to having active telomerase.
*'''Potency''': The ability to differentiate into specialized cell types in response to a signal.  Skin cells, heart cells, and neurons all have the same genome, but are all different cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;tak&quot;/&gt;  This is due to differentiation and different RNA/protein combinations.

Stem cells are often classified into one of two categories: embryonic stem cells, or adult stem cells.

==Totipotency==
Totipotency is defined as a cell's ability to transform into all cell types of the organism&lt;ref&gt;“Pluripotency and Nuclear Reprogramming” From Annual Review of Biochemistry Vol. 81 737-765, by Marion Dejosez and Thomas P. Zwaka&lt;/ref&gt;. Both oocyte (the female germ cell involved in reproduction. This is an immature ovum) and zygote (this is the initial cell created after tow gamete cells are merged by means of sexual reproduction) do not possess the potential to be totipotent. However, the fertilized egg becomes equipotent blastomeres from its specialized cell type with a limited fate. Blastomeres are a type of cell created by cleavage of the zygote after fertilization &lt;ref&gt;^ Blastomere Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online. Encyclopædia Britannica Inc., 2012. Web. 06 Feb. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;. 

What researchers have found through a series of transplantation experiments
1. Maternal proteins and RNAs are taken into the oocyte and deposited there
2. Those maternal proteins and RNAs have the capability to reset the epigentic state of somatic chromatin
3. They also serve to turn the oocyte into totipotent blastomeres after fertilization
4. So far, it has not been achieved to make totipotent cell lines in vitro. 
5. This may be impossible due to the fact that in vivo, that is within living body, the transient nature of the totipotent is extremely different. The pre-embryonic stage of embryonic development offers blastomeres that are not actually self-renewin but they are generated by means of cleavage

==Primordial Pluripotency==
Slowly, a restriction in development potency become apparent as cleavage of the early embryo approaches to the 16-cell stage. Then the cells undergo two different lineages, the trophoblast lineage and the inner cell mass. The question is how the cell differentiation begins. Differentiation begins as blastomeres flatten and as they strengthen cell-to-cell contact. This process is called compaction.

== Embryonic Stem Cells ==
[[File:Stemcell.jpg|600px|thumbnail| Specialization of Embryonic Stem Cells]]
Embryonic stem cells are cells that are derived from embryos that have typically been harvested from eggs through in-vitro fertilization.&lt;ref name=&quot;oli&quot;/&gt; Embryonic stem cells are known as pluripotent, or having the ability to differentiate into every cell line within the organism.  The embryos are 3–5 days old and consist of  collections of hollow balls of cells that are called blastocysts.  

In order to produce these blastocytsts, the embryonic stem cells must be harvested. The process of growing these stem cells is called  cell culture, and is performed in the laboratory.  The inner cell mass of human embryonic stem cells are placed onto a culture dish that has been coated with  a medium that provides an adhesive surface to which the inner cell masses can stick.  This medium is called a feeder layer, and is oftentimes composed of mouse skin cells.   The human embryonic stem cells are then allowed to divide, spread, and attach to the medium of the culture dish in order to create a colony of embryonic stem cells.  If the stem cell colony grows, divides and survives, the cells are plated  onto new, clean culture dishes many times for the duration of many months in order to yield millions of embryonic stem cells, which is called a stem cell line.   A sign that a stem cell line has developed successfully is if the cells have remained unspecialized for the duration of at least six months.  If this is the case, the stem cell line can then be used for further testing and experimentation.  

Throughout the harvesting process the embryonic stem cell colony must undergo a process called characterization, which involves a series of tests performed by scientists to see whether or not the cells have in fact developed correctly.  One such test involves harvesting and examining the stem cell colony for many months in order to verify that the cells are healthy and capable of successful renewal.  These cells are also analyzed to make sure they remain unspecialized.  A way to test whether or not the cells have specialized is to test for the presence of transcription factors that are produced by unspecialized cells.  Two examples of these transcription factors are Nanog and Oct4.  The presence of these transcription factors indicate the cells have remained unspecialized and that they are capable of self replication and renewal. 

Another test performed on embryonic stem cell cultures involves freezing, thawing and re-plating the cells to see whether or not they are capable of self renewal and re-growth.  

An important test to examine whether or not the cells are functioning properly involves injecting a collection of embryonic stem cells into a mouse with a suppressed immune system followed by tests that indicate the formation of teratomas, which are benign tumors.  If the injected stem cells successfully form a teratoma, scientists can be confident that the cells are capable of growth and differentiation, since teratomas contain various specialized cells.

Embryonic stem cells (ESC) are harvested from a blastocyst, which is an early stage in embryonic development(approximately four to five days in humans) that consists of 100-150 cells.  ESC give rise to all three primary germ layers during development: ectoderm, endoderm, and mesoderm; which means they can develop into more than 200 specialized cell types.  They can grow indefinitely under the right conditions due having active telomerase.  Telomerase is inactive in adult cells, and as a result, cannot grow indefinitely.

Embryonic stem cells have proven to be usable in different situations:

*Embryonic development: Understanding ESC aids scientists in further understanding embryonic development.
*Drug testing:  Certain cells cannot be cultured because they will die if removed from an organ or tissue.  For example, in designing drugs for the heart, scientists cannot culture heart cells because once the heart cells are removed, they die.  However, ESC can be cultured, and the ones that are differentiated into heart cells can be sustained in a culture to be used to test the drug.
*Regenerative Medicine: This is not something ESC are currently being used for, but something that scientists are striving towards.  The theory, or goal, is to be able to remove the nuclei in an embryonic stem cell, insert a patient's DNA into the cell, and have it differentiate according to the patient's needs.  For example, Parkinson's disease is a degenerative disease of the central nervous system, and in theory, by adding back new neurons, it should be able to cure Parkinson's.
*Paralysis: In addition, those who suffer from paralysis and unmovable body parts could regenerate body motor control through the study of stem cell research.
*Leukemia: Patients suffering from Leukemia who may be in need of bone marrow transplant or cord blood transfusion can benefit from these stem cell researches. These products could be reproduced without having the need to constantly find a matchable donor. Although this may not treat the disease, it can diminish the symptoms greatly.

==Specialization==
The purpose of harvesting embryonic stem cells is to create a colony of self replicating cells that have the potential to specialize into specific cells of interest that can be used to treat diseases.While they are being grown, the cells remain unspecialized but once they are allowed to clump together under certain specific conditions, they begin to form various specialized cells and tissues.  The challenge scientists are currently facing is figuring out  how to control the specialization to create specific cells of interest as opposed to spontaneous specialization that can result in the formation of various cells that carry unwanted specific functions.  One such way to control specialization is by subjecting the colonies of embryonic stem cells to changes in chemical composition within the culture medium, changing the surface of the culture dish, or inserting specific genes into the culture to change the composition of the harvested cells.   By transplanting the successfully specialized embryonic stem cells into humans, scientists can formulate treatments for certain diseases such as  Parkinson’s Disease, diabetes, spinal cord injury, heart disease as well as vision and hearing loss.

==Adipogenesis==

Adipocytes are cells specialized for energy storage and so when the balance of energy intake versus expenditure is shifted so that more energy is taken in than is burned, the process of adipogenesis begins.  This process involves adipocyte hyperplasia, the excessive recruitment of stem cells to become adipocytes, thereby increasing the number of adipocytes.  In order to accomplish this, pluripotent mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) become preadipocytes then are further developed into mature adipocytes.  

The pluripotent MSCs located in the vascular stroma of adipose tissue and bone marrow first become preadipocytes, a process initiated by bone morphogenic proteins BMP4 or BMP2, then after several rounds of mitotic clonal expansion, they become adipocytes.  While this process is activated by the BMP factors, other factors such as Hh provide inhibitory signals if the process becomes unnecessary&lt;ref&gt;http://www.annualreviews.org/doi/full/10.1146/annurev-biochem-052110-115718?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&amp;rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&amp;rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Regulation and Signaling of Stem Cells==

For stem cells, transcription factors are important to their functioning and can be categorized into three central groups; 1. ones affecting development and its hierarchy (Developmental Core Module), 2. ones controlling cell growth and homeostasis (Cell Growth Module), and 3. ones that control signaling pathways of the other two groups (Signaling Module). These three groups mostly function independently, though there is some interaction present. 

===Developmental Core Module===

The best understood of transcription factors controlling cell pluripotency is Oct4 which is an octamer class protein that specifically recognizes the sequence ATGCAAAT.&lt;ref name=&quot;dej&quot;/&gt; Oct4 is unique apart from the other transcription factors in that it is crucial for epigenetic reprogramming (differentiation of cells during development). If it is inhibited or silenced in any way, ESCs will instantly stop self-renewing and differentiation into trophoblast-like cells. Oct4 will interact with many cofactors in the form of transcription factors. These cofactors tend to interact with DNA and include Sall4, Sp1, Hdac2, Nanog, Dax1, Nac1, Tcfp2l1, and Essrb. Their interactions do not form one protein nexus but multiple complexes all with different composition of proteins. This differing of composition and complexes may be the reason for different states of pluripotency.

Sox2 is another transcription factor involved in development and cell pluripotency. It has an expression pattern that is, to some extent, similar to Oct4. However, when inhibited or silenced, this will mainly affect the later stages of embryogenesis. Sox2 silencing will only affect a small portion its target genes and will lead to trophoblast-like cells. This is mainly because Sox2 loss can affect the amount of Oct4 levels in the cells which is the main reason for the creation of the trophoblast-like cells. 

Nanog is also a member in the core developmental module and is a homeodomain-containing DNA-binding factor that is not associated with the normal ones. Nanog expression alone is able to help keep cell pluripotency in extreme conditions where factors are missing. It has been shown in studies to have a role of starting cell pluripotency rather than maintaining it. Nanog has cofactor proteins it interacts with which includes Smad1, Small3, Nr0b1, Nac1, Essrb, Zfp281, Hdac2, and Sp1.
 
===Cell Growth Module===

This is the gene network that controls and maintains the growth and proliferation of pluripotent stem cells. 

The proto-oncogene c-Myc is one member of this group is associated with activating transcription and opening chromatin. Its expression allows ESCs to self-renew even in extreme conditions. If it is inhibited ESCs will shut off their self-renewing mechanism. c-Myc also controls transcription of genes from multiple unconnecting functions such as cellular metabolism, control of cell cycle, and manufacture of protein. It has an inhibition factor also and will prevent the expression of Gata6 which is a prodifferentiation factor.&lt;ref name=&quot;dej&quot;/&gt; It also has been found to overlap with functions from genes of the developmental module such as Tip60 and p400. It has also seen to function in some cases of cancer growth. 
c-Myc expression is regulated by the transcription factor Ronin (Thap11) which is part of a family of proteins containing an N-terminal THAP domain. It is well conserved between mice and humans which means its sequence and target sequence is very similar for both mammals. Ronin inhibition will led to cell apoptosis while overexpression will lead to an abundance of mESCs. 

===Signaling Module===
There are several signaling pathways that will directly promote self-renewal and/or preserve pluripotency by blocking or signaling normal differentiation prompts. 

Lif (Leukemia inhibitory factor) stimulates the self-renewal of mESCs. It does not directly increase the growth rate of mESCs but rather increases the probability that the cells with self-renew rather than differentiate. The Lif-signaling effect is controlled by a heterodimeric complex that is made of a Lif receptor (LifR) chain and the protein gp130. It has been shown to signal three pathways which are the Jak/Stat3, the PI3K-Akt, and Mapk pathways.&lt;ref name=&quot;dej&quot;/&gt; Of the three, only the Jak/Stat3 pathway completely depends on Lif for its signal. The other two pathways require multiple signals from multiple sources in other to start the process. Signaling of the Jak/Stat3 pathway and PI3K pathways will promote expression of Klf4 and Tcf3 which lead to the creation of greater transcription of Sox2 and Nanog which as stated earlier are involved in differentiation of stem cells and development of the body. For the Mapk pathway, its signaling will lead to less amounts of Tbx3 which will cause a decrease of transcriptional activity.
FgfR1 (Fibroblast growth factor signaling) is the most ample receptor of ESCs in the body. It is involved in signaling the Jak/Stat, phophoinositide phospholipase C-y, PI3K, and Erk pathways. A similar protein, Fgf2 is important for the maintenance of hESC. For example, in mouse feeder cell cultures a hot amount of Fgf2 is required to maintain its self-renewal and prevent differentiation. 

Wnt signaling is very important during embryonic development and controls differentiation of stem cells. Its can induce expression of mesodermal and endodermal markers that, for mESCs, includes Barchyury, Flk1, Foxa2, Lxh1, and Afp. Wnt signaling also maintains cell stem pluripotency by controlling the expression of Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog which are all transcription complexes involved in maintaining pluripotency and development.&lt;ref name=&quot;dej&quot;/&gt;

==Pluripotency-Associated Chromatin Structure==
It should be noted that every cell has a unique chromatin structure. Chromatin  is the combination of DNA and proteins that make up the contents of the nucleus of a cell&lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatin&lt;/ref&gt;. In pluripotent cells, heterochromaitc-associated foci seems to be more spaciously distributed. The associated histones are usually hyperacetylated.  There exists chromatin-modifying enzymes that play a role with the transcriptional modules. They do so by controlling genes that encode key enzymes capable of covalently modifying proteins&lt;ref&gt;“Pluripotency and Nuclear Reprogramming” From Annual Review of Biochemistry Vol. 81 737-765, by Marion Dejosez and Thomas P. Zwaka&lt;/ref&gt;. For instance, the transcription of the H3K9 methyltransferase SetDB1 is controlled by Oct4. It is known that histone labels characteristic of this enzyme. When this happens, the following things occur;
1. Polycomb group proteins are introduced
2. Polycomb group proteins trigger subsequent events which involve methylation of H3K27 residues
3. Then further additional chromatin-associated modifications are enabled.

==Sources of Embryonic Stem Cells==
===1. In Vitro Fertilization===
The largest potential source of blastocysts for stem cell research is from in vitro fertilization (IVF) clinics. The process of IVF requires the retrieval of a woman's eggs via a surgical procedure after undergoing an intensive regimen of &quot;fertility drugs,&quot; which stimulate her ovaries to produce multiple mature eggs. 

When IVF is used for reproductive purposes, doctors typically fertilize all of the donated eggs in order to maximize their chance of producing a viable blastocyst that can be implanted in the womb. Because not all the fertilized eggs are implanted, this has resulted in a large bank of &quot;excess&quot; blastocysts that are currently stored in freezers around the country. The blastocysts stored in IVF clinics could prove to be a major source of embryonic stem cells for use in medical research. However, because most of these blastocysts were created before the advent of stem cell research, most donors were not asked for their permission to use these left-over blastocysts for research.

The IVF technique could potentially also be used to produce blastocysts specifically for research purposes. This would facilitate the isolation of stem cells with specific genetic traits necessary for the study of particular diseases. For example, it may be possible to study the origins of an inherited disease like cystic fibrosis using stem cells made from egg and sperm donors who have this disease. The creation of stem cells specifically for research using IVF is, however, ethically problematic for some people because it involves intentionally creating a blastocyst that will never develop into a human being.&lt;ref name=&quot;del&quot;/&gt;

===2. Nuclear Transfer===
The process called nuclear transfer offers another potential way to produce embryonic stem cells. In animals, nuclear transfer has been accomplished by inserting the nucleus of an already differentiated adult cell-for example, a skin cell-into a donated egg that has had its nucleus removed. This egg, which now contains the genetic material of the skin cell, is then stimulated to form a blastocyst from which embryonic stem cells can be derived. The stem cells that are created in this way are therefore copies or &quot;clones&quot; of the original adult cell because their nuclear DNA matches that of the adult cell.As of the summer of 2006, nuclear transfer has not been successful in the production of human embryonic stem cells, but progress in animal research suggests that scientists may be able to use this technique to develop human stem cells in the future.

Scientists believe that if they are able to use nuclear transfer to derive human stem cells, it could allow them to study the development and progression of specific diseases by creating stem cells containing the genes responsible for certain disorders. In the future, scientists may also be able to create &quot;personalized&quot; stem cells that contain only the DNA of a specific patient. The embryonic stem cells created by nuclear transfer would be genetically matched to a person needing a transplant, making it far less likely that the patient's body would reject the new cells than it would be with traditional tissue transplant procedures.

Although using nuclear transfer to produce stem cells is not the same as reproductive cloning, some are concerned about the potential misapplication of the technique for reproductive cloning purposes. Other ethical considerations include egg donation, which requires informed consent, and the possible destruction of blastocysts.&lt;ref name=&quot;del&quot;/&gt;

== Adult Stem Cells ==


Adult stem cells are known as mesenchymal stem cells. Just like embryonic stem cells, adult stem cells are unspecialized cells capable of renewal and specialization, but unlike embryonic stem cells, adult stem cells are typically found in tissues surrounded by other specialized cells. This makes the stem cell only multipotent; it can only differentiate into certain cell lines as opposed to pluripotent embryonic stem cells which can differentiate into almost any cell line.  The role of adult stem cells is to replenish damaged cells within tissues and organs when needed.  Adult blood-forming stem cells from bone marrow have been used for transplants, and current research is underway to determine whether or not differentiation of stem cells found in the brain and heart can be controlled and used for various other forms of transplantation.

Adult stem cells are found in areas called “stem cell niches” in various organs and tissues.  These cells remain dormant until there is a need for them, which could include a requirement for new cells to replace damaged tissue due to injury or disease.  Like embryonic stem cells, scientists are developing methods to extract these adult stem cells, harvest them in colonies, and manipulate them to create colonies of specialized cells that can be used for treatments of certain diseases.  The challenge arises because once extracted from the human body, these cells have limited capacities to grow and reproduce.

A way scientists identify adult stem cells is first by extracting cells from a living organism.  Next, the cells are labeled in a cell culture and transplanted back into a different organism.  If the cells reproduce in the organism, scientists can verify the presence of properly functioning stem cells.  Scientists have been conducting research to identify various differentiation pathways, which are the processes by which adult stem cells differentiate and convert into highly specialized cells with specific functions. 

Different types of adult stem cells include the following:
*Hematopoietic stem cells: develop into bone cells, cartilage cells, fat cells
*Neural stem cells: develop into neurons, astrocytes and oligodendrocytes
*Skin stem cells: develop into epidermal stem cells and hair follicles

Adult stem cells are found in developed organisms and have the ability to divide and create another cell like itself, or create a cell more differentiated than itself.

They have a few differences from embryonic stem cells, which include:

*They cannot grow indefinitely due to having inactive telomerase.  Some can actually only double once in their cellular life span.
*Adult stem cells have a limited ability do differentiate, unlike ESC.
*They exist in much smaller quantities than ESC do.  There exists about 1 adult stem cell for every 10,000-15,000 cells in an adult human.
*There also exists less ethical issues regarding adult stem cells because they are extracted from adults who are able to make their own decisions and give consent.

Potential exists for adult stem cells and regenerative properties, such as:

*Healing organs:  In the event of a heart attack, heart cells die and are replaced by scar tissue.  Adult stem cells have been used to partially heal the scar tissue in animals by removing the damaged heart tissue, culturing adult stem cells in a petri dish, and putting them back in the damaged heart.
*Organ regeneration:  In 1999, Dr. Anthony Atala, Urologist and Director of the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine, was studying patients with a bladder defect. He took a small piece of bladder, removed the stem cells, and actually grew it into a new bladder. He discovered that he could stick them back in the original patient, and seven years later, the patients were either better, or like normal.  The bladder he was able to create was functional enough to keep the patients healthy and alive.

==CD34+ Cells==
[[Image:Hematopoiesis simple.svg|right|thumb]]
CD34+ cells contain the protein CD34.  CD34 protein is a glycoprotein found on human cell surfaces and functions as an adhesive for cells to interact.  It could also have a function in attaching stem cells to bone marrow or connective tissue cells.  The protein is expressed early in hematopoietic cells.  Another function is that it is needed for T cells to enter lymph nodes.  CD34+ cells are commonly found in as hematopoietic stem cells in umbilical cords and bone marrow.  

===Uses===
To isolate CD34+ cells from blood samples, immunomagnetic or immunofluorescent techniques are used.  These hematopoietic stem cells can be purified for research or clinical use in bone marrow transplant, by using antibodies.  These cells can differentiate into different blood cells.  CD34+ cells can be injected into patients to treat diseases such as Liver Cirrhosis, Peripheral Vascular disease, and spinal cord injury.  


== Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells ==
Induced pluripotent stem cells or iPSCs are adult somatic cells that have been reprogrammed to a state similar to embryonic stem cells. Although iPSCs are theoretically pluripotent cells, it remains unknown if they differ at all from embryonic stem cells. Induced pluripotent stem cells were first produced in 2006 from mouse cells and human cells followed in 2007.

===Production of iPSCs===

iPSCs are produced through a transfection which is process of introducing nucleic acids into a cell.&lt;ref name=&quot;bel&quot;/&gt; In the case of iPSCs, this done through retroviruses. Other methods do exist in the production of iPSCs such as the use of adenoviruses and plasmids. 
Adenoviruses differ from retroviruses because it does not incorporate its own genetic information into the adult cell. Adenoviruses are used to transport the necessary transcription factors into the the DNA of the adult cells. Adenoviruses present some benefits such as the fact that they avoid any potential for mutagenesis that may stem from the insertion as well as the fact that adenoviruses only need to be present for a small period of time to reprogram the adult cell.  
Plasmids can also be used to reprogram the adult cell and in this method, two plasmids are required to carry the necessary transcription factors. The main benefit of using plasmids is the simple fact that viruses do not have to used. Two main problems exist for the use of plasmids though and they are the fact that plasmids demonstrate low efficiency as well as the fact that plasmids have a continued risk of insertional mutagenesis and use cancer-promoting genes during reprogramming.

====Through Cell Fusion====

IPSCs have been created successfully by fusing EGCs (embryotic germ cells) or ESCs (embryotic stem cells) with somatic cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;dej&quot;/&gt; Somatic cell nuclei can be reprogrammed by EGCs and mESCs after they are fused with thymic lymphocytes. After reprogramming, the procedure leads to tetraploid cells that resemble EGCs where the female cells have their inactive X chromosomes became active again. These tetraploids can then be injected into blastocyst to form chimeric embryos. Specifically for humans, this can, in the future, be used for both bone marrow cells and brains cells in the central nervous system that have been isolated. These cells can then be fused with mESCs in culture to create artificial cells that are similar to real ones in morphology and characteristics. 

====Through Cell Reprogramming====

iPSCs can be also be obtained through reprogramming somatic cells (body cells of an organism) into pluripotent stem cells.&lt;ref name=&quot;dej&quot;/&gt; This procedure is performed by the use of transcription factors which are proteins that bind to specific DNA sequences. The four transcription factors that are used in mouse fibroblasts via retroviral infection are Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c-Myc. For humans, different combinations of transcription factors have been used which includes Nanog, Lin28, or Nr5a2. The exogenous expression of the transcription factors is followed by selection in a mESC (mouse embryotic stem cell) agent to finally lead to the iPSCs. The resulting iPSCs have characteristics of normal ESCs (embryotic stem cells) such as reactivation of both X chromosomes in female cells, expression of endogenous pluripotency indicators, and the ability to create chimeric animals. The molecular events are still poorly understood, but how reprogramming occurs can be investigated. During reprogramming, epigenetic marks are expansively altered. Studies have shown that iPSCs clones to be impossible to tell apart from ESCs though there are still small differences that need to be tested before they can be used in regenerative medicine.&lt;ref name=&quot;dej&quot;/&gt;
	
===The Clinical Future of iPSCs===

Induced pluripotent stem cells promise the almost infinite possibilities of embryonic stem cells without the nagging moral implications of the destruction of human embryos, and for this reason offers a promising place for research for regenerative medicine. iPSCs also hold the promise of other benefits over other types of stem cells. The main one being the fact that iPSCs can be developed from a patients own cells which mean that any treatments derived from the iPSCs should avoid any immunogenic responses. Even with the enormous possibilities of iPSCs in a clinical setting, a major concern hovers over the future which is the fact that iPSCs have an increased tendency to form tumors. From experiments, it was discovered that iPSCs injected into mice formed teratomas which are tumors with tissue or organ components inside. Moving toward the future, research is focused on not only coming up with potential treatments using iPSCs but on producing methods with higher efficiency as well as decreased occurrences of tumors using recombinant proteins.

== Uses of Stem Cells==
Both embryonic and adult stem cells have the potential to provide both treatments for various diseases as well as insight into human growth and development.  One specific area of stem cell therapy is the use of these cells to treat people with type I diabetes.  Type I diabetics are unable to produce insulin in the pancreas.  Current research is underway to determine whether or not embryonic stem cells can be  selectively specialized to give rise to insulin producing colonies that can be transplanted into diabetic patients.  In order for such a procedure to be successful, stem cells must be capable of reproducing and generating enough of the tissue/cells of interest.  They must also be able to survive in the recipient host, function properly, and maintain the capability to reproduce,  while leaving the recipient unharmed.  All of these requirements must be met without the recipient rejecting the cells, which is a challenge researchers are presently trying to overcome.

Human stem cells could also be used to test new drugs. New medications could be tested for safety on differentiated cells generated from human pluripotent cell lines. Cancer cell lines for example are used to screen potential anti-tumor drugs. Using stem cells scientists are also developing new ways to grow brain cells in the laboratory that could be used to treat patients with Parkinsons disease. Among the various approaches one is to grow stem cells into brain cells and transplant them into patients. If stem cells can be cultivated to become dopamine-producing nerve cells, researchers believe that they could replace the lost cells.

By using stem cells one could observe the specailization of specific cells such as nerve and muscle cells. By observing this process some of the most serious medical conditions, such as cancer and birth defects, are due to problems that occur somewhere in this process of specialization. Another potential application of stem cells is making cells and tissues for medical therapies.

Cancer cells have the ability to divide indefinitely and spread to different parts of the body during metastasis. Embryonic stem cells can self-renew and, through differentiation to somatic cells, provide the building blocks of the human body. Embryonic stem cells offer tremendous opportunities for regenerative medicine and serve as an excellent model system to study early human development.

==Controversy Surrounding Research==
There is much ethical controversy regarding embryonic stem cell research.  The number one being how ESC are harvested because once ESC are retrieved, the blastocyst dies.  There is no way to harvest them without destroying the embryo.  This brings to the table the question of when does life begin?  There are many different beliefs as to when life begins, whether it be scientific, religious, etc., and so it is difficult to set a definition that everyone can agree upon.

Most of the blastocysts that are used for stem cell research come over from excess invitro fertilization.  People who have fertility issues and decide to have invitro fertilization. This is where sperm and an egg are combined in a test tube, which results with a number of embryos, some of which are implanted in the mother.  The left over embryos are then frozen for a variety of reasons; whether the first implantation doesn't take, or the couple decides to have a second child later on.  Some decide to discard the embryos, but a vast majority are left frozen in labs.  Another controversial question that arises is that whether it is alright to use the frozen embryos for ESC.  

Political controversy in research arises as well:

*late '90s: The first embryonic stem cell line was created.
*2001: Bush outlaws the creation and studying of more embryonic stem cell lines with the use of federal money.  There were 21 distinct ESC lines at the time.
*2009: Obama creates the National Institute of Health (NIH) panel that will approve whether or not federal funding can be used to study certain stem cell lines.  Established guidelines state that the stem cells must come from embryos that were created through invitro fertilization but were frozen and not going to be used anymore.  Parents must provide consent for their frozen embryos to be used for stem cell research, and once approved by the NIH federal money can be used to study them.  However, federal money cannot be used to create new stem cell lines.  They must be created through private funding, and once they are created, federal funding can be used to study it.

An issue of the overall safety of the use of stem cells exists as well.  Researchers do not necessarily know what will happen when stem cells are inserted into a person, they know what they WANT to happen, but cannot guarantee what will.  Scientists have yet to be able to precisely control what cells an embryonic stem cell will differentiate into.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ping Pongis also called the double placement reaction and it means that one or more products are released before all substrates bind the enzyme. One key character of this reaction is the existence of a substituted enzyme intermediate, in which the enzyme is temporarily modified. Cassic examples of this mechanism are reactions that shuttle amino groups between amino acids and a-ketoacids. 

The enzyme aspartate aminotransferase catalyzes the transfer of an amino group from aspartate to a-ketoglutarate. 
After aspartate binds to the enzyme, the enzyme accepts aspartate’s amino group to form the substituted intermediate. The first product, oxaloacetate, departs after that. Glutamate is released as the final product after the second substrate, a-ketoglutarate binds to the enzyme and accepts the amino group from this modified enzyme. 

Enzymes with a ping-pong mechanism can exist in two states, E and a chemically modified form of the enzyme E*; this modified enzyme is known as an intermediate. In such mechanisms, substrate A binds, changes the enzyme to E* by, for example, transferring a chemical group to the active site, and is then released. Only after the first substrate is released can substrate B bind and react with the modified enzyme, regenerating the unmodified E form.

Enzymes with ping–pong mechanisms include some oxidoreductases such as thioredoxin peroxidase, transferases such as acylneuraminate cytydilyltransferase, and serine proteases such as trypsin and chymotrypsin. Serine proteases are a very common and diverse family of enzymes, including digestive enzymes (trypsin, chymotrypsin, and elastase), several enzymes of the blood clotting cascade and many others. In these serine proteases, the E* intermediate is an acyl-enzyme species formed by the attack of an active site serine residue on a peptide bond in a protein substrate. A short animation showing the mechanism of chymotrypsin is linked here.

The name pingpong reaction came for the substrates appearing to bounce on and off the enzyme to a pingpong ball in the Cleland notation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==

'Triose Phosphate Isomerase' (TPI) is an [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme Catalytic Mechanism/Isomerases|isomerase]] that catalyzes the isomerization of dihydroxyacetone phosphate to and from D-glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate.  It takes part in the glycolytic pathway, which is a biochemical pathway employed by many organisms.  The objective of this pathway is to metabolize glucose into two pyruvate molecules, also producing two ATP molecules.  Hence, TPI is an enzyme that contributes to the production of ATP, the molecules used as an energy source by all organisms.

TPI is an example of a &quot;kinetically perfect enzyme,&quot; which means that it catalyzes isomerization so quickly that the rate of reaction is determined by the diffusion rate of the substrate.  This means it isomerizes essentially every molecule of TPI specificity that it encounters.  TPI increases the rate of isomerization by ten degrees of magnitude.  Part of TPI's kinetical perfection comes from it being an isomerase; the enzyme does not have to wait for multiple substrates to bind to the active site.  Also, the mechanism (see below) involves few steps and involves the transfer of protons only.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|Proteins]] are modified by [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids/Fatty Acids|fatty acid]] on the cysteine residue which induces a [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Hydrophobic interaction|hydrophobic interactions]].  This is a very important post translation modification of proteins that diversifies proteins by enabling protein protein interactions, signal transduction and many other protein functions.  One of the widely recognized lipid linked protein is G-protein1.  
The pathway that proteins follow is now being clearly understood.  The discovery of multi-drug resistance (MDR) genes has changed the ways cells can target proteins.  Another significant discovery is that of small lipopeptied that have been found on the surface of some proteins.  Lipid modifications of proteins are important in eukaryotic cells, by increasing flexibility and increasing protein specificity.
There are three covalent lipid modification of eukaryotic cells: Myristoylation, Palmitoylation and Isoprenylation
	
== Myristoylation ==

[[File:Myristoylation.pdf‎|right|thumb|O-GlcNAc.]]
Many cellular peptides are covalently linked to a rare 14-carbon chain (acylation) on a amid bond of glycine.   Since this modification was mostly observed in the cytosol, the hydrophobic function was not the only function in this modification.  The N-myristoyl transferase was purified from yeast and mammals.  Due to the solubility and catalysis after the removal of the interior Met can be achieved using myristoyl-coenzyme A.  The acyl chain plays a more important role in the utility by an enzyme compared to the hydrophobic region 2. 
In vivo the substitution of the methylene group with S or O therefore making it more hydrophilic. Therefore this changes the distribution of proteins in the membrane.  This can be used to target drug delivery &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Palmitoylation ==

This involves a thioester bond on the cysteine residue and primary palmitric acid.  However, the mechanism that regulates this process is poorly understood due to the difficulty of purifying labile (membrane-bound palmitoyl transferases).  Another challenge is that Palmitoyl-CoA is an excellent acyl donor, but no protein sequence specifications need to be fulfilied.  Yet, it has been observed that sites of interest are located close to the transmembrane region on the cytoplam side.  Many of the proteins that are located near the cytoplasm region are palmitoylated &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Isoprenylation ==

This is a triptlet modifications at the C terminal, depending on the primary sequence of motif CAAX (C, cysteine; A, aliphatic aminoacid; X, any amino acid). The first step is to add to isoprenoid lipid farnesol to cysteine residue which will add a 15th cardon.  The second step is to protolytycally remove the AAX and carboxyl-methylation of the a-carboxyl &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

== GPI-anchored proteins ==

[[File:GPI.pdf‎|right|thumb|O-GlcNAc.]]

GPI-anchored proteins were discovered from Trypanosoma Variant Surface Glycoprotein (VSG) and mammalian Thy-1 antigen.  It has now been seen on the surface of many eukaryotic cells including humans and yeast.  A test for this bond was discovered by low using bacterial phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipases C (PI-PLC), which releases the GPI-anchore. The amid c-terminal is linked to ethanolamine which is further linked by a phosphodiester bond to tri-mannosyl glucosaminyl core glycan. On the 6th position of the insitol of the tri-mannosyl glucosaminyl core glycan a phosphatidylinositol (PI) is linked on the outer layer of the bi-layer. There are many possible variations in the glycerol group: alkyl or acyl and may also differ in chain length.  Another structural difference is that the glycan can have extra sugars some examples are aGal, /JGalNAc or aMan, and/or ethanolamine phosphate. Due to these many structural differences therefore we have many different functions that these proteins can fulfill&lt;sup&gt; 2&lt;/sup&gt;.

== Conclusion ==
 
Only four methods have been identified to modify eukaryotic proteins. However, this doesn't mean that there are no other lipid modifications of proteins.  Using metabolic labeling and SDS-PAGE to identify proteins that are regulated by lipids it was discovered that about 10-50 proteins were observed.  This may lead to a conclusion that about 10-50% are modified by lipids. One of the major functions of lipid modification of protein is localization.  Analyzing lipid modification of proteins we may better understand cell function &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== '''Definition''' ==

'''Covalent Catalysis''' is one of the four strategies that an enzyme will employ to catalyze a specific reaction. Covalent catalysis occurs when the substrate(s) in an enzymatic reaction become temporarily covalently attached to the enzyme during the catalytic reaction. In this reaction the enzyme contains a reactive group, usually a nucleophilic residue which reacts with the substrate through a nucleophilic attack. This is usually carried out by pyridine, which is a better nucleophile than water that has a pKa of 5.5. The charge loss in the reaction during transitional state will then cause hydrolysis to accelerate. The residue becomes covalently attached to the substrate throughout the catalytic reaction adding an additional intermediate which helps stabilize later transition states by lowering the activation energy. The covalent bond is then broken to regenerate enzymes. 

== '''Examples of Enzymes that Participate in Covalent Catalysis''' ==

Examples of enzymes that participate in covalent catalysis include the proteolytic enzyme [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme Catalytic Mechanism/Proteases/Chymotrypsin|Chymotrypsin]] and trypsin in which the nucleophlie is the hydroxyl group on the serine.
Chymotrypsin is a degradative protease of the digestive system. It catalyzes the cleavage of peptide bonds that are adjacent to large aromatic or nonpolar residues. It cleaves the peptide bond on the carboxyl terminus side of the protein. The chymotrypsin has three main catalytic residues termed as the catalytic triad. These are His 57, Asp 102 and Ser 195. Upon deprotonation the serine residue becomes a powerful nucleophile due to its alkoxide that will attack the relatively unreactive carbon of the carbonyl in the protein.
The figure shows the catalytic triads in neutral and deprotonated form.

Typical residues used in covalent catalysis are Lys, His, Cys, Asp, Glu, and Ser and some other coenzymes.

An example of covalent catalysis is shown below:

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''General Information'''
Enzymes commonly employ one or more strategies to catalyze specific reactions. These strategies are designed to increase the binding energy which in turn establishes substrate specificity and increases catalytic efficiency.

==Acid-Base Catalysis==
Acid-base catalysis facilitates a reaction by stabilizing the charges in the transition state through the use of an acid or base, which donates protons or accepts them, respectively.  Nucleophilic and electrophilic groups are activated as a result of the proton addition or removal and causes the reaction to proceed. Many acid-base catalysis reactions involve histidine because it has a pH close to 7, allowing it to act as both an acid and a base. An example of acid-base catalysis is peptide hydrolysis by [[Structural Biochemistry//Enzyme Catalytic Mechanism/Proteases/Chymotrypsin|'''chymotrypsin''']]. Chymotrypsin uses a histidine residue as a base catalyst to increase the nucleophilicity of serine.
Chymotrypsin uses a histindine residue as a base catalyst to help to strengthen the neucleophillic property of serine, whereas a histindine residue in carbonic anhydrase helps the removal of hydrogen ion from zinc bound water molecule to generate OH-. 

[[Image:peptide hydrolysis.JPG|thumb|The peptide hydrolysis by chymotrypsin]]

In the picture, serine acts as a nucleophile and attacks the carbonyl group of the substrate, while histidine accepts the proton from serine and the tetrahedral intermediate is formed. The collapse of the tetrahedral intermediate forms the acyl enzyme. Water loses a proton to histidine and attacks the acyl enzyme and the oxyanion hole is formed. The reaction ends with the release of a carboxylic acid. The cycle then continues with a new substrate.

Another example of acid-base catalysis is the reaction with [[Structural Biochemistry//Enzyme Catalytic Mechanism/Carbonic Anhydrase|'''carbonic anhydrase''']]. His residues in carbonic anhydrase facilitates the removal of a hydrogen ion from zinc-bound water to generate a hydroxide ion.

==Covalent Catalysis==
In covalent catalysis, the active site of an enzyme contains a reactive group, usually a powerful nucleophile, the be comes covalently attached to a part of the substrate in the course of catalysis. The covalent bonded intermediate reduces the energy of the transition state, lowering the activation energy. However, the covalent bond must be broken to regenerate the enzyme. This mechanism is found in enzymes such as proteases like chymotrypsin and trypsin, where an acyl-enzyme intermediate is formed. 

Some enzymes utilize non-amino acid cofactors to form covalent intermediates with reactant molecules. These intermediates also lower the activation energy, but the capabilities of cofactors allow enzymes to carryout reactions that amino acid side residues alone could not.

==Catalysis by Approximation==
In reactions that include two distinct substrates, the reaction rate may be enhanced by bringing the two substrates together along a single binding surface on an enzyme.

==Metal Ion Catalysis==
Metal ions can function catalytically by forming nucleophiles by direct coordination, by serving as electrophiles to stabilize a negative charge on a reactive intermediate, and by serving as a bridge between enzyme and substrate which increases the binding energy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== RNA Structural Alignment ==

Structural alignment techniques have traditionally only been applied to proteins, as they are the primary biological macromolecules that form characteristic three dimensional structures. However, large RNA molecules also form characteristic tertiary structures, which mostly consist of hydrogen bonds formed between base pairs as well as by base stacking. Functionally similar noncoding RNA molecules can be particularly difficult to extract from genomics data because structure is more strongly conserved than sequence in RNA as well as proteins, while the more limited alphabet of RNA decreases the information content of any given nucleotide at any given position. A recent method for pairwise structural alignment of RNA sequences with low sequence identity has been published and implemented in the program [http://foldalign.ku.dk/| FOLDALIGN.] This method is not truly analogous to protein structural alignment techniques because it computationally predicts the structure of the RNA input sequences rather than requiring experimentally determined structures as input. Although computational prediction of the protein folding process has not been particularly successful to date, RNA structures without pseudoknots can often be sensibly predicted using free energy-based scoring methods that account for base pairing and stacking.

&lt;u&gt;'''Oxidation-reduction enzyme'''&lt;/u&gt;

Uses coenzymes NADP+/NADPH and FAD/FADH2

In humans, this is a dimer of 478-amino acid subunits linked by disulfide bond

'''Two-stage reaction'''

&lt;u&gt;1st stage&lt;/u&gt;:
E + NADPH + H+ EH2 + NADP+

Oxidized E binds NADPH, immediately reduces FAD, producing NADP+.

E contains redox-active disulfide bond (Cys58-Cys63), which has accepted an electron pair in EH2 to form a dithiol (one S- is in a charge transfer complex with FADH-)

&lt;u&gt;2nd stage&lt;/u&gt;:
EH2 + GSSG E + 2GSH

GSSG binds to EH2

Cys58 nucleophile attacks one S of GSSG yielding mixed disulfide, promoted by His467' acting as general base

One GSH is kicked-off by protonation by His467' (general acid)

Cys63 nucleophile attacks Cys58 to form redox-active disulfide, kicking off second GSH

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Introduction'''
The globins are a related family of proteins, all of which have similar primary and tertiary structure (amino acid sequence and folding). These proteins all incorporate the globin fold. The haploid human genome contains 1 globin gene for myglobin, two genes for alpha hemoglobin, and one gene for beta hemoglobin, as well as fetal hemoglobin. Recent examination of the human genome has revealed two additional globins. 

===Neuroglobin===
Neuroglobin is expressed primarily in the brain and at especially high levels in the tetina. Neuroglobin is a monomer that reversibly binds oxygen with an affinity higher than that of hemoglobin. It also increases oxygen availability to brain tissue and provides protection under hypoxic or ischemic conditions, potentially limiting brain damage. It is of ancient evolutionary origin, and is homologous to nerve globins of invertebrates.

===Cytoglobin===
Cytoglobin is a globin molecule located in the brain and most notably utilized in marine mammals. It is thought to be a method of protection under conditions of hypoxia. The predicted function of cytoglobin is the transfer of oxygen from arterial blood to the brain.

      <text xml:space="preserve">It is an ancient and diverse family of protein. The globins of microorganisms were ignored and discovered in 1930s and rediscovered in 1950. Modern focus on them has been inspired by their structural diversity and fine-tuning to fulfill discrete functions.
at least three classes of microbial globin are recognized, all have the classic globins’ protein fold.

First is the myoglobin like haemprotein Vgb from the bacterium vitreoscilla, which is unique because of its ability to improve growth and metabolism for biotechnological gain in a variety of host cells, even though its physiological function is not well understood yet. It has roles in oxygen but the metabolism has not been proposed yet for the 2nd type of globin- truncated globins, that is disguished because it is 20-40 residues shorter than Vgb. the third and the most well understood one is called flavohaemoglobins, it was partly characterized in yeast. they are characterized by the presence of an additional domain with binding sites for FAD and NAD(P)H. they are widely spread in bacteria. 

A full understanding of microbial globins promises advances in controlling the interactions of pathogenic bacteria with their animal and plant hosts, and manipulation of microbial oxygen transfer with biotechnological applications.

'''&lt;u&gt;Phillips Mechanism&lt;/u&gt;'''

Glu35 and Asp52 are catalytic residues

Enzyme binds hexasaccharide unit, residue D distorted towards half-chair to minimize CH2OH interactions.

Glu35 transfers H+ to O1 of D ring (general acid), C1-O1 bond cleaved generating resonance-stabilized oxonium ion at C1.

Asp52 stabilizes planar (transition state binding catalysis) oxonium ion through charge-charge interactions (electrostatic catalysis), SN1 mechanism.

Enzyme releases hydrolyzed E ring with attached polysaccharide, yielding glycosyl-enzyme intermediate, H2O adds to oxonium ion to form product and reprotonated Glu35, retention of configuration is result of enzyme cleft shielding one face of oxonium ion.

Catalytic residues were identified by chemical (group specific reagents) and molecular mutagenesis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ferritin is the cell’s storage compartment for iron. It is a protein that is found in all organisms from plants and animals to bacteria and archaea. Ferritin is present mainly in the cytoplasm of the spleen, liver, and bone marrow in mammals. The amount of ferritin within a cell varies depending on the cell’s function. A molecule of ferritin protein is comprised of 24-peptide subunits. The subunits are either catalytically active H subunits or the catalytically inactive and specific to mammals, L subunits. The 24-peptide subunits form a hollow spherical shell that encases a core of iron. 

[[File:Ferritin.jpg|thumb|Ferritin sphere indicating three-fold and four-fold channels|300px|right]]Channels, or small openings which allows the transportation of certain ions or molecules in and out of the ferritin protein, are formed at the intersections of the subunits. The intersection of three-peptide subunits forms a three-fold channel. This channel is lined with the polar amino acids, Aspartate and Glutamate. The polarity allows favorable interactions with the iron ion and water, and thus serves as the passageway for iron to enter and leave the ferritin protein. The intersection of four-peptide subunits forms a four-fold channel. It is line with Leucine amino acids making it a non-polar passageway. Although it is unable to serve as a passageway for the transport of iron ions, it is thought to be the site of electron transport which plays a role in the reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) and the vice versa oxidation. The reduction and oxidation of Fe is important because it dictates whether the Fe will be stored in the ferritin protein or release into the cell. The protein molecular weight is about 445,000 and up to 4,300 atoms of Fe can be stored in the iron core. The iron is stored as ferrihydrite phosphate, [(Fe(O)(OH)&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;(FeOPO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;).xH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;], in a crystalline solid lattice. [[File:Cross_Cut_Ferritin.jpg|thumb|Cross-cut view of ferritin with iron lattice|200px|left]] It is known from tracer experiments that all the oxygen atoms in the ferrihydrite are derived from water, rather than O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The lattice structure prevents the Fe (III) atoms from becoming soluble and exiting the ferritin shell. Reduction of Fe(III) to Fe(II) allows the iron atoms to break away from the lattice in order to be released from the ferritin. A water cage forms around the Fe(II) ion as the positively charged Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; ion attracts the electronegative oxygen in H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. The polarity of the three-fold channels allows the soluble iron to pass through the channel, thus releases the iron from the ferritin. 
&lt;br /&gt;
==Regulation==
Ferritin synthesis decreases when low iron levels are present. Conversely when high iron levels are present, ferritin synthesis increases. The interaction between RNA binding proteins and the iron responsive element (IRE) region of mRNA regulates this process. Ferritin synthesis is inhibited when the two RNA proteins bind to the “stem-loop” structure of the IRE and inhibit mRNA translation. The binding proteins are called iron regulatory proteins (IRP1 and IRP2). IRP1 is regulated by the presence or scarcity of iron. When there is a scarcity of iron, IRP1 has an open configuration and is able to bind to the IRE loop and repress translation. IRP2 is regulated by its degradation in the presence of iron surplus. IRP2 is present when there is no iron, so it is able to inhibit translation. When iron is present in abundance, IRP2 degrades and ferritin synthesis can take place. The ratios of IRP1 and IRP2 are tissue specific. For example. IRP1 is more dominant in the liver, kidney, intestine, and brain tissues whereas IRP2 is more abundant in pituitary and pro-B-lymphocytic cell line. 
&lt;br /&gt;
==Transferrins &amp; Mini-ferritins==
Other iron proteins, include transferrins and mini-ferritins. Transferrins serve to transport iron as Fe(III) in the blood and other fluids. One of these has iron bound as Fe(III) by two tyrosine phenoxy groups, an aspartic acid carboxyl group, a histidine imidazole, and either HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt; or CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;2-&lt;/sup&gt;. Mini-ferritins Dps (DNA protection during starvation) proteins are present in bacteria and archaea. They are made with 12 subunits and function oppositely from ferritin. Rather than using dioxygen to concentrate iron like ferritin, mini-ferritin usues iron to detoxify dioxide and peroxide. This process protects the DNA.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Bacteria and fungi also synthesize iron transfer compounds, called siderochromes.The common structures are complex hydroxamates (also called ferrichromes or ferrioxamines) or complex catechols (enterobactin). They have peptide backbones and are very strong chelating agents (K&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; ~ 10&lt;sup&gt;30&lt;/sup&gt; to 10&lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt;), allowing the organism to extract iron from surroundings that contain very little iron or are basic enough that iron is present as insoluble hydroxides or oxides. Some of these compounds act as growth factors for bacteria and others act as antibiotics. There are also examples in which the iron is bound by a mixture of phenolic hydroxyl, hydroxamate, amine and alcoholic hydroxyl groups.
Siderochromes are substances which are excreted into the culture medium by micro- organisms in iron-deficient conditions. These compounds characteristically bind Fe3 + very strongly, and a number of them participate in the transport of iron into the cells. Siderochromes are synthesized in large amounts and excreted into the culture medium only when the bacteria 
have insufficient iron, and it forms a very stable complex with Fe(II).

      <text xml:space="preserve">Interferons are specialized proteins that come in three various classes alpha, beta and gamma. Though each varies slightly in function they are all produced by the immune system and released in the response of a pathogen as an antiviral agent. When released in the body they have the sole function of identifying infection, activating immune cells and increasing antigen production. They are used by cells as a way to warn others of the presences of a viral cell. To do this the cell releases interferons, which then send signals to close cells so they may create a protective defense. Once released the cells within the presence of the viral cell produce two enzymes called protein kinase R (PKR) and RNAse L. At the release of these enzymes RNA is destroyed and protein synthesis is reduced, thus preventing protein synthesis of the viral gene.  Interferons also have the ability to increase the activity of the p53 gene and produce numerous other proteins to help combat a viral infection.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=='''Enzyme Catalysis: Summary'''==

&lt;u&gt;Enzymes accelerate reactions using &lt;/u&gt; :

Proximity and orientation effects 

Electrostatic catalysis 

Preferential Transition State Binding 

Induced fit 

General acid/base catalysis 

Covalent catalysis 

Metal ion catalysis


Enzymes accelerate chemical reactions by lowering the activation energy,  DG‡. 

Strong binding of the transition state and weak binding of the substrate leads to the maximum rate because all the binding energy is used to lower DG‡. 

Any process that uses some of the binding energy for another purpose, e.g., a protein conformational change, will lower the maximum rate. 

Under physiological conditions, the maximum rate is achieved by maximizing kcat/Km AND having Km greater than the physiological [S]. This means that most of the enzyme will be free to interact with a substrate molecule and that every encounter will lead to a reaction.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Carboxypeptidase is a pancreatic enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of the peptide bond at the carboxyl end of proteins and peptides, with a strong preference for amino acids with an aromatic or branched aliphatic side chain. The zinc ion is bound in a 5-coordinate site by two histidine nitrogens, both oxygens from a glutamic acid carboxyl group, and a water molecule. A pocket in the protein structure accommodates the side chain of the substrate. Evidence indicates that the negative carboxyl group of the substrate hydrogen bonds to an arginine on the enzyme while the zinc bonds to the oxygen of the peptide carbonyl. A Zn-OH or Zn-OH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; combination seems to be the group that reacts with the carbonyl carbon, with assistance of a glutamic acid carboxyl group from the enzyme that assists in the transfer of H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; from the bound water to the amino acid product. An artificial peptidase model compound has been made with a Cu(II) bound by four nitrogens in a chain that ends in a guanidinium ion, all attached to a cross-linked polystyrene. The catalytic activity is high for hydrolysis of amides with carboxyl groups attached, similar to a carboxypeptidase activity. The H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; on the guanidinium group can hydrogen-bond to the carboxyl group, holding the substrate in position near the Cu, which is the active site.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Evolution is change in the genetic material of a population of organisms from one generation to the next. Evidence of evolution of enzymes have been found by examining multiple enzymes with similar characteristics. 

== Catalytic Triads ==
Catalytic triads are found in other hydrolytic enzymes similar to that in chymotrypsin. These sequences of proteins are approximately 40% identical and have nearly the same overall structure. However, these proteins differ in substrate specificity. Other members of this family include a collection of proteins that take part in blood clotting. Other enzymes that are not homologues of chymotrypsin have been found to contain very similar active sites. The presence of very similar active sites in different protein families is a consequence of convergent evolution. Furthermore, other proteases have been discovered that contain an active site serine or threonine residue that is activated by a different side chain. It can be concluded that the catalytic triad in proteases is especially effective in the hydrolysis of peptides because of its frequency of occurrence in different enzymes.

== Zinc Based Active Sites ==
Carbonic anhydrases homologous to the human enzymes are common in animals and some bacteria and algae. In addition, two other families of carbonic anhydrases have been discovered for catalytic activity. In plants, beta carbonic anhydrases are found and revealed that although it has a bound zinc ion similar to alpha carbonic anhydrases the structures are unrelated. Gamma carbonic anhydrases were discovered to have three zinc sites similar to the alpha carbonic anhydrases. Convergent evolution has generated carbonic anhydrases that rely on coordinated zinc ions at least three times.

== P-Loop Domains ==
Domains similar in NMP kinases are present in a wide array of proteins. Examples include ATP synthase, molecular motor proteins, signal transduction, and translation. The wide utility of P-loop NTPase domains is perhaps best explained by their ability to undergo substantial conformational changes.

[[Image:Lysozyme.png‎|thumbnail|Structure of a lysozyme protein]]

Lysozymes, also known as muramidase or N-acetylmuramide glycanhydrolase, are small globular protein enzymes composed of 129 [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acid]] residues. As on of the first enzymes to be studied, Alexander Fleming had shown them to be produced by phagocytes and epithelial cells (Neufeld).They are part of the glycoside hydrolase family, which are known for damaging the cell walls of bacterial cells by catalyzing hydrolysis of 1,4-beta-linkages. In a peptidoglycan, the 1,4-beta-linkages between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine are hydrolyzed; in chitodextrins, the 1,4-beta-linkages between N-acetyl-D-glucosamine residues are hydrolyzed. Lysozymes can be found in tears, human milk, saliva, and mucus. As such, lysozymes act as part of the body's defense system against bacteria. High concentrations of lysozymes can also be found in egg white. Their ability to break down bacterial cell walls in order to improve protein and nucleic extraction efficiency make lysozymes important proteins in living organisms. In human beings, the LYZ gene is responsible for encoding the lysozyme enzyme. 



==History==

Laschtschenko first discovered lysozymes in 1909, when he first observed the antibacterial property of hen egg whites. However, it wasn't until about a decade later until scientists used the term. In 1922, Alexander Fleming, who also discovered penicillin, observed the antibacterial effect of treating bacterial cultures with nasal mucus from a patient suffering a cold. As discussed above, he noticed that lysozymes were secreted from such places in the body. It wasn't, however, until 1965 that the three-dimensional structure of lysozyme was determined by David Chilton Phillips. Utilizing X-ray crystallography with a 2 angstrom resolution, a hen egg-white lysozyme model was determined, being the first enzyme structure to be observed using X-ray analysis. The lysozyme was the first enzyme structure to be solved with X-ray diffraction tools. It was also the first enzyme to be fully sequenced and determined to contain all 20 common amino acids. And mechanistically, it was the first enzyme to be well studied and understood.

==Overview==

The best studied lysozymes are from hen egg whites, from which lysozymes are abundant, and bacteriophage T4. This enzyme was the first enzyme to have its structure determined, although crystal structures of other proteins had been determined previously. Lysozymes are often easy to study through X-ray crystallography due in part to their easy ability to be isolated from egg whites and to be crystallized, features used widely in the purification of lysozymes. Lysozymes are a part of the immune system and can protect against E. coli, Salmonella, and also Pseudomonas. 



'''Lysozyme Active Site'''



Since Fleming's discovery of lysozyme, undoubtedly the most significant contribution to our knowledge concerning this enzyme was the X-ray crystallographic analysis. The [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/X-ray Crystallography|X-Ray Crystallography]] 
structure of lysozyme has been determined in the presence of a non-hydrolyzable substrate analog. This analog binds tightly in the enzyme's [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Active Site|active site]] to form the ES complex, but ES cannot be efficiently converted to EP. It would not be possible to determine the X-ray structure in the presence of the true substrate, because it would be cleaved during crystal growth and structure determination.


The active site consists of a crevice or depression that runs across the surface of the enzyme. Look at the many [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzymes]] contacts between the substrate and enzyme active site that enables the ES complex to form. There are 6 subsites within the crevice, each of which is where hydrogen bonding contacts with the [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzymes]] are made. In site D, the conformation of the sugar is distorted in order to make the necessary hydrogen bonding contacts. This distortion raises the energy of the ground state, bringing the substrate closer to the transition state for hydrolysis. &lt;ref&gt;Neufeld, Elizabeth. &quot;From Serendipity to Therapy&quot;,Annu. Rev. Biochem, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practical Uses==

Chicken-type and goose-type lysozyme have a very high anti-bacterial potential mainly against Gram-positive bacteria, this has practical uses in food, pharmaceutical, and medical industries. The lysozyme's antibacterial properties are most highly effective against those Gram-positive bacteria with a cell wall made of a peptidoglycan layer. The properties of the lysozyme have made it possible to be integrated into food packaging materials which can greatly extend the shelf-life of scarcely processed food, protecting it from microbial contamination. It has also been shown to preserve food items such as vegetables, milk, meat, etc. It has been seen to help control the production of lactic acid in the wine-making process. The pharmaceutical industry has seen success with using hen-lysozymes in inflammatory diseases, as well as bacterial and viral diseases. &lt;ref&gt;Lesnierowski G., Cegielska-Radziejewska R., 2012.

The endocrine system consists of ductless glands that work together and secrete different hormones to regulate the human body. As an information signal system, hormones regulate many functions of an organism.

There are many types of signaling involved in the endocrine system including: autocrine, paracrine, and juxtacrine. Autocrine hormones act on the secreting cell itself, paracrine hormones act only on neighboring cells, and juxtacrine hormones act either on the emitting cell or adjacent cells.

The number of glands that signal one another in a sequence is called an axis. The typical endocrine glands are the pituitary, thyroid, adrenal glands, pancreas glands, ovaries, and testes.  

==Pituitary Gland==

Also known as the hypophysis, the pituitary gland is about the size of a pea weighing 0.5g and is located at the bottom of the hypothalamus at the base of the brain and rests in a small, bony cavity (sella turcica) covered by a dural fold (diraphragma sellae). It is considered the mater gland as it secretes hormones regulating homeostasis. It is functionally connected to the hypothalamus by the median eminence. 

Anterior pituitary (adenohypophysis) synthesizes and secretes important hormones such as: ACTH, TSH, PRL, GH, endorphins, FSH, and LH and are released under the influence of the hypothalamus through the hypothalamic-hypophyseal portal system. Hypothalamic hormones travel along axons until they’re released from terminal aborizations into the blood vessels of the hypothalamic-hypophyseal portal system. They are then carried into the adenohypophysis where cells are stimulated with hormone-specific receptors which trigger a release of a certain hormone.  The anterior pituitary gland is divided into regions known as the pars tuberalis, pars intermedia, and pars distalis. 

Posterior pituitary (Neurohypophysis) stores and releases oxytocin and antidiuretic hormone (ADH and AVP). Oxytocin has a positive feedback loop and is released from the paraventricular nucleus in the hypothalamus. ADH (vasopressin) and AVP (arginine vasopressin) is released from the supraoptic nucleus in the hypothalamus. ADH is controlled by the blood osmolarity. As blood osmolarity increases, the signal leads to increased ADH release from supraoptic nucleus. If a concentrated solution is perfused near the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei, that can also signal an increase in ADH release. 

The process by which hormones are released in the neurohypophysis and the andenohypophysis are quite similar. In the neurohypophysis, the hormones are synthesized in the supraoptic and paraventricular nuclei of the hypothalamus (in the brain- most of it is synthesized in the supraoptic nucleus). These hormones are then transported to the posterior pituitary where it is stored in and released from the terminals of these neurons whose cell bodies are in the hypothalamic nuclei. These terminals are like the synaptic terminals between neurons, except for the fact that they release their &quot;transmitter&quot; into the bloodstream rather than onto other neurons. Finally, release of these hormones occur when electrical activity increases in the hypothalamic cells that project into the neurohypophysis. In the adenohypophysis, the release of hormones synthesized and stored by the cells is controlled by local hormones produced by cells in the hypothalamus. These hypothalamic hormones (called release hormones or release-inhibit hormones) are all peptides. These releasing hormones are transported along axons of the hypothalamic neurons, where they are released from terminal arborizations that resemble synapses. The synapses end on the blood vessels of a portal system in the median eminence of the hypophyseal stalk (a portal system being a collection of veins that connect capillary beds in two organs rather than connecting the capillary bed in an organ with the rest of the circulation). The releasing hormones are then carried by the blood to the adenohypophysis where they stimulate cells with hormone-specific receptors to release their stored hormones.
Intermediate lobe produces melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH).

Functions:
The pituitary hormones help control: growth, blood pressure, breast milk production, sex organ functions in both sexes, thyroid gland function, metabolism, water regulation, secretion of ADH to control water absorption in the kidneys and temperature regulation.

==Thyroid Gland==

Located in the neck below the thyroid cartilage, the thyroid controls the rate at which the body burns energy, makes proteins, and controls sensitivity to hormones. The thyroid produces its own hormones including thyroxine (T&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;) and triiodothyronine (T&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) which regulate the rate of metabolism and affect the growth and functional rate of other systems in the body. 

Controlled by the hypothalamus and pituitary gland, the thyroid gland gets its name from the Greek &quot;shield&quot; after the shape of the thyroid cartilage. 

The most common problems involving the thyroid gland include: hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism. Hyperthyroidism is an overactive thyroid while hypothyroidism is an underactive thyroid.

==Parathyroid Gland==
The important hormone is parathyroid hormone (PTH) and is regulated by calcium in blood. Its main function is to raise blood calcium level. It is secreted by parathyroid glands, causes bone to release Ca2+ in the kidneys. PTH also stimulates the kidneys to activate vitamin D, promoting intestinal uptake of Ca2+ from food. 

==Adrenal Gland==

Also known as the suprarenal gland, the star-shaped adrenal gland sits on top of the kidneys and is responsible for releasing hormones in conjunction with stress through the synthesis of corticosteroids and catecholamines using cortisol and adrenaline, respectively. 

The adrenal cortex is vital to the synthesis of corticosteroid hormones from cholesterol. The source of cortisol and corticosterone synthesis is the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Under normal unstressed conditions, the human adrenal glands produce the equivalent of 35–40&amp;nbsp;mg of cortisone acetate each day. They also have other functions which include producing androgens (like testoserone)and regulating water and electrolyte concentrations via secretion of aldosterone. The adrenal cortex is regulated by neuroendocrine hormones secreted by the pituitary gland renin-angiotensin system, and hypothalamus.

The three layers of the adrenal cortex are: zona glomerulosa, zona fasciculata, and zona reticularis. Zona glomerulosa is the site for production of mineralocorticoids  which affect the body's sodium homeostasis. Zona fasciculata produces glucocorticoids in humans. Cortisol secretion is simulated by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) from the anterior pituitary. In the absence of ACTH, zona fasciculata secretes a basal level of cortisol. Zona reticularis produces mainly dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) and DHEA sulfate.

The adrenal medulla is the core of the adrenal gland and is surrounded by the adrenal cortex as it releases secretions directly into the blood stream. The chomaffin cells of the medula are the main source of circulating water-soluble catecholamines derived from the amino acid tyrosine: adrenaline (epinephrine) and noradrenaline(norepinephrine). This is party of the fight-or-flight response initiated by the nervous system. 

Arteries and veins supply blood to the adrenal gland. The superior suprarenal artery is provided by the inferior phrenic. The middle suprarenal artery is provided by the abdominal aorta and the inferior suprarenal artery is provided by the renal artery. The right suprarenal vein drains the inferior vena cava and the left suprarenal vein drains the left renal vein also known as the left inferior phrenic vein. The suprarenal veins may form anastomoses ( the branching out and reconnection of blood vessels) with the inferior phrenic veins.

==Pancreas Gland==

Situated deep within the abdomen between the stomach and the spine, it is known as the both the double gland and the mixed gland because it has both endocrine and exocrine functions. As an endocrine gland, it secretes hormones into the bloodstream. When it comes to its function as an exocrine gland, it plays a pivotal role in the secretion of enzymes to help break down carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and acids in the duodenum. More importantly, the pancreas gland secretes the insulin hormone, which regulates sugar metabolism. Too little insulin would result in high blood sugar levels in addition to muscle and body weakness (a condition known as diabetes). 

Observing the functionality of the pancreas gland reveals its involvement in the production of chemicals that are critical to
proper digestion and blood sugar regulation. Besides its role in the secretion of the body's important enzymes, the pancreas gland
also creates digestive juices as a member of the exocrine system. These fluids play a key role in breaking down the nutrients that
the stomach acids were incapable of metabolizing. The juices initially are alkaline in the pancreas but as they make their way
through the stomach where they meet other substances, they become acidic.

==Ovaries==

The ovaries, situated in the pelvis with each ovary on opposite sides of the uterus, are a pair of female reproductive organs. To give you a sense of the shape and size of an ovary, we can consider it quite similar to the size and shape of an almond. Ovaries specifically have two functions: they produce eggs and just like the other glands of the endocrine system, they produce female hormones. 

The ovaries are in fact the main source of female hormones, which include estrogen and progesterone. These hormones play a pivotal role in controlling the development of female body characteristics, such as the breasts, body shape, and body hair. More importantly, the ovaries also regulate the menstrual cycle and pregnancy. 

==Testes==

The testes is the male reproductive organ held responsible for the production and storage of millions of tiny sperm cells. The testicles are oval-shaped and can grow to about five centimeters in length and 3 centimeters in diameter. The testes do indeed play a pivotal role in the endocrine system due its production of hormones, namely testosterone. As a young man reaches puberty, his testes actually produce more and more of this hormone. More importantly, this hormone causes boys to have deeper voices, bigger muscles, grow facial and body hair, and stimulate the production of sperm. 

==Hypothalamus==

It is a portion of the brain containing some small nuclei with a variety of functions. It plays a central role in integrating the endocrine and nervous systems. The hypothalamus is located below thalamus, just above the brain stem. The hypothalamus receives information from nerves throughout the body and from other parts of the brain. Signals from the hypothalamus travel to the pituitary gland, which is located at the base. Some produce directacting hormones that are stored and released from the posterior pituitary. Other hypothalamic cells produce hormones that are transported by portal blood vessels to the anterior pituitary. These hormones either promote or inhibit the release of hormones from the anterior pituitary.

The way in which the hypothalamus promotes or inhibits the release of hormones from the anterior pituitary is through the use of a portal vein system and hormone-releasing hormones. Hormone-releasing hormones include, Growth hormones, Prolactin, Folicle-stimulating hormone, Luteinizing hormone, Thyroid-Stimulating Hormone, and ACTH. These hormones are released by the anterior pituitary upon promotion of their release via hormone-releasing hormones such as antidieuretic hormone, ADH. Once these hormones reach the anterior pituitary gland via the portal vein connected the hypothalamus and the gland, the hormones are secreted into the bloodstream and taken up by their specific receptors throughout the body. 

The effect of any hormone on a cell depends on the cell's intracellular machinery. Hormones only affect the specific receptors to their appropriate receptor molecules in their membranes. Their is little effect of these hormones on other types of cells due to receptor specificity. 
An example of this is that in the smooth muscle fibers of the blood vessel walls, catecholamines produce contraction but in the liver, catecholamines make it possible for the breakdown of glycogen and the release of glucose into the bloodstream.

==Hormones==

Tropic hormones
It is a hormone that regulates the function of endocrine cells or glands. It is also produced and secreted by anterior pituitary that target endocrine glands. 
Tropic hormones include TSH, follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luterinizing hormone (LH), and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH).  The main target ofFSH and LH are testes or ovaries. 

Nontropic hormones include prolactin (PRL) and melanocyte-stimulating hormone (MSH). 

Growth hormone is secreted by the anterior pituitary and stimulates growth through tropic and nontropic effects. The major targets are liver, bones, and other tissues. 

Some hormones have very specific targets while others affect essentially all cells of the body. Most hormones belong to one of a few basic families: the peptides, the amino acid derivatives, and the proteins. Many endocrine glands secrete more than one hormone each. When this is the case, the hormones secreted by a gland belong to the same family. In general, each family operates by a characteristic mechanism to regulate the function of target cells. All of them must first bind to receptor molecules that specifically recognize hormones. Protein and peptide hormones bind to membrane surface receptors and through a series of reactions involving small cytoplasm molecules called &quot;second messengers&quot; and enzymes called protein kinases. These hormones modify the activity levels of proteins within the cytoplasm by causing them to be phosphorylated on particular amino acid residues. Also, these peptides and protein hormones are charged at normal pH and cannot cross cell membranes. These hormones therefore must bind to the extracellular domain of g-protein coupled receptors. On the other hand, steroid hormones and thyroid hormones are hydrophobic. Due to their physical properties, steroid hormones and thyroid hormones must bind to intracellular receptors, which allow them to move into the nucleus bound to their receptors, directly affecting the transcription of genes.

When level of hormone is too high, the normal effects of hormones are exaggerated. This effect is known as hypersecretion. The causes of hypersecretion include benign and malignant tumors of the endocrine glands. Imbalance of hormones in the body can also come from outside of the body, known as exogenous hormones or agonists. The introduction of exogenous hormones in the body is known as iatrogenic. For example, when certain hormones such as cortisol in the body is introduced, it causes the shutdown of the secretion of hypothalamus and anterior pituitary glands. This causes the loss of cell mass, called atrophy. In contrast, hormone deficiency in the body is called hyposecretion. The main cause of hyposecretion is from atrophy of the gland due to a certain disease process.

The specificity of the response to any hormone lies in the properties of the receiving cells and not in the delivery of those hormones to the cells. Only the cells with the appropriate receptor molecules respond, even to the steroid hormones that will dissolve through the membranes of all cells. The effect that any hormone has on any particular cell depends upon the cell's own intracellular machinery. When a hormone binds to its specific receptors on different kinds of cells, the effect depends upon the nature of the cell.

==Hormonal control==
Hormonal control involves a negative feedback loop and thus homeostasis within the body. Many types of hormones exist in the body and thus many different feedback loops exist for the systems. Some of them are very simple, others are very complex.

A simple example of hormonal control is the feedback loop for Insulin. Insulin is released into the bloodstream via blood cells of the pancreas, and it controls the rate at which most cells remove glucose from the bloodstream. Insulin is synthesized and stored in pancreatic beta cells. The synthesis and the release of insulin are triggered by the increase of glucose in the bloodstream. Other signals such as an increase in amino acid concentration in the blood, the presence of several other hormones, and neural control, have an effect on the increase of insulin into the bloodstream. Hormone signals are always terminated by either the binding of the hormone to its specific receptor and the breakdown of the hormone via bloodstream enzymes.

==Background Information==
There are many kinds of oxidation states of metals especially transition metals. The stability of a given oxidation state is a comparison between the ionization energy required to remove electrons from the valence orbitals and the solvation or ligation energy obtained by surrounding the metal cation with solvent or [[Structural Biochemistry/Protein function/Ligand|ligand]] atoms. Oxidation-Reduction reactions, otherwise known as redox reactions, are involved in a wide range of vital natural processes. Examples include the rusting of iron, respiration process, and the browning of certain foods. Redox reactions are also used in the operation of batteries.

Oxidation is the loss of electrons, and reduction is the gain of electrons. Each atom in a molecule is assigned an oxidation number or the oxidation state. Besides, the oxidation number for each element in a binary ionic compound equals the ionic charge. The oxidation number for each element in a covalent compound is not obvious because the atoms do not have whole charges. [The Molecular Nature of Matter and Change].

Oxidation states are assigned to metals based on a couple of different rules. These numbers that are assigned are useful in the quest of describing and determining oxidation/reduction reactions and redox equation balancing. It is important to remember that oxidation states do not suggest the compound's charge, but rather for use in balancing reactions. Some metals have fixed oxidation states while others such as iron have numerous oxidation states that are possible! &lt;ref name=&quot;Oxidation State&quot;&gt;[http://www.science.uwaterloo.ca/~cchieh/cact/c123/oxidstat.html Oxidation State], October 28, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The current concept of &quot;oxidation state&quot; was introduced by W. M. Latimer in 1938. Oxidation itself was first studied by Antoine Lavoisier, who believed that oxidation was always the result of reactions with oxygen, thus the name. Although Lavoisier's idea has been shown to be incorrect, the name he proposed is still used, albeit more generally.
Oxidation states were one of the intellectual &quot;stepping stones&quot; Mendeleev used to derive the modern periodic table.

==Oxidation States==
In order to determine whether a chemical reaction is a oxidation-reduction reaction, we must look at all the oxidation numbers (oxidation states) at all the elements involved in the reaction. To do so there are a set of rules to follow when assigning oxidation numbers. 
*An atom in its pure/elemental form, the oxidation state is always zero.
*Monoatomic ions have an oxidation state equal to the charge of the ion. For example, K+ would have an oxidation number of +1, S^2- would have an oxidation state of -2.
#keep in mind that alkali metal ions always have a +1 charge which means all group 1A metals always have an oxidation number of +1. The same rule applies to Group 2A having a +2 state and Aluminum possessing a +3 oxidation number.
*Nonmetals will usually have a negative oxidation number, however there are exceptions:
#Oxygen usually has a -2 oxidation number in both ionic and molecular compounds. However, compounds with peroxide, O2^2-, gives each oxygen an oxidation state of -1.
#Hydrogen has a +1 charge when bonding to nonmetals and a -1 charge when bonding to metals. 
#The oxidation state of Fluorine is -1 in all compounds. 
*The sum of all oxidation numbers within a neutral compound must be zero. The sum of the oxidation numbers of a polyatomic ion must equal the number of the charge.  
For example, consider the reaction: zinc metal added to a strong acid

Zn(s) + 2H+(aq) -&gt; Zn2+(aq) + H2(g)
The oxidation state of Zinc metal = 0.
The oxidation state of H+ = +1.
The Oxidation state of Zn2+ = +2.
The oxidation state of H2 = 0.
The sum is equal to zero because there are 2 H+ ions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Interferons''' are specialized proteins that come in three various classes alpha, beta and gamma. Though each varies slightly in function they are all produced by the immune system and released in the response of a pathogen as an antiviral agent. When released in the body they have the sole function of identifying infection, activating immune cells and increasing antigen production. They are used by cells as a way to warn others of the presences of a viral cell. To do this the cell releases interferons, which then send signals to close cells so they may create a protective defense. Once released the cells within the presence of the viral cell produce two enzymes called protein kinase R (PKR) and RNAse L. At the release of these enzymes [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/RNA|RNA]] is destroyed and protein synthesis is reduced, thus preventing [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|protein]] synthesis of the viral gene.  Interferons also have the ability to increase the activity of the p53 gene and produce numerous other proteins to help combat a viral infection.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The nervous system functions by the almost instantaneous transmission of electrochemical signals. Highly specialized cells called neurons control the means of transmission. They are also the functional unit of the nervous system.
The neuron is an elongated cell with three parts dendrites, cell body, and axon.

The typical neurone contains many dendrites which appear to look like thin branches that extend from the long branch of the cell body. The axon is a single long projection that extends from the cell body. It usually ends in a few small branches called axon terminals. These neurons are usually connected in chains and networks. They are physically close together, yet never actually come in contact with one another. The gap that separates the axon terminals of one neuron from the dendrites of another neuron is called the synse.

When an electrical impulse moves through the neuron, it starts at the dendrites. From there, it passes through the cell body along the axon. Impulses always follow the same path from the dendrite to the cell body, and then the axon. When the electrical impulse reaches the synapse at the end of the axon, special chemicals called neurotransmitters are released. The neurotransmitters will carry a signal across the synapse to the dendrites of the next neuron to restart the process in the next cell.


When there is no impulse traveling through a neuron, the cell is said to be at its resting potential. The inside of the cell contains a negative charge in relation to the outside. The cell requires energy to maintain this negative charge. The cell membrane of the neuron contains a protein called Na+/K+ ATPase that uses the energy provided by one molecule of ATP to pump 3 positively charged sodium molecules out of the cell. It also simultaneously takes into the cell 2 positively charged potassium ions. Thus, there is a high concentration of sodium ions outside the cell and an excess of potassium ions inside the cell. A sodium leak channel allows some of the potassium ions to flow out of the cell. Nonetheless, the difference in concentrations creates a net potential difference across the cell membrane of about -70mV, which is the value of the resting potential.
action potential The action potential is the electrochemical impulse that can travel along the neuron. The neuron membrane also contains voltage-gated proteins. These proteins will respond to changes in the membrane potential by opening and allowing certain ions to cross that would normally not be allowed to do so. The neuron has both voltage-gated sodium channels and voltage-gated potassium channels. Each one will open under different circumstances.
The action potential will being when another neuron sends chemical signals to depolarize, or make less negative, the potential of the cell membrane in one localized area of the cell membrane- usually in dendrites. When the neuron is stimulated so that the cell membrane potential reaches -50mV, the voltage-gated sodium channels in that region will open up. The voltage at which these channels open up is called the threshold potential. (in this case, the threshold potential is -50). When the voltage-gated channels open, the sodium ions outside the cell will follow the concentration gradient and rush into the cell. The flood of sodium ions will cause the cell to depolarize and eventually the membrane potential will increase to +35mV. At this point, the voltage-gated sodium channel will close and the voltage-gated potassium channel will reach their threshold and open up. The positive potassium ions concentrated in the cell will now rush out of the neuron to repolarize the cell membrane to its negative resting potential. The membrane potential will now drop to -90mV and the voltage-gated potassium channels will close. After this occurs, the potassium leak channels will restore the membrane back to its original state with a potential of -70mV. This whole process will take place in about one millisecond.

==VERTEBRATE NERVOUS SYSTEM==

The vertebrate nervous system can be divided into 2 main parts: the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The central nervous system acts as a central command that receives sensory input from all regions of the body and integrates the information toe create a response. It controls most of the basic functions that are needed for survival, such as breathing, digestion, and consciousness. On the other hand, the peripheral nervous system refers to pathways through which the central nervous system communicates with the rest of the organism. In highly evolved systems, such as the human nervous system, there are 3 types of neural binding blocks: sensory, motor, and interneurons.
sensory neurons send information to the central nervous system after the organ's sense organs receive a stimulus from the environment. Another name for these neurons is afferent neurons.
motor neurons carry information away from the central nervous system to an organ or muscle as a response to a stimulus or a voluntary action. Another name for these neurons is efferent neurons.
interneurons provide connection between sensory neurons and motor neurons.
CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM It consists of the brain and the spinal chord. The spinal cord a long cylinder cord that extends along the vertebral column back bone from the head to the lower back.
The brain is made of almost entirely interneurons. The cerebrum is the largest portion of the brain and controls consciousness. It controls all voluntary movement, perception, sensory perception, speech, memory, and creative thought. The cerebellum helps to fine-tune voluntary movement, but does not initiate it. It makes sure that movements are coordinated and balanced. The brainstem is responsible for the control of involuntary functions, such as breathing, cardiovascular regulation, and swallow. It is a portion of the medulla oblongata, which is essential for life and processes a great deal of information. The medulla also helps maintain alertness. The hypothalamus is responsible for maintenance of homeostasis. It regulates temperature, controls hunger, manages water balance and helps to generate emotion.
The spinal cord contains 3 types of neurons: axons, interneurons, and glial cells. Axons of motor neurons extend from the spinal column into the peripheral nervous system. Interneurons link motor and sensory neurons. Glial cells provide physical and metabolic support for neurons. It serves as a link between the body and the brain so that it can regulate simple reflexes
THE PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM It is a sensory system that carries information from the senses into the central nervous system from the body and motor system that branches out from the CN to organs or muscles. The motor system can be divided into 2 parts: somatic system and the autonomic system
The somatic nervous system is responsible for voluntary or conscious movement. Neurons will only target skeletal muscles needed for bodily movement. All of the neurons in the somatic system release acetylcholine, an excitatory neurotransmitter that causes skeletal muscles to contract.
The autonomic nervous system controls tissues other than skeletal muscles. It controls processes that an animal that does not have voluntary control over, such as heart beat, movement of the digestive tract, and contraction of the bladder. It can be subdivided into sympathetic division and parasympathetic division. Sympathetic division works to prepare the body for emergency situations. It increases heart rate, dilates pupils, and increases breathing rate. It also stimulates the medulla of the adrenal glands to release epinephrine and norepinephrine into he bloodstream. Together, it creates the &quot;fight of flight&quot; response. The parasympathetic division is most active when the boy is at rest. It slows the heart rate, increases digestion, and slows breathing. it creates the &quot;rest and digest&quot; response.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Cotransporters==

Cotransporters are protein pumps used to export or import small molecules. It is sometimes equated with [[Structural Biochemistry/Membrane Proteins/Symporters|symporter]], but the term &quot;cotransporter&quot; refers both to symporters and [[Structural Biochemistry/Membrane Proteins/Antiporters|antiporters]] (though not [[Structural Biochemistry/Membrane Proteins/Uniporters|uniporters]]). They utilize active transport, meaning that they require some sort of energy to carry out its process.  Cotransporters are secondary active transporters, which means they use an electrochemical gradient as a means of energy. It works by binding to two molecules or ions at a time and using the gradient of one solute's concentration to force the other molecule or ion against its gradient.

Primary [[Structural Biochemistry/Membrane Proteins/Active Transport|active transporters]], on the other hand, use chemical energy like ATP. The electrochemical gradient for the cotransporter is due to the movement of Na + and H+ ions. This powers the movement of another substance that is pumped either in or out, against the concentration gradient. An example is the movement of glucose. In order for the transportation of glucose to be in the opposite direction of the concentration gradient, sodium ions are needed. Na+ ions are moved across the cell membrane by a transmembrane voltage gradient (movement from an area of positive charge to negative charge), and by a concentration gradient (from an area of high concentration to low concentration). Glucose is then coupled and moved against its concentration gradient. When the Na+ ion, an example of a cotransported ion, moves in the same direction as the coupled substance, it is call symporter; movement in the opposite direction of a substance is called antiporter.

==Transport of glucose in animal cells by symporters==

A [[Structural Biochemistry/Membrane Proteins/Symporters|symporter]] is an integral membrane protein that is involved in movement of two or more different molecules or ions across a phospholipid membrane such as the plasma membrane in the same direction, and is therefore a type of cotransporter. Cotransporters are used for the transport of glucose in the cell. Glucose is needed in different organs, but there is already an abundance of glucose in these areas. This prevents glucose from entering by passive transport. Active transport is thus used, using a 2Na+/1Glucose symporter.  The transporter moves one glucose in for every two sodium ion, and moves them out in the same ratio. 
What forces are used to drive the substances in and out of the cells? As mentioned before, the electrochemical gradient and the concentration gradient of the Na+ ion allows this process to happen. 

This is done by the free energy change ([[Structural Biochemistry/Free energy#ΔG|ΔG]]) of transportation of Na+ ions. The concentration of Na+ ions is either higher or lower inside the cell than outside. The charge of the cell is also either inside negative or inside positive. The flow of Na+ ions is either to the inside or the outside, depending on which side has more Na+ ions and the charge of each side. Na+, like all particles, will go from an area of low concentration to high concentration. In addition, Na+ will move from an area of positive charge to negative charge, until there is a balance between the concentration of Na+ and a balance between the charges. This is the equilibrium potential, and it can be calculated by the Nernst equation. 
There is a free energy change of the cell for the transport of Na+ ions, which will affect the concentration of glucose inside and outside the membrane.

==Transport of calcium ions from cardiac muscle cells by antiporter==

An [[Structural Biochemistry/Membrane Proteins/Antiporters|antiporter]] (also called exchanger or counter-transporter) is an integral membrane protein which is involved in secondary active transport of two or more different molecules or ions (i.e. solutes) across a phospholipid membrane such as the plasma membrane in opposite directions.

In secondary active transport, one species of solute moves along its electrochemical gradient, allowing a different species to move against its own electrochemical gradient. This movement is in contrast to primary active transport, in which all solutes are moved against their concentration gradients, fueled by ATP.

Antiporters play a key role in movement of calcium ions out of cardiac muscle cells. For every 3 Na+ ions out (or in) the membrane, 1 Ca2+ ions are pumped oppositely in (or out) the membrane. This is significant for different physiological functions, such as relaxation of cardiac muscles, maintenance of calcium ion concentration in different cellular organelles, control of neurosecretion, and other functions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The nervous system functions by the almost instantaneous transmission of electrochemical signals. Highly specialized cells called neurons control the means of transmission. They are also the functional unit of the nervous system.
The neuron is an elongated cell with three parts: dendrites, cell body, and an axon.
[[Image:neuron.gif|thumb|alt=neuron|neuron]]
The typical neurone contains many dendrites which appear to look like thin branches that extend from the long branch of the cell body. The axon is a single long projection that extends from the cell body. It usually ends in a few small branches called axon terminals. Is is also covered by the myelin sheath to promote neural impulses, or to ensure the signals get transferred smoothly and quickly. Neurons are usually connected in chains and networks. They are physically close to each other, yet never actually come in contact with one another. The gap that separates the axon terminals of one neuron from the dendrites of another neuron is called the synse.

When an electrical impulse moves through the neuron, it starts at the dendrites. Basically, dendrites receive messages from other cells. From there, it passes through the cell body along the axon. Impulses always follow the same path from the dendrite to the cell body, and then the axon. When the electrical impulse reaches the synapse at the end of the axon, special chemicals called neurotransmitters are released. The neurotransmitters will carry a signal across the synapse to the dendrites of the next neuron to restart the process in the next cell. They, as chemical messengers, are called agonists because they open cellular locks or receptors to communicate between the outside and inside of the cell (Medicines by Design 10-11), just like a key fitting into lock. 

'''RESTING POTENTIAL'''
[[Image:restingpotential.gif|thumb|alt=resting potential|resting potential]]
When there is no impulse traveling through a neuron, the cell is said to be at its resting potential. The inside of the cell contains a negative charge in relation to the outside. The cell requires energy to maintain this negative charge. The cell membrane of the neuron contains a protein called Na+/K+ ATPase that uses the energy provided by one molecule of ATP to pump 3 positively charged sodium molecules out of the cell. At the same time, it brings in 2 positively charged K+ ions, creating a system that has a higher concentration of Na+ on the outside and K+ on the inside. A sodium leak channel allows some of the potassium ions to flow out of the cell. Nonetheless, the difference in concentrations creates a net potential difference across the cell membrane of about -70mV, which is the value of the resting potential.
The action potential is the electrochemical impulse that can travel along the neuron. The neuron membrane also contains voltage-gated proteins. These proteins will respond to changes in the membrane potential by opening and allowing certain ions to cross that would normally not be allowed to do so. The neuron has both voltage-gated sodium channels and voltage-gated potassium channels. Each one will open under different circumstances.

The action potential will begin when another neuron sends chemical signals to depolarize, or make less negative, the potential of the cell membrane in one localized area of the cell membrane- usually in dendrites. When the neuron is stimulated so that the cell membrane potential reaches -50mV, the voltage-gated sodium channels in that region will open up. The voltage at which these channels open up is called the threshold potential. (in this case, the threshold potential is -50). When the voltage-gated channels open, the sodium ions outside the cell will follow the concentration gradient and rush into the cell. The flood of sodium ions will cause the cell to depolarize and eventually the membrane potential will increase to +35mV. At this point, the voltage-gated sodium channel will close and the voltage-gated potassium channel will reach their threshold and open up. The positive potassium ions concentrated in the cell will now rush out of the neuron to repolarize the cell membrane to its negative resting potential. The membrane potential will now drop to -90mV and the voltage-gated potassium channels will close. After this occurs, the potassium leak channels will restore the membrane back to its original state with a potential of -70mV. This whole process will take place in about one millisecond.

'''VERTEBRATE NERVOUS SYSTEM'''
[[Image:nervoussystem.gif|thumb|alt=nervous system|nervous system]]
The vertebrate nervous system can be divided into 2 main parts: the central nervous system (CNS) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). The central nervous system acts as a central command that receives sensory input from all regions of the body and integrates the information toe create a response. It controls most of the basic functions that are needed for survival, such as breathing, digestion, and consciousness. On the other hand, the peripheral nervous system refers to pathways through which the central nervous system communicates with the rest of the organism. In highly evolved systems, such as the human nervous system, there are 3 types of neural binding blocks: sensory, motor, and interneurons.
Sensory neurons send information to the central nervous system after the organ's sense organs receive a stimulus from the environment. Another name for these neurons is afferent neurons.
Motor neurons carry information away from the central nervous system to an organ or muscle as a response to a stimulus or a voluntary action. Another name for these neurons is efferent neurons.
Interneurons provide connection between sensory neurons and motor neurons.

'''CENTRAL NERVOUS SYSTEM''' 

The CNS consists of the brain and the spinal chord and plays a role in the communication between sensory receptors, muscles, and glands. The spinal cord is a long cylinder cord that extends along the vertebral column back bone from the head to the lower back.
The brain is made of almost entirely interneurons. The cerebrum is the largest portion of the brain and controls consciousness. It controls all voluntary movement, perception, sensory perception, speech, memory, and creative thought. The cerebellum helps to fine-tune voluntary movement, but does not initiate it. It makes sure that movements are coordinated and balanced. The brainstem is responsible for the control of involuntary functions, such as breathing, cardiovascular regulation, and swallow. It is a portion of the medulla oblongata, which is essential for life and processes a great deal of information. The medulla also helps maintain alertness. The hypothalamus is responsible for maintenance of homeostasis. It regulates temperature, controls hunger, manages water balance and helps to generate emotion.

The spinal cord contains 3 types of neurons: axons, interneurons, and glial cells. Axons of motor neurons extend from the spinal column into the peripheral nervous system. Interneurons link motor and sensory neurons. Glial cells provide physical and metabolic support for neurons. It serves as a link between the body and the brain so that it can regulate simple reflexes

'''THE PERIPHERAL NERVOUS SYSTEM'''
 
It is a sensory system that carries information from the senses into the central nervous system from the body and motor system that branches out from the CN to organs or muscles. The motor system can be divided into 2 parts: somatic system and the autonomic system, however, the two systems work together to ensure a proper internal states to avoid any extreme responses. 

The somatic nervous system is responsible for voluntary or conscious movement. Neurons will only target skeletal muscles needed for bodily movement. All of the neurons in the somatic system release acetylcholine, an excitatory neurotransmitter that causes skeletal muscles to contract.

The autonomic nervous system controls tissues other than skeletal muscles. It controls processes that an animal that does not have voluntary control over, such as heart beat, movement of the digestive tract, and contraction of the bladder. It can be subdivided into sympathetic division and parasympathetic division. Sympathetic division works to prepare the body for emergency situations. It increases heart rate, dilates pupils, and increases breathing rate. It also stimulates the medulla of the adrenal glands to release epinephrine and norepinephrine into he bloodstream. Together, it creates the &quot;fight of flight&quot; response. The parasympathetic division is most active when the body is at rest. It slows the heart rate, increases digestion, and slows breathing. it creates the &quot;rest and digest&quot; response.

'''PARKINSON'S DISEASE'''

Parkinson’s Disease (PD) is a degenerative disorder affecting the nervous system. This is caused by low levels of the neurotransmitter dopamine produced in the brain. Evident symptoms include trembling or stiffness in body limbs or face, instability in posture, or lack of balance and body coordination. These symptoms can cause labor in simple tasks, such as walking and talking. The severity in the impairment of the motor skills differ between individuals. Some may become critically disabled and others may only suffer from minor motor trembling. This is a chronic disease that usually affects people around the age of 50. There is no cure for this disease, therefore, the symptoms progressively worsens over time.  

'''Wilson Disease'''

The Wilson Disease is a inherited mutation on chromosome 13. This disorder causes a person's body from removing excess build up of copper. The protein that is in charge of the removal of copper is ceruloplasmin. With the inability for one to be able to remove copper can lead to cirrhosis, which is the damaging of liver cells and hindering the liver function. Evident symptoms of having the Wilson Disease is having extreme body tremors and decrease in speed in body movement. Also, the person's mental capabilities will decrease and emotionally sensitive, especially temperamental. Treatment can include avoid eating any food that contains copper or chelating the excess copper to remove from the body.

'''Neuroglobin and Cytoglobin''' are two new heme-containing repiratory proteins, which were revealed through the human genome sequence. These proteins are both monomeric, and are structurally similar to myoglobin more than hemoglobin. The expression of neuroglobin is restricted to the brain and is mostly observed in the retina. Its roles include protecting neural tissue from hypoxia and insufficient oxygenation of the blood, through its roles in neuronal oxygen homeostasis. Cytoglobin on the other hand is expressed mainly in fibroblasts and other similar cells throughout the body, and may be involved in collagen synthesis. Spectroscopy data has shown that both proteins have the proximal and sital histidines coordinated to iron in the deoxy form and the distal histidine is displaced on oxygen binding.

[[File:Neuroglobin.png|150px|right|Neuroglobin]]
== History of Neuroglobin ==
Neuroglobin was first identified by an Italian researcher, Thorsten Burmester et al. in 2000, and the 3D structure of the neuroglobin of human body was discovered in 2003. In 2004, the neuroglobin of murine was determined at a further highly resolution.

== Functions of Neuroglobin ==
Neuroglobin, has the symbol of NGB, is an intracellular hemoprotein that involved in cellular oxygen homeostasis. Neuroglobin is a monomer which expressed in the central nervous system, retina, endocrine tissues, and cerebrospinal fluid. Neuroglobin reversibly binds oxygen with affinity which is higher than hemoglobin, and also increase the existence of oxygen in brain tissue and gives the protection under ischemic or hypoxic conditions in order to limiting the brain damages.
[[File:PDB 1urv EBI.jpg|250px|right|PDB 1urv EBI]]
== Functions of Cytoglobin ==
Cytoglobin is the protein product that can be found in human body and mammalian.
Just like the Neuroglobin, Cytoglobin is also a globin molecule located in the brain of mostly marine mammals. It has always been considered to be a method to protect the brain under the condition called hypoxia.Cytoglobin is also the transferring reagent of oxygen from arterial blood to the brain.
Cytoglobin is a hexacoordinate hemoglobin. It may scavenge reactive oxygen species such as nitric oxide, and also facilitate diffusion of oxygen through tissues, or serve a protective function during oxidative stress

'''Metal ion catalysis''', or electrostatic catalysis, is a specific mechanism that utilizes metalloenzymes with tightly bound metal ions such as Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Cu&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Zn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mn&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Co&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ni&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mo&lt;sup&gt;6+&lt;/sup&gt; (the first three being the most commonly used) to carry out a catalytic reaction. This area of catalysis also includes metal ions which are not tightly bound to a metalloenzyme, such as Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, Mg&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. 

Enzymes can catalyze a reaction by the use of metals. Metals often facilitate the catalytic process in different ways. The metals can either assist in the catalyic reaction, activate the enzyme to begin the catalysis or they can inhibit reactions in solution. Metals activate the enzyme by changing its shape but are not actually involved in the catalytic reaction. 
 
First, the metal can make it easier to form a nucleophile which is the case of [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme Catalytic Mechanism/Carbonic Anhydrase|'''carbonic anhydrase''']] and other enzymes. In this case, the metal facilitates the release of a proton from a bound water to produce a nucleophilic hydroxide ion and start the catalytic reaction. With the polarization of the O-H bond, the acidity of the bound water can increase. Equally important, the metal can promote the production of an electrophile which in turn stabilizes the negative charge on the intermediate. Also, metals can promote binding of the enzyme and substrate by acting as a bridge to increase the binding energy and orient them correctly to make the reaction possible.

Common metals that take part in metal ion catalysts are copper ion and zinc ion. The catalysis of carboxypeptidase A is a prime example of this catalytic strategy. The iron metal ion is also very common--from the binding of oxygen to hemoglobin and myoglobin, to participating as an electron carrier in the cytochromes of the electron transport chain, to even as a detoxifying agent in catalase and peroxidase. 


Metal ions also have the ability to stabilize transition states, which makes them very useful in catalytic chemistry because it allows them to stabilize unstable intermediates that are still transitioning into a structure that's going to allow them to react with another substrate and form the final product. For example, in the presence of a tetrahedral oxyanion and another oxygen that is attached to a carbonyl functional group nearby  that is also about to become nucleophilic as an intermediate, the metal ion can coordinate to these two neighboring anions and participate in charge stabilization. 

[[Image:Metal_stabilizing.jpg‎]]

Forming this Copper 2+ metal ion bridge allows both nucleophilic/anionic oxygens to be stabilized at the same time. It also positions this molecule in the appropriate geometry for breaking or forming bonds. Metal ions like these enable species to acquire a reactive role by coercing them to adopt unusual angles and bond distances. 

Metal ions that are not tightly bound to a metalloenzyme, such as Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; mentioned earlier participate as specific charge carriers in the membrane of our cells. For example, Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; and K&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; control the membrane's electrostatic voltage. They are ions that conduct the inside of our membrane's to have a net negative charge by the use of ion pumps and concentration gradients. Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; is also an important metal ion that controls and regulates the passing of neurotransmitters from one axon to the next in order to sound out signals throughout the body.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Catalysis by Approximation ==

Substrates that happen to come together through random collisions have an even smaller possibility of contact with the reactive portions of the substrate. Thus, enzymes can employ a strategy known as '''catalysis by approximation''' by which the enzyme brings together two substrates in order to increase the rate of reaction. This strategy takes advantage of binding energy and positions the substrates in the correct orientation for the reaction to proceed. Usually in a reaction, there will be a loss in translational entropy and rotational entropy. In the reaction, the transition state is much more ordered than it is at ground state, making delta S negative. This reaction takes place in the active site of an enzyme and the substrate and the catalytic group will than act as one molecule, preventing the loss of translational and rotational energy. The reaction first begins with two molecules that are able to find each other, which makes the rate of reaction dependent on the concentrations of the reactants. This is due to the higher probability of molecules to find each other. 

== Some Examples ==

An example of catalysis by approximation is when NMP kinases[[http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Structural_Biochemistry/Enzyme_Catalytic_Mechanism/Nucleoside_Monophosphate_Kinase]] bring two nucleotides together to facilitate the transfer of a phosphoryl group from one nucleotide to the other. With the addition of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a phosphate group is placed adjacently to the phosphate group of the NMP kinase. This facilitates in the transfer of the phosphate between the two molecules.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Types of Catalysis== 
Enzymes are proteins that catalyze a reaction by stabilizing the transition state and therefore, lowering the activation energy of the reaction. To achieve this, enzymes use different classes of reactions or catalytic strategies. The strategies used to catalyze a reaction are:

[[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Covalent Catalysis|'''Covalent Catalysis''']]

In this type of reaction, a nucleophile in the active site reacts with a reactive group in the substrate.  The nucleophile is temporarily, covalently bonded to a substrate during catalysis.

Example: Chymotrypsin uses a strong nucleophile to attack a normally unreactive carbonyl carbon atom of a substrate.  The nucleophile is briefly covalently attached to the substrate in catalysis.

[[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Acid-Base Catalysis|'''Acid-Base Reactions''']]

In this type of reaction a molecule other than water acts as a proton acceptor or donor.

Example: In the catalytic triad, the histidine residue polarizes the hydroxyl group on serine so that it is ready for deprotonation.  When a substrate is present, it takes the proton from hydroxyl group of serine which makes the residue act like a base catalyst.

[[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Catalysis By Approximation|'''Catalysis by Approximation''']]

In this type of reaction, two subtrates are positioned together on a single binding surface so that the formation of the new bond is easier, speeding up the reaction.

Example: NMP has a phosphoryl group transferred from ATP by an enzyme holding its two substrates together and aligning them to stabilize the transition state.  

[[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Metal Ion Catalysis|'''Metal Ion Catalysis''']]

In this type of reaction, metal ions help the formation of nucleotides or the ion acts as an electrophile to stabilize a negative charge on an intermediate.

Example: Carbonic Anhydrase is an enzyme that contains a zinc ion which aids in turning water into a better nucleophile.  The formation of a hydroxide ion speeds up the nucleophilic attack of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

The type of strategy that is employed is based on the enzyme's structural properties and the reaction that the enzyme will catalyze. Many times a combination of strategies is used to in catalytic reactions.

==Examples of Catalytic Reactions==

===[[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme Catalytic Mechanism/pingpong mechanism|Ping-Pong Mechanism]]===

Ping pong reactions, or double displacement reactions, involve the release of one or more products before all of the substrates bind to the enzyme. This back and forth is where the reactions get the name ping-pong. A defining part of a ping-pong reaction is called the substituted enzyme intermediate, which has a temporarily modified enzyme that shuttles groups back and forth. An example of a double displacement reaction is as follows:

Aspartate + alpha-Ketoglutarate &lt;-(with enzyme aminotransferase)-&gt; Oxaloacetate + Glutamate 

Though this reaction seems like a normal reaction with two reactants and two products, the order of events is what defines the reaction. First, aspartate binds to the enzyme. Then, (before alpha-Ketoglutarate binds), oxaloacetate is released. Now, alpha-Ketoglutarate binds to the enzyme-substrate complex. Last of all, these substrates react and glutamate is released and the enzyme reforms.

===[[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/sequential reactions|Sequential Reactions]]===

This is a more orthodox description of an enzymatic reaction. Sequential reactions require all of the substrates to bind to the enzyme before all of the products are released. These can be further broken down into ordered and random sequential reactions. Ordered reactions have a specific order for which substrates must bind to the enzyme, whereas random reactions do not. 

An example of an ordered reaction is as follows:

Pyruvate + NADH &lt;-(lactate dehydrogenase)-&gt; lactate + NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

In this reaction, the pyruvate must first bind to the enzyme before the NADH may react with it. Then, lactate is released first before NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is released.

An example of a random reaction is as follows:

Creatine + ATP &lt;-(creatine kinase)-&gt; Phosphocreatine + ADP

In this reaction, the enzyme is not selective, and either Creatine or ATP can bind first. Similarly, either Phosphocreatine or ADP can be released first.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Protein regulation is essential for biological balance. Too much or too little of any [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins|protein]]reactivity can cause severe biological damage.  


=='''&lt;big&gt;Specific Diseases&lt;/big&gt;'''==


==Alzheimer's Disease==

Alzheimer's patients have &quot;plaques&quot; in their brains, which are essentially large chunks of a certain protein believed to contribute to neuronal death. It is also a dementia that gets worse over time. There is no cure for Alzheimer's disease. As you can see in the picture, someone who has Alzheimer's has extreme loss in the different functions of the brain. 

Alzheimer's patients have this protein's regulation pathway disturbed, causing it to be overly expressed.  Protein regulation is also referred to as [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme Regulation|Enzyme Regulation]].  Furthermore, the study of these protein regulation pathways have lead to much growth in the creation of medicinal and pharmaceutical products.

==Hunter Syndrome==

Hunter syndrome is a genetic disease in which mucopolysaccharides do not degrade accurately. As a result, mucopolysaccharides will accumulate inside the body. The main cause of this accumulation is the absence of iduronate sulfatase enzyme. Some of the signs for recognition of the syndrome are big heads and different facial characteristics. The syndrome can be found out with urine test. However, this test is not trusted. The study of fibroblasts that extract from body’s skin is more effective. The gene that contributes to the cause of Hunter syndrome is residing on the X-recessive chromosome. Since males only have one X chromosome, the chance that males inherit this syndrome is higher than that of females. 

The problem with Hunter syndrome is how the body is unable to break down mucopolysaccharides, which make up proteoglycan that is part of the extracellular matrix. As a consequence, the adding up of mucopolysaccharides becomes an obstacle for other cells in the body to carry out their jobs. This incident may lead to significant effects that can harm the body. For instance, some early side effects of Hunter syndrome can be the normal sickness such as cold and runny nose.
 
Hunter syndrome results in a certain effects upon the body. Thus, people who inherit the syndrome tend to have common characteristics. The more extreme consequences of Hunter syndrome include mental retardation, heart problem, joint stiffness, etc. Bone marrow replacement was proven to help expanding the life span of Hunter syndrome patients. Unfortunately, it does not solve the problem of mental retardation. Elaprase, a lysosomal enzyme iduronate sulfatase that can be made by recombinant DNA technique, has demonstrated to be an effective cure for Hunter syndrome through the replace of enzyme. Nevertheless, elaprase is indeed very expensive.



==Hurler Syndrome==

Hurler Syndrome is an inherited disease and is caused by a recessive mutation (both parents would need to have passed down the trait).  Historically, it was thought to be caused by the excessive synthesis of 2 mucopolysaccharides: dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate.  Some scientists believed the excessive synthesis of the 2 molecules to be caused by a faulty regulation pathway.  Elizabeth Neufeld tested this hypothesis and found it to be false; she found the cause of the disorder to be the inadequate degradation of the 2 sugars.  While normal cells leveled off production after a certain point, cells affected by the mutation continued production past normal levels.

Correction of this disease is easily possible in vitro (and works to an extent in vivo.)  The addition of healthy cells in the same culture as mutated cells in vitro caused normal levels of dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate to be created.  The normal cells excrete a corrective factor/enzyme in the medium which is taken up by the mutated cells.  This enzyme is crucial in the degradation of the 2 mucopolysaccharides; furthermore, very little of it is necessary to fully correct the mutated cells.  There are many problems with using α-L-Iduronidase as treatment in vivo; the main issue being that various tissues respond at various degrees to the medication.  Most importantly, the central nervous system does not uptake any of the intravenously injected enzyme because of the blood-brain barrier.  On top of this issue, a significant number of people with this disease have neurological diseases that need to uptake this enzyme somehow.

α-L-Iduronidase was found to be the key enzyme in restoring proper degradation of dermatan sulfate and heparan sulfate.  It was found though that α-L-Iduronidase from some cells was not corrective.  Research showed that the carbohydrate mannose 6-phosphate was responsible for proper uptake of the enzyme; a mutation in the structure of it caused the α-L-Iduronidase product to not be taken up properly by cells affected by Hurler Syndrome.



==Sanfilippo Syndrome==

Sanfilippo Syndrome is within a set of neurodegenerative diseases called tauopathies (the most common of which is Alzheimer's Disease).  Although there are 4 subtypes of Sanfilippo Syndrome, they are all characterized by reduced degradation of heparan sulfate (see Hurler Syndrome section) due to reduced levels of a lysosomal enzyme. 

It was found in a mouse model (MPS IIIB) that there were significantly increased levels of the protein lysozyme; increased levels of this disease were found to cause the creation of hyperphosphorylated tau which is found in the brains of Alzheimer's patients and patients with other tauopathies.  Significant research is being done in Alzheimer's disease which may carry over to Sanfilippo Syndrome as well due to their similarities.

1.	4 different subtypes:
Each Sanfilippo subtype is caused by the deficiency of each specific enzyme: heparin N-sulfatase for MPS-III A, N-acetyl-alpha-D-glucosaminidase for MPS-III B, acetyl-CoA: alpha-glucosaminide acetyltransferase for MPS-III C, and N-acetylglucosamine-G-sulfate sulfatase for MPS-III D. Among these four subtypes, Sanfilippo syndrome type A is the most prevalent (60%), followed by B (30%), D (5%), and C (6%). In total, 47% of all cases of mucopolysaccharidosis diagnosed is related with Sanfilippo disease.

2.	Mortality/ Morbidity:
Patients with Sanfilippo syndrome tend to develop Central Nervous System degeneration and usually end up at a vegetative state. They usually die before the age of 20 due to cardiopulmonary arrest because of airway obstruction or infection in the pulmonary pathway. Among these 4 subtypes, MPS-III A is the most severe one due to early death in patients (usually during their teenage years).
Sanfilippo syndrome has an equal effect on both males and females as well as on different races since its main cause is the inheritance in an autosomal recessive pattern which has no relations with the sex chromosomes. 

3.	Diagnosis and History:
In terms of diagnosis, these four subtypes are not indistinguishable clinically; therefore, the only determining factor to identify each specific subtype is the different genes that are responsible for that subtype. 
Usually, affected individuals show no symptoms and develop normally during the first two years of their lives. Onset usually takes place between the age of 2 and 6. Developmental delays in infancy may be shown in some of them. Growth might be slowed down at the age of 3 (e.g. short stature). Patients might also become hyperactive and behave aggressively and destructively. Besides disturbing the sleep pattern in patients, this syndrome also interferes severely into the mental development of affected patients – speech impairment, hearing loss, etc. At the same time, patients might show shortened attention spans and find it challenging to concentrate and to be able to perform academic tasks at schools. 
By the age of 10, patients’ daily activities and movements are severely limited. They often are in need of wheelchairs to accommodate them and might even have swallowing difficulties and seizures. 
Some other physical symptoms might also be shown such as carious teeth, enlarged liver and spleen, diarrhea (which is believed is due to lysosomal glycosaminoglycans (GAG) storage in the neurons of the myenteric plexus3.)
Respiratory compromise can occur and is related to airway obstruction due to anatomical changes, excessive thick secretions and neurologic impairment. Upper respiratory tract infections and sinopulmonary disease are common. 

4.	Work-up:
In order to diagnose patients with Sanfilippo Syndrome, specific enzymatic assays in cultured skin fibroblasts and in peripheral blood leukocytes are used (e.g. enzymatic cell analysis).  One indicating sign for this syndrome is the increase in the level of heparan sulfate in the urinary secretion.  Thus a total quantitative or a fractionation test are carried by performing either electrophoresis or chromatography with the purpose of measuring how much Glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) is in the urine. Due to the higher level of GAGs in newborns and infants, age-specific controls and fractionation must be included to accurately quantify the level of GAGs. 
Imaging studies can also be used to look for changes in brain structure since the spectrum of skeletal changes can be seen in patients with Sanfilippo syndrome. 

5.	Treatment:
Currently, there is no available treatment for the real cause of Sanfilippo syndrome. Bone marrow transplantation and Enzyme replacement therapy only work for patients with mucopolysaccharidosis I, II, and VI (not III). However, some promising therapies are making their ways to be FDA-approved.

In studying enzyme catalysis, an important factor to understand is how the substrate and enzyme interact with each other. The affinity of the substrate to the enzyme is a deciding factor to whether or not the binding in the active site occurs. There are many things that affect the affinity of the substrate to the enzyme. The surface, complementarily, flexibility and non-covalent charges are all important factors. Another influencing factor includes the orientation of the molecule.
Molecular modeling is a technique used in computational chemistry, computational biology and material science to mimic the behavior of molecules to further understand its systems and how they bind to each other. A type of molecular modeling is docking. Molecular docking is a method that predicts the preferred orientation of a molecule when it binds to another molecule. It uses computers to create a 3D image of two molecules and shows how they fit together. Knowing the preferred orientation that a molecule has for another can help predict the strength of binding affinity that a substrate will have for an enzyme.
A common application that molecular modeling is used for is drug design. When creating a new drug for a certain disease, molecular docking can be used to predict the binding affinity that the new drug has on the targeted protein. However, there are certain errors that can occur in relying mainly on this approach. For example, while molecular modeling can predict the preferred orientation that a drug may have for a protein, it is not able to effectively account for conformational changes that may occur. But despite this, molecular docking is still a very important technique that helps us further understand the molecular processes that occurs within the molecular level.

==Installing Content Over Multiple Trainz Versions==

If you have multiple versions of Trainz installed on the same computer, there is a simple way to ensure that new material is imported into the correct version.
# Open the version of CMP that was installed with the version of Trainz you wish to import the content for. Download from the DSL will now be installed for that version only. 
# To import information into another version, repeat the above.
# If you double click on a downloaded file on your desktop, it will automatically install it to the last version of CMP that was opened (eg if the 2006 version was the last used, then it will import content to that edition unless you first manually open a different version).

==Textures==
: {{TrainzTip|Textures are surfaces that colorize the {{wp|wireframe}} underlying the 3D virtual world surface and 'skin' objects in Trainz}}
* Rotate you textures in big areas rather than small for a more realistic look.
* If you are laying down large areas of texture, overlay the area with patches of the same texture at a different scale (smaller or larger) to break up the patterning that can occur. A different texture that is nearly the same color can be used for the same effect. 
* Where power lines cross your fields make a small circle of grass around the base of each post or pylon. Farm machines steer clear of power line bases so they are always surrounded by rough grass (check Google Earth for proof!).
* Not all textures are a simple color or pattern - some are shrubs, bushes or rocks.  If you are trying to delete or move these you won't find an object or a spline.  Delete then by pasting a blank section of terrain over the area where they are appearing. 
* With some tunnels a 'dighole' has to be used in order to see through the tunnel. The 'dighole' is then masked with a suitable 10x10, or larger, terrain object that resembles the surrounding texture. At least one of andi06's tunnels requires the 'dighole' and he has created a piece of terrain to cover above and below the tunnel.
* When you’re putting down textures, if you want a baseboard done fast, click the thing that looks like miniature baseboards. There are 8 of them with red in the middle. It textures the whole baseboard.
* If you would like some random terrain (user-specifiable to a degree) to start a new fictional route, take a look over at http://freepages.misc.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~wewain/trainz/Surveyor/Baseboard/Topology/TerrainGeneration/Computer-generatedTerrain.htm for a utility called Terrain Zurveyor. You can specify general conditions and hit Generate and it will create a displacement file that you can directly use in Surveyor to set the terrain of a user-specified area.
* You can also find some nice pre-generated displacement files over at http://www.trainz-online.com/ which includes some pictures so you can have an idea what you will be getting.
*  When you are making fields note that a field is rarely ploughed right up to the fence. Try to orientate you fields so you can paint a rough grass texture to follow the line of the fence and paint the rest of the field your required colour. Always include a &quot;Farm Gate&quot; or &quot;Open Farm Gate&quot; in your field and paint a mud texture round it, suggestive of tractors or animals going through it.  If you use a textured pattern with a fixed orientation, such as a crop, you can overlay it with patches of coloured texture to create areas of light and dark, which is how a crop usually looks.

==Foliage==
* Planted trees/objects and now don't want them? Copy and paste a blank area of board onto the trees/objects and now they're gone (be sure to select Paste Objects in the pasting options).
* When laying out large numbers of trees use the &quot;Randomly rotate new objects&quot; function in Surveyor Settings (in Options).
* When laying out Tree Splines, avoid laying them in straight lines. Consider laying in short stretches that criss-cross to make them look less uniform.
* When building a country route, avoid using the same hedge spline throughout. Mix it up a little or try different types of fencing to create variety and a more realistic look.
* Sick of planting trees and texturing? Build up a random clump of trees and add the texture beneath in a square somewhere out of sight on a baseboard. Name one of the trees 'Trees' so that you can do a 'find' if you forget where you put them. Now copy and paste where they need to be. 
* Always paint the forest floor a darker colour (e.g. “Ger Forest”) than the surrounding area. Individual trees should be planted in a dark patch.
* For good measure use a sound file such as &quot;Crows&quot;.
* Consider varying the height of the trees by using the “Height” button.   A tree can be a bush by burying the trunk, but it can also be raised above ground to add variety, without its suspension being obvious from a distance. If you are using a very small variety of trees and it's all looking a bit similar, try pulling a few into the ground to resemble less mature trees or shrubs. You can do this with the ones you are going to copy and paste and they will retain the heights above ground.  
* I'm modeling an area in the Eastern U.S., where vegetation is everywhere, and one thing I've had a hard time locating is good impenetrable-looking undergrowth. I've found a very effective solution to be to place low-poly trees (the cottonwood trees are especially effective for this) and lower them with the height tool until only the tops of the trees are visible. To my eyes it's much more realistic and much faster as well than placing vast numbers of bushes, etc. along the route. If you stick to just a few types of trees the rendering time is minimally impacted as well. (Be sure auto-rotate is on.)
* Only use high poly items (such as 3d trees), where they are in full, close and lengthy view of a camera. While the 3d trees look great in the screenshots, they have less impact at 100 km/h from the loco cab. 
* You can force perspective by using matching tall/short trees sets for foreground and background. For Australian layouts 'Tree Gum Group' (kuid -1:100275) can be used in the foreground, and the smaller 'Tree Stickish Group' (kuid -1:100286) used in the distance.

==Water==
* When creating water with different heights close together, make sure the water doesn't touch. If it does then it will act as one big water mass. 
* To create rivers, use water or river splines rather than animated water. There are three reasons for this:
# When you're speeding past on a train you can't really tell it's not moving.
# Performance will be massively better than if you used animated water
#  Splines allow you to make realistic rivers which flow down hills, rather than having lots of flat bits broken up by rocks / waterfalls etc.

==General==
* Always save before you paste Terrain plus Objects like {{TG|M|mocrossings}}. I've avoided that nasty spline bug (where you paste and some splines go nuts and try to join others half way across the map). {{ILT|This might also be avoided by holding down {{kp|SHIFT}} when {{kp|LMB}} clicking the spline object vertex point. Use the move tool to attach then to the right spline vertex if you want them connected. The OP tip is good because it forces the data base to reorganize itself, closing up confusing cross-reference that cause those crazy flying splines across the map.}}
* When using the undo button to delete a spline, TRS may crash. (The undo bug seems to be fixed in Trainz Classics.)
* To show KUID's, add this sentence to your trainzoptions file:(-showkuids). In TS12 this is done with a setting in General Settings (in Options) &quot;Show object/track/train KUIDs in Surveyor&quot;.

==Tracks==

* There are hundreds of different types of track available in Trains and on the Download Station. Experiment to find the best type for you scenario. Don't put all your effort into the rolling stock, scenery and buildings used on a route just to have the visual effect ruined by using the default tracks built-in to the original Trainz. 
* Where possible, lay your track in the direction the trains will be travelling. This helps the AI as it &quot;prefers&quot; track which is laid in the direction of travel.
* Do not use double track track splines. It's a lousy short cut for several reasons: 
# it can make the AI think it's travelling in the wrong direction (both tracks are laid in the same direction)
# it makes curves very difficult to build
# for certain countries it's the wrong spacing
* Leave the signalling till last, as laying a signal and then laying more track ahead of it can cause problems with the AI.
* Use the track straightening tool to make proper switches and make sure the diverge leaves the mainline at a suitable small angle.  Take a low-down view along the track to make sure the angle is not too sharp - what might look OK from a top-down view can be a nasty jolt for a train. 
* Hold down shift as you are moving or placing a spline point to prevent it from joining another spline (also do this if the spline is incompatible with another spline, which can prevent it from being placed - hold down shift to make it go down). This is a godsend if you are working with a very complex area!
* Spend a minute or two to install Trainz tuner.  http://www.kreativenergy.com/index.p...25&amp;Itemi d=28
* The last few yards of track by a buffer, and any track on catch points or safety sidings, should be laid as rusty track. Real train drivers will not allow their trains to actually make contact with the buffer stops/rail ends, and trap points and catch points should never have trains running over the &quot;dead&quot; track, so that track should always be rusty.

==Splines==

* When laying down multiple spline points, hold ctrl and simply LMB each point in turn. Handy for curves.
* To prevent a spline point from automatically connecting to a nearby point, press Shift as you place the spline.
* For splines such as fences or hedges where you want them to join at an angle, allow them to connect when you lay them down, then come back and disconnect (Split Spline 'Q') them afterwards.  This is quicker than trying to prevent them from connecting as you place them, and also ensures that they are perfectly aligned on top of each other.
* If a spline point displays with a white dashed circle in Surveyor, that means it is attached to the ground at that point, and will change height if the height of the ground changes.  If the point is displayed with a yellow dashed circle that means the spline point has a fixed height, and will not change if the ground height changes (but note that the circle is always white when viewed against the wireframe background).
* When a spline is laid across terrain with varying heights, the spline will follow the height of the terrain.  To force the spline to a constant gradient between two points, select the Spline Height ('H') icon then LMB on a spline point at either end of the section. Actually changing the height of either point will also force the spline to a constant slope.
* The Smooth Spline ('S') tool doesn't actually smooth the spline - it smooths the terrain along the spline to match the height of the spline.  Matching the ground height to the spline height increases with more clicks, out to a maximum of about 6.
* The straighten track tool can also be used with splines.

==Buildings==
* When making large industrial or residential areas, set up a nice looking section and then use the copy/paste tool to expand the area. This can save you hours when route building.
* Avoid populating your world with too many different items (whether inbuilt, or downloaded). Pick a set of items you can use repeatedly, and try and stick to them, to improve game performance. You can use the adjust height and rotate buttons to add variety.
* Overlay/combine existing buildings to create new buildings.
* Combine multiple buildings together to make them fit the situation 
* Always lay a base texture first in case you miss an area of the main textures.
* When you're building a station, make sure you get the gap between the train and platform right by placing a train on the track and creeping the platform up to the train. The rule of thumb is - if there's space for a passenger to slip down, the gap is too wide.
* If you put a train on the track you can't move the track or any track directly connected to it. This is why it makes more sense to move the platform.
* Temporarily drop &quot;hydraulic buffers&quot; onto the track and shove the platform up to them and that way you get the width correct and the ends to match as well.
* To rotate an object to match the angle of the track, hold down the 'Ctrl' key when you rotate the object and get a 1/10th more precise angle.
* To get a closer 'zoom-in' distance in surveyor, to help fine tune or position something at closer range... is to add the line &quot;-surveyorfov=30&quot; to the trainzoptions file.
* The minimum distance between the railway boundary fence or wall and the nearest running rail is 10 feet (3 metres). Anything inside that is called the &quot;Lineside&quot;. When you place fences, don't make them less than 10 feet from the track.
* Copy and paste is your friend. Allows you to knock out large areas/tasks in a breeze

==Releasing a Route==
* Before you release a route, try to run some common scenarios to make sure the AI/signalling works as expected, and to ensure that track work is all correct.
* Compare your route with as many photographs as you can. This will help make your as prototypical as possible.
* Try to include at least one unique area to your route that you haven't seen in another (e.g.a different sort of factory or industry) to create a point of interest.
* Try to look at routes from different geographic areas for inspiration. For example if you model USA then look at European/UK routes (and vice-versa).

==Trackmarks/AI Drivers==
* If you want to move track marks beyond spline points, use the move function. This works on track marks of all types.
* If your AI trains refuse to load or unload at ProtoLars tracks try this trick.
  When sending the AI to a ProtoLars track, I use the driver command &quot;Stop Train&quot; (131986:150150).
  So issue the following driver commands:
  # Drive to Trackmark-Stop Train-Wait for n minutes-etc.
  # Drive to Trackmark-Stop Train-Wait for 10 seconds-Uncouples-etc.
  This applies the air brakes to the whole train and prevents any movement (the probable cause of not un/loading).
* You can use a driver more than one time if you just change their name. I set names of drivers to the name of the train to see train locations when on a large map.
* When a portal creates trains, the same driver get assigned to the same train every time.
* If you have a long stretch of track or you find the AI constantly takes the wrong route at a certain location, lay a trackmark down on the path you want the AI to take and then tell your trains to &quot;Drive Via&quot;. I find that placing a trackmark a full braking distance before a signal and telling a train to &quot;Drive Via&quot; prevents the AI from trying to take control of points which are beyond the signal and it will instead wait for the signal to clear.
* I have been experimenting with 'path control' and 'path trigger'. I wanted to get the train to stop before it made the next path and carried on with its journey into the yard from the mainline. I was moving the trigger to get it so far from the signal that the train would reach the trigger just as the signal stopped the train. after some playing around i found the train stops 25 metres short of the signal, so i now place my triggers in exactly the same spot as the signal and set the radius to 26 metres, works great.

==Bridges/Docks==
* When you make Bridges note that grass does not grow under a bridge so use a dark colour such as &quot;Dock Surface&quot; or Ballast if its track side.
* 

&lt;b&gt;Tips for using Plate Girder Bridge&lt;/b&gt;

If using &quot;Plate Girder Bridge&quot; to cross 2 tracks, first lay the basic bridge across the tracks and set the height by placing 2 Locos underneath and allowing about 4 feet clearance. This is important because Plate Girder Bridge has an extra deep girder. 
Next, click &quot;Get Height&quot; and &quot;Use Height&quot; to make sure both ends are the same height. Then form another section of bridge and VERY gently stretch it until it forms a new abutment but stop stretching it before it forms a girder.
Place the end of the new abutment in line with the bridge abutment after using Use Height to make sure the new abutment is the same height. It's best to line both abutments up in an aerial view. On the left side of the bridge you see the completed abutment - the blue brick makes the join virtually invisible. Of course, while you manoeuvre the section into position you must keep the shift key pressed down so that they don't physically join up! This will work with nearly any Trainz bridge and repeating sections of abutment you can construct a long brick viaduct.

==Rolling Stock/Locomotives==
* You can load a car by pressing the ? button in Surveyor it will show you the list of loads it can take.
* But quick easy way to get your engine from heaven out of the way is to upper left corner tab &quot;remove missing dependancies&quot; then save this will remove your ghost engine... ( did that myself one time and that worked for me).

==-freeintcam==
Allows you to move freely around inside a train Cab. You're no longer locked into one place now. Works in TRS2006 and TC as far as I know.

Holding down shift allows 'zooming' speed in driver to check track connections without travelling the route at regular speed.

==Quick and Easy Mountains and Slopes==
 
-This is a two step process. Use the Fill area tool in the &quot;Topology Menu&quot; on an area I call the palette, just some base boards that I add to the route to create items to be copied for pasting elsewhere. I select &quot;Hill&quot; and fill an area at least three to four grid squares inside one full base board. It does not have to be square nor a full baseboard, just leave enough room around the filled area so later you can place all the copy lines at 0 elevation. If I'm after really big hills I use 4 base boards but again only fill up to 3 or 4 squares from the edge to leave the 0 level edge.

-Now the trick. In the &quot;Tools&quot; menu use copy and paste. Copy the &quot;Hill&quot; but be sure to have your copy lines just outside the raised area and at &quot;0&quot; elevation. This is important. Set the paste functions to height and RELATIVE. The relative is critical. This way you have no sharp edges on your pasted item and can overlap and compound with additional pastings to double the height of the new land form. By varying the original template from a gentle slope to sharp cone you can get almost any topography you wish. Also note that when you paste you can use half the hill by moving to the edge of a base board. That way your hills can start high at the edge of the route and slope down and in, acting as backdrops to the route. With a little bit of playing around you are just a few clicks away from mountains, hills, and slopes that cover entire base boards quickly and easily.
-Stagger the paste in a brickwork fashion and rotate each time to avoid repetition.
Planted trees/objects and now don't want them. Copy and paste a blank area of board onto the trees/objects and now they're gone.

To create nice gradients, lay the track first, set the spline heights then click on the &quot;smooth spline height&quot; button to snap the ground right up to the track! This works with curves and turnouts too, beautiful cuttings and embankments at no fuss at all!

==For Prototypical Routes==

1) Carefully look at the scale of the buildings your putting in your route. There are buildings on the DLS that are much too huge and way out of scale for modelling the real world. Rule of thumb- If a 200 ton diesel loco looks small next to a building in your route the building is probably too large and not to scale 

2) There is nothing worse then driving your train over &quot;floating track&quot; that has a space between the track and the ground. When you are done laying all the track for your route, use the ground elevation tool to bring the ground up to your track. Don't bring your track down to the ground or you will lose the gradient you set for the track. Select the &quot;ground up&quot; button in the topography menu and gently tap your left mouse button to bring the ground up to your track. Keep doing it until the ground just starts to cover the edge of the track, then hit the undo button once to lower the ground one &quot;mouse tap&quot;. Do this for your entire route. It is time consuming but the result is no more ugly space between your track and the ground.

3) Iron and steel bridges should have abutments at each end. Iron bridges do not magically emerge from the ground. It looks very fake. Also, track does not hang in the air when connecting to a bridge. (Would you drive a locomotive over that in real life?) Place a stone or concrete abutment to give it that prototypical look. Or use a retaining wall spline to give the bridge an abutment

4) Try to keep your industrial complexes a realistic size. Set surveyor to use &quot;real scale&quot; and measure the buildings from Sanborn maps. You will find that most factory complexes in the real world are actually much smaller then they appear.

5) In city areas, use textures that are kind of drab. Railroad yards and industrial sidings are very dirty, dark, unfriendly places. See the route &quot;UK Somewhere&quot; for an example of excellent example of texturing to give a route a &quot;industrial look&quot;.

6) Don't use &quot;black&quot; textures for forests floors.

==Track Laying Tips for Yards==
{{cleanup}}
First when laying a Yard out, do each half of a double ended yard with Track running in one direction then do the same for the opposite end. so that the track will look like this

&lt;---------------:--------------------&gt;


That way your track marks will be facing in Opposite directions and will make it easier for AI Trains to move to the proper ends of the yard
Also as a Naming Convention, Try to use a Formate like this
N-S or E-W (Yard) Trk (#) NB-SB or EB-WB for your track marks that way you have things in nice and neat order when your want your AI Trains to Drive to or Drive Via a Certain Track mark.

Name junctions to tell what track it is.

Example: a run through track going from East to West. the west junction to the run trough track can be called WRT and the East ERT
 yards major on e consist of 5 things.
*Receiving yard
*Classification Yard
*departure Yard
*local yard
*service tracks

These all help the yard function.

Cars go to the receiving yard to the classification to the departure yard. the first yard ever to have this was Dewitt Yard in East Syracuse follow the tracks from old plans you sac easily run from one end to the other in this manner.

Service track is where bad cars and locos are fixed.

Local yard holds car used for local service at industries.

Another good thing to have is a storage area to store extra cars.

If your AI Drivers refuse to go into a siding or sidings try placing an Invisible Signal in front of the Bufferstop/Railend. I have a Goods Yard on my Route laid out exactly as it was in real life - you have to set back from the Main Line into the Headshunt then drive forward into the goods yard. The AI drivers wouldn't do it, but when I added the Invisible Signal they drove in OK. Apparently the line was &quot;unsignalled&quot; and that was the cause of the problem.

On UK Railways catch points were spring loaded trailing points provided on rising gradients to derail runaway wagons in the days when many wagons were only fitted with handbrakes or had &quot;through&quot; vacuum pipes. They are best used on lines where you normally let the AI drive and Alastair should not be allowed near them. They should be laid with rusty track and provided with a Catch Point sign

When making yards, with out a template, start with you mainline like this:
____________________________________________

Then off that make a normal spur that straightens out and and ends where ever.

___________________________ 
___________________________\_____

Now make another off that like so.

___________________ 
___________________\___
_______________________\____

Leaving a space so that you have an area for the junction so it dont mess up anything. 
I find this type of yard building much easier and better.

If track is floating, then there is a button on the top-right row of the advanced track tab (Can't think of it's name) that will change the ground height to the height of the track. 

There are also tools in the advanced tab in the track tab that allow you to set gradients and spline point heights that I have found very useful.

==Searching for content when building==

When building a route there is an endless seeking for content, tracks and textures that you know that you have somewhere but everything drowns in the huge amount of material. I know about filters etc. but find it a bit tricky to organize.
-To find and place what you want to use later on an empty baseboard and then get it by the pick tool is no news either, but I have added a little extra routine there that works very good for me.

-First I have to start with a time consuming and rather boring task, but it pays off very well in the long run. I start with an empty baseboard and then I fill it with all the content, textures etc. that I like and possibly want to use later. Yes, it takes a long time really to search trough everything and place it in proper order on the baseboard...

-Then I save that single baseboard, by the name &quot;toolbox&quot;. Whenever I want to build a new route or go on with an already started route I simply merge the toolbox-baseboard to the route and pick whatever I need from the toolbox, easy and fast without a lot of boring and endless searching.

-When the route is ready, if that ever happens, I simply delete the toolbox. No time saved really with one single route, but the point is that you can use that saved toolbox to all routes you ever wish to build as many times you wish. The boring task to search for material is only necessary one time.

-If you have a large area such as a Town a Forest or a Major Road to build, make up a &quot;Works Yard&quot; on an empty baseboard. Go through EVERY type of house, tree or road bridge and put one example of each in the Works Yard so that you can compare them all and use the best ones. You'll often forget what Content you have available, and this is a good reminder
My solution was not to try to put everything into one route, but to make separate, categorized routes with only one type of objects, and no more than 100 or so of those per route. I named the routes according to the type of objects that are installed on each (&quot;Bridges 01&quot;, &quot;Bridges 02&quot;, etc.)

I just use the &quot;Get Object&quot; tool to click on the object I'm interested in - I found no need for separate labels
I just use the &quot;Get Object&quot; tool to click on the object I'm interested in - I found no need for separate labels.

==Coupling to Consist==

When you want to use AI to couple a Locomotive to a Train/Consist in a Siding the Locomotive will drive at Line Speed as far as the points for the siding and then at 1 MPH until it reaches the Train. This can be tiresome if the siding is very long, so what you do is 1) decide on a place (call it the Coupling Point) where the last vehicle in the Train/Consist will stand, this being the vehicle the Loco will couple to. About 5 yards from the Coupling Point pace a Signal Invisible on the track so that the AI Driver can see it as he approaches the Train. Then place an Invisible 5 0r 10 MPH Speed Limit on the entry to the siding, and (leaving the siding) a Speed Limit for whatever your Line Speed is. Now when the Loco enters the Siding it will drive at 5 or 10 MPH till it reaches the Signal Invisible (a few yards from the Train) and slow down to 1 MPH before coupling. This works like a charm for me.

:Didn't know there were metric cups.  As far as I was aware, the United States is the only major country to still use the imperial system of measurement.  However, you make a good point.  Looking at the Wikipedia entry for [[w:Cup (volume)|Cup]] I see there are six types of cups.  Makes me wish the US had converted.  I think it's most likely these are United States customary cups using the definition of that article. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:44, 4 December 2009 (UTC)</text>

==Copyright/Licensing problems with images you've uploaded==
 
Thanks for uploading images on Wikibooks. However, the images may soon be deleted unless we can determine the copyright holder and copyright status. The [[w:Wikimedia Foundation|Wikimedia Foundation]] is very careful about the images included in Wikibooks because of [[w:Copyright|copyright law]] (see Wikibooks' [[Wikibooks:Copyright|Copyright policy]]).

The copyright holder is usually the creator, the creator's employer, or the last person who was transferred ownership rights. Copyright information on images is signified using copyright templates. The three basic license types on Wikibooks are [[w:open content|open content]], [[w:public domain|public domain]], and [[w:fair use|fair use]]. Find the appropriate template in [[Wikibooks:Image copyright tags]] and place it on the image page like this: &lt;code&gt;{&amp;#123;TemplateName}}&lt;/code&gt;.

Please signify the copyright information on [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Special%3ALog&amp;type=upload&amp;user={{urlencode:{{PAGENAME}}}} all images you have uploaded] or will upload. Remember that images without this important information or giving false information can be deleted by an administrator. If you have any questions, ask them in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading room]]. Thank you. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:22, 4 December 2009 (UTC)</text>

Normally, long-term [[m:Help:Block and unblock|blocks]] of IP addresses or ranges do not affect [[m:Registered user|logged-in users]]. However, it is occasionally necessary to block both anonymous and logged-in users to prevent disruption. 

[[Wikibooks:Administrators|Administrators]] are always exempt from such blocks. Other users can request IP blocking exemption on a per user basis if they can show good cause.

IP block exemption allows users to edit without interruption, when their usual IP would otherwise be blocked through no fault of their own. It can also be used (exceptionally) to allow editing via an [[m:WM:NOP|anonymizing proxy]] such as [[w:Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]]. 

Users granted IP block exemption should be aware that breach of this policy, including unauthorized editing via [[m:Meta:OP|proxies]], or significant concerns over [[w:WP:SOCK|account abuse]] or other conduct, may lead to removal of the IP block exemption right.

== Requesting and granting exemption ==
The IP block exemption flag has two main uses:
:* A user who is unfortunately affected by a block intended to prevent vandalism or disruption, can be given the flag. They will then be able to edit without being affected by any IP block.
:* In highly exceptional circumstances, a user may be permitted to edit anonymously, via [[w:Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] or another [[m:WM:NOP|anonymizing proxy]].

:These are handled differently, due to the additional safeguards involved for open proxy usage. 

=== Used to bypass an IP range block ===
&quot;Hard&quot; IP range blocks are used to prevent persistent disruption from temporary accounts and sock-puppets within an IP range. A user with a credible editing record who would be affected by this measure, may be exempted from the block at administrative discretion, to allow them to edit uninterrupted through the IP range block. 

The '''conditions''' for granting this are that:
:* the user's normal (non-proxy) IP will be disrupted by an IP block that is placed on a range they usually edit on, through no fault of theirs. (This may be confirmed via autoblock or checkuser)
:* the user agrees &lt;u&gt;never&lt;/u&gt; to mis-use the exemption to edit through a blocked anonymizing proxy (this may be checked), and, 
:* when the block ends, or ceases to be an issue for the user, the exemption will be removed by any administrator.

In addition, ''IP exemption may also be given by a bureaucrat or checkuser without a request'', to prevent good-faith users being affected by a hard IP range block. The user should be informed that in order to prevent vandalism, a block has been applied to their IP range, and they have been exempted from it. They should clearly be recommended to read this section, and especially that the flag may be removed if used to edit via a blocked proxy.

:&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ffd0d0&quot;&gt;''Who may request''&lt;/span&gt; – A user affected by an IP block that is unrelated to their editing and that prevents them editing with a logged-in account.

:&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ffd0d0&quot;&gt;''How to request''&lt;/span&gt; – Request IP block exemption as part of an [[Template:unblock|unblock]] request.  '''You must ask from your registered account'''.  Requests posted to the user talk page of the IP address will be automatically declined.  Those granting this right may sometimes need to consult a checkuser to confirm the problem, or may wish to obtain further review by posting the request onto an administrative list or page for discussion if unfamiliar with the case.

=== Used for anonymous proxy editing ===

Editing via an anonymous proxy can be easily abused, so it is only granted under exceptional circumstances. Examples of users who may reasonably request an exemption include users who show they can contribute to the encyclopedia, and (for existing users) with a history of valid non-disruptive contribution, but are either being hindered by restrictive [[w:firewall|firewall]]s, or for exceptional reasons must edit via anonymous proxies. 

Note that avoidance of checkuser, or specific checkusers, is not an acceptable reason - concerns regarding checkusers should be discussed with the [[m:stewards|stewards]] or [[m:Ombudsman commission|Ombudsman commission]].

:&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ffd0d0&quot;&gt;''Who may request''&lt;/span&gt; -- A user who has genuine and exceptional need, and can be trusted not to abuse the right. This is a level of trust equal to that given administrators, as IP block exemption is an administrative tool.

:&lt;span style=&quot;background-color:#ffd0d0&quot;&gt;''How to request''&lt;/span&gt; -- Email a [[Special:ListUsers/sysop|administrator]] or [[Special:ListUsers/bureaucrat|bureaucrat]].

==Removal==
IP exemption is a privilege given to users who need the right, and who are trusted not to abuse it. Typical reasons why exemption may be removed from an account:

:* No longer needed or insufficient rationale for granting - relevant hard IP block ended and not anticipated to recur; user has access to Wikipedia through a non-firewalled IP, user becomes a sysop, etc
:* Bad faith or misleading statement in request
:* Credible evidence or concern of abuse - in unclear cases questions might be raised before assumptions are made.

As with any block (which exemption removal can effectively be), a bureaucrat or checkuser may remove the right or seek discussion of perceived issues by the community. Due to the potential for abuse, credible concerns over abuse endorsed by the community may at times be sufficient for removal. However in all cases, removal should be preventative and not punitive.

== Granting guide==
* All IP block exemptions are subject to review and repeal. Exemption may be, and will usually be, withdrawn if there is credible evidence or concern of abuse. It is advisable for administrators to discuss first if in doubt, since a poorly-founded exemption will be quickly withdrawn.

* When considering IP block exemption, the editing history of the user and the abusive range concerned should be carefully reviewed before making a decision.

* IP block exemption is granted or removed via [[Special:UserRights]]. Users having the &lt;tt&gt;IP-block-exempt&lt;/tt&gt; right are visible as a user group under [[Special:ListUsers/ipblock-exempt]] and can be reviewed. (Note that if the user is an administrator, they will not usually appear in this list.) The reason for granting or removal are given in the relevant user's [[Special:Log/rights|rights log]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''registered user''' is a user who has signed up for an account and has logged in to a Wikimedia project.  In addition to what an [[Wikibooks:Anonymous users|anonymous user]] can do, a registered user can:

* set preferences
* register pages for &quot;watching&quot; 
* upload files such as pictures, sounds, etc.
* mark edits as minor
* create their own user page
* move pages

The full list of rights is available at [[Special:ListGroupRights]].

All edits made as a registered user will show the user name in the history instead of an IP address. 

Registered users (excepting [[Wikibooks:Administrators|administrator]]s) cannot edit or move protected pages. [[Wikibooks:Autoconfirmed users|Newly registered users]] cannot edit semi-protected pages, move any page, or upload files.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Users who do not log in are said to be '''IP users''', or, '''anonymous users''', also referred to as ''anons''. These users may edit pages which are not protected or semi-protected; their edits will appear in [[Help:Tracking changes#Page history|page histories]] alongside the IP address from which they were made. They can also create new pages.

Anonymous editors cannot move pages, upload media, or maintain a [[Help:Tracking changes#Watching pages|watchlist]]. Because IP addresses are so often dynamic, an IP-based user page is generally impractical, and in fact disallowed on several wikis. Anonymous users are often prohibited from participation in processes such as deletion and permissions debates, or may only participate on a restricted basis (e.g. may leave comments, but may not vote).

They also are not able to select the option of '''minor edit''' as this could allow a bad-natured user to make undesirable changes without being spotted for some time.

The public visibility of an anonymous user's IP address means that, in extreme legal cases, the computer from which the user contributes could be identified through contact with the ISP, which can eventually lead to identification of the user. In this sense, &quot;anonymous&quot; users are in fact less anonymous than [[Wikibooks:Registered users|registered users]] who do not reveal any personal information.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&quot;Strictly speaking, on multi-CPU machines one can run two threads at once, but even so, if there are more threads than CPU’s, then the threads must run in turns&quot;

Honestly that is complete bullshit. Most of the modern CPUs implement threads on hardware. I work daily with a system that can run some 1560 threads simultaneously. Given the software uses real threads offered by the operating system (which uses the CPU architecture correctly) instead of some silly green threads and kin.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==When to use the pseudo-bot flag==
Administrators should use the pseudo-bot flag (also called &quot;flood flag&quot;) to avoid flushing other edits and actions from the [[Special:RecentChanges|RecentChanges]] (RC) feed when making repetitive changes. Such actions must never be controversial, as using the pseudo-bot flag decreases the amount of oversight they may receive. Abuse of the pseudo-bot flag is treated as abuse of any other administrator tool would be. Examples of acceptable use would be deleting many spambot pages, or deleting a large number of pages after consensus has been achieved at [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion]] or blocking many open proxies. Unacceptable uses include attempting to circumvent legitimate oversight of any controversial action, regardless of whether it is an administrator task or not. 

Users may also wish to equip the pseudo-bot flag when performing log actions on large numbers of usernames that are offensive or libellous (i.e. bureaucrats renaming accounts, administrators performing local blocks, and so on).

In some cases, a bureaucrat may remove the pseudo-bot flag to force an administrator's edits to appear in RC. This should be done in cases where the administrator has forgotten to remove it, or when the changes should be seen by default in RC.

The pseudo-bot flag is set and removed using [[Special:UserRights]].

== Room for abuse? ==
One issue with the pseudo-bot flag is that there is room for abuse from administrators; if an administrator is making contentious edits or actions, he or she would be able to toggle the pseudo-bot flag to prevent them from being seen or monitored from Recent Changes, which is the primary source at which new edits are displayed and observed.

However, it must be remembered the administrators are already trusted with the ability to delete pages, block users, view deleted material, place protections on pages, etc. In the end, this added functionality should not require more trust than administrators are already given.

Granting the pseudo-bot flag is [[Special:Log/rights|logged]], and shown in [[Special:RecentChanges|recent changes]]. [[Wikibooks:Administrator|Administrator]]s who abuse the pseudo-bot may have their administrative rights removed.

==Pseudo-bot flag or bot flag?==
This is intended to replace requesting temporary bot flags from bureaucrats. Administrators who would otherwise request a temporary bot flag may simply flag themselves using the pseudo-bot flag.

Cases where a permanent bot flag should be given remain the same - the administrator should create a secondary account and request a bot flag as normal. Only temporary bot flags are replaced with this pseudo-bot flag.

      <text xml:space="preserve">BerkeKalman is my predecessor's name at the time of immigration. As with many new to the US, he was practically ignored when he presented his papers and his name was changed by the immigration office in Boston, MA. It is a Magyar name and that language is a version of the Altaic family of languages of the Mongolian peoples. Only the Finnish have a similar language and that is why it is a difficult language for Indo-European language speakers, like myself. The family name is given first, then the given name so that you are clear as to which Berke this is!


I am a long time student of Utopian Socialism as well as a proponent of Scientific Socialism. I was educated at The Ohio State University and my favorite and most inspiring teacher is Harvey Goldberg. Harvey is a specialist on French history and culture of the 18th and 19th Centuries. In one course ,  on the French Revolution, there was standing room only in the room on the day the crowd stormed the Bastille. It was a dramatic and minutely detailed exposition. His most impressive course offered was the Rise of Liberalism in which Harvey clearly demonstrated the aberrant nature of Capitalism in the history of human society.He also delivered a State of the Union address after the usual one given before Congress by the President of the US. Harvey's was more important because it was precise and true, and of course, humorous. Thank you Harvey Goldberg, wherever you are! I think of you and thank you always.

My writings to date have been expositions on the rise of American Fascism. The corporate control of the economy and governance of the US
 since the 19th Century is complete. Reagan closed the doors on the New Deal, itself a  peaceful attempt to establish a social democracy in the US, and we have had unbridled corporatism ever since. The framework espoused by Mussolini in his Corporate state is now a perfect replica in the US. And Americans like it. I wish Kalman had stayed in Budapest.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==5.2 Consequences of Growth==
===='''Externalities'''====
-----
:*''Positive'': more efficient production methods that are better for the environment, results in larger tax base which may be spent on environment
:*''Negative'': pollution, overuse of land

::*The market is not responsive to certain externalities and so fails to account for entropy and potentially catastrophic environmental damage
::*Even with government regulation replacing the market, some ecologically relevant externalities may involve damage to the ecosystem itself, and yet the signals going to the regulators may be false and sustainability may not be attainable
	
:*''Environmental Degradation &amp; Pollution''
::*Population pressures have led to degradation of the environment:
:::*Soil erosion is a serious problem in several countries
:::*Forest cover is lost by cutting for fuel
:::*Desertification occurs from domestic animals over-grazing land
:::*There has been overfishing of lakes and rivers, and now the oceans
::*Most pollution such as depletion of the ozone layer and the greenhouse gasses which are causing global warming are a result of industrialization
::*The question becomes: how can we develop indicators which can be used to adjust national income accounting to alert us when there is a problem and provide a way of evaluating attempts to reverse the degradation?
:::*Valuing natural and environmental resources is not simple:
::::*Market values can be subtracted from the flow of income generated by a country; while not ideal this does provide an indicator
::::*It is usually very difficult to measure changes in quality rather than simple market values of quantities consumed
::*If we attempt to measure resources which have no market value:
:::*People may lie about the true value if they think that lying will benefit them
:::*Market values usually reflect opportunity costs: the value of substitutes.  How do we value a resource for which there is no substitute?

:*''Problems With Industrialization''
::*Crowding in cities usually leads to pollution, health and sanitation problems, crime and vandalism, and a breakdown in infrastructure
::*The greatest industrial weakness in LDCs is management
:::*Labour is more difficult to manage than capital, thus firms use labour saving systems to compensate for weak management
:::*Unionization, minimum wage and labour protection laws motivate firms to buy labour saving capital
:::*Foreign investors import labour saving capital equipment
	
::*Prestige attached to industrialization leads to government pressuring for capital intense, modern industries and unnecessary infrastructure:
:::*Paid for with taxes on primary sector exports, impoverishing rural areas
:::*City infrastructure is heavily subsidized and given priority
::::*Firms lobby for subsidized food in the cities
::::*Rural-urban migration explodes
	
''Case Study: China''
:*China tried to copy the Russian model and put all its investment into industry.  Disastrous harvests followed forcing the govt. to change policy:
::*Collectivized farms were abandoned and market driven farmers were encouraged to invest in machinery and chemicals
::*The government restricted rural urban migration, the resulting migration which did occur was not enough to eliminate the rural labour surplus, the government introduced incentives to lower the birth rate
::*Prices to farmers were raised, while input costs were held constant with the result that the terms of trade turned in favour of the agricultural sector
::*Mechanization of farms was slowed down to prevent a drop in demand for surplus farm labour
	
''Case Study: Kenya, Zambia''
:*Investment was devoted primarily to industrialization in the cities:
::*Low farm productivity: researchers believed they were a result of diminishing returns because of the limited supply of land, but in fact most African countries had low population densities (many still do)
::*New farm lands were opened up, populations grew rapidly because of the increases in agricultural productivity
::*Eventually the sharp decline in available arable land and the movement of people to the cities reduced per capita food production
::*Resources have been switched back from the cities to the rural areas


===='''Income distribution'''====
-----
:*May increase inequality if benefits of growth only seen by a select few, or decrease inequality if benefits seen by entire population.
''Fairness of Access''
:*Traditional economic growth has attempted to maximize the income per person: making the pie grow bigger and hoping that poorer people with only tiny slices will experience some improvement in welfare
:*More recently, economic development has emphasized the need to distribute the income more evenly amongst persons.  Everyone receives a slice which is more fair in size, even if the pie stays the same size.
:*Should growth have priority over the environment?
::*Without adequate environmental protection, development is undermined
::*Without development, resources will be inadequate for needed investments, and environmental protection will fail
:*Poor people have a high marginal propensity to consume compared to rich people who have a high marginal propensity to save
::*Should we reduce poverty by spreading limited resources thinly and see them used more rapidly?
::*Should we allow the rich to accumulate assets knowing they might invest in and take better care of them?
	
:*People living in poorer countries which are natural resource poor and future generations impoverished by our overused of resources do not have political or economic power to ensure access
:*Uncertainty about environmental systems and their role in our very existence make us wary of engaging in traditional economic net benefit maximization.  This is especially true for future generations.


===='''Sustainability'''====
-----
:*Economic growth will put pressure on the environment

''Sustainable Development:''  integration of economic, environmental and social components at all levels without destroying resources held in trust for future generations
:*''Limits to Growth''
::*In the 1960s and 1970s some scientists predicted the end of the world based on physical limits on resources which would restrain economic growth.
::*In the 1980s many prominent studies were published which changed the focus
:::*The world’s resources are indeed sufficient to meet long term human needs
:::*The uneven spatial distribution of the human population relative to the natural carrying capacity of the environment is of much greater concern
:::*There is inefficient and irrational use of natural resources
:::*The ability to pollute the world to the point where it is unlivable is likely to happen far more quickly than the exhaustion of natural resources
::*In the 1990s interest has shifted to applying the knowledge accumulated in the natural sciences to the economic process:
:::*The scale and rate of throughput, energy and matter passing through economic systems, is subject to entropy, the second law of thermodynamics:
::::*Entropy: materials that get used in the economy tend to get dissipated and it requires energy inputs to make these materials useful again
::::*Sometimes it is not worthwhile recycling: the cost of transportation required to bring all the used materials together and the energy required to return them to a useful state may cost more than the original materials

''Sustainable Human Development (SHD)''
:*UNDP (IGO) vision for development that centers on enlarging people’s choices and capabilities, enabling participation in decisions that affect their lives - SHD approach is both inclusive and multisectoral, and works to ensure that the process of development not only generates economic growth, but also distributes its benefits equitably
:*Four key components:
::*Productivity: people must be allowed full participation in the process of income generation and paid employment
::*Equity: people must have access to equal opportunities
::*Sustainability: equity must be ensured not only for the present generations but for future generations as well
::*Empowerment: development must be BY the people, not FOR them - a 'process' not so much an 'end result'

===='''Poverty cycle'''==== 
-----
Low incomes --&gt; Low savings --&gt; Low investment --&gt; Low productivity --&gt; low income...

''Absolute poverty'': ''inability to just meet basic physical human necessities''/needs of food/nutrition, clothing, health and shelter in order to survive
:*Because this is so difficult to measure accurately, many researchers simply estimate that 20% of the world’s population falls below this line  
:*UNDP reports that most live in 10 countries, with the proportions falling below the poverty line in brackets: Bangladesh (80%), Ethiopia (60%), Vietnam (55%), Philippines (54%), Brazil (49%), India (40%), Nigeria (40%), Pakistan (29%),Indonesia (24%) and China (10%)
:*A characteristic of most LEDCs is the unequal distribution of income
:*What is interesting is the middle income LEDCs appear to have greater income inequality than very poor or high income countries
:*Income inequality is greatest in Latin American countries

''Relative poverty'': a poverty measure based on a poor standard of living/low income ''compared to the rest of society''
:*Suggests that the lack of ACCESS to many goods and services expected by the rest of the respective society leads to social exclusion and damaging results for the individuals and families mired in relative poverty

''Rural Poverty''
:*Most poor people are found in rural areas: farmers with small holdings, landless peasants, artisans, fishermen, nomads and indigenous people - the poor are not idle, they work hard
:*Those with a traditional way of life are not necessarily poor - for thousands of years they adequately sustained themselves - it is only recently that they have become poor due to policies which have deprived them of the means of earning a living (land, fisheries, hunting ranges, forests)
:*Poverty in city slums is highly correlated with poverty in the countryside and is linked through migration
:*Women are often the poorest of the poor, as men control most of the land, capital and technology, and receive a better education in most countries - this can have a major impact on population control
::*Investments in infrastructure, social services, and technology in rural areas can go a long way to helping those mired in the poverty cycle

''Human Suffering Index (HSI)'' has been developed which looks beyond HDI
:*Composite indicator, linking ten measures of human welfare - income (GDP/capita), inflation rate, life expectancy, demand for new jobs/urban population pressures, infant mortality/infant immunization, nutrition/daily calorie supply, access to clean water, energy use/telephones/1000 people, adult literacy/secondary school enrollment, and personal political freedom/civil rights
:*HSI numbers are worst in Mozambique (93), followed by Somalia, Afghanistan, Haiti, and Sudan. Most of these countries also have high population growth. The most comfortable countries are Denmark (1), the Netherlands, Belgium, Switzerland, and Canada, which have low population growth. Total scores of 75 or greater (extreme human suffering) occur in 37 countries (20 in Africa, 16 in Asia, and Haiti) with 8% of the world's population (432 million people) (2002)
:*It is estimated that 75% of the world’s population live in countries where the human suffering index is over 50% 
:*It is estimated that 1 billion people live in desperate poverty
:*HSI numbers are comparatively worse off now than just five years ago
	
''Case study: Kerala State in India''
This is a region with low income and yet a reasonably high standard of living because of the emphasis on human development:
:*The society is very international in its approach, and is not afraid of new ideas and methods of doing things
:*Women have a high status in the society due to the matrilineal system of passing property from mother to daughter rather than from father to son
:*With greater wealth and income in the hands of women, the child mortality rate is low, and spending on health, nutrition and education for children has been very high: the illiteracy rate is very low
:*There is a strong interest in community economic development and the institutions which promote community welfare such as cooperatives and community associations
:*The result is strong representation for labour in the workplace, excellent health standards and low prices on food which result in very little malnutrition

''Reducing Poverty'' 
:*The trickle down theory is associated with the concept that inequity is inevitably a part of economic growth, but after a period of rapid growth, greater equity and poverty reduction will occur 
:*Studies have shown that income distribution does appear to worsen at first
:*However, the evidence indicates that rapid growth does not appear to have eradicated poverty which is surely the aim of growth in the first place
:*Furthermore, as income rises for the few who are lucky, their consumption pattern tends to dominate the location on the production possibility curve, more luxury goods rather than necessities are produced
	
:*The elite may not contribute that much to growth
:*They often import luxury goods rather than invest domestically - this is very different from the historical pattern for the MEDCs 
:*Often there is ''capital flight'': elites may invest in overseas bank accounts, property or investment opportunities
:*''Brain drain'' occurs when those in skilled positions (e.g., doctors, engineers, architects, university professors) leave and work abroad for higher pay/increased opportunities
	
''Stimulating Growth while Reducing Poverty''
:*Growth needs to be targeted at those sectors which will reduce poverty
:*Raising the income of the poor will lead to increased consumption of necessities which are produced within the country
:*This stimulates investment, incomes and jobs and leads to improved health and education which, in turn, increases productivity
:*R&amp;D should be directed toward appropriate technology rather than to the transfer of labour saving technology from MEDCs

===='''Institutional and political factors'''====
-----
'''Ineffective taxation structure'''
:*Taxation is often a difficult problem in LEDCs:
::*In many countries very little tax revenue is collected and government is forced to raise revenue by printing money or imposing export tariffs which inevitably reduces the incomes of rural people because most LEDCs export raw materials and agricultural products
::*A proper income tax system can provide the revenue for govt. and reduce inequality by making the wealthy pay a fair share for running the country
::*Greater tax revenue also allows the government to provide basic infrastructure for the poor such as better health care, better schools, provision of clean water, sanitation, and electricity and more reliable road systems (infrastructure)
::*Laffer Curve

:''Price Distortions''
:*Prices are often distorted due to subsidies or a strong union sector which is able to extract high wages from foreign multi-nationals
:*A return to market prices is essential so that correct signals can be sent to allocate resources according to true scarcity: for example, lower wages would lead to greater employment
:*Government subsidizes capital through tax breaks, grants and low foreign exchange - this lowers the price of capital artificially and leads to substitution of capital for labour

'''Lack of property rights''' 
:*And rule of law in general, including reasonable, predictable contract enforcement 
:*No clear title to real property (land, houses) and high-value assets
:*Inheritance of property often cloudy
:*Capital gains from sales often subject to negotiation, thus not predictable

'''Political instability''' 
:*Important to attract FDI
:*Important that the next government assume the debt obligations of outgoing government
:*Rule by the will of the people OR for the government in power - who is the government working for?

'''Corruption'''
:*An issue worldwide; many different forms; some quite subtle in nature
:*Most involving bribes for getting imports into a country or in bidding on government contracts
:*Transparency International

'''Unequal distribution of income''' 
:*Redistribution of assets often does not happen or does not happen fairly (transparently)
:*If the most important cause of inequality is an unequal distribution of land, natural resources and capital, attempts must be made to redistribute at least some natural resources such as land
:*Land reform can often lead to a dramatic increase in farm productivity and incomes for the rural poor
:*Children of the elite have greater access to education and to the best jobs:
::*Policies to open access to education for the poor, to reduce absenteeism and improve the quality of education can lead to great increases in productivity
:*Gini coefficient/Lorenz Curve

'''Formal and informal markets''' 
:*Percentage of population engaged in a money economy v. subsistence/barter economy 
:*The less informal markets operating, the more grasp on the macroeconomy the government has

'''Lack of infrastructure''' 
:*Important to attract FDI
:*Key to allow access to markets, schools, hospitals, wider world (even if just the capital city/urban area)

===='''International trade barriers'''====
-----
:*overdependence on primary products
:*consequences of adverse terms of trade
:*consequences of a narrow range of exports
:*protectionism in international trade


===='''International financial barriers'''====
-----
'''International finance &amp; indebtedness'''
:*Economic development has been promoted since 1960 as the best route for LEDCs to follow, justifying borrowing from banks to spend on projects:
::*The risky nature of lending to LEDCs requires: higher interest rates, much more expensive than the rate charged by the World Bank or aid agencies
::*Stock of debt: the ratio of debts to exports has averaged 125% to 150%
::*Debt servicing flow: includes interest payments and repayments of principal, and often exceeds 40% of exports for certain poorer LEDCs
	
''Causes of the Debt Crisis''
:*In 1973 and 1979 OPEC increased the price of oil dramatically:
::*Oil rich countries looked for the highest rate of return on investments
::*The international banking community started lending this money to LEDCs
::*While the nominal interest rates charged were high, once inflation had been taken into account, the real interest rates were very low leading to an explosion in LEDC borrowing
::*Those LEDCs which did not have oil, were now faced with vastly higher costs for fuel, input costs rose dramatically hurting exports
	
:*Since 1935 most industrialized countries have been off the gold standard
:*Governments started inflating in the early 1960s until 1976 when inflation rates reached high levels in the MEDCs:
::*Loanable funds were available at low interest rates to lend around the world
::*LEDCs were accustomed to ‘soft’ loans from international agencies such as the World Bank which lent at low rates of interest
::*Commercial banks charged full market rates on 'hard' loans 
:*By 1979 most OECD countries decided to stop inflating:
::*Interest rates rose dramatically, particularly on short term commercial paper
::*More than 50% of LEDC debt is short term in nature, the interest rates being charged to LEDCs reached crisis proportion
::*With the shortage of money, oil rich countries started taking their cash out of the bank to be used in their own countries
::*No more loans were available for anyone including LEDCs
::*As incomes in MEDCs fell so did imports from LEDCs worsening their balance of payments difficulties
::*Elite groups in LEDCs panicked and there was capital flight:
:::*It is estimated that 30% of all borrowed funds, usually in a hard currency, ended up in bank accounts outside the borrowing country
	
''Poor project evaluation''
:*MEDC banks were only interested in securing loans through government guarantees, there was little checking of the projects the money was to be used for  
:*Much of the borrowed money had been wasted on military arms or projects which did not have any hope of paying interest on the debt or ever repaying the principal
:*Many LEDCs printed money to cover the deficits which led to extremely high rates of inflation in some countries
	
''Rescheduling &amp; Restructuring''
:*LEDCs were unable to service their debts and were forced to reschedule
:*Loans were renegotiated with lenders, extending the terms of repayment
:*LEDC governments have been forced to make major structural reforms under instruction from the IMF in order to qualify for rescheduling:
::*Market mechanisms: supply side measures increase output and investment
::*Devaluation of the currency: devaluation should lead to greater exports and fewer imports unless both domestic demand for imports and external demand for exports are inelastic
::*Deflation: tight monetary and fiscal policy reduce government deficits, inflation and eventually interest rates

:*LEDCs which are able to lower their debt servicing experience some benefits:
::*Lower inflation which stabilizes the exchange rate and creates enough confidence that the elite repatriate money lost through capital flight
::*Domestic interest rates fall leading to greater domestic investment and an improvement in the economy
	
:*Restructuring simply extends the length of the repayment problem, it does not eliminate the debt: 
::*LEDCs simply lack the exports needed to earn the foreign exchange required to service the debt
::*The only hope of getting out of debt is for MEDC economies to expand rapidly leading to major increases in imports from LEDCs
::*Most of the debtor nations are faced with years of economic deprivation in order to meet their debt obligations
::*Domestic policies that lead to overvalued currencies encourage imports and discourage exports creating strong pressures to seek more loans to support the country until the next crisis
::*If the money had been invested in projects which earned a rate of return which could have paid the interest plus repaid the principal, there would have been few problems


'''Non-convertible currencies'''

'''Capital flight/brain drain'''

===='''Social and cultural factors acting as barriers'''====
-----
:*religion
:*culture
:*tradition
:*gender issues

:*Periods of economic growth are associated with structural transformation and social and ideological changes.  In the past, 1/3 of growth came from population increases and 2/3s from productivity increases
:*Productivity increased due to technological change in terms of capital and human skills, encouraging research and development which led to further growth
:*The rise in income led to increased consumption:
::*Demand for income elastic industrial products rose quickly
::*Demand for income inelastic agricultural goods grew only slowly
::*This led to a rapid rural-urban shift which often destroyed traditional values

''Current Conditions facing LEDCs''
:*Many LEDCs are not truly nations, they are artificial creations of former colonial powers
::*Have not had enough time to adapt to modern concepts such as science, individualism, economic mobility, and the work ethic
:*Political dependency has been replaced by economic dependency:
::*Technological transfer is controlled by MNCs and trade and finance are dominated by MEDCs
::*Many LEDC natural resource endowments require western capital and knowledge to exploit them
::*Populations are much larger, population densities greater, and education levels lower than they were for MDCs during their period of industrialization
::*The terms of trade have moved steadily against the LDCs because they export mainly raw materials with little value added
:*LEDCs have little scope to develop new products or techniques of production, the expertise in the MEDCs is overwhelming: 
::*Most R&amp;D is concentrated in MEDCs
::*Most technology is labour saving which may not be of great use in countries which have a large labour force looking for employment
:*Where LEDCs try to add value to raw materials they are faced with high tariff barriers in the MEDCs which are trying to preserve jobs
:*Growth does not necessarily proceed without interruption.  It requires social legitimacy: 
::*When Argentina took off, Juan Peron carried out measures that were popular with his constituents, such as price control of food grains and enlarged military expenditures, but that stifled growth and divided society into sharply contending classes
::*Iran's oil wealth, far from being a source of stability, increased the alienation of the great majority of the people who felt that the nation's wealth was being monopolized by a corrupt few
 
''Population Birth and Death Rates''
:*The natural increase in population is the birth rate minus the death rate
:*The pre-industrial era was characterized by high birth and high death rates leading to a slow growing population
	
:*''Birth rates'' in LEDCs are much higher than in MEDCs during the comparable period of development: a larger proportion of women marry and do so at a younger age (leads to larger families)
:*For many developing countries the birth rate remains high while the death rate falls - studies suggest that developing countries today are moving through this phase more rapidly than MEDCs
:*Eventually the birth rate also declines, until low birth and death rates lead to low and stable population growth again
:*For MEDCs population growth rate is 0.5% and for LEDCs it is 2% (2003)
:*Studies indicate that more even income distribution contributes to a more rapid fall in the birth rate
:*In those LEDCs with high poverty levels, birth rates have remained much higher than for MEDCs: there is a correlation between high birth rates and low GDP per capita
	
:*''Death rate:'' as countries develop the death rate drops very quickly due to:
::*Sanitation: there is a reduction in infant mortality due to better sanitation, cleaner water and basic health knowledge
::*Health care: there is a reduction in mortality from disease because of better health care systems
::*Agricultural production: as food production increases deaths resulting directly or indirectly from malnutrition fall
	
:*''Survival rate:'' as the survival rate for children increases there is a rapid increase in children as a proportion of the population, savings and investment rates fall:
::*This increases dependency rates within families, per capita income falls as unproductive children are housed and fed
::*Children under 15 form 25% of MEDC population and 50% of the LEDC population which leads to a high dependency ratio of non-workers to workers
::*Because of the young population, fertility rates are very high and birth rates increase yet again: healthier, better fed women have a greater capacity to give birth to a healthy child
 
''Population: Policy Options''
:*After the last ice age, 13,000 years ago, world population was 100 million
:*By 1790 this had increased to 1.7 billion, and current estimates place world population at 6 billion - the latest findings show a very rapid decrease in population growth rates to the point where it is now expected that population will stabilize at about 7.5 billion by 2040, much lower than original estimates of 12 billion by the year 2075
	 
''Optimal Population Levels''
:*Sub-optimal levels: there is not enough labour to utilize the available resources to the maximum potential
:*Above optimal levels: diminishing returns set in as there is too much labour
:*However, natural resource discoveries and increases in productivity: will increase the optimal population level
:*Preference for additional children depends on the number of surviving children and the costs and benefits of those extra children
:*Costs are dependent on feeding, clothing and education, plus the opportunity cost of the mother’s time
:*Benefits include the need for children to help with the farm or small family business, the security in old age, and particularly during periods of prolonged sickness
	
:*Slower population growth: can be achieved through family planning by women:
::*Social security: if there are pensions and support during illness, there is less need for a large family
::*Effective birth control: whether through chemical or mechanical means or through birth spacing through extended breast feeding
::*Higher female employment and greater schooling for both men and women leads to lower fertility rates
::*Meaningful work for women: women have an alternative way of achieving fulfillment in addition to having children
	
:*Financial costs of having children: 
::*There are reduced opportunities for children to earn income in urban settings due to enforced schooling and fewer less skilled jobs, plus the opportunity costs of the parent's time rises
::*Higher incomes seem to encourage fewer children with more invested in each child
::*Mass sterilization: created much hatred and severe backlash
	
:*Slower population growth is better:
::*Savings rates rise: families save more and govts. spend less on social services
::*People invest more in human capital: it is more worthwhile if there are fewer children and they are likely to live longer
::*There is more investment in infrastructure
::*There is less deforestation and erosion of soil
	
:*Ecological Footprint
::*The US with 6% of the population in the world uses 40% of the world’s resources, and India with 17% of the population uses 4% of the world’s resources
::*Population densities: Are very low in most African and South American countries, and are very high in many developed countries
::*If MEDC populations are adjusted to include their ecological footprint, the real populations and population densities are even higher:
:::*For the US using 6.7 times the world average of resources per person: 1,900 million people
:::*For India using 0.25 times the world average of resources per person: 212 million people
	
:*Malthusian approach: the law of diminishing returns suggests that the world will run out of resources in the face of the rapid increase in population
:*Demographers find that the big increase in population is over - while the long term effects will lead to increased populations in the future, the growth rate has already started to stabilize and will reach replacement level by the year 2050
:*While resources have been fixed, the gains from specialization, economies of scale and learning by doing have more than outweighed diminishing returns in the last 100 years
:*There does not appear to be a clear correlation between birth rates and per capita income - death rates have fallen quite independently of incomes
:*It appears that a more equitable distribution of income, greater literacy for women, and more job opportunities for women results in a lower population growth rate
 
''Agriculture &amp; Rural Urban Migration''
:*It is estimated that in MEDCs, 27% of the population lives in the rural sector with possibly as much as 5% involved in agriculture
:*In LEDCs the figure is 66% living in rural areas, with nearly 70% involved in agriculture
:*Many of the most severe development problems arise from a weak agricultural sector - growth through the agriculture sector has not led to increases in per capita income
:*On the demand side: 
::*The growth potential in the agricultural sector is limited because income elasticity of demand for food is close to zero, growth is much more rapid for industrial goods and services.  
::*Primary exports form the major source of foreign exchange earnings for LDCs, and yet the proportion of primary sector goods in total world trade has fallen from 33% in 1950 to 21% in 1995.
:*On the supply side productivity in agriculture is very low:
::*Increased use of machinery and new methods of raising crops have made it possible for an individual farmer in the US to produce enough food to feed 50 families
::*Farmers in LEDCs are hard pressed to support one other family beside their own
::*Severe droughts and famines occur on a regular basis
::*The oil crisis led to a large increase in energy costs raising the cost of food, while poor people in urban areas spending 80% of their incomes on food could not afford a 100% increase in price
::*Government often imposes price controls which help the urban poor but hurt the farmers
	
:*The potential for growth through industrialization is much greater, so governments invest in infrastructure in cities and subsidized capital
:*As a result, food processing can be done much more cheaply by shipping unprocessed food to the cities: even less value added is left in rural areas
	
''Unemployment &amp; Rural Urban Migration''
:*As government pours money into urban housing, education, food subsidies, health care, and infrastructure, people migrate to the cities, and then government pours even more money into the cities to prevent rioting
:*The official unemployment rate in LEDCs tends to be higher than for MEDCs; however, if disguised unemployment and underemployment figures are included, there is a very serious unemployment problem in LEDCs
:*Disguised unemployment: people are working but producing very little (marginal product is close to zero), each member of the family is trying to share in the total output but has very little to add to production
:*Underemployment occurs where people who would like to work full time only work part time each week, or for only a few months each year (or work in a job in which they are overqualified)
	
''Urban Employment''
:*If investment has been concentrated in industry, enough capacity may be created to absorb labour which is surplus to the agricultural sector
:*Rural wages equal the average product of farm labour in the farm household, this is at subsistence level because there is a great deal of surplus labour and much underemployment
:*The supply curve of labour to industry is elastic up to the point at which the withdrawal of labour can no longer be accomplished without a decline in agricultural productivity: all the surplus labour has been removed
:*Industry only has to pay slightly more than subsistence level to attract labour to manufacturing jobs in the cities
:*A large part of the population can leave without any reduction in farm output	
:*The problem occurs if the urban sector is small relative to the large rural sector and there is not enough capacity to absorb the surplus labour
:*Often investment has been capital intensive (labour saving) which means there are few jobs available, particularly for the unskilled rural worker
:*Even if there is only a 20% chance of getting work, or if there is only part time work available for 20% of the year, young people are still attracted to the city if the urban wage is five times the rural wage
:*If a rural area suffers from drought every few years, the lifetime income expected from staying on a farm could be less despite the prospect of many years of being only partially employed in the city
:*Studies indicate that most migrants do find work within 2 months of reaching the city: most are young with better education which enhances the prospect of finding employment in the city

      <text xml:space="preserve">==5.4 Growth and Development Strategies==

===='''Harrod-Domar growth model'''====
-----
:*1930s concept that explains why economies do not grow as fast their potential growth rates
:*Assumes fixed capital-labour ratios and low savings ratios due to poverty cycle
::*LEDCs have abundant supply of labour and the lack of physical capital holds back economic growth/development
::*More physical capital will generate economic growth
:*Actual income determines the savings ratio, which determines the disposable income for investment, which then affects the rate of economic growth
:*Savings rate, plus capital productivity, minus capital depreciation, equals rate of economic growth
:*Potential growth rate is not achieved automatically (needs Keynesian intervention) if saving is not enough (or not enough confidence in the banking system to offered commercial loans)
:*Change in savings ratio or increased productivity will lead to an economy realizing more of their potential (more efficient)

''Problems of the H-D model''
:*Economic growth and economic development are not the same; growth is a necessary (but not sufficient) condition for development
:*Difficult to stimulate the level of domestic savings, particularly in the case of LEDCs where incomes and confidence in the banking system are low
:*Borrowing from overseas to fill the gap caused by insufficient savings causes debt repayment problems later
:*Law of diminishing returns suggests that as investment increases the productivity of the capital will decrease and the capital to output ratio rise


===='''Lewis' Structural change/dual sector model'''====
-----
:*1954 idea: assumed many LEDCs had dual economies with both a traditional agricultural sector (subsistence nature, characterized by low productivity, low incomes, low savings and much unemployment) and a modern industrial sector (technologically advanced with high levels of investment operating near an urban environment)
:*Development was held back by lack of savings and investment; key to development was to increase savings and investment
:*Theorized that 'pull factors' from the modern industrial sector would attract workers from the rural areas (these firms, whether private or public, could offer wages that would offer a higher quality of life than remaining in the rural areas)
:*As the level of labour productivity was so low in traditional agricultural areas, people leaving the rural areas would have virtually no impact on output (amount of food available to the remaining villagers would increase as the same amount of food could be shared amongst fewer people; possibly offering a surplus which could be sold)
:*Those in the urban areas would earn increased incomes, generating more savings and providing funds for entrepreneurs for investment; the growing industrial sector required labour and provided incomes that could be spent and saved, generating demand and providing funds for investment
:*Income generated would trickle down through the economy

''Problems of the Lewis Model''
:*Productivity of labour in rural areas is almost zero may be true for certain times of the year; however, during planting and harvesting the need for labour is critical to the needs of the village
:*Constant demand for labour from the secondary industrial sector is questionable. Increasing technology may result in labour saving and actually reducing the need for labour. Additionally, if the industry declines, demand for labour will fall
:*Trickle down has been criticised; higher incomes earned in the industrial sector will not necessarily be saved and invested. If the entrepreneurs and labour spend their new incomes rather than save (preferably in banks), funds for investment and growth will not be available
:*Rural-urban migration in many LEDCs has been far larger than the secondary industrial sector can provide jobs; urban poverty has replaced rural poverty

===='''Types of aid'''====
-----
'''OFFICIAL AID'''

''Official Development Assistance'' (ODA) is transferred either as bilateral aid between governments or as multilateral aid through agencies such as the World Bank or the UN


OECD's Development Assistance Committee (DAC) defines ODA as:
''flows to developing countries and multilateral institutions provided by official agencies, including state and local governments, or by their executive agencies, each transaction of which meets the following tests:
:*it is administered with the promotion of the economic development and welfare of developing countries as its main objective, and
:*it is concessional in character (lower rate/perhaps none interest, easier credit terms and repayment schedule, sometimes repayable in local currency; targeted toward a certain 'theme', i.e., poverty reduction or trade expansion) and contains a grant element (not expected to be paid back: food, medical and emergency aid) of at least 25%
:*ODA has grown from $22 billion to $60 billion between 1960 and 1990
:*Aid has fallen from 0.5% of donor GNP in 1960 to 0.3% in 1990
:*The US is the largest donor (in nominal/real terms) with $11.3 billion in 1991
::*Represents ~0.2% of GNP
:*Japan is the second largest with $10.9 billion in 1991
:::*UN aqreement of 0.7% of GNP (1970)
:::Sweden gives ~1% of GNP

:*The World Bank lent $6 billion in 1990
:*UN agencies gave $4 billion, and provided the largest amount of technical assistance through the United Nations Development Program (UNDP), United Nations Environmental Program (UNEP), United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), International Labour Organization (ILO), World Health Organization (WHO)
:*''Unofficial aid'' is transferred through non-governmental organizations (NGOs):
::*NGOs gave $6 billion in 1990, the same amount as the World Bank
::*NGOs tend to attack poverty directly by working with local groups to achieve LOCAL AGENDAS rather than imposing their own agenda
::*LEDCs with large populations have received less because donors have a greater impact by donating to smaller countries which then become more dependent
::*It is estimated that less than 10% of overall aid goes directly to programs to help the poor such as health care/health education, basic literacy education, AIDS prevention, agricultural extension, microcredit schemes, immunization and vocational training, and clean water and sanitation (these are all project typically taken on through NGO aid)
	 

'''BILATERAL &amp; MULTILATERAL FOREIGN AID'''

''Bilateral Foreign Aid''
:*Bilateral aid tends to be distributed directly between two countries according to ''political interests'':
::*The US mainly directed its aid toward containing communism
::*The EU helps former colonies, especially African countries
::*Islamic members of OPEC concentrate on Islamic countries, but this source of funding has faded rapidly with the sharp declines in oil revenues
::*Communist bloc countries used to give to communist countries such as Cuba, Mongolia, and Vietnam, but aid from this source has disappeared
		
''Multilateral Foreign Aid''
:*Most LEDCs have a current account deficit created by the import of high value added capital goods which cannot be matched by the low value added exports - aid provides an alternative to FDI as a way to create a capital account surplus
:*The first aid plan was the Marshall Plan (no longer available) provided by the US which was motivated by a combination of national security fears, economic interests and humanitarian concerns 
:*This aid was available to European countries with acceptable development plans for physical capital investment
:*It expanded to include new technical assistance programs: available to invest in human capital
:*Plans and projects were generally excellent making the Marshall plan so successful that private capital was attracted
	
:*The success of the Marshall Plan led to the formation of the development assistance committee of the OECD (25% US) which provided money for:
::*Capital and human capital investment (education)
::*Improving health and sanitation
::*Relieving poverty through rural regeneration, and assistance to women

:'''''World Bank'''''
:*Large donor countries such as the US or Japan or EU tend to dominate multilateral aid agencies such as the World Bank (created at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944)
:*The World Bank does not give grants (gifts of money) but borrows at the prime rate from MEDCs and relends at a slightly higher rate to LEDCs and must be repaid:
::*90% of loans are for projects (physical capital); 10% for programmes
::*US traditionally selects leader

:'''''IMF'''''
:*Large donor countries also tend to dominate the IMF (also created at the Bretton Woods conference in 1944)
::*The IMF is designed to support the system of international currencies
::*It only gives loans to countries experiencing balance of payments difficulties
::*The loans are conditional on the imposition of a structural adjustment programme (SAP) which often requires: reductions in government budget deficits, a slower rate of money expansion (lower inflation) and devaluation
::*European governments traditionally select leader


'''GRANT AID, SOFT LOANS'''
:*''Grant aid'':money not expected to be returned
::*Used primarily for food, medical and emergency aid
:*''Soft loans'': loans with a lower interest rate (perhaps none), easier credit terms and repayment schedule, sometimes repayable in local currency; targeted toward a certain 'theme', i.e., poverty reduction or trade expansion
::*Relatively easy to renegotiate a different repayment schedule if a country is having difficulty with debt service

'''TIED AID'''
:*Bilateral aid is often ''tied'': aid money can only be used to purchase goods and services from the donor countries
:*Historically, the proportions were: France 60%, Britain 75%, Italy 90% - while Japan does not officially tie aid, it often reaches unofficial agreements which do tie aid
:*The proportions which are tied have dropped steadily and average 25% for many countries
:*Services are tied in the form of technical assistants being sent out from the donor country:
::*They are designed to provide the technical and managerial skills which may be missing in the LEDCs
::*An estimated 100,000 consultants from MDCs are working in African countries, many are doing jobs which could be done by local people

''Conditionality''
:*Loans and aid from large agencies is often conditional on changes in government policy in the recipient country
::*IMF's SAP is a good example of this, encouraging: less protectionism/lifting restrictions in trade; currency devaluation; exports of primary agricultural commodities (&quot;cash crops&quot;), metals and minerals; increased FDI; privitization of nationalized businesses; removing subsidies and price controls; reducing social expenditures and government expenditures in general to have a balanced budget; charging for education and health services; reducing corruption; and making government more responsive to the people (Washington Consensus)
:*One condition is often that funds are used to buy goods and services from the donor country
::*Resulting in aid money actually flowing back into the donating country

===='''Export-led growth/outward oriented strategies'''====
-----
:*Tariffs are reduced or eliminated, and imports rise
:*Domestic production is displaced and unemployment rises in domestic industries that compete with imports 
:*Costs for intermediate goods fall leading to an increase in exports and a fall in unemployment in the external sector 
:*Countries specialize in the sectors in which they have a comparative advantage

:*''Export promotion benefits''
::*There is more rapid growth in both GDP and GDP per capita 
::*Technology transfer takes place through imports of capital goods 
::*Exports of manufactured goods rise compared to primary sector exports 
::*Gains from trade: lead to a higher standard of living 
::*Specialization allows economies of scale and rapid learning by doing 
::*Even if growth is more uneven, the huge increase in productive capacity will lead to rapid investment and linkage adjustment in other sectors (backward and forward integration) 
:*''Export promotion costs''
::*MEDC tariffs and quotas block imports of labour intense manufacturing goods where LEDCs have a comparative advantage 
::*Growth is more uneven 
::*Vertical integration is lost, workers may be confined to assembly and some fabrication 
::*There is a risk that new technology may render a sector obsolete 
::*There may be an overemphasis on natural resource exports which could lead to deteriorating terms of trade

===='''Import substitution/inward-oriented strategies/protectionism'''====
-----
:*Tariffs are imposed and imports fall
:*The first to be protected are final stage assembly and simple consumer goods
:*Over time, parts fabrication and more sophisticated manufacturing is protected
:*Domestic production increases and unemployment falls
:*Capital and intermediate goods become more expensive, otherwise why would tariff barriers be needed to promote sales of domestic equivalents?
:*Costs rise for exports, exports fall, and unemployment rises in the export sector

:*''Benefits from import substitution''
::*There is greater vertical integration within industries (both upstream and downstream)
::*Research, development, engineering, design, fabrication, assembly, marketing, and financing provide a richer variety of jobs 
::*There is greater integration amongst industries (both backward and forward linkages) 
::*Learning by doing takes place
::*There is less dependence on other countries, therefore less specialization and more evenly distributed development in the economy

:*''Costs of import substitution''
::*Infant industries never grow up because the lack of international competition leads to higher costs
::*With few imports of capital goods, there is virtually no technology transfer
::*The export sector collapses so there are no gains from trade 
::*Economies of scale cannot be achieved because the market is too small
::*Balance of payments problems lead to a reduction in imported capital which is often needed for industrialization to proceed: 
:::*Producers are cut off from new technology in international markets. 
::*The poor gain little, the major beneficiaries are the wealthy and the MNCs operating behind tariff walls
::*Government tends to subsidize capital, and currencies are held artificially high to encourage the use of imported capital and intermediate goods: 
:::*Industry becomes less labour intense, leading to unemployment. 
::*Exporters of primary goods (the poor) are hurt: because LEDCs face perfectly elastic demand, they have to lower their prices to compensate for the higher currency value. 

''Import Substitution vs Export Promotion''

Is it better for industrialization to proceed through replacing imported goods with domestically produced goods, or is export promotion more likely to lead to faster growth because of the gains from trade through specialization?

===='''Commercial loans'''====
-----

Commercial loans are loans that involve buying and selling (commerce) activities, that are concerned with making a profit.

===='''Fair trade organizations'''====

===='''Micro-credit schemes'''====
-----
:*Small loan amounts for a small time period often with weekly/bi-weekly payments due at a low percentage interest, often tied with entrepreneurial education (used to purchase a sewing machine, a handloom, a cow), taken out by consumers deemed uncreditworthy by commercial banks
:*Low default rates
:*Access to credit is a human right and one way to break the poverty cycle
::*Grameen Bank (Muhammad Yunis) Nobel Prize 2006


===='''Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)'''====
-----
:*FDI by MNC/TNCs usually comes in a bundle including: equity and debt financing, management expertise, technology transfer, technical skills training, and access to overseas markets:
::*Product life cycles have reinforced the need to maintain technical superiority in order to advance, thus MNCs are extremely reluctant to un-bundle the package: they fear the technology will be exposed to a competitor who will reach the life cycle window faster
:*LEDC governments are attracted by the FDI bundle:
::*Learning by doing: is accelerated which can enable the country to cope with a technologically advanced future
::*Technology transfer: while embodied in a process, also includes information and the technical skills needed to adapt, install, operate and maintain capital equipment systems
::*Managerial shortage: LEDC govts understand the acute shortage of local managers capable of organizing and operating large scale industrial projects
::*Intra firm exclusion: LEDC govts realize that access to international markets is severely limited because markets are dominated by intra and inter firm transactions (50% of Canada's imports and exports are intra firm sales), MNC/TNCs are needed to gain access to this system
::*Marketing expertise: MNC/TNCs have preferential agreements with customers due to volume, length of time in the business, the use of standardized contracts and standardized products, it may take years for LDC producers to understand let alone break into international markets
::*Supply side bottlenecks: can be reduced through FDI by MNC/TNCs
::*National gaps in savings, foreign exchange, taxes, technology and human skills can all be filled by MNCs:
:::*Labour: they can create jobs, develop managerial skills, and provide technical education of labour,
:::*Capital: they can transfer technology and provide much needed physical capital
:::*Tax revenue can be earned on the exports of natural resources which can be used to fund construction of much needed infrastructure
::*Foreign currency flows in from the MNC/TNC investments, and from the private earnings on the exports

===='''Sustainable Economic Development'''====
-----

''The process which maximizes the net benefits of economic development while maintaining the services and quality of environmental and natural resources forever''  
:*This involves:
::*Using natural resources at rates less than or equal to the natural rate of regeneration
::*Using non-renewable resources in a manner which permits recycling of materials and substitutability between natural resources and technological change
	
::*Economic development and resource usage are complementary but after a certain point development will reduce one or more of the functions of certain resources resulting in a tradeoff
::*Using forestry as an example:
:::*The wood can be harvested and sold
:::*Or the trees can be left uncut so the forest can act as a waste assimilation system or a region to absorb rain to prevent flooding
:::*Or the trees can be left and the area used as a park for recreation
	
::*How can we make less use of natural and environmental resources:
:::*Create a low growth, austerity economy?
:::*Develop a high tech economy in which growth is based on very low resource usage and high technological progress?
:::*Use renewable resources on a sustainable basis and recycle non-renewable resources?
	
:*We need to develop environmentally friendly technologies and ensure they are made available to developing countries.  
:*Top priority must be given to:
::*Adequate sewage disposal and safe water
::*The elimination of burning fires for cooking: they cause smoke pollution both within buildings and around urban areas and contribute to deforestation
::*We must remove subsidies that encourage excessive use of forests, fossil fuels, irrigation water, and chemical sprays
::*Clarify rights to own resources
::*Help local communities to take ownership of their common resources:
:::*Local participation in setting and implementing environmental policies
:::*Teach them how to make long term decisions and investments
::*Develop realistic policies and strategies which:
:::*Permit low cost monitoring and enforcement for developing countries
:::*Use market systems of punishments and rewards rather than regulation
:::*Restrict the power of rich resource owners and large institutions

      <text xml:space="preserve">==5.5 Evaluation of Growth and Development Strategies==

===='''Foreign Aid'''====
-----
 
''Problems with Foreign Aid''
:*Aid is a poor substitute for trade: opening up MEDC markets to LEDC exports can enhance the ability of the poor to earn a living and reduce poverty
:*It is estimated that less than half the aid goes to poor countries, instead it is based on the military, political and business interests of the donors, a reward to those in power

:*There has been no significant correlation between the level of aid given to an LEDC and corresponding growth of GDP
::*Though humanitarian/emergency aid is considered morally/ethically necessary and an important contribution at times of short-term suffering
:*The LEDC government may be forced to change development policies to suit the donor's ideas:
::*Loans and grants may be contingent on changes in tax laws, wage and price systems, food subsidy programs, and whether the money is used for rural or urban development
::*These ideas may be out of touch with reality and do little to contribute to development in the country

	
:*Aid contributes in direct proportion to the increase in capital investment, but aid does not appear to have accelerated the growth rates of recipient countries
:*There is a lack of complementary inputs: human technical skills, administrative capacity, infrastructure, financial institutions, and political stability
:*The introduction of hard currency inflows may also lead to increases in consumption rather than just investment:
::*Supply bottlenecks may discourage investment in physical capital
::*Rising incomes for the poor may lead to increased consumption rather than increased saving

	
:*Aid may displace LEDC government spending (crowding out): 
::*There is less pressure to provide infrastructure, and necessary reforms particularly in rural areas
::*Resources are then free for consumption instead of investment and may be used to acquire military hardware


:*It has been persuasively argued that tied aid is not as effective as untied aid:
::*LEDCs are not able to look for the least expensive goods or services but has to purchase from the donor country (more expensive) 
::*Creates no employment or extra output in the LEDC, because no expenditure is taking place there (money is spent on 'foreign experts' and returns to the granting country)
::*Imports may also replace domestic products, which may further harm domestic industries (e.g., agricultural aid increasing supply and lowering prices)
::*May be politically motivated and in fact, no more than a subsidy to industries in the MEDC
::*Tied aid has actually been made illegal in some countries (UK 2002)

	
:*Famine is often not a result of a lack of food but of the inability to earn enough to pay for the food:
::*Distributing cash instead of food can stimulate the local market:
:::*Local traders know best how to transport supplies
:::*They are often able to reach inaccessible places to provide food
:::*Long term food production and employment can increase through investment


:*''Aid weariness'': some in MEDCs are beginning to think that problems in their own economies are more important than problems in LEDCs and flows of aid may be reduced (current recession?)
::*Politically, very popular in light of continuing allegations of corruption and misspent aid money


:*Some evidence that 'targeted' short-term aid can bring about limited growth (at least in a specific sector)
::*Cut flowers in Kenya and Zambia exported to Europe
::*Heifer Project in Rwanda and India
::*HIV/AIDS health education programmes in Botswana and Uganda

===='''Market-led and Interventionist Strategies'''====
-----


===='''The Role of International Financial Institutions'''====
-----
:*International Monetary Fund aims to ensure international financial stability - they provide loans under certain conditions
::*Interventionist nature and seeming violation of state sovereignty an issue with SAP

:*World Bank: aims to promote development to some extent
::*Critics view some World Bank projects as being imposed upon countries, and not being requested locally
::*Large-scale population movements (cultural destruction?) are sometimes required for dam construction (and dams are expensive with an estimated lifespan of about 25 years)
::*Construction firms are often from a country that has lobbied for the World Bank loan, so loan money flows back into an MEDC

:*Private sector banks: provide loans in exchange for interest

:*Non-governmental organizations (NGOs): foreign aid by NGOs

===='''MNC/TNCs: Foreign Direct Investment'''====
-----
 
''MNC/TNCs have grown for the following reasons:''
:*They need to secure their supply lines of raw materials
:*The need to sell to ever larger markets where new products are fully developed and competition increases the price elasticity
:*Locational advantages are important:
::*They need to locate within restrictive trade barriers
::*Low wages, low taxes and high education levels are important
::*They like to locate near markets to reduce transport costs

''Problems with Foreign Direct Investment''
:*There are 35,000 MNCs of which 50% were controlled by US, Japanese, German and Swiss investors
:*50% of all industrial production was produced by 100 companies
:*These 100 companies control 50% of world trade
:*Studies have indicated that MNC/TNCs are not good at providing jobs:
::*Local firms are displaced by the MNC/TNC and the displaced firms often have much higher labour capital ratios
::*LEDC govts may force the MNC/TNCs to operate in a highly capital intense sector of the economy such as natural resource extraction and processing requiring massive investments in sophisticated equipment and machinery:
:::*The labour that is hired is very highly skilled
:::*Either local labour must be given extensive training 
:::*Or skilled workers must be imported
:*Labour protection laws: introduced by the government to appease the labour sector may increase labour costs significantly leading to the substitution of K for L
:*MNC/TNCs may prefer to take advantage of cheaper labour by using more appropriate technology but LEDC governments anxious for technology transfer insist on the latest technology being used, once again this lowers the labour capital ratio
	
:*''Technology/managerial/knowledge transfer'' is severely limited by the country's ability to absorb and utilize the new technology:
::*Workers lack the technical skills
::*The LEDC goveernment's system of information dissemination may be non-existent
::*The MNC/TNC may be extremely reluctant to accommodate technology transfer for fear of losing trade secrets
	
''Transfer pricing:'' the setting of internal prices between branches of an MNC such that goods can be exported at artificially low prices:
:*The MNC/TNC raises price in the next country to the market level and takes the profit there if the taxes are very low, thereby saving on income taxes
:*This reduces the ability of the host govt. to collect taxes and defrauds them of taxes on work done in their own country
:*25% of all trade is between branches of the same MNC company
:*The highest value added work is done in the countries with the lowest taxes
:*It is a powerful tool in labour negotiations to demonstrate that the company is losing money
	
:*Competing LEDC govts may offer concessions on:
::*Reducing taxes while providing subsidies, and tariff or quota protection
::*Allowing monopoly power
::*Reducing environmental regulations
::*However, concessions are often useless: 
:::*Repatriated profits are simply taxed by home governments
:::*Tax relief may lead to confiscation of MNC property if the host government changes in the future 
	
''Foreign enclave:'' the MNC/TNC can increase the  inequality between the rich and the poor by developing a modern high wage sector
:*This sector imports luxury goods
:*Inappropriate goods are marketed in the LEDC
:*It widens the rural-urban wage gap leading to increased migration
:*MNC/TNC supporters may influence the government to undertake projects or adopt policies which are growth rather than development oriented
	
''MNC/TNC Policy''
:*Over time, nations and institutions such as labour unions have developed laws and agreements to control or balance the excess of private companies
:*The problem with MNCs is that there is no global government or global union to oppose or reduce the worst excesses
:*To achieve their ends LEDC governments may:
::*Impose a schedule for local value added to be increased and for greater utilization of local personnel
::*Impose bans on the import of used capital equipment with an insistence that only the latest technology be used
::*Insist on joint ventures with local firms, and ceilings on the repatriation of profits to encourage or force reinvestment of profits in the local economy
::*Insist on market pricing rather than transfer pricing on intra firm transactions
::*Many MNC/TNCs now insist on proper tax payments right from the start:
:::*To provide enough tax revenue for the govt. to build the infrastructure needed to service the MNC/TNC
:::*To prevent resentment and potential nationalization which can lead to risk and uncertainty which threaten the long term viability of a project

===='''International Trade &amp; Economic Development'''====
-----
:*About 70% of trade is between MEDCs, with the remaining 20% from LEDCs and 10% from previously centrally planned economies:
::*This situation has not changed significantly for 40 years
::*It is the NICs and the oil exporters which are experiencing rapid growth, the remaining LEDCs have seen their proportion of trade falling steadily
	
''Benefits from Trade''
:*Comparative advantage: the potential gains from trade resulting from economies of scale and lower consumption prices can be of great potential benefit:
::*Even large LEDCs may have limited domestic markets due to low income
::*Small economies can achieve economies of scale through access to larger markets
::*Growth: technology transfer can occur through the importing of capital goods: this can promote the rapid spread of technology
::*Learn by doing: best practices in production spread rapidly through trade
::*Domestic monopoly power can be reduced through international competition
::*Importance of fostering '''South-South trade'''
	
''Problems with Trade''
:*Foreign enclave: with wealth and income concentrated in the hands of the rich, most imports could be luxury goods
:*Countries are assumed to be on their production possibility frontier when in fact most LEDCs experience high unemployment and underemployment
:*Technology transfer may be pointless if it is labour saving in countries with high unemployment rates.  What is needed is appropriate technology
:*Risk of permanently slower growth: specialization may lock the LDCs into low skilled, labour intense production while MDCs benefit from high tech production
:*Prices may not reflect opportunity cost but simply manipulation by government and firms
:*Taxes, subsidies and the lack of recognition of true social costs (pollution for example) can lead to serious price distortions
:*All countries CANNOT find an industry/natural resource to specialize and enjoy comparative advantage
:*Markets in MEDCs are not open for exports from LEDCs
:*Barriers to trade: LEDCs may find that MEDCs have already achieved economies of scale, and protect their home industries through tariffs and quotas thus effectively blocking imports from LEDCs
:*Many LEDCs have turned to other LEDCs for trade opportunities
:*Displacement of local production: in many LEDCs the production of cheap plastic sandals can put shoe makers out of work, backward linkages to suppliers of leather, fabric, glues, polish and packaging materials lead to even more people being put out of work
:*Gains from trade will benefit foreign owned plants and factories and the profits repatriated to home countries
:*High income elasticity for manufactured goods and services means that imports rise with incomes
:*Price elasticity of demand for capital goods tends to be low because there are few substitutes
:*Devaluation of the currency can actually lead to a larger import bill
	
''Problems with Primary Goods Exports''
:*Low income elasticity of demand for primary goods, the substitution of synthetic materials and the dramatic reduction in the weight and bulk of manufactured goods have all led to virtually no growth in demand
:*World demand: tends to be inelastic: there are no substitutes for primary goods:  
::*World supply: intense competition amongst LDCs lowers price and total revenue
::*Devaluation of the currency can actually lead to lower export revenue
::*In farming: supply shocks due to weather and disease combined with inelastic demand means farm revenues are very unstable
:*Attempts to form cartels have met with opposition from MEDCs:
::*Cartels that do survive are weak due to cheating amongst members
::*Non-member increase supply and reap the benefits of the higher prices
:*Alternatives to cartels are buffer stock management:
::*When demand falls: the manager provides a price floor, buying and storing the excess supply
::*When demand rises: the manager sells from storage and uses the profit to pay back the costs of the buffer stocks
::*The costs of storage and the interest on the loans to carry the inventory are very expensive
:*Supply price elasticity problems: 
::*In mining: shifts in demand for minerals due to MEDC economic cycles combined with inelastic supply means mineral revenues are very unstable
	
:*Trade protection: MEDCs have increased trade protection and subsidies to their own farmers, effectively blocking imports of food goods from LEDCs
:*Worsening terms of trade: prices of primary goods has fallen relative to the price of manufactured goods and services, lowering the gains from trade for the poorest countries which do not have the means to produce anything but raw materials
::*Commodity agreements: agreements between developing countries in an attempt to stabilize prices for certain commodities

      <text xml:space="preserve">==5.1 Sources of Economic Growth and/or Development==
'''Development (Todaro)''': multidimensional process (ideally each outcome will have its own indicator) involving the reorganization and reorientation of entire economic and social systems:
:*Producing more necessities/needs (i.e., food, shelter and health care) and broadening the distribution
:*Increasing standard of living and self-esteem
:*Expanding economic and social choices
:*Reducing fear of the future

'''Development (Rubenstein)''': improvement of material conditions in economic, social and demographic characteristics through diffusion of knowledge and technology

'''Development (Seers)''': concerned with outcomes, as development happens with reduction/elimination of poverty, unemployment and inequality within a growing economy

'''Development (Green)''': dynamic process of increasing choices available to people


'''Increasing Standard of Living''': prosperity of a country/individual (measured by GDP/capita, quality of housing and food, medical care, educational opportunities, transportation, communications, and others); more of an entire country/region relative measurement


'''Increasing Quality of Life''': includes housing, food, education, clothing, transportation, and employment opportunities, environmental and recreational benefits, as well as social infrastructure (e.g., availability of child care, in attracting/retaining businesses in a community); more an individual relative measurement


'''Economic development''': occurs if there is a reduction in poverty, inequality, and unemployment - having more choices for the population is essential - this will include increasing the access to and the means to obtain improved food, shelter, health and protection under law (rule of law)
:*If growth occurs with no improvement in living standard for most of the population, then economic development has not taken place
:**Trickle down theory (market economy): an early theory which assumed that economic growth, leading to greater prosperity, would diffuse from the rich to the poor raising overall living standards
:**Development plan (central planning): must include targets and policies for reducing poverty, inequality and unemployment
	

There are about 144 developing economies (LEDCs) in the world, of which 83 have fewer than 5 million people
:*LEDCs tend to have low standards of living, and low GNP per capita
:**Low income countries receive $700 per capita, middle income countries receive from $700 to $8,000 per capita
:**They tend to have a high population growth rate
:*More than 50% of the population is involved in primary production: 
::*Primary goods are the most prominent exports
::*Mining tends to be dominated by MNCs (multinational corporations)/TNCs (transnational corporations)
::*Infrastructure, often built by colonial powers, is designed to move primary goods to the coast for shipment overseas
:*All sectors are characterised by low productivity and high unemployment: 
::*Capital equipment and technology is likely to have been imported
::*Processing and manufacturing for export is discouraged because MEDCs tend to raise trade barriers against higher value added goods
:*Economic power is unequally distributed both internally and externally
:*Latin American and Asian countries tend to have more private enterprise, African countries tend to have greater state ownership of enterprises


'''Measuring Development'''



'''Measuring Growth'''

''Economic growth is an increase in the real level of national output of a country, as measured by GDP''

:*The share of a sector or component of GDP such as manufacturing or agriculture is measured by the value added contributed by that sector
:*Value added: the addition to value of a product during a stage of production
::*Value added in the cotton textile industry: the value of the textiles when they leave the factory minus the value of raw cotton used in their manufacture
::*This is equal to payments to the factors of production: wages paid to labour plus profits, interest, depreciation of capital, and rents for buildings and land
	
:*If economic growth is 1%, it will take approximately 72 years for the value of the economy to double
:*If the growth rate is 10% it will only take 7.2 years for the economy to double
	
''Growth Theories''
:*The trickle down theory has failed to happen in most LEDCs - while the emphasis on growth has switched more toward development, growth is still of great concern as it is a necessary foundation for economic development (makes development much more likely)
:*Growth occurs:
::*Through increases in the factors natural resources and capital
::*It also occurs by increasing the productivity of existing factors through investment in education (labour) and technology (capital)

''Stages of Growth''
:*Countries appear to go through distinct stages of growth, and are arrayed along the following spectrum:
::*Low income LEDCs (HIPCs=Highly Indebted Poor Countries) are characterized by subsistence agriculture with a manufacturing and service sector producing goods and services using simple technologies to service the rural sector (food processing, textiles), perhaps exporting basic commodities
::*Middle income LEDCs are further up the escalator and are involved in processing raw materials for export and producing basic chemicals, steels, some farm machinery, clothes for export, and perhaps some tourism
::*The NICs, newly industrialized countries are involved in manufacturing clothes, cars, some simple electronics for export
::*MEDCs are heavily involved in manufacturing higher value added products, e.g., luxury cars, sophisticated electronics and simple services such as tourism
::*High income MEDCs are at the top of the escalator such as the US and Switzerland which put greater emphasis on the production of highly sophisticated services such as research, development, design, marketing, financing, computer software, and management consulting
:Transitioning economies (from command to market) have similar characteristics: inflation rate, unemployment rate, difficulty attracting FDI, nonconvertible currency
	
:*The position of each country on the spectrum is determined by the endowment of natural resources, the historical heritage of experience with commerce, finance, and trade, the size of the country which can lead to economies of scale, and the level of investment in human capital both in terms of education and training and in terms of learning by doing


===='''Factors Contributing to Development/Growth'''====
-----
'''Natural factors''': the quantity and/or quality of land or raw materials
:*Many LEDCs have abundant natural resources
::*Agriculture is especially important as an export sector, and is an area for initial mechanisation, productivity gains and growth
::*Agricultural (arable) land is finite and therefore the law of diminishing returns applies as more labour is added to the land - many LEDCs have had problems with severe weather, low agricultural productivity, worsening terms of trade and rising prices for crucial pesticides and fertilisers
::*It is estimated that more than half the renewable natural resources are being utilized in the world - this includes arable land, fisheries, forests, and water
::*There are still significant amounts of non-utilized arable land in some African and Latin American countries


'''Human factors''' (labour): the quantity and/or quality of human resources - relatively high population growth rates in LEDCs reduce growth in per capita GDP


'''Physical capital and technological factors''': the quantity and/or quality of physical capital
:*Investment in machinery and equipment add directly to productivity
:*Investment in infrastructure such as roads, bridges, dams, sanitation and electricity are indirectly productive, but equally as essential
:*The opportunity cost of capital investment is the lower levels of current consumption which result from saving
::*Savings present a great hardship for people who may already be living below the poverty line
:*Technology developed in MEDCs is appropriate for labour scarce, rich countries - because it is labour saving, it is inappropriate in labour abundant countries where it is more efficient to use more labour and less capital
:*Capital intensive development often displaces workers and does little to reduce unemployment
:*Factor rewards go to capitalists or investors from foreign countries - it does little to relieve poverty


'''Institutional Structures''' that contribute to development:
:*Banking system
:*Education system
:*Health care
:*Infrastructure
:*Political stability

:*Key institutions: property ownership or land tenure, domestic markets (free or controlled), labour markets, education, financial sector (savings and investment, capital markets), international trade (import substitution or export oriented), government (structures and experience), and the colonial creation of artificial countries
:*Countries with a history of stable government and a developed commercial sector including merchants, financiers and businesses familiar with international trade tend to have fewer problems with development
:*Countries with governments previously dominated by colonial powers and with commerce controlled by minorities, find it difficult to compete in international trade and finance
	
''Substituting for Missing Institutions''

Is it necessary to substitute for missing institutions in order to enhance the development process in LEDCs?
:*Many countries have managed to develop without the need for accumulated wealth or developed financial sectors (Germany, Russia, Japan)
:*Importing foreign experts with knowledge and experience is not as effective as training and utilizing local talent
:*There is a need to transfer power from old ruling classes with no interest in promoting development for poorer people:
::*Landowners block small farm development to prevent competition, and block growth of industrialists to prevent loss of influence and power
::*Rich industrialists try to block small businesses to prevent competition
::*'Corporate' unions lobby the govt. for high minimum wages and labour protection laws (making it difficult for business to be competitive), in order to stop erosion of artificially high wages
::*Problem: downtrodden peasants of one generation become materialistic consumers of the next generation who prefer imported goods
	
''The Need for Stable Government''
:*Stable government reduces risks for local investors, encourages investment, and reduces capital flight
:*Stable government is more willing to make tough decisions such as devaluation, reducing urban subsidies, reducing overstaffed bureaucracies, reducing tariffs to promote competition and perhaps redistributing income to poorer people
:*Stable government is more able to encourage small scale entrepreneurs to: 
::*Take initiative, develop managerial ability and undertake risks
::*Train to overcome weaknesses in marketing, finance and managerial ability

'''Analysing Economic Growth'''
:*If we call real output Y, and the stock of capital K, then output can be related to the capital stock:Y=K/k, where k=the capital output ratio (the amount of capital required to produce a unit of output), and is simply a measure of the productivity of capital
:*Growth, g, is simply the rate of change in Y and is related to the investment in the capital stock K, where investment measures the rate of change in K
:*If we designate S/Y as the percent saving rate in the nation and call it s, then: g=s/k
:*Capital created by investment is one of the main determinants of growth and it is savings by people and corporations that pays for that investment  

''Planning''
:*Given the formula, planners can decide on the rate of growth, g, and the equation tells them the savings and investment necessary to achieve that growth level  
::*Alternatively, planners can decide on the rate of savings and investment that is feasible, and the equation tells them the rate of growth that can be achieved - often referred to as the savings gap, the ‘s’ tells planners how much they need to borrow internationally after deducting what the nation saves domestically
:*Poor countries with low savings rates and unemployed labour can achieve higher growth rates by economizing on capital and utilizing as much labour as possible  
::*As economies grow and per capita income rises:
:::*Savings rates tend to increase and the labour surplus diminishes  
:::*Savings become relatively more abundant and hence the price of capital falls while employment and wages rise  
::*Producers increasingly economize on labour and use more capital  
::*Technological change and learning by doing can play important roles; both can contribute to increased productivity of all factors of production 

:*Richer nations like the US, Japan and Norway tend to have higher capital output ratios because capital is less expensive relative to labour than in LEDCs  
:*Studies indicate that increases in productivity or efficiency account for a much higher proportion of growth than was believed to be the case  
:*Between 50% and 70% of growth can be attributed to increases in factor productivity, including mobilization and improvement in the quality of labour
:*Increases in the capital stock frequently account for much less than half of the increase in output, particularly in rapidly growing countries; however, capital tends to play a larger role in growth in today's developing countries, and some of the increases in efficiency or productivity involve advances in technology that is embodied in capital equipment


'''Productivity and Growth'''

''Policies to Stimulate Growth''

According to the World Bank, rapid growth in Asia is a ''direct result of policy guidance'' rather than just a free market - these policies include:
:*Making income distribution more equitable: measured by Lorenz Curve and Gini coefficient
:*Encouraging savings and making banks more reliable 
:*Improving primary and secondary education
:*Improving agricultural productivity
:*Facilitating technology transfer and encouraging FDI
:*Streamlining legal and regulatory structures to create a positive business environment
:*Setting industry wide standards and monitoring quality facilitates marketing
:*Targeting key industries for development:
::*Protecting infant industries in the early stages
::*Managing resource allocation
::*Facilitating exports through government-assisted marketing
	
''Low Productivity Leads to Slow Growth''

Diminishing returns is the major cause of low productivity in LEDCs
:*There is a scarcity of capital and trained management, ever increasing supplies of labour combine with relatively fixed supplies of land, capital and management  
:*Also people need to be healthy and educated in order to be productive; some studies have shown that a third of the working population in very poor countries are afflicted with internal parasites which drain energy rapidly
:*Savings are needed for investment in both physical and human capital, but savings requires a higher income, and higher income requires greater productivity - often referred to as the 'poverty trap'
:*Higher productivity does not require high tech solutions: 
::*Billions of dollars in aid for large scale, high tech projects has only increased dependency for the poor rather than increasing productivity
::*What is needed is technology appropriate for the poor which will allow them to help themselves
::*'''Appropriate technology''' uses local materials, and local labour skills, and capital that can easily be repaired locally:
:::*Simple clay stoves, pipe wells, pipe latrines, micro hydro power transformers, better harnesses for oxen, etc
	

'''Growth Through Enhancing Factor Productivity'''

''Natural resources''
:*While there is still land to be developed, the bulk of land available to most populations is limited in size
:*Irrigation, drainage, the use of chemicals for fertilizing, pest and weed control, and the use of machinery can increase productivity dramatically
:*The green revolution is an example of this
::*The problem is that the damage to the soil can be so extensive, that the increase in productivity may only last 70 years before the soil is destroyed
::*Already India is starting to seriously question the use of irrigation, machinery and chemicals as soil degradation is very serious
	
''Labour''
:*If 50% to 70% of economic growth arises from improvements in the productivity of factors, there is a need for better education, greater efficiency in management, and better training in technology
:*LEDCs have made large investments in primary and secondary education
:*Increase in worker skills is essential in order to make use of capital equipment and new technology, and to provide the services needed for growth in the future
	
''Capital''
:*85% of the scientists working in research and development live in the US, Japan, and Germany.  The new ideas and inventions which are applied through the new technology and capital are dominated by MEDC thinking
:*Only modest amounts are invested in research and development in LEDCs

''Growth &amp; Multinational/Transnational Corporations''
:*50 of the top 100 ‘national incomes’ in the world are earned by MNCs/TNCs
:*MNCs/TNCs have no loyalty and are happy to produce and sell anywhere, they are economically powerful and often more influential than the governments they deal with
:*Industrial orientation: 40% of FDI by MNCs/TNCs is for manufacturing, and 60% is for extraction and processing of natural resources:
:*500 MNCs control 80% of the FDI, 40% of them are US based, and 30% are based in the UK, Germany and Japan
:*Most European and US based MNC/TNCs tend to invest in other MEDCs
:*US owned: US MNCs/TNCs still account for 50% of total FDI in LEDCs - much of the FDI from US based MNCs/TNCs is directed toward the oil industry
:*Japanese owned: 60% of Japanese MNCs/TNCs investment has been in LEDCs
:*LEDC owned: MNCs/TNCs which are LEDC based and invest exclusively in other LEDCs have the fastest growth rate
 

'''Growth Through Industrialization'''
:*Manufacturing has been growing faster than GDP in most LEDCs, but can only absorb 30% of the growing workforce
:*In the early stages of development, manufacturing growth often occurs through backward integration from consumer to producer goods
:*Primary sector growth usually occurs through forward linkages rather than backward linkages
:*Cities have grown rapidly because:
::*There are agglomeration economies (face-to-face contact with bankers, government decision makers, lawyers, marketing, and suppliers)
::*There are external economies (railroads, ports, airports, communications utilities, roads, water and sewage)
::*Businesses prefer large cities, infrastructure costs can be 15% higher in smaller cities
	
''Benefits of Industrialization''
:*Industrialization allows economies of scale to be reached in production:
::*Exports: access to larger markets allows minimum efficient scale to be reached more rapidly
::*Research and development: costs are more spread out
::*Heavy industries: economies of scale are important for steels and chemicals
::*Cost savings: size confers concessions and discounts through bulk buying, and lower interest rates when borrowing money
	
:*Industrialization leads to better firm management:
::*In many industries this is more important than economies of scale
::*Firms become more efficient through the introduction of: subcontracting systems, re sequencing of production systems, and just in time delivery; while the product life cycle can confer temporary monopoly profits
::*The introduction of flexible computer integrated manufacturing has made low cost labour less important for assembly operations
	
:*Increased productivity enhances the possibilities for import substitution as well as for export promotion
::*Industrialization can ensure that inputs needed to enhance productivity in the primary sector are available
:*Industrialization can enhance job creation:
::*K/L ratios can be as low as 4 to 1 in textiles in LEDCs which contrasts with 80 to 1 in MEDCs, thus providing 20 times as much employment
	

'''Balanced Industrial Growth'''
:*Balanced growth requires countries to develop a wide range of industries simultaneously to achieve sustained growth: on the demand side to absorb the output, on the supply side to prevent bottlenecks
:*Balanced growth is very important for centrally planned economies, without price adjustment, all sectors must be developed simultaneously:
::*Information about shortages in one sector cannot be transmitted properly as prices are not permitted to rise
::*Even if prices were permitted to rise and rates of return were to rise in those industries in response, there are no entrepreneurs to respond to the profit opportunities by investing to reduce the shortages
:*Unbalanced growth typically occurs for a developing country which cannot start up a wide range of industries simultaneously:
::*Import substitution can be followed as a way to ensure a ready market for the output of a domestic industry
::*Alternatively export promotion can be pursued: access to larger markets, economies of scale are quickly reached, and workers learn by doing

''Backward and Forward Linkages''
:*With unbalanced growth, imports provide what cannot be produced locally
:*Backward linkages can be created as follows:
::*Fabrication: as the imported goods are repaired, domestic industries are set up to supply the parts required rather than importing parts
:*Forward linkages are also created as follows:
::*Adding value: rather than exporting raw materials, processing industries are created to add value to the output, for example iron ore is smelted into steel
::*Once processing is viable, there are opportunities to invest in machinery, metal processing and eventually car part fabrication and assembly plants
:*Both forward and backward linkages set up pressures that lead to the creation of new industries, all operating through the profit driven investment process
:*Governments build the infrastructure necessary to service the expanding industry: roads, railways, harbours, airports, electricity, water and sewage
:*Linkage pressures will eventually lead to balanced growth, provided:
::*Free market pricing is permitted to allow the proper signalling to occur to reflect enhanced profit opportunities
::*A stable banking system is instituted to allow the process of saving and investing to proceed with low risk
::*An entrepreneurial sector is fostered through training to allow individuals to respond to the profit signals by investing in areas of the economy where shortages and profit opportunities are the greatest
::*Super-normal profits can be earned
 

'''Entrepreneurship'''
:*Unemployment is not a result of demand deficient cyclical unemployment:
::*In most LEDCs it is supply bottlenecks that create constraints on employment creation
::*There are insufficient savings and investment to create the expensive workplaces needed to create urban jobs
::*Where there has been technology transfer from MEDCs, investment is labour saving and does not create jobs
::*Capital is often subsidized by a government intent on accelerating growth - firms use the cheap capital as a substitute for labour
::*Wages may be too high due to minimum wage laws or MNCs/TNCs permitting unions to bid up wages and forcing firms to replace labour with capital
	
''Small Scale Industry (small and medium enterprises/SMEs)''
:*There needs to be investment in small scale, labour intense industries in both urban and rural areas to provide alternatives to low paid farm jobs, and the competition for scarce industrial jobs in cities
:*Small scale businesses in both urban and rural areas have certain characteristics
::*People perform all sorts of services and fashion all sorts of products from recycled materials
::*Capital and materials are scarce but human labour is abundant, production is labour intensive
::*Usually employs 5 workers or less, and yet can account for 30% of the work force
::*Are a wonderful way to flush out entrepreneurial talent
	
:*Governments favour large firms through price distortions, output controls, regulations, export licenses, and credit rationing
:*To foster small scale businesses, government needs to:
::*Remove controls and regulations to reduce the bias against small firms
::*Provide a technology extension system to assist in the process of technology transfer to small entrepreneurs

:*Small, modern factories grow out of small scale businesses:
::*They generally employ 50 or less, and yet can account for 50% of the industrial labour force
::*If they stay in the rural economy, they can provide technology transfer
::*However, they are often forced to move to cities to gain: agglomeration and external economies, access to pools of skilled workers, cheap transport and marketing; and access to subcontract work for large firms
 

'''Growth &amp; Financial Institutions'''
:*A good banking system is essential for economic growth:
::*Savers: deposit money in the bank and expect to receive a steady interest rate (e.g., 5%); savers know that there is no risk attached and do not mind earning such a low rate of return  
::*Lenders: banks then take the money and lend it out to entrepreneurs; they charge 10% on the loans for several reasons:  
:::*The bank assesses the investment proposals of various businesses looking for those which are feasible (can be done) and viable (can support themselves and repay the loan), and rates them according to risk and return
:::*Low risk investors pay 10% and higher risk investors pay up to 18%
:::*The rate differential between savers and borrowers covers the paperwork, earns a return on invested capital, and covers the loans which may fail
:::*By diversifying across various sectors in the economy and geographic regions in the country, banks are able to reduce risk
:::*They can also reduce risk through securitization:
::::*Banks grade loans by risk (grade A, B etc.), and group the loans into standard sized packages/tranches, such as $5 million)
::::*The packages of loans are sold to domestic and foreign investors
	
:*Before investing, entrepreneurs analyse the various opportunities available and rank projects according to the expected rates of return
::*They borrow at the bank as long as the project rate of return at least covers the bank charges
::*They can often earn considerably more, but need it to cover the risks of failure which can be very high for certain projects:
:::*Primary sector projects may find no oil or minerals, manufacturing projects may face competition from new products or lower cost imports
:::*The product life cycle may be near exhaustion, or new technology may render a project obsolete
	
:*Entrepreneurs earn more because they are prepared to accept the risk of failure and the consequences of going bankrupt
::*They are willing to take new technology and apply it to a new product, or to invest in innovative locations or new product areas - their reward is a relatively high rate of return

Beef Short Ribs are cheap and can make an excellent winter warmer. I like to braise in the fall and winter as the oven adds heat to the house and the smells when coming in from the cold will blow your socks off.  This recipe is very easy and there are many many variations.

==Ingredients==
* 8 bone in beef short ribs (3.5 - 4 lbs)
* [[Cookbook:Olive Oil|Olive oil]]
* One large onion peeled and sliced (pole to pole)
* 4 celery stalks, sliced
* 4 carrots, peeled and sliced
* 3 cloves garlic, smashed and sliced
* 4 sprigs thyme (or 1 tsp dried)
* 1 can [[Cookbook:Tomato Paste|tomato paste]]
* 1 bottle of dry [[Cookbook:Red Wine|red wine]]
* Salt and pepper

==Procedure==
*Pour yourself a glass of wine.
*Preheat oven to 350&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;F.
*Remove any large fat deposits on the sides of the ribs (your butcher should have done this, but sometimes it needs a more tender hand) and salt and pepper all sides.
*Heat about 2 tbs of olive oil in Dutch oven (enameled cast iron or cast iron) over medium-high heat.
*Add ribs and brown on all sides (about 2-3 minutes per side) (work in batches as not to crowd pan).
*While meat is browning mix tomato paste with enough wine to thin (1/3 bottle)
*Remove meat and set aside.
*Sauté the vegetables until soft (about 5-10 minutes).
*De-glaze pan with wine and scrape up any fond.
*Add in tomato paste mixture.
*Salt and pepper to taste.
*Add ribs (nestle in vegetables).
*Add sprigs of thyme.
*Add remainder of wine to just almost cover the ribs.
*Pour rest of wine in your almost empty glass.
*Cover and braise in oven for 2.5-3 hours (turning ribs once while cooking) until ribs are fork tender and fall off the bone.

Serve ribs with braising liquid and vegetables over mashed potatoes, along side new potatoes, or over egg noodles.

==Variations==
*Separate out ribs and braising liquid, strain out vegetables and thicken braising liquid over medium heat.
*Separate out ribs and braising liquid and blend vegetables and braising liquid in blender or food processor, reduce over medium heat.
*Blend all vegetables prior to sautéing and sauté on high heat until almost burned
*Refrigerate overnight, remove any solidified fat, reheat over medium-low heat until sauce reduced.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Expectations management is an important aspect of network effects. Success or failure in network implementation can affect whether or not the network will achieve a low or high network size equilibrium. Positive feedback has a pushing affect near the critical mass which will determine whether a network will be successful. When expectations of the quantity of people in a network exceed critical mass, the positive feedback effect will make the network stronger. On the other hand, the network will fail when expectations fall short of the critical mass. 

==Expectations management and competition==
First, expectations management can really take two sides. There is the up-side, which is that one's own network would utilize expectations management. The down-side consists of the employment of fear, uncertainty, and doubt [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear,_uncertainty_and_doubt FUD] from rival networks to hinder a competing network from succeeding.

There are some ways to exceed critical mass, it can be:
# Alliances.
# Advertising. 
These can help the quantity of people’s expectations exceeds critical mass, and it have a positive feedbacks to network, it lead network to be successful. 

==Using advertising/vaporware to exceed critical mass==
On a positive side, companies employ expectations management in an effort to help their network succeed. Such tactics include [[Strategy for Information Markets/Glossary#vaporware|vaporware]], heavy advertising, offering subsidies or lower prices to new members (this is used quite often in traditional markets as well). For example, suppose a network recently entered a market with high network externalities as shown in Figure 1a. Initially, expectation of the network will be at Q1 which fails to exceed critical mass. For simplicity, the outer points for both diagrams below have been labeled F (fail) and S (success) instead of the low demand and high demand points. The effects of positive feedback will push the market and/or expectations to point F; therefore, the network will not succeed because the expected size of the network is not appealing enough for others to join. Strategies such as advertising and vaporware cause the expected size of the network to exceed critical mass. These strategies will cause expected quantity (Q1) to leap over critical mass at Q2 as shown in Figure 2a. Now that Q2 exceeds critical mass, positive feedback will make the network more successful as Q2 will reach and stay at point S.

[[File:Graph1.A.jpg|frame|left|295x295px|alt=A]]
[[File:Graph1.B.jpg|frame|center|alt=A]]

===Expectations management and FUD===
In a more malicious tone, expectations can be bitter. Fear, uncertainty and doubt (from here on referred to as FUD) are intentional attempts to discredit a rival company/network. FUD is essentially rhetoric by opposing sides through the placement of disinformation in an attempt to discredit their rival network/firm. Although the statements placed may be entirely false, the typical real world setting of asymmetric information can make this tactic easy to employ. Since consumers do not usually have the extent of information that the rival firms do, a more recognizable (by brand) firm can employ FUD tactics to dispose a new company even though their network/product may be entirely superior and less costly to a consumer.  

Possible tactics of FUD may include the intentional disclosure of overstated sales numbers. For example, Sony may run a commercial advertising a huge sales number for Sony or very small numbers for competing firms (both relative to each other). This tactic would show potential buyers/users that the expected size Sony's network is larger than competing networks; therefore, members of competing networks would have doubt and proceed in switching to Sony. In this case, creating doubt in competitive networks would be considered a successful FUD tactics.

Other options of FUD attacks could include comments regarding the durability of a product or a network's hardware reliability. Using FUD tactics has the opposite effects of advertising and vaporware on the competing network. The misinformation makes it perceivable that the competing network is expected to lose enough members that the current members will leave because a small network does not provide enough benefit to them. The expected quantity of people in the network will leap backwards toward point F. Therefore, positive feedback will prevent the competitor's network size from exceeding critical mass and no one will want to be part of the network. FUD tactics have mostly occurred in the computer and software industries. For instance, Digital Research developed their DR DOS while Microsoft provided MS-DOS5 in their computers. Microsoft soon came out with MS-Windows 3.1 which was not compatible with the DR DOS. Then Microsoft advertized the upcoming release of MS-DOS6 which was expected to be much better than DR DOS. However, Microsoft had looked into MS-DOS6 but did not reach the developing stage. Although this may seem like a vaporware strategy, the negative side of announcing the future release of MS-DOS6 created uncertainty/doubt for Digital Research and its consumers. As a result, Digital Research experienced low demand for their technology. In general, FUD tactics that produce fear occur in political campaigns. An extreme example of FUD in political campaigns is the [http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63h_v6uf0Ao daisy] commercial that was broadcasted on television. 

Finally, with the presence of FUD existent in a market, reaching that [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Demand_Structure_with_Network_Effects critical mass point](see next section) can become an even more challenging task for a network. Employment of FUD may also take out a network that has already passed critical mass. The latter, however, would require more ingenuity on the rivaling firms end however to create enough disinformation regarding the succeeding network.
&lt;ref name=WhatIsFUD&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cavcomp.demon.co.uk/halloween/fuddef.html|title=What is FUD|last1=Irwin|first1=Roger|year=1998|accessdate=2012-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==other section==
There are two main ways for a business to achieve critical mass for the product.

Critical mass:
In a market with network externalities, there may be a critical mass exist. The product will succeed if and only if it can achieve a greater use than the critical mass.

Externality:
If some people do something which harms or benefits someone who isn’t involved in the decision, the effect on the person involuntarily involved is an externality. There are some positive externalities and negative externalities.
 
Positive externalities:
Where someone is involuntarily helped by the decisions others make.

Negative externalities:
Pollution, traffic congestion, etc.
Network externalities:
The benefit that a member of a network receives when someone else joins that network. 
We’ll mostly be concentrating on the benefits part of that, with positive network externalities, but it doesn’t mean the negative network externalities does not exist, it still exist. 

What is network?
# A network may be closed or open.
This is very much like the idea of excludability. 
An open network is one that anyone can connect to. Nobody can deny access.
A closed network is one which has someone who’s the gatekeeper, who can keep people from joining even if the gatekeeper chooses to allow access fairly freely.
# A network may be sponsored or not.
A sponsored network has someone who is in some fashion “in charge” of the network, perhaps promoting or maintaining the network.
Often that means that the sponsor can benefit from the network. 
Frequently, sponsored and closed go together, but it is possible to have a network which is sponsored and open. 
# A network may be one-sided or two-side. 

In a classic market model, we see everything we need to predict quantity demanded.
Without network externalities, we are not sure exactly how or when consumers will purchase the good, but we can be pretty confident about the quantity which will be purchased. 

With network externalities, there are two different strong possibilities. 

a.	If quantity of people’s expectation less than the critical mass, people expect the product won’t be very popular, so the value from network externalities isn’t enough to make it worth the price. 
b.	If quantity of people’s expectation exceeds the critical mass, people expect the product would be popular, so the value from network externalities makes it worth purchasing, it lead business to be success. 
Notice: the critical mass depends on price. If the price is lower, that can compensate for fewer people using the product and make it worthwhile to buy. If the price is higher, it would be different. 

Demand equilibrium:
In a market with network externalities, there is a demand equilibrium if the quantity demanded equals the expected quantity.
1)	Q&lt;Qx (left,bottom)
Fewer people actually want to buy it than are expected to buy it. People will figure this out, and then the expected number of people will drop
When the expected number of people drops, even fewer people want it.
Overall the system moves down and left. 

2)	Q&gt;Qx
More people actually want to buy it than are expected to buy it. People will figure this out, and then the expected number of people will rise. When the expected number of people rises, even more people want it. 
Overall the system moves up and right.

3)	Q&lt;Qx (right,top)
Fewer people want it than are expected.
Again, overall it moves down and left.

      <text xml:space="preserve">When can the structure of the network(s) be completely abstracted, and when is it important to think about who's connected to whom? When analyzing networks we tend to completely abstract them so we can make generalizations of how all networks work.  However, we need to think about what interactions we are not taking into account.  Some important factors are that some connections are stronger than others, some connections are more influential and some can connect more directly. When we abstract a network these factors are left out and these factors could have a major influence on the network and how the network actually works.

===Importance of Networks===

In order to grasp the multiple facets of the structure of networks it is important to understand what a network actually is. The internet is basically a complex network of computers connected together with each other. While the digital information source of the World Wide Web is a complex network, also consider that society as a whole is a network of people connected by friends, family, and professionals alike. An important role to comprehend is that networks play in shaping the behavior of most complex systems including that of the information network. When looked upon in a general point of view, it can be seen that most networks are relatively similar in nature. The ever-growing populace of the social network is really not at all that different from the somewhat newly created internet.

===Information Networks===

While the science of network studies is important to understanding the complexity of operations, the most vital to review is the workings of the information network. Information networks are networks that transmit information in variable human and technical networks to enrich knowledge, business, or social facets of society. In many situations, information technology is used in contrast to biological networks or social networks research. There are multiple varieties of collected networking used to distribute and share information. When taking into account the source of information networks, you usually refer to networking technologies such as wireless communications and the World Wide Web for distributing and sharing this information amongst the public. Basically, information networks are used primarily to exchange information by human institutions such as corporations, educational institutions, research companies, and the human public in general.

=== Virtual and Real Networks ===
Real networks are networks that are tangible structures where there are physical connections bringing together each player within the network. For example, trains are real networks because steel and wood are needed to make the tracks which work as the concrete links between the different areas of the network. Users must physically use these tracks to stay connected within the network.
In contrast, a virtual network is defined by having a structure that is more of a commonality (typically associated with computers). These networks do not need essential hardware that physically makes the path of each connection. For example, the popular website known as Facebook is a virtual network because there is no need for tracks, cords, or cables to be apart of the network.

===Network Structure Variations===

In any organization which focuses on information distribution, they set up their network which will be fully capable of processing, exchanging, and distributing the information required for the tasks at hand. The different types of network forms can be looked upon as network patterns which occur and repeat in multiple settings. There are many different approaches an organization can take when developing the structure of their network. They can aim towards creating a network in which their product will provide better performance in comparison to a competing network. However, a network can also focus more towards compatibility in the hopes that users will rely more on this in comparison to a better performing product without compatibility. An organization that uses the openness strategy is critical when they are not strong enough to dictate technology standards on their own. This is also the case that occurs naturally when multiple products must work together and establish coordination in compatibility. Only organizations with a strong hold upon the market can exercise a strategy of control over their network. In these situations organizations are able to unilaterally control product standards and interfaces. One good example would be that of Microsoft and AT&amp;T in the later years. Organizations must consider who's connected to whom in their networks when they implement network structures such as these.

===Abstract Network Structure===

When considering an abstract network structure, you are dealing with the customers and clients involved within a network and why they are there. These relationships between customers and clients in a certain network could change how the network behaves, which would lead to a bad model. One influencing factor of a network would be that of network effects within a network structure. This relates to the influence of the structure of connection patterns between already existing customers and clients, those of whom are already satisfied. Second, take into account the influence of already existing clients on those who would be potential clients looking to join the network and why. This also relates to analyzing existing customers and the influence they would have on new customers joining the network and why. Depending on the availability of certain data and legal constraints, a network promoter can use some of these variables to identify potential marketing targets in order to influence the adoption process within a network and consider whom will join. This strategy is looking at all of these factors and is not abstracting the network.

In relation to whether or not a network should be abstracted, network effects must be taken into account when considering the number of people desired within the network. A vital part about networks that users mull over is mainly about connecting with other users. Take for example social networking such as Facebook, Myspace, or Twitter. In a study done by the Haas School of Business at the University of California Berkeley, they considered not the “network growth or evolution, but focused on the diffusion process of an existing network.” In the study, they found that as a member in a social network such as these, that being a in a cluster means network friends actually know each other as opposed to having many friends who do not know each other. This is important in the sense that it demonstrates that beyond the overall size of the network, strong network communities are more prevalent to word of mouth influence. Ultimately they found that, “Consequently, if one were trying to maintain his influence in the network, he would also have to maintain the same density of his relationships when the number of contacts grows.”  This example is looking into other factors that would effect the networks behavior and therefore the network is not being abstracted.

A good example when considering whether a network should be abstract or not, is displayed with the workings of cell phone companies and users. Again in this situation, most users wish to be connected with a specific group of other users. In an article on an online website Sonamine, they discuss the terms in which a social network predicts “churn” in mobile telecommunications.  http://www.sonamine.com/home/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=13%3Awhitepaper-1&amp;catid=17%3Awhitepapers-category&amp;Itemid=29

===Two-Sided Platforms===

Once you are able to comprehend the basic aspects of network structures and their abstract forms within an information network, you must realize that networks continue to evolve and branch off into other forms. An information network can be two-sided, in which the economic networks have two distinct user groups that will provide each other with network benefits. Another way of thinking of two-sided platforms are that they &quot;leave control entirely to sellers and simply determine buyer and seller affiliation with a common marketplace&quot;.  A good example of a two-sided network is eBay. In this online article, Hagiu goes into more detailed examples of two-sided platforms. http://www.hbs.edu/research/pdf/07-093.pdf. There can also be one-sided or three-sided networks.  A one-sided network only connects one type of user.  For example Pokemon cards are a one-sided network because they either connect producers or players.  An example of a three-sided network is YouTube which contains viewers, video uploaders and advertisers.  In this example, viewers benefit from more videos, and video uploaders and advertisers benefit from more viewers.

===Analyzing Networks===

Networks can be analyzed in two different ways, the socioeconomic perspective and the complex network perspective.  The complex network perspective looks at larger-scale networks. According to one source, &quot;these models supplement classical economic models to identify the systematic implications of certain network-formation rules on the emerging link structure and of that link structure as a constraint on the options for agents.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Economic Networks: What do we know and what do we need to know?&quot;&gt;[http://www.sg.ethz.ch/publications/preprint-final.pdf],&lt;/ref&gt; This perspective is creating a new model, which takes the link structure into account instead of abstracting the network structure. The socioeconomic perspective acts in a similar away, however it &quot;emphasizes understanding of how the strategic behavior of the interacting agents is influenced by -and reciprocally shape- relatively simple changes in network architectures.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Economic Networks: What do we know and what do we need to know?&quot; /&gt; In order to analyze networks using these perspectives game theory must be used to study how these links are strategically made and the decision behind making certain links. &lt;ref name=&quot;Economic Networks: What do we know and what do we need to know?&quot; /&gt; 


Analyzing different network structures is important in understanding economic activity; &quot;the study of how network structure influences (and is influenced by) economic activity is becoming increasingly important because it is clear that many classical models that abstract away from patterns of interaction leave certain phenomena unexplained.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Research Opportunities in the Study of Social and Economic Networks&quot;&gt;[http://www.stanford.edu/~jacksonm/networkwhitepaper.pdf],&lt;/ref&gt;.  With many networks in today's society especially social networks the connections should be taken into consideration.  For example, &quot;the fact that information about jobs is largely disseminated through social networks has significant implications for patterns of wages, unemployment and education.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Research Opportunities in the Study of Social and Economic Networks&quot; /&gt; This example demonstrates the importance of knowing who is connected to whom in networks. If networks are abstracted we will be losing valuable information.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Markets with network externalities have positive feedback. On the positive side, this means that as more people join a network, everyone will find that network more attractive, and so yet more people will want to join. This is often called a [[w:Bandwagon effect|Bandwagon effect]].

Similar-appearing effects can arise from (at least) two different sources. These two experiments are intended to highlight that a market which appears to have network effects might be demonstrating an entirely different phenomenon.

Given some care, both experiments can be conducted with ordinary playing cards. If more than one deck of cards is required for the network externalities experiment, the class is probably too large to conduct these experiments within a reasonable time.

== Herding game ==

The instructor will be walking around the class from student to student, so one student will be needed as an assistant to keep track of the students' actions on the board. If money or extra credit is being awarded for game play, the assistant should receive a full share.

* The instructor should create two &quot;sets&quot; of cards. One set contains two red cards and one black card, and is called the '''Red''' set. The other set contains two black cards and one red card, and is called the '''Black''' set.
* If working with cards all from the same deck, then the students ''should not'' be shown the cards as public knowledge, since seeing a specific card (say, the three of clubs) could give away which set is which.
* I recommend the instructor have their assistant randomly select one of the two sets, so that nobody (students, instructor, or assistant) knows which set is in use. This &quot;double-blind&quot; control will help prevent the instructor from giving away the correct answer.
* The assistant stays at the board to keep track of students' actions. The instructor goes from student to student.
** The instructor offers the three cards face-down as a fan to the student, who draws one of the cards. The student should look at the card, being careful that they are the only one who can see the card. The instructor should also not see the card.
** The student should not say anything to reveal the card they see. Instead, the student then publicly announces a guess about whether they are looking at the '''Red''' set or the '''Black''' set. The assistant records their guess on the board.
** The instructor moves on to the next student.
* After all the students have made a guess, the instructor publicly reveals the three cards.

== Network effects game ==

For this game, an assistant is not strictly needed, since the instructor will not need to be moving around the room. However, it is important to have an even number of students in the experiment. The assistant may be retained to help if doing so will mean an even number of students remains, or may return to take part in this second experiment.

For this game, if there are ''2 n'' students, the instructor should shuffle ''n'' red cards and ''n'' black cards into a deck.

* The instructor hands out the cards, one to each student. The students ''must not reveal'' their cards to anyone else.
* The instructor calls on the students one at a time.
** The student decides to choose (not guess, but choose) either '''Red''' or '''Black'''.
** The student's payoff is ''(2 if they choose the same color as is on their card)'' plus ''(1 per other student who chooses the same color)''. The student should not reveal their card or find out their payoff until the end of the experiment.
** The instructor or assistant records the student's choice on the board.
** The instructor calls on the next student.
* After all the students have made their choices, count the number of '''Red''' and '''Black''' choices. If there are 14 students who chose '''Black''', then each student who chose '''Black''' should receive 13 extra points.
* Ask each student to reveal the card they hold to decide if they receive 2 points from individual taste.

== Network Effects Pertaining to Both Experiments ==
In reference to the &quot;Herding Game&quot;, there are no real network effects working with the decision made by the student to whether they will choose a black set or red set. Instead, it is purely random in the sense that the majority of people will choose the first color set that they choose in the hopes that there is a similar color in that set of three cards. The results of each persons decision results in inefficiency because of &quot;bad&quot; guesses, which clarifies the earlier remark of there being no network externalities at work here.
However, in the second experiment, we are able to see different results in the fact that there are strong positive network effects at work. It becomes the case that as students begin choosing which color card they might have, that it doesnt really matter as long as they choose the color which everyone else is choosing in order to receive the maximum amount of points. The experiment creates a bandwagon effect in which the player cannot really lose as long as they go along with the crowd. Players tend to avoid becoming an outcast and feel comfortable making the same decision as everyone else. Through this we are able to see the strong effects that occur with &quot;positive&quot; network effects in relation to a product or market.

      <comment>Replacing Blender_selecting_the_edges_of_your_eye.gif with [[File:Blender_selecting_the_edges_of_your_eye.png]] (by [[commons:User:GifTagger|GifTagger]] because: Replacing GIF by exact PNG duplicate.).</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Preparing your Window ==
Before we start, split the window into two halfs by right clicking the top panel, and selecting split area.
[[File:Blender_Split_Area.png|thumb|centre]]
And then change the right one to 'UV/Image editor' as below.
[[File:Blender_UV_image_example.png|thumb|centre]]

== Texturing using UV unwrapping ==
UV unwrapping is, as the name suggests, taking the model and selecting the edges which would allow you to unwrap it. When this has been done, you can apply a texture to it. The best model for this to be demonstrated on is the eyes, as only one cut is needed to split it up.
Select each of the edges on the outside of the eye, from the side to the top relative to the front of the body (the easiest way to do this would be to maneuver the camera to the side, push b to allow you to create a box, then selectall of those edges in the middle),
[[File:Blender_selecting_the_edges_of_your_eye.png|thumb|centre]]
then ensuring that only the middle lines are selected, push space, and select 'Edit/Edges/Mark seam'. Next, select all of the model, and push 'U', and select unwrap. You should see an unwrapped wire frame of the right side of the interface, which will provide the basis for your texture.
Save this wireframe by selecting, on the bottom of the right window (under the newly unwrapped UV image) and select 'UVs/Scripts/Save UV Face layout'. This will save your wire as a PNG file, which can be opened and edited in windows paint (at least Vista onwards). Using this image as a basis, clear the wireframe, and draw an eye on the top half (you can find which of the wire effects what part of the model by selecting parts of the model and seeing what is highlighted on the UV image).
[[File:Fish Eyes wire.gif|thumb|centre]][[File:Fish Eyes drawn.gif|thumb|centre]]
Apply the newly drawn image to the model by selecting on the UV window 'Image/Open...' and selecting it. You can see the effect of this by selecting the textured draw type on the left window as below.
[[File:Blender_textured_eye.png|thumb|centre]]

== Texturing using UV 'Project From View' ==
An easier way to do this, although allowing for less flexibility in your texturing, is by using project from view. To demonstrate this, maneuver the camera so that it is to the side of your main fish body in edit mode, select all of the vertices, and push U. This time select 'Project from view'.
[[File:Blender_Unwrap_from_view_demonstration.png|thumb|centre]]
With this, save the map as before, and fill it with the pattern of your choice.
[[File:Fish body Map.gif|thumb|centre]]
Apply this, the same way as previously. What you should notice if you rotate your model now that the pattern is mirrored on the other side. This can make it unsuitable for more complex models, but for whats basically a sphere it is the quickest way to get a good result.

Next, do the same thing for the fins, applying a solid colour texture to them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

In statistics an optimization problem is used to maximize or minimize a function, and its variables in a specific space. As these optimization problems may assume many different types, each one with its own characteristics, many techniques have been developed to solve some of these.

One of these techniques is the Maximum Likelihood and its main goal is to adjust a statistic model with specific data set, estimating its unknown parameters so the function can describe all the parameters in the dataset. In other words, the method will adjust some variables of a statistical model from a dataset or a known distribution, so the model can “describe” each data sample and estimate others. This technique is very important in data mining and knowledge discovery area as it can be used as basis for more complex and powerful methods.

The Expectation-Maximization method is one of the methods developed from Maximum Likelihood, trying to estimate the likelihood in problems which some variables are unobserved. This method was first documented in 1977 by &lt;ref name=&quot;dempster1977&quot;/&gt;, although the technique was informally proposed in literature, as suggested by the author. So, this work was its first formalization in the literature.

The function can be calculated approximating the parameters in a iterative process, which steps called Expectation (E-step) and Maximization (M-step) are executed to find the unobserved variables and re-estimate the parameters for the maximum likehood, respectively. The next section will describe the method with more details, presenting an algorithm with all steps of the calculation of the function.

==A Brief Overview==

The expectation-maximization algorithm described in &lt;ref name = &quot;georey1996&quot;/&gt; is an unsupervised clustering method which doesn’t require a training step based on a density mixture. It uses a sub-optimal iterative approach to find the probability distribution parameters to the attributes with maximum likelihood.

The algorithm’s input are the data set (x), the total number of clusters (M), the tolerance threshold (E) and the maximum number of iterations. For each iteration, the E-step (expectation) e executed at first to estimate each class probability, followed by the M-step (maximization) to estimate the parameters array for the probability distribution of each class for the next iteration. The method will end when the distribution parameters falls into the tolerance threshold or the maximum number of iterations is reached.

===Initialization=== 

Each cluster j of M contains a parameters array(tetha), which has a mean (uu) and a covariance matrix (Sigmaj),  in order to represent the Gaussian probability distribution details. This distribution is used to bound the elements of dataset x.

&lt;math&gt; \theta\ (t) = \{ \mu_{j},\sum_{j} (t) \}  j = 1..M  &lt;/math&gt;

In the first iteration, the method generates random initial values to mean and covariance, in order to approximate the parameters array (tetha) to its real distribution.

===E-Step===

The main goal of the E-step is to estimate the probability of each element belong the each class (P (Cj|xk)).

&lt;math&gt; P(C_{j}|x) = \frac{\left | \sum_{j}(t)\right \vert ^{-\frac{1}{2}} * exp^{n_{j}*P_{j}(t)}}{\sum_{k=1}^M \left | \sum_{j}(t)\right \vert ^{-\frac{1}{2}} * exp^{\sigma_{k}*P_{k}(t)} } &lt;/math&gt;

==Algorithm in R==

===Packages===

The expectation-maximization in algorithm in R &lt;ref name = &quot;chambers&quot;/&gt;, proposed in &lt;ref name = &quot;fraley2007&quot;/&gt;, will use the package mclust. This package contains crucial methods for the execution of the clustering algorithm, including functions for the E-step and M-step calculation. The package manual explains all of its functions, including simple examples. This manual cam be found in &lt;ref name = &quot;fraley2006&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;fraley2007&quot;/&gt;.

===Executing the Algoritm===

The function “em” can be used for the expectation-maximization method, as it implements the method for parameterized Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), starting in the E-step. This function uses the following parameters:

* '''model-name:''' the name of the model used;
* '''data:''' all the collected data, which must be all numerical. If the data format is represent by a matrix, the rows will represent the samples (observations) and the columns the variables;
* '''parameters:''' model parameters, which can assume the following values: pro, mean, variance and Vinv, corresponding to the mixture proportion for the components of mixture, mean of each component, parameters variance and the estimate hypervolume of the data region, respectively.
* '''others:''' less relevant parameters which wont be described here. More details can be found in the package manual.

After the execution, the function will return:

* '''model-name:''' the name of the model;
* '''z:''' a matrix whose the element in position [I,k] presents the conditional probability of the ith sample belongs to the kth mixture component;
* '''parameters:''' same as the input;
* '''others:''' other metrics which wont be discussed here.  More details can be found in the package manual.

===A simple example===

In order to demonstrate how to use the R to execute the expectation-Maximization method, the following algorithm presents a simple example for a test dataset. This example can also be found in the package manual.

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; modelName = ``EEE''
&gt; data = iris[,-5]
&gt; z = unmap(iris[,5])
&gt; msEst &lt;- mstep(modelName, data, z)
&gt; names(msEst)
&gt; modelName = msEst$modelName
&gt; parameters = msEst$parameters
&gt; em(modelName, data, parameters)
&lt;/pre&gt;

The first line executes the M-step so the parameters used in the em function can be generated. This function is called mstep and its inputs are model name, as “EEE”, the dataset, as flower study dataset and finally, the z matrix, which contains the conditional probability of each class contains each data sample. This z matrix is generated by the unmap function.

After the M-step, the algorithm will show (line 2) the attributes of the object returned by this function. The third line will start the clustering process using some of the result of the M-step method as input.

The clustering method will return the parameters estimated in the process and the conditional probability of each sample falls in each class. These parameters include mean and variance, and this last one corresponds to the use of the mclustVariance method.

===Visualization===

After the execution of the clustering algorithm, a chart can be plotted with the results. In R, this visualization can be done by using the coorProj function. The following algorithm shows how to use it: 

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; data = iris[,5]
&gt; dimens = c(2,4)
&gt; what = &quot;errors&quot;
&gt; parameters = msEst$parameters
&gt; truth = iris[,5]
&gt; coordProj( data, dimens, what, parameters, z, truth) 
&lt;/pre&gt;

This book is an independent project based on '''Designing Sound''' by Andy Farnell, all about the principles and techniques needed to design sound effects for real-time synthesis. The original book provides examples in the [http://puredata.info PureData] language - here we have re-created some of the examples using [http://supercollider.sourceforge.net/ SuperCollider].

The original book includes '''much more''' than what you see here - we're only recreating the examples and not the text! So in a sense this is ''not a stand-alone book'' and you'll get the most out of it if you have the original book with you. But we hope the examples are illustrative in themselves.

Any defects in the code we present should be assumed to be our own mistakes, and no reflection on Andy's fine book!

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Fig 14.28: recirculating schroeder reverb==

First start the server, if you haven't already:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
s.boot;
&lt;/source&gt;

Then so we have some source material, we'll load the standard sound file that comes bundled with SC:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
b = Buffer.read(s, &quot;sounds/a11wlk01-44_1.aiff&quot;);
// Hear it raw:
b.play
&lt;/source&gt;

Now here's the code which creates the reverb in a single Synth, with four separate delay lines cross-fertilising each other:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
(
Ndef(\verb, {	
	var input, output, delrd, sig, deltimes;
	
	// Choose which sort of input you want by (un)commenting these lines:
	input = Pan2.ar(PlayBuf.ar(1, b, loop: 0), -0.5); // buffer playback, panned halfway left
	//input = SoundIn.ar([0,1]); // TAKE CARE of feedback - use headphones
	//input = Dust2.ar([0.1, 0.01]); // Occasional clicks
	
	// Read our 4-channel delayed signals back from the feedback loop
	delrd = LocalIn.ar(4);
	
	// This will be our eventual output, which will also be recirculated
	output = input + delrd[[0,1]];
	
	// Cross-fertilise the four delay lines with each other:
	sig = [output[0]+output[1], output[0]-output[1], delrd[2]+delrd[3], delrd[2]-delrd[3]];
	sig = [sig[0]+sig[2], sig[1]+sig[3], sig[0]-sig[2], sig[1]-sig[3]];
	// Attenutate the delayed signals so they decay:
	sig = sig * [0.4, 0.37, 0.333, 0.3];
	
	// Here we give delay times in milliseconds, convert to seconds,
	// then compensate with ControlDur for the one-block delay 
	// which is always introduced when using the LocalIn/Out fdbk loop
	deltimes = [101, 143, 165, 177] * 0.001 - ControlDur.ir;
	
	// Apply the delays and send the signals into the feedback loop
	LocalOut.ar(DelayC.ar(sig, deltimes, deltimes));
	
	// Now let's hear it:
	Out.ar(0, output);
	
}).play
)
&lt;/source&gt;

And here's an alternative way of doing exactly the same thing, this time using a matrix to represent the cross-mixing of the delayed streams. The single matrix replaces all those plusses and minusses so it's a neat way to represent the mixing - see which you find most readable.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
(
Ndef(\verb, {	
	var input, output, delrd, sig, deltimes;
	
	// Choose which sort of input you want by (un)commenting these lines:
	input = Pan2.ar(PlayBuf.ar(1, b, loop: 0), -0.5); // buffer playback, panned halfway left
	//input = SoundIn.ar([0,1]); // TAKE CARE of feedback - use headphones
	//input = Dust2.ar([0.1, 0.01]); // Occasional clicks
	
	// Read our 4-channel delayed signals back from the feedback loop
	delrd = LocalIn.ar(4);
	
	// This will be our eventual output, which will also be recirculated
	output = input + delrd[[0,1]];
	
	sig = output ++ delrd[[2,3]];
	// Cross-fertilise the four delay lines with each other:
	sig = ([ [1,  1,  1,  1],
	         [1, -1,  1, -1],
	         [1,  1, -1, -1],
	         [1, -1, -1,  1]] * sig).sum;
	// Attenutate the delayed signals so they decay:
	sig = sig * [0.4, 0.37, 0.333, 0.3];
	
	// Here we give delay times in milliseconds, convert to seconds,
	// then compensate with ControlDur for the one-block delay 
	// which is always introduced when using the LocalIn/Out fdbk loop
	deltimes = [101, 143, 165, 177] * 0.001 - ControlDur.ir;
	
	// Apply the delays and send the signals into the feedback loop
	LocalOut.ar(DelayC.ar(sig, deltimes, deltimes));
	
	// Now let's hear it:
	Out.ar(0, output);
	
}).play
)

// To stop it:
Ndef(\verb).free;
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Fig 17.4: Additive synthesis==

Additive synthesis using eqn 17.2, taken from Moorer.

First start the server, if you haven't already - this time making sure it's the server which lets use the oscilloscopes:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
Server.default = s = GUI.stethoscope.defaultServer;
s.boot;
&lt;/source&gt;

In the following we use &quot;.sin&quot; and &quot;.cos&quot; as mathematical operations, so we can stick closely to the original design - these are '''much''' less efficient than using SC's SinOsc oscillator, which is what most people would use for additive synthesis in SuperCollider.

In the original diagram, freq starts as 122, index as 0.42. Here we connect these parameters to the mouse - left/right for freq, up/down for harmonic decay.

The amplitude will vary with the decay coefficient, so practically, you'd want some kind of normalisation.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
(
x = {	
	
	var freq = MouseX.kr(100, 1000, 1) / SampleRate.ir;
	var distance = 3.00;
	var index = MouseY.kr(0.42, 0.99);
	var theta, beta, num, denom, son;
	
	// Two phasors which will ramp from zero to 2pi
	theta = Phasor.ar(0, freq, 0, 2pi);
	beta  = Phasor.ar(0, freq * distance, 0, 2pi);
	
	num = sin(theta) - (index * sin(theta - beta));
	denom = 1 + index.squared - (2 * index * cos(beta));
	
	son = num / denom;
	
	Out.ar(0, Pan2.ar(son * 0.3));
	
}.freqscope;  // Use &quot;.freqscope&quot; or &quot;.scope&quot;, both are illustrative.
)
&lt;/source&gt;

The LFPulse here is used to provide a sharp-edged on/off for the sound. (LFPulse outputs a low of zero and a high of one, which is handy in this case so we don't need to re-scale it before we can use it as the multiplier.)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Fig 27.2: Alarm with two alternating tones==
Note that we have separated this into multiple lines for clarity. '''''Exercise:''''' rewrite it as a single line - and use array expansion rather than writing &quot;SinOsc&quot; twice.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
(
Ndef(\alarm, {
	var tone1 = SinOsc.ar(600);
	var tone2 = SinOsc.ar(800);
	// We switch between the tones using LFPulse, but soften the crossfade with the low-pass:
	var control = LPF.kr(LFPulse.kr(2), 70);
	var out = SelectX.ar(control, [tone1, tone2]);
	Pan2.ar(out * 0.1)
}).play
)
&lt;/source&gt;

==Fig 27.3: Alarm with three alternating tones==
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
(
Ndef(\alarm, {
	var tone1 = SinOsc.ar(723);
	var tone2 = SinOsc.ar(932);
	var tone3 = SinOsc.ar(1012);
	// Stepper is perfect for stepping through the options:
	var control = LPF.kr(Stepper.kr(Impulse.kr(2), 0, 0, 2), 70);
	var out = SelectX.ar(control, [tone1, tone2, tone3]);
	Pan2.ar(out * 0.1)
}).play
)
&lt;/source&gt;

Or we can write exactly the same thing a bit more generically using Demand units. The frequencies are simply given as an Array - change the values, or add new ones to the end:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
(
Ndef(\alarm, {
	var freq, out;
	freq = Duty.kr(0.5, 0, Dseq([723, 932, 1012], inf));
	freq = LPF.kr(freq, 70);
	out = SinOsc.ar(freq);
	Pan2.ar(out * 0.1)
}).play
)
&lt;/source&gt;

==Fig 27.4: A choice of timbral settings==
This using .cos and .sin to perform waveshaping - move the mouse left and right to choose from our 4 timbral options.
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
(
Ndef(\alarm, {
	var freq, out, operations;
	freq = Duty.kr(0.05, 0, Dseq([723, 932, 1012], inf));
	freq = LPF.kr(freq, 70);
	out = SinOsc.ar(freq);
	operations = [out, (out * pi).sin, (out * pi).cos, ((out+0.25) * pi).cos];
	out = Select.ar(MouseX.kr(0,4).poll, operations);
	Pan2.ar(out * 0.1)
}).play
)
&lt;/source&gt;

'''''Exercise:''''' alter the &quot;Duty&quot; line so that you can have different durations for each of the notes.(Hint: you can use Dseq to specify times just as easily as to specify frequencies.)


==Fig 27.7: A multi-ringer==
This SynthDef is capable of a wide variety of sequences, as you'll see below:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
(
SynthDef(\dsaf_multialarm, {
	|length=0.05, freqs=#[600,800,600,800], timbre=1, repeats=inf|
	var freq, out, operations;
	freq = Duty.ar(length, 0, Dseq(freqs, repeats), doneAction: 2);
	freq = LPF.ar(freq, 70);
	out = LeakDC.ar(SinOsc.ar(freq));
	out = Select.ar(timbre, [out, (out * pi).sin, (out * pi).cos, ((out+0.25) * pi).cos]);
	// NOTE: when writing a synthdef always remember the Out ugen!
	// (Handy shortcuts like Ndef and {}.play often add Out on your behalf)
	Out.ar(0, Pan2.ar(out * 0.1))
}).store;
)
&lt;/source&gt;

...and now we can play it, using the sequences used in the book:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
// happy blips
Synth(\dsaf_multialarm, [\length, 0.1, \freqs, [349, 0, 349, 0], \timbre, 1, \repeats, 1]);
// affirmative
Synth(\dsaf_multialarm, [\length, 0.1, \freqs, [238, 0, 317, 0], \timbre, 2, \repeats, 1]);
// activate
Synth(\dsaf_multialarm, [\length, 0.02, \freqs, [300, 125, 0, 0], \timbre, 2, \repeats, 10]);
// invaders?
Synth(\dsaf_multialarm, [\length, 0.03, \freqs, [360, 238, 174, 158], \timbre, 1]);
// information
Synth(\dsaf_multialarm, [\length, 0.05, \freqs, [2000, 2010, 2000, 2010], \timbre, 1, \repeats, 6]);
// message alert
Synth(\dsaf_multialarm, [\length, 0.15, \freqs, [619, 571, 365, 206], \timbre, 1, \repeats, 2]);
// finished
Synth(\dsaf_multialarm, [\length, 0.15, \freqs, [365, 571, 619, 206], \timbre, 3, \repeats, 1]);
// error code
Synth(\dsaf_multialarm, [\length, 0.01, \freqs, [1000, 0, 1000, 0], \timbre, 3, \repeats, 30]);
// wronnnnnnnnnng
(
Pbind(
	\instrument, \dsaf_multialarm,
	\freqs, [[1000, 476, 159, 0]],
	\timbre, 2,
	\repeats, 25,
	\length, Pseq([0.003, 0.005]),
	\dur, 0.5
).play
)
&lt;/source&gt;

'''''Exercise:''''' work out why some of these multialarm examples don't quite sound like Andy's audio examples! ;)

We'll use the internal server to make sure we can use the oscilloscope etc.:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
Server.default = s = Server.internal;
s.boot;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Fig 28.6: imitation of capacitor charge/discharge==
In SuperCollider we can provide an almost-direct physical model: the LFPulse represents a &quot;raw&quot; on/off signal before smoothing by capacitors, and the &quot;lagud&quot; provides exponential smoothing, with the handy feature of allowing different time-periods for the &quot;on&quot; and &quot;off&quot; convergence. This one-line example will plot the curve for you:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
{LFPulse.ar(1, 0.99, 0.4).lagud(0.3, 0.7)}.plot(2)
&lt;/source&gt;

==The siren==

Now let's use this technique both for the pitch curve, and for waveform synthesis.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
(
SynthDef(\dsaf_horn1, { |rate=0.1|
	var freq = LFPulse.kr(rate, 0.99, 0.4).lagud(0.4 / rate, 0.6 / rate) * 800 + 300;
	var son  = LFPulse.ar(freq, 0.99, 0.2).lagud(0.4 / freq, 0.6 / freq) * 2 - 1;
	
	// This filtering is a simple approximation of the plastic horn acoustics:
	son = BPF.ar(son.clip2(0.2), 1500, 1/4) * 4;
	
	// delay and reverb, to simulate the environment in which we hear the siren
	son = son + DelayC.ar(son, 0.1, 0.1, 0.3);
	son = son + FreeVerb.ar(son);
	
	Out.ar(0, Pan2.ar(son * 0.4));
}).add;
)

x = Synth(\dsaf_horn1);

s.scope

// Choose a rate
x.set(\rate, 3);
x.set(\rate, 0.1);
&lt;/source&gt;

'''''Exercise:''''' instead of using the lagged-pulse implementation of the waveform, do as the book says and try using a simple triangle oscillator (LFTri) - this loses the physical-modelling &quot;realism&quot; of the authentic circuit but will be more efficient, and reasonably similar. How much of an effect on the tone quality do you get?

      <text xml:space="preserve">==29 Old-style telephone bell==
In the book, one partial of the resonance is modelled using a sinewave, modulated by an envelope that dies away on a quadratic-shaped curve. Groups of three such oscillators are then made.

Here we take advantage of a built-in unit in SuperCollider which does quite a lot of the work for us: Klank. A difference: it gives exponential rather than quadratic decay - which is not too bad since exponential decay is often what you want.

==Fig 29.11: a simple metallic resonance with three pitches==
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
(
{
	var son;
	son = Klank.ar(`[
		[521, 732, 934],  // freqs
		[0.7, 0.45, 0.25],// amps
		[0.8, 0.8, 0.8]   // ring times
		]
	, Impulse.ar(1));
	Out.ar(0, Pan2.ar(son * 0.2));
}.play
)
&lt;/source&gt;

==Fig 29.12: a striker sound==
As described in the book, a brief click is all we need to approximate this part of the sound.
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
(
x = {
	var son = WhiteNoise.ar(XLine.ar(1, 0.000001, 0.01, doneAction: 2)) * 0.1;
	Out.ar(0, Pan2.ar(son));
}.play
)
&lt;/source&gt;

==Fig 29.13: many resonators to create the various modes of the bell==
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
(
SynthDef(\dsaf_phonebell1, { |freq=465, strength=1, decay=3|
	var son;
	son = Klank.ar(`[
		// frequency ratios
		[0.501, 1, 0.7,   2.002, 3, 9.6,   2.49, 11, 2.571,  3.05, 6.242, 12.49, 13, 16, 24],
		// amps
		[0.002,0.02,0.001, 0.008,0.02,0.004, 0.02,0.04,0.02, 0.005,0.05,0.05, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04],
		// ring times - &quot;stutter&quot; duplicates each entry threefold
		[1.2, 0.9, 0.25, 0.14, 0.07].stutter(3)
		]
	, Impulse.ar(1), freq, 0, decay);
	Out.ar(0, Pan2.ar(son));
}).store
)
x = Synth(\dsaf_phonebell1, [\freq, 500]);
&lt;/source&gt;

Note: '''leave the bell playing''' while you add the following effect:

==Fig 29.14: resonant effects of bakelite phone casing==
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
(
SynthDef(\dsaf_phonecase1, { |in=0, out=0, mix=0|
	var casein = In.ar(in, 2);
		
	var delayA = CombC.ar(casein, 0.00077, 0.00077, 0.1);
	var delayB = CombC.ar(delayA, 0.00088, 0.00088, 0.1);
	var bands = BPF.ar(delayB, [1243, 287, 431], 1/12).sum;
	var son = bands.clip2(0.3);
	
	ReplaceOut.ar(out, XFade2.ar(casein, son, mix))

}).store
)
y = Synth(\dsaf_phonecase1, target: x, addAction: \addAfter);
&lt;/source&gt;

If you have sc3.3 or later, you can visualise a frequency representation of the filter's effect:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
GUI.stethoscope.defaultServer.boot;
(
// Notice that for this shortcut visualisation, we define the filter as a function taking its 
//  input as an argument, and returning its output (we don't use In.ar or Out.ar)
{ |casein|
	var delayA = CombC.ar(casein, 0.00077, 0.00077, 0.1);
	var delayB = CombC.ar(delayA, 0.00088, 0.00088, 0.1);
	var bands = BPF.ar(delayB, [1243, 287, 431], 1/12).sum;
	var son = bands.clip2(0.3);
	
	// Mouse to the LEFT means flat filter (no change), to the RIGHT means full bakelite
	XFade2.ar(casein, son, MouseX.kr(-1,1));
	
}.scopeResponse
)
&lt;/source&gt;

==Fig 29.14: putting it all together==
We will re-use the SynthDef from fig 29.14, so make sure you have run that so that the server has that SynthDef. (But stop the sound, if it is still running.)

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
// A tweaked version of the phonebell synthdef, to take an on/off from outside, and incorporate the striker
(
SynthDef(\dsaf_phonebell2, { |gate=1, freq=465, strength=1, decay=3, amp=1|
	var trigs, striker, son;
	trigs = Impulse.ar(14) * gate;
	striker = WhiteNoise.ar(EnvGen.ar(Env.perc(0.0000001, 0.01), trigs));
	son = Klank.ar(`[
		// frequency ratios
		[0.501, 1, 0.7,   2.002, 3, 9.6,   2.49, 11, 2.571,  3.05, 6.242, 12.49, 13, 16, 24],

		// ring times - &quot;stutter&quot; duplicates each entry threefold
		[1.2, 0.9, 0.25, 0.14, 0.07].stutter(3)
		]
	, striker, freq, 0, decay);
	Out.ar(0, Pan2.ar(son * amp));
}).store
)

// We could launch the patch all at once, but let's do it bit-by-bit so we understand what's going on

// Here we start the phone bells constantly ringing. We put them in a group for convenience
~bellgroup = Group.new(s);
~bell1 = Synth(\dsaf_phonebell2, [\freq, 650], ~bellgroup);
~bell2 = Synth(\dsaf_phonebell2, [\freq, 653], ~bellgroup);

// Now we add the bakelite
y = Synth(\dsaf_phonecase1, [\mix, -0.65], target: ~bellgroup, addAction: \addAfter);

// OK, shush for now
~bellgroup.set(\gate, 0);

// Now let's turn them on and off in a telephone-like pattern.
// This could be done using a synth, but let's use a (client-side) pattern:
p = Pbind(\type, \set, \id, ~bellgroup.nodeID, \args, [\gate], \gate, Pseq([1,0], inf), \dur, 2).play
p.stop

The four clear resonances are identified using a spectrogram of a can.

	// This line just creates a sharp little spike whenever we want:
	var strike = EnvGen.ar(Env.perc(0.0001, 0.001, 0.1), t_trig);
	// here's the resonances:
	var son = Ringz.ar(strike, [359, 426, 1748, 3150], 0.2).sum;
	// some distortion livens up the spectrum a little:

	son * 0.2
}.play;

&lt;/source&gt;


==Fig 31.6: a repeating roll pattern==
This simulates the regular turning of the drinks can. Since it's a control signal we'll plot it rather than play, for now.
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;

~regularroll = { |rate = 1|
	// In the original code, Andy uses a master phase control, 
	// wrapping and re-scaling it before differentiating, to produce
	// a repeating but disorderly set of impulses.
	// Here we do it differently - we use Impulse.kr to generate the 
	// impulses directly.
	// We evaluate this function multiple times using .dup so that 
	// we get a whole set of impulses with random phase positions.
	{
		Impulse.kr(rate, 1.0.rand, 1.0.bilinrand)

(You must have run figs 31.6 and 31.7 to get their functions defined.)

The sound of a can rolling a little and coming to a stop.

		K2A.ar(~regularroll.(rate) * 0.1)
			;
	// Force the strikes to die off in intensity:
	strike = strike * XLine.ar(1, 0.0001, 8);
	// And here are the tin-can resonances as in fig 31.3:

	son = HPF.ar(son.clip2(0.6), 300);

==Motion of the twanged ruler==

Here we use Env to create an asymmetric waveshape - when the value is below zero, the ruler is touching the table and so is practically &quot;shorter&quot;. Therefore it has a higher frequency (shorter wavelength) in the lower cycle than in the upper cycle.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
~rulerwave = Env([1, 0, -0.7, 0, 1], [0.3, 0.1, 0.1, 0.3], [4, -4, 4, -4]).asSignal(512).asWavetable;
~rulerwave.plot;
// Here let's plot it running at a frequency that speeds up.
// This approximates the actual trajectory of motion of the end of the ruler:
{Osc.kr(~rulerwave.as(LocalBuf), XLine.kr(50, 100, 1), mul: XLine.kr(1, 0.001, 1))}.plot(1)

// Now, every time the wave passes zero in a downwards-going direction, that represents the ruler thwacking on the table and therefore transmitting energy into the resonances.
// This code builds on the previous one to derive the thwacks - one at each downward zero crossing, with an energy proportional to the speed (==derivative of position, found using Slope)
(
{
	var motion, thwacks, isDown;
	motion = Osc.ar(~rulerwave.as(LocalBuf), XLine.kr(50, 100, 1), mul: XLine.kr(1, 0.001, 1));
	isDown = motion &lt; 0;
	thwacks = Trig1.ar(isDown, 0) * (0-Slope.ar(motion)) * 0.01;
	thwacks = LPF.ar(thwacks, 500);
	[motion, isDown, thwacks]
}.plot(1)
)
&lt;/source&gt;


==Let's hear it==
OK, so now we need to make sound from this data. The base frequency for the resonator is higher if isDown==true, since the effective length is shorter. So we need to modulate the base frequency at the same time as pushing the thwacks through the resonators.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
(
{
	var motion, thwacks, isDown, basefreq;
	motion = Osc.ar(~rulerwave.as(LocalBuf), XLine.kr(10, 100, 1), mul: Line.kr(1, 0.001, 1, doneAction: 2));
	isDown = motion &lt; 0;
	thwacks = Trig1.ar(isDown, 0) * (0-Slope.ar(motion)) * 0.01;
	thwacks = LPF.ar(thwacks, 500);
	
	basefreq = if(isDown, 289, 111);
	~freemodes.value(thwacks, basefreq, 100)
		+
	~clampedmodes.value(basefreq, thwacks);
}.play
)


// That was a model of a ruler-on-a-desk. The next one is... something else.

(
{
	var motion, thwacks, isDown, basefreq;
	motion = Osc.ar(~rulerwave.as(LocalBuf), 80, mul: Line.kr(1, 0.001, 1, doneAction: 2));
	isDown = motion &lt; 0;
	thwacks = Trig1.ar(isDown, 0) * (0-Slope.ar(motion)) * 0.01;

	~freemodes.value(thwacks, basefreq, 100)
		+
	~clampedmodes.value(basefreq, thwacks);

[[File:Supply-and-demand-9-28-08.ogg]]
----
''A place or situation where buyers and sellers communicate with exchange in mind''
PRICES are important as a signal and as an incentive in terms of resource allocation in a correctly-functioning market economy
:*A market is a meeting of buyers and sellers who do not have to physically meet
*Markets cannot exist unless both buyer and sellers are involved

*Markets include those for wheat, fruit, stocks and bonds and foreign exchange:
:*Wheat produced in one place can be sold anywhere in the world
:*Between the London stock exchange, the New York stock exchange and the Tokyo exchange, it is now possible to trade certain stocks 24 hours a day - markets are not limited to certain intervals of time
:*Foreign exchange markets are located in the international telephone networks and computer hookups
*In some rural markets, fruits, vegetables and fish may be quite expensive in the morning but be marked down drastically toward the end of the day, particularly if there is no refrigerated storage available

*Non market sectors include non-governmental organizations (NGOs) such as charities/volunteer organizations which raise money from the public to pay for goods and services 
*The bulk of non market production is accounted for by government and NGOs: 
:*Money is provided by tax revenue and donations, and the non market goods and services are distributed to households and firms


'''Different types of industries'''

:*''Perfect Competition'': industry structure in which there are many firms, none large enough to influence the industry, producing homogeneous products = price takers
::*No/few barriers to entry or barriers to exit 
::*Everyone - both buyers and sellers - have perfect information about the product
::*Examples include the agricultural market and stock market


:*''Monopolistic Competition'': industry structure in which there are many firms, producing slightly differentiated products
::*There are close substitutes for the product of any given firm - competitors have slight control over price
::*There are relatively insignificant barriers to entry or exit and success invites new competitors into the industry 
::*Examples include home builders and restaurants


:*''Oligopoly'': industry structure in which there are a few firms producing products that range from slightly differentiated to highly differentiated
::*Each firm is large enough to influence this industry
::*Barriers to entry and exit are difficult, but exist
::*Examples include aircraft manufacturers, tire manufacturers, camera/electronics manufacturers, car manufacturers, supermarkets


:*''Monopoly'': industry structure where a single firm produces a product for which there are no close substitutes
::*Monopolists can set price = price makers - but are constrained by market discipline
::*Barriers to entry and exit exist and in order to ensure profits, a monopoly will attempt to maintain them
::*Examples include Microsoft's (former? current?) virtual monopoly over the global PC operating system market and historical examples of AT&amp;T and Standard Oil (US) 
::*Antitrust legislation used to break up monopolies who abuse monopoly power via price gouging and lack of responding to consumer concerns

====Demand====
-----
''Quantity of a commodity that consumers are willing and able to purchase at a given period of time at a given price - what consumers are willing and able to buy at a price affects the demand for that good''
:*Effective demand is a ''want backed by money and the willingness to pay''
[[Image:Supply-and-demand.svg‎|300px|right]]
:* Function of demand: Qn= f [Pn, Y, (P1....Pn-1), T]
'''Law of demand''' states that as a price of good or service rises, the quantity demanded will fall; concurrently, if the price of a good or service falls, the quantity demanded will increase
:*The law of demand states that a higher quantity will be demanded at a lower price assuming other factors such as the price of substitutes are unchanged
:*Quantity demanded refers to a continuous flow of purchases per period of time
:*A single point on the demand curve reflects the quantity demanded at that price
:*The demand curve shows the quantity of a good that consumers want at each price, assuming they have the effective purchasing power (income) to pay

:*Price and quantity demanded are negatively related:
::*Demand is downward sloping: each increment in consumption leads to less and less satisfaction, and the consumer will buy more only for a lower price
::*As price rises, the quantity demanded of the good or service tends to fall
::*It becomes an increasingly expensive way to satisfy the need or want associated with the good or service
::*People switch in part to some other goods or services to satisfy the same need, and less will be purchased of the good that has gone up in price
::*As the price of the good falls, it becomes relatively cheaper and more of it will be purchased and less of substitute goods

:*'''Fundamental distinction between a movement along the demand curve and a shift of the demand curve'''
:*Price of a good: A change in the price of a good causes a movement along the demand curve
:*Movements along the demand curve (''own price effect'') lead to changes in quantity demanded
::* A movement along the demand curve is caused by a change in price; however, a shift of the demand curve means that more is demanded at each price - this is caused by a change in any of the determinants of demand (with the exception of price)
::* The demand curve is downsloping for several reasons, including the ''law of diminishing marginal utility'' - extra utility gained from the consumption of a good falls 
::*Therefore, the price must be lower for a person to purchase extra units of a given good
:::*The income effect states that as prices fall, real income increases
:::*Consumers can therefore afford to consume a greater quantity, providing a second reasons for the downsloping curve
:::*A third reason is the ''substitution effect,'' whereby the falling price of a good makes that good cheaper in relation to other goods (substitutes)

'''Determinants of demand/Shifts in the demand curve''' 
:*Income, tastes/preferences, price of other/related goods, advertising
:*The demand curve will shift out if more is demanded at each price and is caused by changes in factors other than the price of the good itself:
::*'''Substitutes''': Goods that can be used in place of one another/different goods that satisfy the same needs 
:::*If the price of a substitute rises, demand for the good will increase 
:::*If the price of coffee falls, many people will shift from drinking tea to drinking coffee and the demand curve for tea shifts in to the left
::*'''Complements''': These are goods which tend to be used jointly
:::*If the price of a complement rises, demand will decrease.
:::*If the price of gasoline rises people are motivated to use their car less, and the demand for cars shifts to the left
[[Image:Giffenen.svg‎|290px|right]]
::*'''Real income''': when income rises, more people can afford to buy cars and the demand curve for cars shifts to the right for ''normal goods'' and a decrease in demand for ''inferior goods''
::*'''Population''': if the population grows/changes composition (old/young) there are more consumers and demand will shift out to the right
::*'''Tastes and preferences''': more people may want the product or service (a product becomes 'fashionable') and demand shifts out
::*'''Advertising''': the more effective the advertising the greater the demand, unless the government uses negative advertising for things such as the dangers to health from cigarette smoking
::*Other macro factors: 
:::*'''Legislation'''
:::*'''Access to credit''': more credit means it is easier to borrow for durable goods like cars and demand shifts right

'''Exceptions to the law of Demand (HL)''' (''role of expectations'')
:*'''Veblen (ostentatious) goods''': named after the economist Veblen and link with his theory of conspicuous consumption
::*If price for a status good rises, then demand for that good also rises 
::*People want to be seen buying more expensive goods – goods with ‘snob’ appeal
::*If the price rises, people will buy more because they are more expensive

:*'''Giffen goods''': goods which are absolutely vital for a person
::*All Giffen goods are inferior goods: as income rises, less is purchased
::*The income effect is more powerful than the substitution effect, and less is bought as the price falls; the demand curve is positively sloped
::*This usually refers to staple crops such as rice in some parts of China and potatoes during the Irish potato famine
::*As price for the good increases, individuals will be able to buy little of anything else and instead spend their income purchasing staple crops
::*During the Irish famine, families spent 80% of their income on potatoes - as potato prices fell, real income rose and money was spent on milk and meat instead; quantity demanded for potatoes fell as prices fell
::*Perhaps rice in some areas today could be considered a Giffen good; other than that, you'll never find one!

:*'''Speculative goods''': As share prices increases, so does the quantity demanded of shares, as individuals predict further price increases

====Supply====
----
''Willingness and ability for producers to produce a good at a given price over a given period of time''
[[Image:Supply-demand-right-shift-supply.png‎|300px|right]]

'''Law of supply''': a higher quantity of a good will be supplied at a higher price 
:*Producers can afford to supply extra units at a higher price because it allows them to produce more before AC is greater than MC


'''Movements along the supply curve (change in P)'''
:*The supply curve shows the quantity producers are willing to supply at each price
:*'''Law of Supply''' states that higher quantities will be supplied at higher prices,all other things unchanged:
::*This leads to a movement along the supply curve
::*As the extra cost of producing a unit increases, producers need a higher price to produce the product
:*A movement along the supply curve is a change in quantity supplied resulting from a change in the good price
:*All other determinants of supply will change the supply and so will shift the entire supply curve
:*Quantity supplied is a flow of goods or services per unit of time

'''Shift of the supply curve'''
:*Changes in supply refer to shifts of the whole supply curve

'''Factors (determinants) causing shifts in the supply curve''':
:*Increase in number of producers in an industry (new firms entering a market): leads to an increase in supply
:*Prices of factors of production:
::*If there are increases, less is supplied at each price (less profit is being made), and the supply curve shifts left
::*If factor prices fall, the supply curve shifts right
:*Technological changes: always lead to a rightward shift in supply
:*Weather: improvements can increase the supply of agricultural products
:*Taxes and subsidies (government intervention): increases in taxes lead to a fall in supply, increases in subsidies leads to an increase in supply
:*Changes in the prices of other (jointly produced) goods:
::*Sometimes goods are produced jointly such as wool and lamb’s meat: if the price of wool falls dramatically and farmers switch to producing something else, the price of lamb's meat rises dramatically
::*Alternatively, if you could produce two goods from the same factory and the demand for one rises dramatically:
:::*Production will switch to that good and it's supply will shift out (rightward)
:::*Production of the second good will fall and it's supply will shift in (leftward)

'''Effect of taxes and subsidies''': 
:*An increase in corporate taxes increases input costs for the supplier. Less is produced at each price – the supply curve shifts leftwards
:*A subsidy, or corporate tax credit, reduces input costs for the supplier. More is produced at each price level.  The supply curve shifts rightwards.

====Interaction of Supply and Demand====
----
''Example'': When a good is placed on a market, it suddenly does not begin to sell at its equilibrium price. What follows is a game of trial and error. Say a new pair of jeans comes out on the market at CHF20.00 and it instantly becomes a success selling out everywhere. Producers decide to produce more and charge it at CHF30.00. Now they are not selling enough and have a surplus of stock. They reduce the price to CHF25 and they sell as much as they make. 

''YOU must be able to make a diagrammatic analysis of changes in demand and supply to show adjustment of a new equilibrium''

[[Image:Sup_and_dmd1.jpg|300px|right]]

'''Market Equilibrium'''
*Occurs when quantity demanded equals quantity supplied
*Market clearing price, where supply equals demand
*Only at a price of $8,000 (in diagram at right) does quantity demanded equal quantity supplied

''Price below equilibrium (shortage)'': households will desire more but firms will not be prepared to offer as much leading to excess demand
*Inventories will be falling, and sellers can charge a higher price
*The price will edge back up to $8,000 (equilibrium) where the quantity supplied and demanded will be equal to each other again

''Price above equilibrium (surplus)'': people will want fewer cars while firms will be only too happy to supply more leading to excess supply:
*Inventories will be rising and firms will lower prices to clear the carlots
*Households will be happy to buy cars at lower prices

''No equilibrium'': where supply is everywhere above demand, nothing will be produced because the higher price consumers are prepared to pay is less than the minimum price producers need to supply (e.g., spaceships)


''Goods or services with no price'':    [[Image:Quota_diagram.jpg|280px|right]]
*In most countries, roads are available free of charge and people will use them out to the point where demand intersects the horizontal axis leading to excess demand
*Rationing does not take place: there is overcrowding (tragedy of the commons)
*In some countries medicine is free and again there is excess demand which is likely to get worse as populations age
*Rationing takes place through queuing (typically the government issues coupons to stop hoarding)


'''Four Laws of Demand &amp; Supply''':

1. A rise in demand: excess demand, inventories fall, price and quantity increase:
:*The rise in price acts as a rationing device to lower demand but encourages existing firms to produce more and for other firms to join the industry, thus moving resources into the industry to respond to the increase in demand

2. A fall in demand: excess supply, inventories rise, price and quantity decrease

3. A rise in supply: excess supply, inventories rise, price falls and quantity rises

4. A fall in supply: excess demand, inventories fall, price rises and quantity falls

====Price Controls====
-----
[[Image:Priceceilingandblackmarket.jpg|300px|right]]

*'''Maximum Price/price ceiling''': a maximum price that sellers may charge for a good or service - usually set by the government 
:*To be effective, the maximum price (or price ceiling) must be set BELOW the market clearing price
:*E.g., rent control and concert tickets may have maximum prices
::*If price is held below equilibrium, there will be excess demand, shortages, and parallel or black markets often spring up
::*Black marketers buy at the low price and resell to the highest bidder ($100 in diagram at right)
::*The profit is represented by the difference between the two prices ($100 - $50) times the quantity they buy and resell
::*''Black markets'': can exist because purchasers who have the money are willing to pay more than the ceiling price for the limited amounts of the good available
::*In most economies black markets are illegal, and buyers have to wait for hours to get into stores, only to find that supplies are exhausted before they can be served (a particular problem in centrally planned economies, where the government has a high degree of involvement in the economy)
::*Governments can ration the commodity by issuing only enough ration coupons to match the available supply and then distribute the coupons to purchasers who must present both the money and the coupons in order to get the goods (many economies have done this is times of war/natural disaster)
:::*Rationing is often considered fairer than the black market
::*''Grey markets'': where a product is bought and sold outside of the manufacturer's authorized trading channels
:::*Applies to price ceilings, as e.g., renters may pay the ceiling price (lower than market value) for rent, but then have to pay much higher prices for furniture for the apartment, totalling market value for the apartment, and thereby skirting the around the price control  


*'''Minimum Price/price floor''' a minimum price that sellers may charge for a good or service - usually set by the government
:*To be effective, it must be set ABOVE the market clearing price
::*If price is held above equilibrium, there will be excess supply
::*Either inventories build up or the govt. purchases the surplus and stores it or sells it cheap on the international market
::*Minimum wage: the excess supply results in people not being able to find work, and the government supports the surplus by providing welfare support
:::*Those who do find jobs are better off because their wages are higher than they would normally have been in a free market
::*Farmers who sell their crops at floor prices are better off, but the government traditionally purchases the surplus and stores it; if the crops are later sold at a loss, it is taxpayers that pay the costs


*'''Buffer stock scheme''': government tries to regulate the price level of a good or service by buying the good up when demand is too low or selling off any surplus when demand is too high (in a free market, commodities tend to fluctuate in price)
:* Buffer stock schemes tend to be very expensive, as there are storage costs, the goods in question might be perishable, and there is an opportunity cost made by the government in implementing them
:*Other options: pay not to plant (leave fields fallow)


*'''Commodity agreements''': agreements between countries to attempt to stabilise commodity prices
:*This may be done by a buffer stock scheme or placing a tariff on foreign goods
:*OPEC is a good example of such an agreement


*'''Quantity controls: Quotas'''
:*Government cannot force the quota to be above the equilibrium quantity, people cannot be forced to consume what they do not want
:*Thus quotas usually restrict the quantity below what would have been the case with a free market


*'''Subsidies'''
:*Payments by the government to a producer to lower costs of production - these lowered costs can be passed along to consumers


'''Why do governments intervene in agricultural markets?'''
:*There has been a downward trend in agricultural markets: thanks to more efficient technology, there has been an increase in supply, resulting in lower prices (as demand has increased only slightly). Moreover, the income elasticity of demand for food is inelastic. Someone does not buy more apples because he has more money. 
:*Agricultural prices are subject to fluctuations because of harvests, time lags in supply, and the price elasticity of demand is very low (many substitutes available; e.g., if the price of beef goes up, individuals will switch to chicken)
:*Governments may wish to subsidize to prevent cheap imports from abroad in an effort to protect domestic jobs
:*National security concerns and ability of a country to feed itself
:*Preserve a traditional 'way of life'
:*Governments may wish to intervene by using buffer stocks, subsidies, high fixed prices, or some combination of all of these

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
{WhiteNoise.ar(LFNoise2.kr(1))}.play
&lt;/source&gt;

==Fig 34.4: square it==
Squaring the noise gives it a more useful dynamic range, with rare loud bursts

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
{WhiteNoise.ar(LFNoise2.kr(1).squared)}.play
&lt;/source&gt;

==Fig 34.5: more==
Add another .squared for even stronger effect on the dynamics, and use a high-pass filter to make the hiss more hissy

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
{HPF.ar(WhiteNoise.ar, 1000) * LFNoise2.kr(1).squared.squared}.play
&lt;/source&gt;

==Fig 34.6: a simple single crackle==
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
{WhiteNoise.ar * Line.ar(1, 0, 0.02, doneAction: 2)}.play
&lt;/source&gt;

==Fig 34.7: many crackles==
If we use a proper envelope generator instead of a simple line, we can retrigger it randomly with Dust to give random crackles of a controllable density

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
{WhiteNoise.ar * EnvGen.ar(Env.perc(0, 0.02, curve: 0), Dust.kr(1))}.play
&lt;/source&gt;

==Fig 34.8: more variation==
Add more variation by modulating the duration and the filter frequency for each event

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
(
{
	var trigs, durscale, son, resfreq;
	trigs = Dust.kr(1);
	durscale = TRand.kr(1, 1.5, trigs); // vary duration between default 20ms and 30ms
	resfreq = TExpRand.kr(100, 1000, trigs); // different resonant frequency for each one
	son = WhiteNoise.ar * EnvGen.ar(Env.perc(0, 0.02, curve: 0), trigs, timeScale: durscale);
	son = son + BPF.ar(son, resfreq, 20);
}.play
)
&lt;/source&gt;

==Fig 34.9: woof==
Simple attempt at the low &quot;woofing&quot; noise made by the flames themselves

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
{LPF.ar(WhiteNoise.ar, 30) * 100}.play
&lt;/source&gt;

==Fig 34.10: woosh==
// another component we could use to build up a flamey sound
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
{BPF.ar(WhiteNoise.ar, 30, 0.2) * 20}.play
&lt;/source&gt;

==Fig 34.11: shape==
Shaping the dynamic range and discarding some of the lower frequencies, allowing a little clipping to give a less static sound.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
{LeakDC.ar(LeakDC.ar(BPF.ar(WhiteNoise.ar, 30, 0.2) * 50).clip2(0.9)) * 0.5}.play
&lt;/source&gt;

==Fig 34.12: putting it all together==
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
(
~firegen = {
	var trigs, durscale, resfreq;
	var noise, hissing, crackles, lapping;
	// A common noise source
	noise = WhiteNoise.ar;
	// Hissing
	hissing = HPF.ar(noise, 1000) * LFNoise2.kr(1).squared.squared;
	// Crackle
	trigs = Dust.kr(1);
	durscale = TRand.kr(1, 1.5, trigs); // vary duration between default 20ms and 30ms
	resfreq = TExpRand.kr(100, 1000, trigs); // different resonant frequency for each one
	crackles = noise * EnvGen.ar(Env.perc(0, 0.02, curve: 0), trigs, timeScale: durscale);
	crackles = crackles + BPF.ar(crackles, resfreq, 20);
	// Flame
	lapping = LeakDC.ar(LeakDC.ar(BPF.ar(noise, 30, 0.2) * 50).clip2(0.9)) * 0.5;
	// Combine them:
	([crackles, hissing, lapping] * [0.1, 0.3, 0.6]).sum * 3
};
~firegen.play
)
&lt;/source&gt;

==Fig 34.13: poly==
Let's have four of the above, each filtered differently, for a composite effect

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Fig 35.5: producing a repeating but random-seeming pattern of triggers==
First we'll create a reusable synthdef that outputs triggers (but not sound):

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
(
SynthDef(\bubbletrigs, {|out=0, probability=0.5|
	var trigs, buf, a;
	// These two lines create a loop of zeroes 
	// with some ones (i.e. triggers) placed at prime-number locations
	a = {0}.dup(200);
	[29, 37, 47, 67, 89, 113, 157, 197].do{|val| a[val] = 1};
	buf = a.as(LocalBuf);
	// playbuf by default will use the server's rate, but we want one item every 15ms
	trigs = PlayBuf.kr(1, buf, 0.015.reciprocal / (s.sampleRate / s.options.blockSize), loop: 1);
	// Randomly discard half of them, to remove too much obvious looping
	trigs = CoinGate.kr(probability, trigs);
	// Let's poll to watch the events appearing
	trigs.poll(trigs);
	Out.kr(out, trigs);
}).store
)

// Then we'll play it:
x = Synth(\bubbletrigs); // watch the post window to see the bubble events happening (no sound yet!)
x.free;
&lt;/source&gt;


==Fig 35.8: sound of a bubble==
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
(
SynthDef(\bubblebub, {	|out=0, t_trig=0, attack=0.01, decay=0.08, pitchcurvelen=0.1, freq=1000, doneAction=0, amp=0.1|
	var pitch, son;
	amp   = amp * EnvGen.ar(Env.perc(attack, decay).delay(0.003), t_trig, doneAction: doneAction);
	pitch = freq * EnvGen.ar(Env.new([0,0,1],[0,1]).exprange(1, 2.718), t_trig, timeScale: pitchcurvelen);
	son = SinOsc.ar(pitch);
	// high-pass to remove any lowpitched artifacts, scale amplitude
	son = HPF.ar(son, 500) * amp * 10;
	Out.ar(out, son);
}).store
)

x = Synth(\bubblebub);
x.set(\t_trig, 1); // run this line multiple times, to get multiple (very similar) bubbles!
x.free;
&lt;/source&gt;



==Fig 35.9: four bubble systems, simply triggered at random.==
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
(
s.bind{	
	// Here we'll create busses to hold the triggers, passing them from synth to synth
	~maintrigbus = Bus.control(s, 1);
	~bubtrigbus = Bus.control(s, 4);
	// Note how we make sure things are running in the desired order, using \addAfter
	~trigs = Synth(\bubbletrigs, [\out: ~maintrigbus]);
	// This reads the main trig and puts each trig on a randomly-chosen bus
	~randomdistrib = {
		var trig, which;
		trig = In.kr(~maintrigbus);
		which = TIRand.kr(0,3, trig);
		// or try the Stepper instead of TIRand for &quot;round-robin&quot; selection:
		// which = Stepper.kr(trig, 0, 0, 3);
		which = which.poll(trig);
		Out.kr(~bubtrigbus.index + which, trig);
	}.play(target: ~trigs, addAction: \addAfter);
	
	s.sync;
	
	~bubs = [2400, 2600, 2500, 2700].collect{|afreq|
		Synth(\bubblebub, [\freq, afreq], target: ~randomdistrib, addAction: \addAfter);
	};
	
	s.sync;
	
	// &quot;map&quot; allows us to push the triggers from the control bus to the &quot;t_trig&quot; inputs:
	~bubs.do{|bub, bubindex| bub.map(\t_trig, ~bubtrigbus.index + bubindex) };
};
)
&lt;/source&gt;

Note, instead of using the &quot;bubbletrigs&quot; synth (which is a direct port of the pd example) we could use Patterns to trigger bubble synths. This is a different model for resource management: instead of having four always-running synths which re-trigger to create a new bubble, we create one synth whenever we need a bubble, and it frees itself after.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
(
p = Pbind(
	\instrument, \bubblebub,
	// The commented version is a bit like the above timings...
	// \dur, Pseq([29, 37, 47, 67, 89, 113, 157, 197, 200].differentiate * 0.015, inf),
	// ...but happily we have useful random-distrib generators. Ppoisson would be ideal but is misbehaving for me!
	\dur, Pgauss(0.3, 0.2),
	\freq, Pwhite(0,1,inf).linexp(0,1, 1000, 3000),
	// doneAction of two allows the synths to free themselves. See  &quot;UGen-doneActions&quot;.openHelpFile
	\doneAction, 2
).play
)
p.stop
&lt;/source&gt;

This next one's a bit more complex - we do as the book does and make smaller bubbles have (a) higher pitch (b) lower volume (c) shorter duration. To connect these values together we define a &quot;sizefactor&quot; and use Pkey to reuse it in each of the args.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
(
p = Pbind(
	\instrument, \bubblebub,
	\sizefactor, Pwhite(0,1,inf),
	\dur, Pgauss(0.3, 0.2),
	\freq,  Pkey(\sizefactor).linexp(0, 1, 1000, 3000),
	\amp ,  Pkey(\sizefactor).linlin(0, 1, 0.15, 0.04), 
	\decay, Pkey(\sizefactor).linlin(0, 1, 0.05, 0.08), 
	\doneAction, 2
).play
)
p.stop
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Fig 36.3: random-frequency sines==
Not a physically realistic model, but notice how it has some of the same aural qualities:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
x = {SinOsc.ar(LFNoise0.kr(170).range(800, 2400), 0, 0.3)}.play;
x.free;
&lt;/source&gt;


==Fig 36.4: rising pitches==

Tweak the above so that the sounds drift in pitch, tending to rise:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
(
x = {
	var trigs, freq;
	trigs = Dust.kr(170);
	freq = 
		// Generally choose from a varied base freq
		TExpRand.kr(800, 2000, trigs)
		// Wobbly variation

// hmmm, let's try combining a few of these in parallel.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Fig 38.1: Fluid sphere impact==
The waveform produced by impact of fluid sphere on hard surface - we'll create it as a Function here so we can reuse it:
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
~dropletonhard = {|dur=0.0005| Env.perc(dur/2, dur/2, 1, [-4, 4])};
~dropletonhard.value.plot
&lt;/source&gt;

==Fig 38.3: obtaining a Gaussian noise distribution.==
The Central Limit Theorem tells us that adding together independent noise sources will eventually give us gaussian noise. Twelve is certainly enough for auditory purposes.

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
x = { {WhiteNoise.ar}.dup(12).mean.dup * 0.5}.play;
x.free;
&lt;/source&gt;

In the book, Andy says that it is more efficient to use two white noise sources and to create a gaussian shape using the Box-Muller transform. However, this involves some relatively heavy mathematical operations (log, cos, sqrt) so it's not actually obvious which approach is more efficient on a given system. Compare the CPU usage (and the audio result) of the above, with the following:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
(
x = {
	var amount=MouseX.kr(0,1); // move mouse left/right to change amount
	var n1 = WhiteNoise.ar.abs * amount + (1-amount);
	var n2 = WhiteNoise.ar(2pi);
	var gaussian = sqrt(-2 * log(n1)) * cos(n2);
	gaussian.dup * 0.5
}.play;
)
x.free;
&lt;/source&gt;


==Fig 38.4: raindrop pressure on solid ground==
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
(
x = {
	var gaus, osc;
	gaus = {WhiteNoise.ar}.dup(12).sum;
	gaus = LPF.ar(BPF.ar(gaus, 50, 1/0.4), 500);
	
	// 
	osc = SinOsc.ar(gaus.linlin(-1, 1, 40, 80)) * gaus.squared * 10;
	osc = (osc - 0.35).max(0);

	2.do{
		osc = HPF.ar(osc, 500);
	};

	osc.dup
}.play
)
&lt;/source&gt;

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

&lt;/noinclude&gt;
In this module we look at what it was like to live in a castle for the different groups of people who typically lived in one - from the Lord to the serfs.
==Family==

==Retainers==

===Kinghts===

===Men-At-Arms===

==Officials==

===The Butler===
In a medieval castle the butler was a mid ranked member of the staff responsible for the storage, security and serving of alcohol. The name &quot;butler&quot; derives from the Middle English word ''boteler'' which itself is derived from the Latin ''butticula'' meaning someone who looks after ''butts'', that is, casks of wine.

===The Castellan===

The castellan was the governor of the castle, responsible for all aspects of its domestic and military organisation. A castle that was not the home of a noble would be permanently run by a castellan.

===The Steward===

The steward supervised both the estate and the household. In larger castles there may have been two stewards - one who managed the estate and the other (sometimes known as the majordomo) to manage the domestic household. For castles that did not have a castellan, the stewards would maintain the castle during the owner's absence.

This chapter intends to give an overview of the technique Expectation Maximization (EM), proposed by &lt;ref name = &quot;georey1996&quot;/&gt; (although the technique was informally proposed in literature, as suggested by the author) in the context of R-Project environment. The first section gives an introduction of representative clustering and mixture models. The algorithm details and a case study will be presented on the second section.

The R package that will be used is the MCLUST-v3.3.2 developed by Chris Fraley and Adrian Raftery, available in CRAN repository. The MCLUST tool is a software that includes the following features: normal mixture modeling (EM); EM initialization through an hierarchical clustering approach; estimate the number of clusters based on the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC); and displays, including uncertainty plots and dimension projections.

The information sources of this document were divided in two groups: (i)  manual and guides of R and MCLUST, which includes the technical report &lt;ref name = &quot;fraley2006&quot;/&gt; that is the base reference of this project and gives an overview of MCLUST with several examples and (ii) theoretical papers, surveys and books found in literature.

= Introduction =

Clustering consists in identifying groups of entities that have characteristics in common and are cohesive and separated from each other. Interest in clustering has increased due to several applications in distinct knowledge areas. Highlighting the search for grouping of customers and products in massive datasets, document analysis in Web usage data, gene expression from microarrays and image analysis where clustering is used for segmentation.

The clustering methods can be grouped in classes. One widely used involves hierarchical clustering, which consider, initially, that each points represent one group and at each iteration it merged two groups chosen to optimize some criterion. A popular criteria, proposed by,&lt;ref name = &quot;ward1963&quot;/&gt; include the sum of within group sum of squares and is given by the shortest distance between the groups (single-link method).

Another typical class is based on iterative relocation, which data are moved from one group to another at each iteration. Also called as representative clustering due the use of a model, created to each cluster, that summarize the characteristics of the group elements. The most popular method in this class is the K-Means, proposed by,&lt;ref name = &quot;mcqueen1967&quot;/&gt; which is based on iterative relocation with the sum of squares criterion.

In statistic and optimization problems is usual to maximize or minimize a function, and its variables in a specific space. As these optimization problems may assume several different types, each one with its own characteristics, many techniques have been developed to solve them. This techniques are very important in data mining and knowledge discovery area as it can be used as basis for most complex and powerful methods.

One of these techniques is the [[w:Maximum likelihood|Maximum Likelihood]] and its main goal is to adjust a statistic model with a specific data set, estimating its unknown parameters so the function that can describe all the parameters in the dataset. In other words, the method will adjust some variables of a statistical model from a dataset or a known distribution, so the model can “describe” each data sample and estimate others.

It was realized that clustering can be based on probability models to cover the missing values. This provides insights into when the data should conform to the model and has led to the development of new clustering methods such as Expectation Maximization (EM) that is based on the principle of Maximum Likelihood of unobserved variables in finite mixture models.

= Technique to be discussed =

The EM algorithm is an unsupervised clustering method, that is, don't require a training phase, based on mixture models. It follows an iterative approach, sub-optimal, which tries to find the parameters of the probability distribution that has the maximum likelihood of its attributes.

In general lines, the algorithm's input are the data set (x), the total number of clusters (M), the accepted error to converge (e) and the maximum number of iterations. For each iteration, first is executed the E-Step (E-xpectation), that estimates the probability of each point belongs to each cluster, followed by the M-step (M-aximization), that re-estimate the parameter vector of the probability distribution of each class. The algorithm finishes when the distribution parameters converges or reach the maximum number of iterations.

== Algorithm ==

&lt;big&gt;'''Initialization'''&lt;/big&gt;

Each class j, of M classes (or clusters), is  constituted by a parameter vector (θ), composed by the mean (μj) and by the covariance matrix (&lt;math&gt;P_j&lt;/math&gt;), which represents the features of the Gaussian probability distribution (Normal) used to characterize the observed and unobserved entities of the data set x.

&lt;math&gt;
\theta(t) = { \mu_j(t),\ P_j(t) },\ j\ =\ 1..M
&lt;/math&gt;

On the initial instant (t = 0) the implementation can generate randomly the initial values of mean (μj) and of covariance matrix (&lt;math&gt;P_j&lt;/math&gt;). The EM algorithm aims to approximate the parameter vector (θ) of the real distribution. Another alternative offered by MCLUST is to initialize EM with the clusters obtained by a hierarchical clustering technique.

&lt;big&gt;'''E-Step'''&lt;/big&gt;

This step is responsible to estimate the probability of each element belong to each cluster (&lt;math&gt;P(C_j | x_k)&lt;/math&gt; ). Each element is composed by an attribute vector (&lt;math&gt;x_k&lt;/math&gt;). The relevance degree of the points of each cluster is given by the likelihood of each element attribute in comparison with the attributes of the other elements of cluster &lt;math&gt;C_j&lt;/math&gt;.

&lt;math&gt;
P(C_j|x) = \frac{|\sum_j(t)|^{-\frac{1}{2}}\ exp^{n_j}\ P_j(t)}{\sum_{k=1}^M\ |\sum_j(t)|^{-\frac{1}{2}}\ exp^{n_j}\ P_k(t)} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''M-Step'''&lt;/big&gt;

This step is responsible to estimate the parameters of the probability distribution of each class for the next step. First is computed the mean (μj) of class j obtained through the mean of all points in function of the relevance degree of each point.

&lt;math&gt;
\mu_j(t+1) = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^N\ P(C_j|x_k)\ x_k}{\sum_{k=1}^N\ P(C_j|x_k)}
&lt;/math&gt;

To compute the covariance matrix for the next iteration is applied the Bayes Theorem, which implies that &lt;math&gt;P(A|B) = P(B|A)*P(A) P(B)&lt;/math&gt;, based on the conditional probabilities of the class occurrence.

&lt;math&gt; 
\sum_j(t+1) = \frac{\sum_{k=1}^N\ P(C_j|x_k)\ (x_k - \mu_j(t) )\ (x_k - \mu_j(t) )}{\sum_{k=1}^N\ P(C_j|x_k)}
&lt;/math&gt;

The probability of occurrence of each class is computed through the mean of probabilities (&lt;math&gt;C_j&lt;/math&gt;) in function of the relevance degree of each point from the class.

&lt;math&gt; 
P_j(t+1) = \frac{1}{N} \sum_{k=1}^N P(C_j|x_k)
&lt;/math&gt; 

The attributes represents the parameter vector θ that characterize the probability distribution of each class that will be used in the next algorithm iteration.

&lt;big&gt;'''Convergence Test'''&lt;/big&gt;

After each iteration is performed a convergence test which verifies if the difference of the attributes vector of an iteration to the previous iteration is smaller than an acceptable error tolerance, given by parameter. Some implementations uses the difference between the averages of class distribution as the convergence criterion.

&lt;big&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
if(||θ(t + 1) − θ(t)|| &lt; ǫ)
   stop
else
   call E-Step
end
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/big&gt;

The algorithm has the property of, at each step, estimate a new attribute vector that has the maximum local likelihood, not necessarily the global, what reduces the its complexity. However, depending on the dispersion of the data and on its volume, the algorithm can stop due the maximum number of iterations defined.

== Implementation ==
===Packages===

The expectation-maximization in algorithm in R,&lt;ref name = &quot;chambers&quot;/&gt; proposed in,&lt;ref name = &quot;fraley2007&quot;/&gt; will use the package mclust. This package contains crucial methods for the execution of the clustering algorithm, including functions for the E-step and M-step calculation. The package manual explains all of its functions, including simple examples. This manual can be found in.&lt;ref name = &quot;fraley2006&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name = &quot;fraley2007&quot;/&gt;

The mclust package also provides various models for EM and also hierarchical clustering(HC), which is defined by the covariance structures. These models are presented in Table 1 and are explained in detail in.&lt;ref name = &quot;fraley2002&quot;/&gt;

===Executing the Algorithm===

The function “em” can be used for the expectation-maximization method, as it implements the method for parameterized Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), starting in the E-step. This function uses the following parameters:

*'''model-name''': the name of the model used;

*'''data''': all the collected data, which must be all numerical. If the data format is represent by a matrix, the rows will represent the samples (observations) and the columns the variables;

*'''parameters''': model parameters, which can assume the following values: pro, mean, variance and Vinv, corresponding to the mixture proportion for the components of mixture, mean of each component, parameters variance and the estimate hypervolume of the data region, respectively.

*'''other''': less relevant parameters which wont be described here. More details can be found in the package manual.

After the execution, the function will return:

*'''model-name''': the name of the model;
*'''z''': a matrix whose the element in position [I,k] presents the conditional probability of the ith sample belongs to the kth mixture component;
*'''parameters''': same as the input;
*'''others''': other metrics which wont be discussed here.  More details can be found in the package manual.
 
===A simple example===

In order to demonstrate how to use the R to execute the expectation-Maximization method, the following algorithm presents a simple example for a test dataset. This example can also be found in the package manual.

&lt;pre&gt;
&gt; modelName = ``EEE''
&gt; data = iris[,-5]
&gt; z = unmap(iris[,5])
&gt; msEst &lt;- mstep(modelName, data, z)
&gt; names(msEst)
&gt; modelName = msEst$modelName
&gt; parameters = msEst$parameters
&gt; em(modelName, data, parameters)
&lt;/pre&gt;

The first line executes the M-step so the parameters used in the em function can be generated. This function is called mstep and its inputs are model name, as “EEE”, the dataseta the iris dataset and finally, the z matrix, which contains the conditional probability of each class contains each data sample. This z matrix is generated by the unmap function.

After the M-step, the algorithm will show (line 2) the attributes of the object returned by this function. The third line will start the clustering process using some of the result of the M-step method as input.

The clustering method will return the parameters estimated in the process and the conditional probability of each sample falls in each class. These parameters include mean and variance, and this last one corresponds to the use of the mclustVariance method.

This section will present some examples of visualization available in MCLUST package. First will be showed a simple example of the overall process of clustering from the choice of the number of clusters, the initialization and the partitioning. Then it will be explained a didactical example using two random mixtures in comparison with two gaussian mixtures.

&lt;big&gt;'''Basic Example'''&lt;/big&gt;

This is a simple example to show the features offered by MCLUST package. It is applied to the faithful dataset (included in R project). First the cluster analysis estimates the number of clusters that best represents this data set and also the covariance structure of the spread points. This is performed through the technique called Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) that varies the number of cluster from 1 to 9. The BIC is the value of the maximized loglikelihood measured with a penalty for the number of parameters in the model. Then it's executed the hierarchical clustering technique (HC), which doesn't require a initialization phase. The output of the HC, that is, the cluster that each element belongs, is used to initialize the Expectation-Maximization technique (EM). After the execution of EM clustering the charts are showed below:

&lt;big&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;

# usage: R --no-save &lt; basic_example.R

library(mclust)           # load mclust library
x = faithful[,1]          # get the first column of the faithful data set
y = faithful[,2]          # get the second column of the faithful data set
plot(x,y)                 # plot the spread points before the clustering
model &lt;- Mclust(faithful) # estimate the number of cluster (BIC), initialize (HC) and clusterize (EM)
data = faithful           # get the data set 
plot(model, faithful)     # plot the clustering results
&lt;/pre&gt;     
&lt;/big&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''Didactical Example'''&lt;/big&gt;

A didactical example is developed to show two distinct scenarios: (a) one that the model doesn't represents the data and (b) another that the data is conformed to the model. This example intends to show how EM behaves with noised and clean data sets. 

'''a) Uniform random mixtures'''

A noised data set is generated through a uniform random function. The points spread are showed in a chart. Then the clustering analysis is executed  with default parameters (i.e. varies cluster from 1 to 9). The clustering tool shows a warning with a message that the best model occurs at the min or max, in this case is the min that all points are grouped in a single cluster.

&lt;big&gt;

mix[,2] = c(y1, y2)              # insert second class points into the matrix
mixclust = Mclust(mix)           # initialize EM with hierarchical clustering, execute BIC and EM

# Warning messages:
# 1: In summary.mclustBIC(Bic, data, G = G, modelNames = modelNames) :
#    best model occurs at the min or max # of components considered
# 2: In Mclust(mix) : optimal number of clusters occurs at min choice

&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/big&gt;

'''b) Two gaussian mixtures'''

This scenario is composed by two well separated data sets generated through a gaussian distribution function (Normal). The points are showed in the first chart. The EM clustering is applied and the results are also showed in the graphs below. As we can see, the EM clustering obtain two gaussian models that is in conformed to the data.

== Case Study ==
=== Scenario ===

The scenario to be analyzed is composed by a sample data set available in the MCLUST package named &quot;wreath&quot;. A clustering analysis is performed with more details, applied to a scenario composed by 14 point groups, that exceeds the maximum number of clusters allowed by the default MCLUST parameters. The clustering technique is executed two times: (i) the first based on the default MCLUST, (ii) with customized parameters.

=== Input data ===

The input of the case study is the data set wreath provided by the MCLUST package. This data set consists in a 14 point group showed on the next figure, which can be modeled with Spherical or Ellipsoide that take into account the orientation of the data due its rotation. 

&lt;big&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
### case_input.R ###
# usage: R --no-save &lt; case_default.R

plot(wreath[,1],wreath[,2])
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/big&gt;

=== Execution ===

The clustering is executed two times. The first one is based on the default parameters given by the MCLUST tool, that varies the number of cluster from 1 to 9, which is smaller than the necessary to fit the case study data set. The estimation of the number of clusters is showed in a graphic that varies the number of clusters and compute the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) for each value. We can see that the BIC, using the default parameters, is divergent while is expected find a peak followed by a decrease that indicates the best number of clusters.

&lt;big&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
### case_default.R ###
# usage: R --no-save &lt; case_default.R

library(mclust)

wreathBIC &lt;- mclustBIC(wreath)
plot(wreathBIC, legendArgs = list(x = &quot;topleft&quot;))
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/big&gt;

[[File:default bic.pdf]]

Then the number of cluster is customized, modified to varies from 1 to 20 as showed below. The BIC technique will give the best number of clusters, in this case 14 clusters and the coefficient structure that have the properties of this data set, that is the EEV, which means that the clusters has similar shape, similar volumes but variable orientation. After executes the BIC method again we can see that 14 clusters, indicated by the peak on the graphic, is the number of cluster that present the maximum likelihood for this data.

&lt;big&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
### case_customized.R ###
# usage: R --no-save &lt; case_customized.R

library(mclust)
wreathDefault &lt;- mclustBIC(wreath)
wreathCustomize &lt;- mclustBIC(wreath, G = 1:20, x = wreathDefault)
plot(wreathCustomize, G = 10:20, legendArgs = list(x = &quot;bottomleft&quot;))
summary(wreathCustomize, wreath)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/big&gt;

[[File:customize bic.pdf]]

=== Output ===

The output of this clustering is analysed is obtained using the method mclust2Dplot depicted in the next figure. It was used the density visualization. The clusters found are characterized by 14 models wich have the distribution of an ellipsoides, with different orientation, beein in conformed with the data. The method summary can be executed later analyse other aspects of the clustering result.

&lt;big&gt;
&lt;pre&gt;
### case_output.R ###
# usage: R --no-save &lt; case_customized.R

library(mclust)
data(wreath)
wreathBIC &lt;- mclustBIC(wreath)
wreathBIC &lt;- mclustBIC(wreath, G = 1:20, x = wreathBIC)
wreathModel &lt;- summary(wreathBIC, data = wreath)
mclust2Dplot(data = wreath, what = &quot;density&quot;, identify = TRUE, parameters = wreathModel$parameters, z = wreathModel$z)
&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/big&gt;

[[File:cluster customize.pdf]]

=== Analysis ===

We can see that the mixture models created to represent the point are in conformation to the data set. On this case, the groups doesn't have an intersection between them, so all points were classified to the right group. The cluster orientation allows the method to find a better Ellipsoide to represent those points.

We conclude that the EM clustering technique, despite the dependence of the number of clusters and the initialization phase, is an efficient method that  produces good results for several scenarios of data dispersion. The use of BIC to estimate the number of clusters and of the hierarchical clustering (HC) (which doesn't depend of the number of clusters) to initialize the clusters improves the quality of the results.

      <text xml:space="preserve">UC San Diego has several libraries available to students. The largest library is Geisel Library. Other libraries on campus include CLICS and the Biomedical Library.

==Libraries==
There are several libraries on campus. These include Geisel Library, CLICS, the Biomedical Library, as well as several others. 

===Geisel Library===
[[File:Geisel-Library.jpg|thumb|Geisel Library]]
[[File:Dr. Suess and the Cat in the Hat, Sculpture, UCSD.jpg|thumb|Dr. Seuss sculpture near Geisel Library entrance]]
The biggest library on campus is Geisel Library. It is located in the center of the campus (it was originally called the &quot;Central Library&quot;) near the Price Center. The main entrance to this library opens to Library Walk, which is a busy walkway that extends all the way to Gilman Drive. This library is named after Theodor Geisel, the famous artist and children's author better known as Dr. Seuss. Geisel and his wife were generous benefactors to the library and his artwork and papers are currently in the possession of the library. A statue of Geisel and his famous character The Cat in the Hat are close to the entrance of the library. This library has a very distinctive design and is one of the main symbols of UC San Diego.

Geisel Library is composed of several smaller libraries. The biggest of these is the Social Science &amp; Humanities (SSH) Library.[http://libraries.ucsd.edu/locations/sshl/index.html] This library is housed on all the floors of Geisel Library except the basement level. To go to this library, turn left when entering Geisel Library or use the elevator or stairs located near the entrance to go to the floor you want to go to. The next largest is the Science &amp; Engineering (S&amp;E) Library.[http://libraries.ucsd.edu/locations/se/index.html] It is located on the ground floor and in the basement level of Geisel Library. To go to this library, turn right when entering Geisel Library and continue walking until you enter this library. Geisel Library also includes the Arts Libraries.[http://libraries.ucsd.edu/locations/arts/index.html] The Arts Libraries are in the basement level of Geisel Library. The Mandeville Special Collections Library houses the library's rarest and oldest books.[http://libraries.ucsd.edu/locations/mscl/index.html] It contains archives and important manuscripts. It is mainly used by researchers rather than undergraduate students. It is located on the ground floor of the library.

===CLICS===
CLICS (Center for Library &amp; Instructional Computing Services) is located directly south of Revelle Plaza.[http://libraries.ucsd.edu/locations/clics/index.html] This library consists mostly of ACMS computers available for student use. The main level of this library consists of computer cubicles and a computer room. Printers and copiers are available here as well. The second level consists of more computer cubicles and tables students can study and do homework at. This library is open all day and night during Final Exams Week at the end of each quarter.

===Biomedical Library===
The Biomedical Library is located on the School of Medicine area of the main campus near Osler Lane.[http://libraries.ucsd.edu/locations/bml/index.html] The ground floor of this library consists mostly of computer cubicles and a computer room as well as study room students can use. The second level houses the biomedical book and journal collection. There are tables and other study areas available for student use on this level as well.

==Course Reserves==
Some instructors use the electronic course reserves system. Faculty can have material (typically PDF files or links to websites) uploaded to the library website so that students can access it. The material is typically organized according to which week of the quarter it is supposed to be read by. This system avoids the costs and hassles of having course readers printed for a class. To access the course reserves materials for a class, go to the [http://libraries.ucsd.edu/resources/course-reserves/index.html|UC San Diego Libraries Course Reserves homepage] and click on &quot;Students.&quot; Then select the department name the class is listed under (i.e. History of Science) from the drop-down menu and click on &quot;Search.&quot; Then click on the link to the course number of the class (i.e. HISC115) and the course reserves for that class will appear.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Creating an Armature ==
In order to create 3D animation in Blender, the first step is to create an armature, more or less a bone structure, for your model. Creating one will let you animate the movements between your bones, which will then move the vertices connected to them. This tutorial will cover the process of making and moving a set of bones created and attached to the fish made in the previous tutorials.

First of all, move your cursor to the tip of the tail fin inside the body (the easiest way to do this is to select the vertice on the end, push space, and select 'Transform'/'Snap'/'Cursor to selection') and add a new armature by moving back into object mode, and hitting space, and selecting 'Add'/'Armature'. This should give a single bone relative to the current camera position.

[[File:Blender_first_bone_for_fish.png|centre]]

Rotate this bone by 90 degrees so it moves along the fishes body. Most of the same manipulations which was covered earlier in these tutorials for models (rotate, scale, extrude etc.) will work here. Enter edit mode with the armature selected. and extrude your now rotated bone to the side fins by selecting the circle connected to the thinnest part of the triangle and hitting 'E'. Move it along until it is about half way through.

[[File:Blender_second_bone.png|centre]]

Using this technique, create bones which lead along the back and side fins, with a bone leading parallel across the rest of the body.

[[File:Blender_almost_complete_bone_structure.png|centre]]

To finish off the bone structure, create two bones off of the end closest to the face, each parallel to the mouth and about the length of each end of the mouth. Then select only the new tow, and hit 'Alt-P'. This will allow you to disconnect the bones from the parent, so they can now be moved slightly down to match the position of the mouth as below, while still being part of the original armature.

[[File:Blender_mouth_armature.png|centre]]

Finally, connect your bones to your model using the following process. Select each of the models, and the same way you set up the subsurf modifiers, add an armature modifier. Enter the name of your armature (which appears on the bottom left when the armature is selected) and ensure that the 'Envelopes' option is deselected, and 'Vert groups' are selected. This changes how the armature effects the model, but for the purposes of the rest of the tutorial, we will need to use 'Vert groups'

[[File:Blender_armature_options.png|centre]]

Select the armature in object mode, and enter pose mode. Later this will allow you move your bones around and see the effect on the model, but for now just select one of the bones, and then go back to object mode and select the model you want to connect it to. Enter weight paint mode, and then you should see your chosen model surrounded by blue, and your cursor should turn into a little paint brush. In this mode, you 'paint' the sections of the model which you want to be covered by that bone. Various options at the bottom can be changed to modify how it can be painted, and for now I would recommend you deselect the 'soft' button to speed up the process.
Do this for all of the related bones to your model. To test out this effect and ensure it is working by re-entering pose mode, and moving the model around.

Now its ready for some animations.

== Animating your model ==
The basic principle of the animation we will be creating is to set different locations for the bones at separated points of time on at different animation frames (keyframes), and then have Blender (and later XNA) calculate the positions in between those two on these times. Imagine it as being similar to directing a film, where you would tell the actors the positions to move between, without having to worry about every step they make.

Split up your screen into two windows as previously, and place the left window into 'Action Editor' mode.

[[File:Blender_action_editor_demo.png|centre]]

Now to start with, we will create a simple swimming animation.

Select the browse choices button on the right window, and select add new, and call it 'Swim'.

[[File:Blender_browse_choices.png|centre]]

Next, move the bones in pose mode so that they look like the body of a fish distorted, as if swimming. I did this by moving the bone closest to the head and one connected to the tail by 10 degrees in alternate directions on the X axis, and the fins by 10 on the Z axis. Then select all the bones modified for the animation and hit I and select 'Rot'. This will create a rotation key at frame 1 for your project, which you should see on your action editor on the left.

Move the animation 5 frames on by clicking on frame 5 on the action editor, and move all of the bones you just moved in the opposite direction to create the next stage of movement. Press I, and save these key frames the same way.

Finally to complete this animation, do the same process as before, which should move the bones back into their original position (alternatively, you can select the initial keyframes and duplicate them by hitting 'Shift-D'). Then click 'View' on the bottom of the right window, and select 'Preview range from action length' which will set the animation length to between the first and last keyframe. Select 'Play back animation' in the same menu, and you should see a swimming Fish.

[[File:Blender_SwimAnimation.png|centre]]

Next, following a similar process and with the 'Swim' still selected, select 'ADD NEW' and modify the two bones connected to the mouth to form a one frame 'Smile' and 'Frown' animation (if stretching the term a little) which will be used in the XNA game late into the development when we start adding NPCs.

Thanks for your contributions to the Aboriginal Lore honor.  It's great that you have kept it up-to-date with this recent development.  I think that's the main feature of a wiki that makes this project so exciting. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 12:37, 6 December 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">This section gives a classical description of projective transformations of the projective line, plane, and 3-space.

A '''projective transformation''' is a transformation used in projective geometry: it is the composition of a pair of [[w:perspective projection|perspective projection]]s. It describes what happens to the perceived positions of observed objects when the point of view of the observer changes. Projective transformations do not preserve sizes or angles but do preserve [[w:incidence (geometry)|incidence]] and [[w:cross-ratio|cross-ratio]]: two properties which are important in projective geometry. A projective transformation can also be called a '''projectivity'''. 
Projectivities form a group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |

As important special cases, a projective transformation can be in the (real) one-dimensional [[w:projective line|projective line]] ''RP''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, the two-dimensional [[w:projective plane|projective plane]] ''RP''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and the three-dimensional projective 3-space ''RP''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;; see:

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Guru Angad Dev''' (31 March 1504 - 28 March 1552) was the second of the ten Sikh Gurus. He was born in the village of Sarae Naga in the Muktsar district of the Punjab region. He was given the name Lehna shortly after his birth as was the custom of his Hindu parents. His father was a small successful trader named Pheru. His mother's name was Mata Ramo (also known as Mata Sabhirai, Mansa Devi and  Daya kaur). Baba Narayan Das Trehan was his grandfather, whose ancestral house was at Matte-di-Sarai near Mukatsar.

In 1538, Guru Nanak Dev Ji chose Lehna, his disciple, as a successor to the Guruship rather than one of his sons.&lt;ref name=Shackle_2005&gt;{{cite book | last=Shackle | first=Christopher | coauthors= Mandair, Arvind-Pal Singh | year=2005 | title=Teachings of the Sikh Gurus: Selections from the Sikh Scriptures | publisher=Routledge  | location=United Kingdom | isbn = 0-415-26604-1 | pages=xiii-xiv | nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bhai Lehna was given the name Angad and designated Guru Angad Dev, becoming the second guru of the Sikhs. He continued the work started by the first Sikh Guru, Guru Nanak Dev Ji.

He married Mata Khivi in January 1520 and had two sons (Dasu and Datu) and two daughters (Amro and Anokhi). The whole family of his father had left their ancestral village in fear of the invasion of Babar's armies. After this the family settled at  Khadur Sahib, a village by the River Beas, near what is now Tarn Taran a small town about 25&amp;nbsp;km from the city of Amritsar the Holiest site of the Sikhs.

==Devotion and service to Guru Nanak Dev Ji==

One day, Bhai Lehna heard the recitation of a hymn of Guru Nanak Dev Ji from Bhai Jodha a neighbor who was a follower of the Guru. His mind was captured by the tune and while on his annual pilgrimage to Jwalamukhi Temple he asked his group if they would mind going to see the Guru. Everyone thought this most inappropriate and refused. Not one to shirk his responsibilities, he was after all the guide and leader of the group, he couldn't abandon them with thieves along the way. But man of honor and dharma that he was, the poems and prayers (kirtan) of Nanak still held onto his every thought. So one night without telling anyone he mounted his horse and proceeded to the village now known as Kartarpur (God's city) to visit with Guru Nanak Dev Ji. As soon as he found the Guru, he threw himself at Nanak's feet. His very first meeting with Guru Nanak Dev Ji completely transformed him. He dedicated himself to the service of Guru Nanak Dev Ji and so became his disciple (Sikh) and began to live in Kartarpur. 

His deep devotion and service (Sewa) to Guru Nanak Dev Ji was so intense that the Guru's family grew jealous. He was therefore sent by his new master back to his home to tend to his family and watch over the Guru's Sikhs in and around Khadur. After later returning to Kartarpur, he was given a series of  tests of his obedience and service (one where he had to eat what appeared to the Guru's sons to be carrion, which only Lehna was willing to eat, which magically turned into the sweetest of foods) he was instated as the 2nd Guru, Guru Angad Dev Ji. Guru Nanak Dev Ji had touched him and renamed him Angad (part of the body) or the second Nanak on September 7, 1539. Before becoming the new Guru he had spent six or seven years in the service of Guru Nanak Dev Ji at Kartarpur.

After the death of Guru Nanak Dev Ji on September 22, 1539, Guru Angad Dev Ji left Kartarpur for the village of Khadur Sahib (near Goindwal Sahib). He carried forward the principles of Guru Nanak Dev Ji both in letter and spirit. Yogis and Saints of different sects visited him and held detailed discussions about Sikhism with him. 

==Community work==
[[File:Sikh mulmantar.png|thumb|right|The text of the Mul Mantar, the holiest prayer in Sikhism, written in the Gurmukhi script]]
Guru Angad Dev Ji introduced a new alphabet known as Gurmukhi script, modifying the old Punjabi script characters. Soon, this script became very popular and started to be used by the people in general. He took great interest in the education of children by opening many schools for their instruction and thus increased the number of literate people. For the youth he started the tradition of Mall Akhara, where physical as well as spiritual exercises were held. He collected the facts about Guru Nanak Dev Ji's life from Bhai Bala and wrote the first biography of Guru Nanak Dev Ji. He also wrote 63 Saloks (stanzas), which are included in the Guru Granth Sahib Ji. He popularised and expanded the institution of ''Guru ka Langar'' (the Guru's communal kitchen) that had been started by Guru Nanak Dev Ji.

Guru Angad Dev Ji travelled widely and visited all the important religious centres established by Guru Nanak Dev Ji for the preaching of Sikhism. He also established hundreds of new centres of Sikhism and thus strengthened its base. The period of his Guruship was the most crucial one. The Sikh community had moved from having a founder to a succession of Gurus and the infrastructure of Sikh society was strengthened and crystallised &amp;mdash; from being an infant, Sikhism had moved to being a young child, ready to face the dangers that were around. During this phase, Sikhism established its own separate religious identity.

==Death and successor==

Guru Angad Dev Ji, following the example set by Guru Nanak Dev Ji, nominated Sri Amar Das Ji as his successor (The Third Nanak) before his death. He presented all the holy scripts, including those he received from Guru Nanak Dev Ji, to Guru Amar Das Ji. He breathed his last on March 29, 1552 at the age of forty-eight. It is said that he started to build a new town, at Goindwal near Khadur Sahib and Guru Amar Das ji was appointed to supervise its construction. It is also said that the deposed Mughal Emperor Humayun  (Babar's son), while being pursued by Sher Shah Suri, came to obtain the blessings of Guru Angad Dev Ji in regaining the throne of Delhi.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{WikiProject Languages}} 

== Learning the kanji ==
A key interest of students of Japanese is, practically, ''how to learn the kanji.'' The current page both gives useful information ''about'' kanji (yomi, furigana), and, as of [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Japanese/Kanji&amp;oldid=1674549 this revision] (or rather the immediately preceding one), gives information on kanji study methods (there is also some information on testing of kanji: JLPT and Kanji Kentei). These are both useful and essential; perhaps they work well together on the same page, perhaps they would work better on separate pages.

Hope the “learning the kanji” section helps, and please feel free to elaborate and rearrange – this is a complex and important topic, and there are many methods and schools of thought (流派) on it!

== Confused characters and calligraphy ==

I just undid [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Japanese%2FKanji&amp;action=historysubmit&amp;diff=1677927&amp;oldid=1676621 a couple of edits] which I felt might be nicer to leave a rationale for:
* I think these &quot;confused characters&quot; are essentially the same problem as addressed in &quot;details&quot;. The &quot;graphical&quot; bit surely looks like that and the &quot;vocabulary&quot; could be added to it. As for the &quot;semantics&quot; and &quot;sound&quot; I don't quite see how these will help you remember whether a おっと is written 天 or 夫.
* The picture seems way too big for the size of the corresponding section. It furthermore displays a highly cursive style that I wouldn't be surprised many Japanese would have trouble reading it with its liberal treatment of the strokes.
* I think it makes most sense in terms of flow and usefulness to have the calligraphy section at the end of the study methods sub-sections.
--[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 00:50, 11 December 2009 (UTC)

: Actually, after a bit of rewriting, I wonder if it might be best to merge the calligraphy and rote sections. --[[User:Swift|Swift]] ([[User talk:Swift|talk]]) 01:51, 11 December 2009 (UTC)

== great work guys ==

Amazing job, too bad the German wiki doesn't have a clear page and/or lessons that are as complete and clear.
The only thing I don't like is the insistence of including external links for learning resources, but I don't see an alternative unless there was suddenly an influx of talent. Keep up the good work!--[[User:Danthemango|Danthemango]] ([[User talk:Danthemango|talk]]) 09:08, 14 January 2011 (UTC)

== Kanji Chains ==

I would like to see someone write about learning Kanji by using Kanji chains.
http://www.susi.ru/kanji/ChMethod.html
Someone should decipher what this guy said, and dumb it down for me.  It sounds potentially useful, but I don't quite understand it.

Let ''X'' be a point on the ''x''-axis.  A projective transformation can be defined geometrically for this line by picking a pair of points ''P'', ''Q'', and a line ''m'', all within the same ''x-y'' plane which contains the ''x''-axis upon which the transformation will be performed.

Points ''P'' and ''Q'' represent two different observers, or points of view.  Point ''R'' is the position of some object they are observing.  Line ''m'' is the objective world which they are observing, and the ''x''-axis is the subjective perception of ''m''.

Draw line ''l'' through points ''P'' and ''X''.  Line ''l'' crosses line ''m'' at point ''R''.  Then draw line ''t'' through points ''Q'' and ''R'': line ''t'' will cross the ''x''-axis at point ''T''.  Point ''T'' is the transform of point ''X'' [Paiva].

== Analysis ==
The above is a [[w:synthetic geometry|synthetic]] description of a one-dimensional projective transformation.  It is now desired to convert it to an [[w:analytical geometry|analytical]] (Cartesian) description.

Let point ''X'' have coordinates ''(x&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,0)''.  Let point ''P'' have coordinates &lt;math&gt; (P_x,P_y) &lt;/math&gt;.  Let point ''Q'' have coordinates &lt;math&gt; (Q_x,Q_y) &lt;/math&gt;.  Let line ''m'' have slope ''m'' (''m'' is being overloaded in meaning).

The slope of line ''l'' is

:&lt;math&gt; P_y \over P_x - x_0, &lt;/math&gt;

so an arbitrary point ''(x,y)'' on line ''l'' is given by the equation

:&lt;math&gt; {y \over x - x_0} = {P_y \over P_x - x_0} &lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; y = {P_y \over P_x - x_0} (x - x_0). \qquad \qquad (1) &lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, any point ''(x,y)'' on line ''m'' is described by

:&lt;math&gt; y = m x + b. \qquad \qquad (2) &lt;/math&gt;

The intersection of lines ''l'' and ''m'' is point ''R'', and it is obtained by combining equations (1) and (2):

:&lt;math&gt; m x + b = {P_y x \over P_x - x_0} - {P_y x_0 \over P_x - x_0}. &lt;/math&gt;

Joining the ''x'' terms yields

:&lt;math&gt; \left( {P_y \over P_x - x_0} - m \right) x
 = b + {P_y x_0 \over P_x - x_0} &lt;/math&gt;

and solving for ''x'' we obtain

:&lt;math&gt; x_1 = {b (P_x - x_0) + P_y x_0 \over P_y - m (P_x - x_0)}. &lt;/math&gt;

''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the abscissa of ''R''.  The ordinate of ''R'' is

:&lt;math&gt; y_1 = m \left[ {b (P_x - x_0) + P_y x_0 \over P_y - m (P_x - x_0)} \right] + b. &lt;/math&gt;

Now, knowing both ''Q'' and ''R'', the slope of line ''n'' is

:&lt;math&gt; {y_1 - Q_y \over x_1 - Q_x} .&lt;/math&gt;

We want to find the intersection of line ''n'' and the ''x''-axis, so let

:&lt;math&gt; (Q_x, Q_y) + \lambda (x_1 - Q_x, y_1 - Q_y) = (x,0) \qquad \qquad (3) &lt;/math&gt;

The value of ''λ'' must be adjusted so that both sides of vector equation (3) are equal.  Equation (3) is actually two equations, one for abscissas and one for ordinates.  The one for ordinates is

:&lt;math&gt; Q_y + \lambda (y_1 - Q_y) = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Solve for lambda,

:&lt;math&gt; \lambda = {-Q_y \over y_1 - Q_y} \qquad \qquad (4) &lt;/math&gt;

The equation for abscissas is 

:&lt;math&gt; x = Q_x + \lambda (x_1 - Q_x) &lt;/math&gt;

which together with equation (4) yields

:&lt;math&gt; x = Q_x - Q_y \left( {x_1 - Q_x \over y_1 - Q_y} \right) \qquad \qquad (5) &lt;/math&gt;

which is the abscissa of ''T''.

Substitute the values of ''x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''y&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' into equation (5),

:&lt;math&gt; x = Q_x - Q_y \left[ { {b (P_x - x_0) + P_y x_0 \over P_y - m (P_x - x_0)} - Q_x \over {m b (P_x - x_0) + m P_y x_0 \over P_y - m (P_x - x_0)} + b - Q_y} \right]. &lt;/math&gt;

Dissolve the fractions in both numerator and denominator:

:&lt;math&gt; x = Q_x - Q_y \left[ {b (P_x - x_0) + P_y x_0 - Q_x P_y + m Q_x (P_x - x_0) \over m b (P_x - x_0) + m P_y x_0 + b P_y - m b (P_x - x_0) - Q_y P_y + m Q_y (P_x - x_0) } \right]. &lt;/math&gt;

Simplify and relabel ''x'' as ''t(x)'':

:&lt;math&gt; t(x) = Q_x - Q_y \left[ { (P_x - x_0) (b + m Q_x)  + P_y (x_0 - Q_x) \over (P_x - x_0) m Q_y  + P_y (m x_0 + b - Q_y) } \right]. &lt;/math&gt;

''t(x)'' is the projective transformation.

Transformation ''t''(''x'') can be simplified further.  First, add its two terms to form a fraction:

:&lt;math&gt; t(x) = { (m Q_x P_y - Q_y P_y + b Q_y) x_0 + (b Q_x P_y - b Q_y P_x) \over m (P_y - Q_y) x_0 + (m P_x Q_y + P_y (b - Q_y)) } \qquad \qquad (6) &lt;/math&gt;

Then, define the coefficients ''α'', ''β'', ''γ'' and ''δ'' to be the following

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha = m Q_x P_y - Q_y P_y + b Q_y, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \beta = b Q_x P_y - b Q_y P_x, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \gamma = m (P_y - Q_y), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \delta = m P_x Q_y + P_y (b - Q_y). &lt;/math&gt;

Substitute these coefficients into equation (6), in order to produce

:&lt;math&gt; t(x) = { \alpha x + \beta \over \gamma x + \delta } &lt;/math&gt;

This is the [[w:Möbius transformation|Möbius transformation]] or linear fractional transformation.

== Inverse transformation ==
It is clear from the synthetic definition that the inverse transformation is obtained by exchanging points ''P'' and ''Q''.  This can also be shown analytically.  If ''P'' ↔ ''Q'', then ''α'' → ''α′'', ''β'' → ''β′'', ''γ'' → ''γ′'', and ''δ'' → ''δ′'', where
:&lt;math&gt; \alpha' = m P_x Q_y - P_y Q_y + b P_y = \delta, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \beta' = b P_x Q_y - b P_y Q_x = - \beta, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \gamma' = m (Q_y - P_y) = - \gamma, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \delta' = m Q_x P_y + b Q_y - Q_y P_y = \alpha. &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore if the forwards transformation is

:&lt;math&gt; t(x) = {\alpha x + \beta \over \gamma x + \delta} &lt;/math&gt;

then the transformation ''t′'' obtained by exchanging ''P'' and ''Q'' (''P'' ↔ ''Q'') is:

:&lt;math&gt; t'(x) = {\delta x - \beta \over - \gamma x + \alpha }. &lt;/math&gt;

Then

:&lt;math&gt; t'(t(x)) = {\delta \left( {\alpha x + \beta \over \gamma x + \delta} \right) - \beta \over - \gamma \left( {\alpha x + \beta \over \gamma x + \delta} \right) + \alpha} &lt;/math&gt;.

Dissolve the fractions in both numerator and denominator of the right side of this last equation:

:&lt;math&gt; t'(t(x)) = {\alpha \delta x + \beta \delta - \beta \gamma x - \beta \delta \over - \alpha \gamma x - \beta \gamma + \alpha \gamma x + \alpha \delta} &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; = {\alpha \delta x - \beta \gamma x \over \alpha \delta - \beta \gamma} = x &lt;/math&gt;.

Therefore ''t''′(''x'') = ''t''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''x''): the inverse projective transformation is obtained by exchanging observers ''P'' and ''Q'', or by letting α ↔ δ, β → −β, and γ&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;−γ.  This is, by the way, analogous to the procedure for obtaining the inverse of a two-dimensional matrix:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} \alpha &amp; \beta \\ \gamma &amp; \delta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \delta &amp; - \beta \\ - \gamma &amp; \alpha \end{bmatrix} = \Delta \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 \\ 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

where Δ = α δ − β γ is the determinant.

== Identity transformation ==
Also analogous with matrices is the identity transformation, which is obtained by letting α = 1, β = 0, γ = 0, and δ = 1, so that

:&lt;math&gt; t_I(x) = x. &lt;/math&gt;

== Composition of transformations ==
It remains to show that there is closure in the composition of transformations.  One transformation operating on another transformation produces a third transformation.  Let the first transformation be ''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and the second one be ''t''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; t_1(x) = {\alpha_1 x + \beta_1 \over \gamma_1 x + \delta_1 }, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; t_2(x) = {\alpha_2 x + \beta_2 \over \gamma_2 x + \delta_2 }. &lt;/math&gt;

The composition of these two transformations is

:&lt;math&gt; t_2(t_1(x)) = {\alpha_2 \left( {\alpha_1 x + \beta_1 \over \gamma_1 x + \delta_1} \right) + \beta_2 \over \gamma_2 \left( {\alpha_1 x + \beta_1 \over \gamma_1 x + \delta_1 } \right) + \delta_2 } &lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt; = {\alpha_2 \alpha_1 x + \alpha_2 \beta_1 + \beta_2 \gamma_1 x + \beta_2 \delta_1 \over \gamma_2 \alpha_1 x + \gamma_2 \beta_1 + \delta_2 \gamma_1 x + \delta_2 \delta_1 } &lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt; = {(\alpha_2 \alpha_1 + \beta_2 \gamma_1) x + (\alpha_2 \beta_1 + \beta_2 \delta_1) \over (\gamma_2 \alpha_1 + \delta_2 \gamma_1) x + (\gamma_2 \beta_1 + \delta_2 \delta_1)}. &lt;/math&gt;

Define the coefficients α&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, β&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, γ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and δ&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to be equal to

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha_3 = \alpha_2 \alpha_1 + \beta_2 \gamma_1, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \beta_3 = \alpha_2 \beta_1 + \beta_2 \delta_1, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \gamma_3 = \gamma_2 \alpha_1 + \delta_2 \gamma_1, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \delta_3 = \gamma_2 \beta_1 + \delta_2 \delta_1. &lt;/math&gt;

Substitute these coefficients into &lt;math&gt; t_2(t_1(x)) &lt;/math&gt; to obtain

:&lt;math&gt; t_2(t_1(x)) = { \alpha_3 x + \beta_3 \over \gamma_3 x + \delta_3}. &lt;/math&gt;

Projections operate in a way analogous to matrices.  In fact, the composition of transformations can be obtained by multiplying matrices:
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} \alpha_2 &amp; \beta_2 \\ \gamma_2 &amp; \delta_2 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} \alpha_1 &amp; \beta_1 \\ \gamma_1 &amp; \delta_1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \alpha_2 \alpha_1 + \beta_2 \gamma_1 &amp; \alpha_2 \beta_1 + \beta_2 \delta_1 \\ \gamma_2 \alpha_1 + \delta_2 \gamma_1 &amp; \gamma_2 \beta_1 + \delta_2 \delta_1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \alpha_3 &amp; \beta_3 \\ \gamma_3 &amp; \delta_3 \end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;
Since matrices multiply associatively, it follows that composition of projections is also associative.

Projections have: an operation (composition), associativity, an identity, an inverse and closure, so they form a [[group (mathematics)|group]].

== The cross-ratio defined by means of a projection ==
Let there be a transformation ''t&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;'' such that ''t&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''(''A'') = &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;, ''t&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''(''B'') = 0, ''t&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''(''C'') = 1.  Then the value of ''t&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''(''D'') is called the cross-ratio of points ''A'', ''B'', ''C'' and ''D'', and is denoted as [''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D'']&lt;sub&gt;''s''&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; [A,B,C,D]_s = t_s(D). &lt;/math&gt;

Let

:&lt;math&gt; t_s(x) = {\alpha x + \beta \over \gamma x + \delta}, &lt;/math&gt;

then the three conditions for ''t&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;(x)'' are met when

:&lt;math&gt; t_s(A) = {\alpha A + \beta \over \gamma A + \delta} = \infty, \qquad \qquad (7) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; t_s(B) = {\alpha B + \beta \over \gamma B + \delta} = 0, \qquad \qquad (8) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; t_s(C) = {\alpha C + \beta \over \gamma C + \delta} = 1. \qquad \qquad (9) &lt;/math&gt;

Equation (7) implies that &lt;math&gt; \gamma A + \delta = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, therefore &lt;math&gt; \delta = - \gamma A &lt;/math&gt;.
Equation (8) implies that &lt;math&gt; \alpha B + \beta = 0 &lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt; \beta = - \alpha B &lt;/math&gt;.
Equation (9) becomes

:&lt;math&gt; {\alpha C - \alpha B \over \gamma C - \gamma A} = 1, &lt;/math&gt;

which implies

:&lt;math&gt; \gamma = \alpha {C - B \over C - A}. &lt;/math&gt;

Therefore

:&lt;math&gt; t_s(D) = {\alpha D - \alpha B \over \alpha \left( {C - B \over C - A} \right) D - \gamma A} = {\alpha (D - B) \over \alpha \left( {C - B \over C - A} \right) D - \alpha \left( {C - B \over C - A} \right) A} &lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; = {D - B \over C - B} \; {C - A \over D - A} = {A - C \over A - D}\; {B - D \over B - C}. \qquad \qquad (10) &lt;/math&gt;

In equation (10), it is seen that ''t&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''(''D'') does not depend on the coefficients of the projection ''t&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;''.  It only depends on the positions of the points on the &quot;subjective&quot; projective line.  This means that the cross-ratio depends only on the relative distances among four [[collinear points]], and not on the projective transformation which was used to obtain (or define) the cross-ratio.  The cross ratio is therefore
:&lt;math&gt; [A,B,C,D] = {A - C \over A - D} \; {B - D \over B - C}. \qquad \qquad (11) &lt;/math&gt;

== Conservation of cross-ratio ==
Transformations on the projective line preserve cross ratio.  This will now be proven.  Let there be four (collinear) points ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D''.  Their cross-ratio is given by equation (11).  Let ''S(x)'' be a projective transformation:

:&lt;math&gt; S(x) = {\alpha x + \beta \over \gamma x + \delta} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; \alpha \delta \ne \beta \gamma &lt;/math&gt;.  Then

:&lt;math&gt; [S(A) S(B) S(C) S(D)] = {{\alpha A + \beta \over \gamma A + \delta} - {\alpha C + \beta \over \gamma C + \delta} \over {\alpha A + \beta \over \gamma A + \delta} - {\alpha D + \beta \over \gamma D + \delta}} \cdot {{\alpha B + \beta \over \gamma B + \delta} - {\alpha D + \beta \over \gamma D + \delta} \over {\alpha B + \beta \over \gamma B + \delta} - {\alpha C + \beta \over \gamma C + \delta}} &lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; = { [(\alpha A + \beta) (\gamma C + \delta) - (\alpha C + \beta) (\gamma A + \delta)] [(\alpha B + \beta) (\gamma D + \delta) - (\alpha D + \beta) (\gamma B + \delta)] \over [(\alpha A + \beta) (\gamma D + \delta) - (\alpha D + \beta) (\gamma A + \delta)] [(\alpha B + \beta) (\gamma C + \delta) - (\alpha C + \beta) (\gamma B + \delta)] } &lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; = { [\alpha A \delta + \beta \gamma C - \alpha C \delta - \beta \gamma A] [\alpha B \delta + \beta \gamma D - \alpha D \delta - \beta \gamma B] \over [\alpha A \delta + \beta \gamma D - \alpha D \delta - \beta \gamma A] [\alpha B \delta + \beta \gamma C - \alpha C \delta - \beta \gamma B]} &lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; = { [\alpha \delta (A - C) + \beta \gamma (C - A)] [\alpha \delta (B - D) + \beta \gamma (D - B)] \over [\alpha \delta (A - D) + \beta \gamma (D - A)] [\alpha \delta (B - C) + \beta \gamma (C - B)]} &lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; = {(\alpha \delta - \beta \gamma) (A - C) (\alpha \delta - \beta \gamma) (B - D) \over (\alpha \delta - \beta \gamma) (A - D) (\alpha \delta - \beta \gamma) (B - C)} &lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; = {A - C \over A - D} \cdot {B - D \over B - C} &lt;/math&gt;
Therefore [S(A) S(B) S(C) S(D)] = [A B C D], [[Q.E.D.]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">Two-dimensional projective transformations are a type of [[w:automorphism|automorphism]] of the projective plane onto itself.

Planar transformations can be defined synthetically as follows: point ''X'' on a &quot;subjective&quot; plane must be transformed to a point ''T'' also on the subjective plane.  The transformations uses these tools: a pair of &quot;observation points&quot; ''P'' and ''Q'', and an &quot;objective&quot; plane.  The subjective and objective planes and the two points all lie in three-dimensional space, and the two planes can intersect at some line.

Draw line ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; through points ''P'' and ''X''.  Line ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; intersects the objective plane at point ''R''.  Draw line ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through points ''Q'' and ''R''.  Line ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; intersects the projective plane at point ''T''.  Then ''T'' is the projective transform of ''X''.

== Analysis ==
Let the ''xy''-plane be the &quot;subjective&quot; plane and let plane ''m'' be the &quot;objective&quot; plane.  Let plane ''m'' be described by

:&lt;math&gt; z = f(x,y) = m x + n y + b &lt;/math&gt;

where the constants ''m'' and ''n'' are partial slopes and ''b'' is the ''z''-intercept.

Let there be a pair of &quot;observation&quot; points ''P'' and ''Q'',

:&lt;math&gt; P : (P_x, P_y, P_z), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; Q : (Q_x, Q_y, Q_z). &lt;/math&gt;

Let point ''X'' lie on the &quot;subjective&quot; plane:

:&lt;math&gt; X : (x,y,0). &lt;/math&gt;

Point ''X'' must be transformed to a point ''T'',

:&lt;math&gt; T : (T_x, T_y, 0) &lt;/math&gt;

also on the &quot;subjective&quot; plane.

The analytical results are a pair of equations, one for [[abscissa]] ''T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' and one for [[ordinate]] ''T&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'':

:&lt;math&gt; T_x = {x (-m Q_x P_z - n Q_z P_y + Q_z (P_z - b)) + (n y + b) (Q_z P_x - Q_x P_z) \over (m x + n y) (Q_z - P_z) - (m P_x + n P_y) Q_z + (Q_z - b) P_z}, \qquad \qquad (12) &lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; T_y = {y (-n Q_y P_z - m Q_z P_x + Q_z (P_z - b)) + (m x + b) (Q_z P_y - Q_y P_z) \over (n y + m x) (Q_z - P_z) - (n P_y + m P_x) Q_z + (Q_z - b) P_z }. \qquad \qquad (13) &lt;/math&gt;

There are (at most) nine degrees of freedom for defining a 2D transformation: ''P&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''P&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''P&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''Q&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''Q&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''Q&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''m'', ''n'', ''b''.  Notice that equations (12) and (13) have the same denominators, and that ''T&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' can be obtained from ''T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' by exchanging ''m'' with ''n'', and ''x'' with ''y'' (including subscripts of ''P'' and ''Q'').

== Trilinear fractional transformations ==
Let

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha = -m Q_x P_z - n Q_z P_y + Q_z (P_z - b), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \beta = n (Q_z P_x - Q_x P_z), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \gamma = b (Q_z P_x - Q_x P_z), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \delta = m (Q_z - P_z), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \epsilon = n (Q_z - P_z), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \zeta = - (m P_x + n P_y) Q_z + (Q_z - b) P_z, &lt;/math&gt;

so that

:&lt;math&gt; T_x = {\alpha x + \beta y + \gamma \over \delta x + \epsilon y + \zeta}. \qquad \qquad (14) &lt;/math&gt;

Also let

:&lt;math&gt; \eta = m (Q_z P_y - Q_y P_z), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \theta = -m Q_z P_x - n Q_y P_z + Q_z (P_z - b), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \kappa = b (Q_z P_y - Q_y P_z), &lt;/math&gt;

so that

:&lt;math&gt; T_y = {\eta x + \theta y + \kappa \over \delta x + \epsilon y + \zeta}. \qquad \qquad (15) &lt;/math&gt;

Equations (14) and (15) together describe the trilinear fractional transformation.

== Composition of trilinear transformations ==
If a transformation is given by equations (14) and (15), then such transformation is characterized by nine coefficients which can be arranged into a coefficient matrix

:&lt;math&gt; M_T = \begin{bmatrix} \alpha &amp; \beta &amp; \gamma
\\ \eta &amp; \theta &amp; \kappa 
\\ \delta &amp; \epsilon &amp; \zeta \end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

If there are a pair ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; of planar transformations whose coefficient matrices are &lt;math&gt; M_{T_1} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; M_{T_2} &lt;/math&gt;, then the composition of these transformations is another planar transformation ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; T_3 = T_2 \circ T_1 , &lt;/math&gt;

such that

:&lt;math&gt; T_3(x,y) = T_2 ( T_1 (x,y) ). &lt;/math&gt;

The coefficient matrix of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be obtained by multiplying the coefficient matrices of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; M_{T_3} = M_{T_2} \, M_{T_1}. &lt;/math&gt;

=== Proof ===
Given ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; defined by

:&lt;math&gt; T_{1x} = {\alpha_1 x + \beta_1 y + \gamma_1 \over \delta_1 x + \epsilon_1 y + \zeta_1}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; T_{1y} = {\eta_1 x + \theta_1 y + \kappa_1 \over \delta_1 x + \epsilon_1 y + \zeta_1}, &lt;/math&gt;
and given ''T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' defined by
:&lt;math&gt; T_{2x} = {\alpha_2 x + \beta_2 y + \gamma_2 \over \delta_2 x + \epsilon_2 y + \zeta_2}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; T_{2y} = {\eta_2 x + \theta_2 y + \kappa_2 \over \delta_2 x + \epsilon_2 y + \zeta_2}, &lt;/math&gt;

then ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; can be calculated by substituting ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; into ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; T_{3x} = T_{2x} ( T_{1x}, T_{1y} ) = { \alpha_2 \left( {\alpha_1 x + \beta_1 y + \gamma_1 \over \delta_1 x + \epsilon_1 y + \zeta_1} \right) + \beta_2 \left( {\eta_1 x + \theta_1 y + \kappa_1 \over \delta_1 x + \epsilon_1 y + \zeta_1} \right) + \gamma_2 \over \delta_2 \left( {\alpha_1 x + \beta_1 y + \gamma_1 \over \delta_1 x + \epsilon_1 y + \zeta_1} \right) + \epsilon_2 \left( {\eta_1 x + \theta_1 y + \kappa_1 \over \delta_1 x + \epsilon_1 y + \zeta_1} \right) + \zeta_2}. &lt;/math&gt;

Multiply numerator and denominator by the same trinomial,

:&lt;math&gt; T_{3x} = {\alpha_2 (\alpha_1 x + \beta_1 y + \gamma_1) + \beta_2 (\eta_1 x + \theta_1 y + \kappa_1) + \gamma_2 (\delta_1 x + \epsilon_1 y + \zeta_1) \over \delta_2 (\alpha_1 x + \beta_1 y + \gamma_1) + \epsilon_2 (\eta_1 x + \theta_1 y + \kappa_1) + \zeta_2 (\delta_1 x + \epsilon_1 y + \zeta_1)}. &lt;/math&gt;

Group the coefficients of ''x'', ''y'', and 1:

:&lt;math&gt; T_{3x} = { x (\alpha_2 \alpha_1 + \beta_2 \eta_1 + \gamma_2 \delta_1) + y (\alpha_2 \beta_1 + \beta_2 \theta_1 + \gamma_2 \epsilon_1) + (\alpha_2 \gamma_1 + \beta_2 \kappa_1 + \gamma_2 \zeta_1) \over x (\delta_2 \alpha_1 + \epsilon_2 \eta_1 + \zeta_2 \delta_1) + y (\delta_2 \beta_1 + \epsilon_2 \theta_1 + \zeta_2 \epsilon_1) + (\delta_2 \gamma_1 + \epsilon_2 \kappa_1 + \zeta_2 \zeta_1)} = {\alpha_3 x + \beta_3 y + \gamma_3 \over \delta_3 x + \epsilon_3 y + \zeta_3}.  &lt;/math&gt;

These six coefficients of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; are the same as those obtained through the product

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} \alpha_2 &amp; \beta_2 &amp; \gamma_2 \\
\eta_2 &amp; \theta_2 &amp; \kappa_2 \\
\delta_2 &amp; \epsilon_2 &amp; \zeta_2 \end{bmatrix} 
\begin{bmatrix} \alpha_1 &amp; \beta_1 &amp; \gamma_1 \\
\eta_1 &amp; \theta_1 &amp; \kappa_1 \\
\delta_1 &amp; \epsilon_1 &amp; \zeta_1 \end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix} \alpha_3 &amp; \beta_3 &amp; \gamma_3 \\
\eta_3 &amp; \theta_3 &amp; \kappa_3 \\
\delta_3 &amp; \epsilon_3 &amp; \zeta_3 \end{bmatrix}. \qquad \qquad (16) &lt;/math&gt;

The remaining three coefficients can be verified thus

:&lt;math&gt; T_{3y} = T_{2y} ( T_{1x}, T_{1y} ) = { \eta_2 \left( {\alpha_1 x + \beta_1 y + \gamma_1 \over \delta_1 x + \epsilon_1 y + \zeta_1} \right) + \theta_2 \left( {\eta_1 x + \theta_1 y + \kappa_1 \over \delta_1 x + \epsilon_1 y + \zeta_1} \right) + \kappa_2 \over \delta_2 \left( {\alpha_1 x + \beta_1 y + \gamma_1 \over \delta_1 x + \epsilon_1 y + \zeta_1} \right) + \epsilon_2 \left( {\eta_1 x + \theta_1 y + \kappa_1 \over \delta_1 x + \epsilon_1 y + \zeta_1} \right) + \zeta_2}. &lt;/math&gt;

Multiply numerator and denominator by the same trinomial,

:&lt;math&gt; T_{3y} = {\eta_2 (\alpha_1 x + \beta_1 y + \gamma_1) + \theta_2 (\eta_1 x + \theta_1 y + \kappa_1) + \kappa_2 (\delta_1 x + \epsilon_1 y + \zeta_1) \over \delta_2 (\alpha_1 x + \beta_1 y + \gamma_1) + \epsilon_2 (\eta_1 x + \theta_1 y + \kappa_1) + \zeta_2 (\delta_1 x + \epsilon_1 y + \zeta_1)}. &lt;/math&gt;

Group the coefficients of ''x'', ''y'', and ''1'':

:&lt;math&gt; T_{3x} = { x (\eta_2 \alpha_1 + \theta_2 \eta_1 + \kappa_2 \delta_1) + y (\eta_2 \beta_1 + \theta_2 \theta_1 + \kappa_2 \epsilon_1) + (\eta_2 \gamma_1 + \theta_2 \kappa_1 + \kappa_2 \zeta_1) \over 
x (\delta_2 \alpha_1 + \epsilon_2 \eta_1 + \zeta_2 \delta_1) + y (\delta_2 \beta_1 + \epsilon_2 \theta_1 + \zeta_2 \epsilon_1) + (\delta_2 \gamma_1 + \epsilon_2 \kappa_1 + \zeta_2 \zeta_1)} = {\eta_3 x + \theta_3 y + \kappa_3 \over \delta_3 x + \epsilon_3 y + \zeta_3}.  &lt;/math&gt;

The three remaining coefficients just obtained are the same as those obtained through equation (16). Q.E.D.

== Planar transformations of lines ==
The trilinear transformation given be equations (14) and (15) transforms a straight line

:&lt;math&gt; y = m x + b &lt;/math&gt;

into another straight line

:&lt;math&gt; T_y = n T_x + c &lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' and ''c'' are constants and equal to

:&lt;math&gt; n = {m (\epsilon \kappa - \zeta \theta) + b (\delta \theta - \epsilon \eta) + (\delta \kappa - \zeta \eta) \over m (\epsilon \gamma - \zeta \beta) + b (\delta \beta - \epsilon \alpha) + (\delta \gamma - \zeta \alpha)} &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; c = {m (\beta \kappa - \gamma \theta) + b (\alpha \theta - \beta \eta) + (\alpha \kappa - \gamma \eta) \over m (\beta \zeta - \gamma \epsilon) + b (\alpha \epsilon - \beta \delta) + (\alpha \zeta - \gamma \delta) }. &lt;/math&gt;

=== Proof ===
Given ''y = m x + b'', then plugging this into equations (14) and (15) yields

:&lt;math&gt; T_x = {\alpha x + \beta (m x + b) + \gamma \over \delta x + \epsilon (m x + b) + \zeta} = {(\alpha + \beta m) x + (\beta b + \gamma) \over (\delta + \epsilon m) x + (\epsilon b + \zeta)}, &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; T_y = {(\eta + \theta m) x + (\theta b + \kappa) \over (\delta + \epsilon m) x + (\epsilon b + \zeta) }. &lt;/math&gt;

If ''T&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt; = n T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; + c'' and ''n'' and ''c'' are constants, then

:&lt;math&gt; {\partial T_y \over \partial x} = n {\partial T_x \over \partial x} &lt;/math&gt;

so that

:&lt;math&gt; n = {\partial T_y / \partial x \over \partial T_x / \partial y}. &lt;/math&gt;
Calculation shows that
:&lt;math&gt; {\partial T_x \over \partial x} = { (\epsilon b + \zeta) (\alpha + \beta m) - (\beta b + \gamma) (\delta + \epsilon m) \over [(\delta + \epsilon m) x + (\epsilon b + \zeta)]^2 } &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; {\partial T_y \over \partial x} = { (\epsilon b + \zeta) (\eta + \theta m) - (\theta b + \kappa) (\delta + \epsilon m) \over [(\delta + \epsilon m) x + (\epsilon b + \zeta)]^2 } &lt;/math&gt;

therefore

:&lt;math&gt; n = {\partial T_y / \partial x \over \partial T_x / \partial y} = 
{ (\epsilon b + \zeta) (\eta + \theta m) - (\theta b + \kappa) (\delta + \epsilon m) \over (\epsilon b + \zeta) (\alpha + \beta m) - (\beta b + \gamma) (\delta + \epsilon m) } . &lt;/math&gt;

We should now obtain ''c'' to be

:&lt;math&gt; c = T_y - n T_x &lt;/math&gt;
:::&lt;math&gt; = {(\eta + \theta m) x + (\theta b + \kappa) - \left[ { (\epsilon b + \zeta) (\eta + \theta m) - (\theta b + \kappa) (\delta + \epsilon m) \over (\epsilon b + \zeta) (\alpha + \beta m) - (\beta b + \gamma) (\delta + \epsilon m) } \right] \cdot [ (\alpha + \beta m) x + (\beta b + \gamma) ] \over (\delta + \epsilon m) x + (\epsilon b + \zeta) }. &lt;/math&gt;
Add the two fractions in the numerator:
:&lt;math&gt; c = { \left\{ [(\epsilon b + \zeta) (\alpha + \beta m) - (\beta b + \gamma) (\delta + \epsilon m)] [(\eta + \theta m) x + (\theta b + \kappa)] - [(\epsilon b + \zeta) (\eta + \theta m) - (\theta b + \kappa) (\delta + \epsilon m)] [(\alpha + \beta m) x + (\beta b + \gamma)] \right\}
 \over
 [(\delta + \epsilon m) x + (\epsilon b + \zeta)] [(\epsilon b + \zeta) (\alpha + \beta m) - (\beta b + \gamma) (\delta + \epsilon m)] }. &lt;/math&gt;

Distribute binomials in parentheses in the numerator, then cancel out equal and opposite terms:

:&lt;math&gt; c = { - (\beta b + \gamma) (\delta + \epsilon m) (\eta + \theta m) x + (\epsilon b + \zeta) (\alpha + \beta m) (\theta b + \kappa) + (\theta b + \kappa) (\delta + \epsilon m) (\alpha + \beta m) x - (\epsilon b + \zeta) (\eta + \theta m) (\beta b + \gamma) \over [(\delta + \epsilon m) x + (\epsilon b + \zeta)] [(\epsilon b + \zeta) (\alpha + \beta m) - (\beta b + \gamma) (\delta + \epsilon m)] }. &lt;/math&gt;

Factor the numerator into a pair of terms, only one of them having the ''numerus cossicus'' (''x'').  There is another numerus cossicus in the denominator.  The objective now is to get both of these to cancel out.

:&lt;math&gt; c = { \left\{ [(\theta b + \kappa) (\alpha + \beta m) - (\beta b + \gamma) (\eta + \theta m)] (\delta + \epsilon m) x + [(\alpha + \beta m)(\theta b + \kappa) - (\eta + \theta m) (\beta b + \gamma)] (\epsilon b + \zeta) \right\} \over [(\delta + \epsilon m) x + (\epsilon b + \zeta)] [(\epsilon b + \zeta) (\alpha + \beta m) - (\beta b + \gamma) (\delta + \epsilon m)] }. &lt;/math&gt;

Factor the numerator,

:&lt;math&gt; c = {[(\theta b + \kappa) (\alpha + \beta m) - (\beta b + \gamma) (\eta + \theta m)] [(\delta + \epsilon m) x + (\epsilon b + \zeta)] \over [(\epsilon b + \zeta) (\alpha + \beta m) - (\beta b + \gamma) (\delta + \epsilon m)] [(\delta + \epsilon m) x + (\epsilon b + \zeta)] }. &lt;/math&gt;

The terms with the numeri cossici cancel out, therefore

:&lt;math&gt; c = { (\alpha + \beta m) (\theta b + \kappa) - (\beta b + \gamma) (\eta + \theta m) \over (\alpha + \beta m) (\epsilon b + \zeta) - (\beta b + \gamma) (\delta + \epsilon m) } &lt;/math&gt;
is a constant.  [[Q.E.D.]]

Comparing ''c'' with ''n'', notice that their denominators are the same.  Also, ''n'' is obtained from ''c'' by exchanging the following coefficients:

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha \leftrightarrow \delta, \ \beta \leftrightarrow \epsilon, \ \gamma \leftrightarrow \zeta . &lt;/math&gt;

There is also the following exchange [[symmetry]] between the numerator and denominator of ''n'':

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha \leftrightarrow \eta, \ \beta \leftrightarrow \theta, \ \gamma \leftrightarrow \kappa . &lt;/math&gt;

The numerator and denominator of ''c'' also have exchange symmetry: &lt;math&gt; \{ \eta \leftrightarrow \delta, \ \theta \leftrightarrow \epsilon, \ \kappa \leftrightarrow \zeta \}. &lt;/math&gt;

The exchange symmetry between ''n'' and ''c'' can be [[chunking|chunked]] into binomials:

:&lt;math&gt; n \leftrightarrow c \equiv \{ (\alpha + m \beta ) \leftrightarrow (\delta + m \epsilon ), \ (\gamma + b \beta ) \leftrightarrow (\zeta + b \epsilon ) \}. &lt;/math&gt;

All of these exchange symmetries amount to exchanging pairs of rows in the coefficient matrix.

== Planar transformations of conic sections ==
A trilinear transformation such as ''T'' given by equations (14) and (15) will convert a [[conic section]]
:&lt;math&gt; A x^2 + B y^2 + C x + D y + E x y + F = 0 \qquad \qquad (17) &lt;/math&gt;
into another conic section
:&lt;math&gt; A' T_x^2 + B' T_y^2 + C' T_x + D' T_y + E' T_x T_y + F' = 0. \qquad \qquad (18) &lt;/math&gt;

=== Proof ===
Let there be given a conic section described by equation (17) and a planar transformation ''T'' described by equations (15) and (16) which converts points ''(x,y)'' into points ''(T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;,T&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;)''.

It is possible to find an inverse transformation ''T′'' which converts back points ''(T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;,T&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;)'' to points ''(x,y)''.  This inverse transformation has a coefficient matrix
:&lt;math&gt; M_{T'} = \begin{bmatrix} \alpha' &amp; \beta' &amp; \gamma' \\
\eta' &amp; \theta' &amp; \kappa' \\
\delta' &amp; \epsilon' &amp; \zeta' \end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

Equation (17) can be expressed in terms of the inverse transformation:

:&lt;math&gt; A \left( {\alpha' T_x + \beta' T_y + \gamma' \over \delta' T_x + \epsilon' T_y + \zeta'} \right)^2 + B \left( {\eta' T_x + \theta' T_y + \kappa' \over \delta' T_x + \epsilon' T_y + \zeta'} \right)^2 + C \left( {\alpha' T_x + \beta' T_y + \gamma' \over \delta' T_x + \epsilon' T_y + \zeta'} \right) + D \left( {\eta' T_x + \theta' T_y + \kappa' \over \delta' T_x + \epsilon' T_y + \zeta'} \right) + E \left( {\alpha' T_x + \beta' T_y + \gamma' \over \delta' T_x + \epsilon' T_y + \zeta'} \right) \left( {\eta' T_x + \theta' T_y + \kappa' \over \delta' T_x + \epsilon' T_y + \zeta'} \right) + F = 0. &lt;/math&gt;

The denominators can be &quot;dissolved&quot; by multiplying both sides of the equation by the square of a trinomial:

:&lt;math&gt; A (\alpha' T_x + \beta' T_y + \gamma')^2 + B (\eta' T_x + \theta' T_y + \kappa')^2 + C (\alpha' T_x + \beta' T_y + \gamma') (\delta' T_x + \epsilon' T_y + \zeta') + D (\eta' T_x + \theta' T_y + \kappa') (\delta' T_x + \epsilon' T_y + \zeta') + E (\alpha' T_x + \beta' T_y + \gamma') (\eta' T_x + \theta' T_y + \kappa') + F (\delta' T_x + \epsilon' T_y + \zeta')^2 = 0. &lt;/math&gt;

Expand the products of trinomials and collect common powers of ''T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' and ''T&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'':

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{matrix} 
(A \alpha'^2 + B \eta'^2 + C \alpha' \delta' + D \eta' \delta' + E \alpha' \eta' + F \delta'^2) T_x^2 \\ +
(A \beta'^2 + B \theta'^2 + C \beta' \epsilon' + D \theta' \epsilon' + E \beta' \theta' + F \epsilon'^2) T_y^2 \\ +
(2 A \alpha' \gamma' + 2 B \eta' \kappa' + C (\alpha' \zeta' + \gamma' \delta') + D (\eta' \zeta' + \kappa' \delta') + E (\alpha' \kappa' + \gamma' \eta') + 2 F \delta' \zeta') T_x \\ +
(2 A \beta' \gamma' + 2 B \theta' \kappa' + C (\beta' \zeta' + \gamma' \epsilon') + D (\theta' \zeta' + \kappa' \epsilon') + E (\beta' \kappa' + \gamma' \theta') + 2 F \epsilon' \zeta') T_y \\ +
(2 A \alpha' \beta' + 2 B \eta' \theta' + C (\alpha' \epsilon' + \beta' \delta') + D (\eta' \epsilon' + \theta' \delta') + E (\alpha' \theta' + \beta' \eta') + 2 F \delta' \epsilon') T_x T_y \\ + 
(A \gamma'^2 + B \kappa'^2 + C \gamma' \zeta' + D \kappa' \zeta' + E \gamma' \kappa' + F \zeta'^2) = 0. \end{matrix}  \qquad \qquad (19) &lt;/math&gt;

Equation (19) has the same form as equation (18).

What remains to do is to express the primed coefficients in terms of the unprimed coefficients.  To do this, apply [[Cramer's rule]] to the coefficient matrix ''M&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'' to obtain the primed matrix of the inverse transformation:

:&lt;math&gt; M_{T'} = {1 \over \Delta} \begin{bmatrix} 
\left| \begin{matrix} \theta &amp;\kappa \\ \epsilon &amp; \zeta \end{matrix} \right| &amp;
\left| \begin{matrix} \epsilon &amp; \zeta \\ \beta &amp; \gamma \end{matrix} \right| &amp;
\left| \begin{matrix} \beta &amp; \gamma \\ \theta &amp; \kappa \end{matrix} \right|
\\ \quad &amp; \quad &amp; \quad \\
\left| \begin{matrix} \kappa &amp; \eta \\ \zeta &amp; \delta \end{matrix} \right| &amp;
\left| \begin{matrix} \zeta &amp; \delta \\ \gamma &amp; \alpha \end{matrix} \right| &amp;
\left| \begin{matrix} \gamma &amp; \alpha \\ \kappa &amp; \eta \end{matrix} \right|
\\ \quad &amp; \quad &amp; \quad \\
\left| \begin{matrix} \eta &amp; \theta \\ \delta &amp; \epsilon \end{matrix} \right| &amp;
\left| \begin{matrix} \delta &amp;\epsilon \\ \alpha &amp; \beta \end{matrix} \right| &amp;
\left| \begin{matrix} \alpha &amp; \beta \\ \eta &amp; \theta \end{matrix} \right|
\end{bmatrix} \qquad \qquad (20) &lt;/math&gt;
where ''Δ'' is the determinant of the unprimed coefficient matrix.

Equation (20) allows primed coefficients to be expressed in terms of unprimed coefficients.  But performing these substitutions on the primed coefficients of equation (19) it can be noticed that the determinant ''Δ'' cancels itself out, so that it can be ignored altogether.  
Therefore
:&lt;math&gt; A' = A (\theta \zeta - \kappa \epsilon)^2
+ B (\kappa \delta - \eta \zeta)^2
+ C (\theta \zeta - \kappa \epsilon) (\eta \epsilon - \theta \delta)
+ D (\kappa \delta - \eta \zeta) (\eta \epsilon - \theta \delta)
+ E (\theta \zeta - \kappa \epsilon) (\kappa \delta - \eta \zeta)

The coefficients of the transformed conic have been expressed in terms of the coefficients of the original conic and the coefficients of the planar transformation ''T''.  Q.E.D.

== Planar projectivities and cross-ratio ==
Let four points ''A'', ''B'', ''C'', ''D'' be collinear.  Let there be a planar projectivity ''T'' which transforms these points into points ''A′'', ''B′'', ''C′'', and ''D′''.  It was already shown that lines are transformed into lines, so that the transformed points ''A′'' through ''D′'' will also be collinear.  Then it will turn out that the cross-ratio of the original four points is the same as the cross-ratio of their transforms:
:&lt;math&gt; [A \ B \ C \ D] = [A' \ B' \ C' \ D']. &lt;/math&gt;

=== Proof ===
If the two-dimensional coordinates of four points are known, and if the four points are collinear, then their cross-ratio can be found from their [[abscissa]]s alone.  It is possible to project the points onto a horizontal line by means of a [[pencil (projective geometry)|pencil]] of vertical lines issuing from a point on the [[line at infinity]]:
:&lt;math&gt; [A \ B \ C \ D] = [A_x \ B_x \ C_x \ D_x]. &lt;/math&gt;
The same is true for the [[ordinate]]s of the points.  The reason is that any mere rescaling of the coordinates of the points does not change the cross-ratio.  

Let
:&lt;math&gt; A : (x_1, m x_1 + b), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; B : (x_2, m x_2 + b), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; C : (x_3, m x_3 + b), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; D : (x_4, m x_4 + b). &lt;/math&gt;

Clearly these four points are collinear.  Let

:&lt;math&gt; T_x (x,y) = {\alpha x + \beta y + \gamma \over \delta x + \epsilon y + \zeta} &lt;/math&gt;

be the first half of a trilinear transformation.  Then

:&lt;math&gt; T_x(A) = {\alpha x_1 + \beta (m x_1 + b) + \gamma \over \delta x_1 + \epsilon (m x_1 + b) + \zeta} = {(\alpha + \beta m) x_1 + (\beta b + \gamma) \over (\delta + \epsilon m) x_1 + (\epsilon b + \zeta)}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; T_x(B) = {\alpha x_2 + \beta (m x_2 + b) + \gamma \over \delta x_2 + \epsilon (m x_2 + b) + \zeta} = {(\alpha + \beta m) x_2 + (\beta b + \gamma) \over (\delta + \epsilon m) x_2 + (\epsilon b + \zeta)}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; T_x(C) = {\alpha x_3 + \beta (m x_3 + b) + \gamma \over \delta x_3 + \epsilon (m x_3 + b) + \zeta} = {(\alpha + \beta m) x_3 + (\beta b + \gamma) \over (\delta + \epsilon m) x_3 + (\epsilon b + \zeta)}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; T_x(D) = {\alpha x_4 + \beta (m x_4 + b) + \gamma \over \delta x_4 + \epsilon (m x_4 + b) + \zeta} = {(\alpha + \beta m) x_4 + (\beta b + \gamma) \over (\delta + \epsilon m) x_4 + (\epsilon b + \zeta)}. &lt;/math&gt;

The original cross-ratio is

:&lt;math&gt; [x_1 \ x_2 \ x_3 \ x_4] = {x_1 - x_3 \over x_1 - x_4} \cdot {x_2 - x_4 \over x_2 - x_3}. &lt;/math&gt;

It is not necessary to calculate the transformed cross-ratio.  Just let

:&lt;math&gt; S(x) = {(\alpha + \beta m) x + (\beta b + \gamma) \over (\delta + \epsilon m) x + (\epsilon b + \zeta)} &lt;/math&gt;

be a bilinear transformation.  Then ''S(x)'' is a one-dimensional projective transformation.  But ''T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;(A)=S(A)'', ''T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;(B)=S(B)'', ''T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;(C)=S(C)'', and ''T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;(D)=S(D)''.  Therefore

:&lt;math&gt; [T_x(A) \ T_x(B) \ T_x(C) \ T_x(D)] = [S(A) \ S(B) \ S(C) \ S(D)] &lt;/math&gt;

but it has already been shown that bilinear fractional transformations preserve cross-ratio.  Q.E.D.

== Example ==
The following is a rather simple example of a planar projectivity:
:&lt;math&gt; T_x = {1 \over x}, \qquad T_y = {y \over x}. &lt;/math&gt;
The coefficient matrix of this projectivity ''T'' is
:&lt;math&gt; M_T = \begin{bmatrix} 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \\
1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;
and it is easy to verify that ''M&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;'' is its own [[inverse]].

The [[locus (mathematics)|locus]] of points described parametrically as &lt;math&gt; ( \cos \theta, \,  \sin \theta ) &lt;/math&gt; describe a [[circle]], due to the [[trigonometric identity]]
:&lt;math&gt; \cos^2 \theta + \sin^2 \theta = 1 &lt;/math&gt;
which has the same form as the canonical equation of a circle.  Applying the projectivity ''T'' yields the locus of points described parametrically by &lt;math&gt; (\sec \theta,\,  \tan \theta) &lt;/math&gt; which describe a [[hyperbola]], due to the trigonometric identity
:&lt;math&gt; \sec^2 \theta - \tan^2 \theta = 1 &lt;/math&gt;
which has the same form as the canonical equation of a hyperbola.  Notice that points &lt;math&gt; (~-1,0) &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(1,0)&lt;/math&gt; are fixed points.

Indeed, this projectivity transforms any circle, of any radius, into a hyperbola centered at the origin with both of its [[Focus (geometry)|foci]] lying on the ''x''-axis, and vice versa.  This projectivity also transforms the ''y''-axis into the [[line at infinity]], and vice versa:
:&lt;math&gt; T : (0, y) \rightarrow \left( {1 \over 0}, {y \over 0} \right) = (\pm \infty, \pm \infty), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; T: (\pm \infty, \pm \infty) \rightarrow  \left( {1 \over \pm \infty}, {\pm \infty \over \pm \infty} \right) = (0, y). &lt;/math&gt;
The ratio of [[infinity]] over infinity is indeterminate which means that it can be set to any value ''y'' desired.

This example emphasizes that in the real projective plane, ''RP²'', a hyperbola is a closed curve which passes twice through the line at infinity.  But what does the transformation do to a [[parabola]]?

Let the locus of points &lt;math&gt; (x,x^2) &lt;/math&gt; describe a parabola.  Its transformation is
:&lt;math&gt; T : (x,x^2) \rightarrow \left( {1 \over x}, {x^2 \over x} \right) = (x', 1/x') &lt;/math&gt;
which is a hyperbola whose [[asymptote]]s are the ''x''-axis and the ''y''-axis and whose wings lie in the first [[quadrant]] and the third quadrant.  Likewise, the hyperbola
:&lt;math&gt; y = {1 \over x} &lt;/math&gt;
is transformed by ''T'' into the parabola
:&lt;math&gt; y = x^2 \quad &lt;/math&gt;.

On the other hand, the parabola described by the locus of points &lt;math&gt; (x, \pm \sqrt{x}) &lt;/math&gt; is transformed by ''T'' into itself: this demonstrates that a parabola intersects the line at infinity at a single point.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Three-dimensional transformations can be defined synthetically as follows: point ''X'' on a &quot;subjective&quot; 3-space must be transformed to a point ''T'' also on the subjective space. The transformations uses these elements: a pair of &quot;observation points&quot; ''P'' and ''Q'', and an &quot;objective&quot; 3-space. The subjective and objective spaces and the two points all lie in four-dimensional space, and the two 3-spaces can intersect at some plane.  

Draw line ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; through points ''X'' and ''P''. This line intersects the objective space at point ''R''. Draw line ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through points ''R'' and ''Q''. Line ''l&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'' intersects the projective plane at point ''T''. Then ''T'' is the transform of ''X''.

== Analysis ==
Let
:&lt;math&gt; X : (x,y,z,0), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; T : (T_x,T_y,T_z,0), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; P : (P_x,P_y,P_z,P_t), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; Q : (Q_x,Q_y,Q_z,Q_t). &lt;/math&gt;
Let there be an &quot;objective&quot; 3-space described by
:&lt;math&gt; t = f(x,y,z) = m x + n y + k z + b &lt;/math&gt;

Draw line ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; through points ''P'' and ''X''.  This line intersects the objective plane at ''R''.  This intersection can be described parametrically as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; (1 - \lambda_1) X + \lambda_1 P = (R_x,R_y,R_z,m R_x + n R_y + k R_z + b). &lt;/math&gt;

This implies the following four equations:

:&lt;math&gt; R_x = x + \lambda_1 (P_x - x) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; R_y = y + \lambda_1 (P_y - y) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; R_z = z + \lambda_1 (P_z - z) &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; R_t = \lambda_1 P_t = m R_x + n R_y + k R_z + b &lt;/math&gt;

Substitute the first three equations into the last one:

:&lt;math&gt; (m x + n y + k z) + \lambda_1 (m P_x + n P_y + k P_z - m x - n y - k z - P_t) + b = 0 &lt;/math&gt;

Solve for ''λ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'',

:&lt;math&gt; \lambda_1 = {-(b + m x + n y + k z) \over m (P_x - x) + n (P_y - y) + k (P_z - z) - P_t} = {\lambda_{1N} \over \lambda_{1D}}. &lt;/math&gt;

Draw line ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through points ''R'' and ''Q''.  This line intersects the subjective 3-space at ''T''.  This intersection can be represented parametrically as follows:

:&lt;math&gt; (1 - \lambda_2) R + \lambda_2 Q = (T_x,T_y,T_z,0) &lt;/math&gt;

This implies the following four equations:

:&lt;math&gt; T_x = R_x + \lambda_2 (Q_x - R_x), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; T_y = R_y + \lambda_2 (Q_y - R_y), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; T_z = R_z + \lambda_2 (Q_z - R_z), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; R_t + \lambda_2 (Q_t - R_t) = 0. &lt;/math&gt;

The last equation can be solved for ''λ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;'',

:&lt;math&gt; \lambda_2 = {R_t \over R_t - Q_t} &lt;/math&gt;

which can then be substituted into the other three equations:

:&lt;math&gt; T_x = R_x + R_t {Q_x - R_x \over R_t - Q_t} = {R_t Q_x - R_x Q_t \over R_t - Q_t}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; T_y = R_y + R_t {Q_y - R_y \over R_t - Q_t} = {R_t Q_y - R_y Q_t \over R_t - Q_t}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; T_z = R_z + R_t {Q_z - R_z \over R_t - Q_t} = {R_t Q_z - R_z Q_t \over R_t - Q_t}. &lt;/math&gt;

Substitute the values for ''R&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''R&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''R&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''R&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;'' obtained from the first intersection into the above equations for ''T&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''T&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'', and ''T&lt;sub&gt;z&lt;/sub&gt;'',

:&lt;math&gt; T_x = {\lambda_1 P_t Q_x - [x + \lambda_1 (P_x - x)] Q_t \over \lambda_1 P_t - Q_t} = {\lambda_1 [P_t Q_x - Q_t (P_x - x)] - x Q_t \over \lambda_1 P_t - Q_t}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; T_y = {\lambda_1 P_t Q_y - [y + \lambda_1 (P_y - y)] Q_t \over \lambda_1 P_t - Q_t} = {\lambda_1 [P_t Q_y - Q_t (P_y - y)] - y Q_t \over \lambda_1 P_t - Q_t}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; T_z = {\lambda_1 P_t Q_z - [z + \lambda_1 (P_z - z)] Q_t \over \lambda_1 P_t - Q_t} = {\lambda_1 [P_t Q_z - Q_t (P_z - z)] - z Q_t \over \lambda_1 P_t - Q_t}. &lt;/math&gt;

Multiply both numerators and denominators of the above three equations by the denominator of lambda&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;: λ&lt;sub&gt;1D&lt;/sub&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt; T_x = {\lambda_{1N} [P_t Q_x - Q_t (P_x - x)] - x Q_t \lambda_{1D} \over P_t \lambda_{1N} - Q_t \lambda_{1D} }, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; T_y = {\lambda_{1N} [P_t Q_y - Q_t (P_y - y)] - y Q_t \lambda_{1D} \over P_t \lambda_{1N} - Q_t \lambda_{1D} }, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; T_z = {\lambda_{1N} [P_t Q_z - Q_t (P_z - z)] - z Q_t \lambda_{1D} \over P_t \lambda_{1N} - Q_t \lambda_{1D} }, &lt;/math&gt;

Plug in the values of the numerator and denominator of lambda&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt; \lambda_{1N} = b + m x + n y + k z &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda_{1D} = P_t + m (x - P_x) + n (y - P_y) + k (z - P_z) &lt;/math&gt;

to obtain

:&lt;math&gt; T_x = {T_{xN} \over T_{xD}} = {(b + m x + n y + k z) [P_t Q_x - Q_t (P_x - x)] - x Q_t [P_t + m (x - P_x) + n (y - P_y) + k (z - P_z)] \over P_t (b + m x + n y + k z) - Q_t [P_t + m (x - P_x) + n (y - P_y) + k (z - P_z)]}. &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; T_y = {T_{yN} \over T_{xD}} &lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt; T_{yN} = (b + m x + n y + k z) [P_t Q_y - Q_t (P_y - y)] - y Q_t [P_t + m (x - P_x) + n (y - P_y) + k (z - P_z)], &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; T_z = {T_{zN} \over T_{xD}} &lt;/math&gt;.

The numerator ''T&lt;sub&gt;xN&lt;/sub&gt;'' can be expanded.  It will be found that second-degree terms of ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' will cancel each other out.  Then collecting terms with common ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' yields

:&lt;math&gt; T_{xN} = x (m P_t Q_x + n P_y Q_t + k P_z Q_t + Q_t (b - P_t)) + y n (P_t Q_x - P_x Q_t) + z k (P_t Q_x - P_x Q_t) + b (P_t Q_x - P_x Q_t) &lt;/math&gt;

Likewise, the denominator becomes

:&lt;math&gt; T_{xD} = (m x + n y + k z) (P_t - Q_t) + (m P_x + n P_y + k P_z) Q_t + P_t (b - Q_t). &lt;/math&gt;

The numerator ''T&lt;sub&gt;yN&lt;/sub&gt;'', when expanded and then simplified, becomes

:&lt;math&gt; T_{yN} = x m (P_t Q_y - P_y Q_t) + y (m P_x Q_t + n P_t Q_y + k P_z Q_t + Q_t (b - P_t)) + z k (P_t Q_y - P_y Q_t) + b (P_t Q_y - P_y Q_t). &lt;/math&gt;

Likewise, the numerator ''T&lt;sub&gt;zN&lt;/sub&gt;'' becomes

:&lt;math&gt; T_{zN} = x m (P_t Q_z - P_z Q_t) + y n (P_t Q_z - P_z Q_t) + z (m P_x Q_t + n P_y Q_t + k P_t Q_z + Q_t (b - P_t)) + b (P_t Q_z - P_z Q_t). &lt;/math&gt;

== Quadrilinear fractional transformations ==
Let

:&lt;math&gt; \alpha = m P_t Q_x + n P_y Q_t + k P_z Q_t + Q_t (b - P_t), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \beta = n (P_t Q_x - P_x Q_t), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \gamma = k (P_t Q_x - P_x Q_t), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \delta = b (P_t Q_x - P_x Q_t), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \epsilon = m (P_t - Q_t), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \zeta = n (P_t - Q_t), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \eta = k (P_t - Q_t), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \theta = (m P_x + n P_y + k P_z) Q_t + P_t (b - Q_t), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \iota = m (P_t Q_y - P_y Q_t), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \kappa = m P_x Q_t + n P_t Q_y + k P_z Q_t + Q_t (b - P_t), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \lambda = k (P_t Q_y - P_y Q_t), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \mu = b (P_t Q_y - P_y Q_t), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \nu = m (P_t Q_z - P_z Q_t), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \xi = n (P_t Q_z - P_z Q_t), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; o = m P_x Q_t + n P_y Q_t + k P_t Q_z + Q_t (b - P_t), &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; \rho = b (P_t Q_z - P_z Q_t). &lt;/math&gt;

Then the transformation in 3-space can be expressed as follows,

:&lt;math&gt; T_x = {\alpha x + \beta y + \gamma z + \delta \over \epsilon x + \zeta y + \eta z + \theta}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; T_y = {\iota x + \kappa y + \lambda z + \mu \over \epsilon x + \zeta y + \eta z + \theta}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; T_z = {\nu x + \xi y + o z + \rho \over \epsilon x + \zeta y + \eta z + \theta}. &lt;/math&gt;

The sixteen coefficients of this transformation can be arranged in a coefficient matrix

:&lt;math&gt; M_T = \begin{bmatrix} \alpha &amp; \beta &amp; \gamma &amp; \delta \\
\iota &amp; \kappa &amp; \lambda &amp; \mu \\
\nu &amp; \xi &amp; o &amp; \rho \\
\epsilon &amp; \zeta &amp; \eta &amp; \theta \end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

Whenever this matrix is invertible, its coefficients will describe a quadrilinear fractional transformation.

Transformation ''T'' in 3-space can also be represented in terms of [[homogeneous coordinates]] as

:&lt;math&gt; T : [x : y : z : 1] \rightarrow [\alpha x + \beta y + \gamma z + \delta : \iota x + \kappa y + \lambda z + \mu : \nu x + \xi y + o z + \rho : \epsilon x + \zeta y + \eta z + \theta ]. &lt;/math&gt;

This means that the coefficient matrix of ''T'' can operate directly on 4-component vectors of homogeneous coordinates.  Transformation of a point can be effected simply by multiplying the coefficient matrix with the position vector of the point in homogeneous coordinates.  Therefore, if ''T'' transforms a point on the [[plane at infinity]], the result will be

:&lt;math&gt; T : [x : y : z : 0] \rightarrow [\alpha x + \beta y + \gamma z : \iota x + \kappa y + \lambda z : \nu x + \xi y + o z : \epsilon x + \zeta y + \eta z ]. &lt;/math&gt;

If ε, ζ, and η are not all equal to zero, then ''T'' will transform the plane at infinity into a locus of points which lie mostly in affine space.  If ε, ζ, and η are all zero, then ''T'' will be a special kind of projective transformation called an [[affine transformation|'''affine transformation''']], which transforms affine points into affine points and ideal points (i.e. points at infinity) into ideal points.

The group of affine transformations has a subgroup of affine [[coordinate rotation|rotations]] whose matrices have the form

:&lt;math&gt; M_{AR} = \begin{bmatrix} \alpha &amp; \beta &amp; \gamma &amp; 0 \\
\iota &amp; \kappa &amp; \lambda &amp; 0 \\
\nu &amp; \xi &amp; o &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;
such that the submatrix
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} \alpha &amp; \beta &amp; \gamma \\
\iota &amp; \kappa &amp; \lambda \\
\nu &amp; \xi &amp; o \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;
is [[orthogonal matrix|orthogonal]].

== Properties of quadrilinear fractional transformations ==
Given a pair of quadrilinear fractional transformations ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''T''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, whose coefficient matrices are &lt;math&gt; M_{T_1} &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; M_{T_2} &lt;/math&gt;, then the composition of these pair of transformations is another quadrilinear transformation ''T''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; whose coefficient matrix &lt;math&gt; M_{T_3} &lt;/math&gt; is equal to the product of the first and second coefficient matrices,

:&lt;math&gt; (T_3 = T_2 \circ T_1) \leftrightarrow (M_{T_3} = M_{T_2} M_{T_1}). &lt;/math&gt;

The identity quadrilinear  fractional transformation ''T&lt;sub&gt;I&lt;/sub&gt;'' is the transformation whose coefficient matrix is the [[identity matrix]].

Given a spatial projectivity ''T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;'' whose coefficient matrix is &lt;math&gt; M_{T_1} &lt;/math&gt;, the inverse of this projectivity is another projectivity ''T''&lt;sub&gt;−1&lt;/sub&gt; whose coefficient matrix &lt;math&gt; M_{T_{-1}} &lt;/math&gt; is the inverse of ''T''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;′s coefficient matrix,

:&lt;math&gt; (T_{-1} \circ T_1 = T_I) \leftrightarrow (M_{T_{-1}} M_{T_1} = I) &lt;/math&gt;.

Composition of quadrilinear transformations is associative, therefore the set of all quadrilinear transformations, together with the operation of composition, form a [[group (mathematics)|group]].

This group of quadrilinear transformations contains subgroups of trilinear transformations.  For example, the subgroup of all quadrilinear transformations whose coefficient matrices have the form

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} \alpha &amp; \beta &amp; 0 &amp; \delta \\
\iota &amp; \kappa &amp; 0 &amp; \mu \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
\epsilon &amp; \zeta &amp; 0 &amp; \theta \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

is isomorphic to the group of all trilinear transformations whose coefficient matrices are

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} \alpha &amp; \beta &amp; \delta \\
\iota &amp; \kappa &amp; \mu \\
\epsilon &amp; \zeta &amp; \theta \end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

This subgroup of quadrilinear transformations all have the form

:&lt;math&gt; T : (x, y, z) \rightarrow \left( {\alpha x + \beta y + \delta \over \epsilon x + \zeta y + \theta} , {\iota x + \kappa y + \mu \over \epsilon x + \zeta y + \theta}, 0 \right). &lt;/math&gt;

This means that this subgroup of transformations will act on the plane ''z = 0'' just like a group of trilinear transformations.

== Spatial transformations of planes ==
Projective transformations in 3-space transform planes into planes.  This can be demonstrated more easily using homogeneous coordinates.

Let

:&lt;math&gt; z = m x + n y + b &lt;/math&gt;

be the equation of a plane.  This is equivalent to

:&lt;math&gt; m x + n y - z + b = 0. \qquad \qquad (21) &lt;/math&gt;

Equation (21) can be expressed as a matrix product:

:&lt;math&gt; [m \ n \ -1 \ b] \begin{bmatrix} x \\
. \ . \\
y \\
. \ . \\
z \\
. \ . \\
1 \end{bmatrix} = 0. &lt;/math&gt;

A [[/Permutation|permutation]] matrix can be interposed between the two vectors, in order to make the plane vector have homogeneous coordinates:

:&lt;math&gt; [ m : n : b : 1 ] \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
\ &amp; \ &amp; \ &amp; \ \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
\ &amp; \ &amp; \ &amp; \ \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\ &amp; \ &amp; \ &amp; \ \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x \\
. \ . \\
y \\
. \ . \\
z \\
. \ . \\
1 \end{bmatrix} = 0. \qquad \qquad (22) &lt;/math&gt;

A quadrilinear transformation should convert this to

:&lt;math&gt; [ T_m : T_n : T_b : 1 ] \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
\ &amp; \ &amp; \ &amp; \ \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
\ &amp; \ &amp; \ &amp; \ \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
\ &amp; \ &amp; \ &amp; \ \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} T_x \\
. \ . \\
T_y \\
. \ . \\
T_z \\
. \ . \\
1 \end{bmatrix} = 0 \qquad \qquad (23) &lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} T_x \\
. \ . \\
T_y \\
. \ . \\
T_z \\
. \ . \\
1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \alpha &amp; \beta &amp; \gamma &amp; \delta \\
\ &amp; \ &amp; \ &amp; \ \\
\iota &amp; \kappa &amp; \lambda &amp; \mu \\
\ &amp; \ &amp; \ &amp; \ \\
\nu &amp; \xi &amp; o &amp; \rho \\
\ &amp; \ &amp; \ &amp; \ \\
\epsilon &amp; \zeta &amp; \eta &amp; \theta \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} x \\
. \ . \\
y \\
. \ . \\
z \\
. \ . \\
1 \end{bmatrix}. \qquad \qquad (24) &lt;/math&gt;

Equation (22) is equivalent to
&lt;math&gt; [ m : n : b : 1 ] \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} \bar{\alpha} &amp; \bar{\iota} &amp; \bar{\nu} &amp; \bar{\epsilon} \\
\bar{\beta} &amp; \bar{\kappa} &amp; \bar{\xi} &amp; \bar{\zeta} \\
\bar{\gamma} &amp; \bar{\lambda} &amp; \bar{o} &amp; \bar{\eta} \\
\bar{\delta} &amp; \bar{\mu} &amp; \bar{\rho} &amp; \bar{\theta} \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} \alpha &amp; \beta &amp; \gamma &amp; \delta \\
\iota &amp; \kappa &amp; \lambda &amp; \mu \\
\nu &amp; \xi &amp; o &amp; \rho \\
\epsilon &amp; \zeta &amp; \eta &amp; \theta \end{bmatrix}  
\begin{bmatrix} x \\
. \ . \\
y \\
. \ . \\
z \\
. \ . \\
1 \end{bmatrix} = 0 \qquad \qquad (25) &lt;/math&gt;
where
:&lt;math&gt; \bar{\alpha} = \left| \begin{matrix} \kappa &amp; \lambda &amp; \mu \\
\xi &amp; o &amp; \rho \\
\zeta &amp; \eta &amp; \theta \end{matrix} \right| ; \qquad
\bar{\beta} = \left| \begin{matrix} \lambda &amp; \mu &amp; \iota \\
o &amp; \rho &amp; \nu \\
\eta &amp; \theta &amp; \epsilon \end{matrix} \right|, &lt;/math&gt; etc.

Applying equation (24) to equation (25) yields

:&lt;math&gt; [ m : n : b : 1 ] \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} \bar{\alpha} &amp; \bar{\iota} &amp; \bar{\nu} &amp; \bar{\epsilon} \\
\bar{\beta} &amp; \bar{\kappa} &amp; \bar{\xi} &amp; \bar{\zeta} \\
\bar{\gamma} &amp; \bar{\lambda} &amp; \bar{o} &amp; \bar{\eta} \\
\bar{\delta} &amp; \bar{\mu} &amp; \bar{\rho} &amp; \bar{\theta} \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} T_x \\
. \ . \\
T_y \\
. \ . \\
T_z \\
. \ . \\
1 \end{bmatrix} = 0. \qquad \qquad (26) &lt;/math&gt;
Combining equations (26) and (23) produces
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} \bar{\alpha} &amp; \bar{\beta} &amp; \bar{\gamma} &amp; \bar{\delta} \\
\bar{\iota} &amp; \bar{\kappa} &amp; \bar{\lambda} &amp; \bar{\mu} \\
\bar{\nu} &amp; \bar{\xi} &amp; \bar{o} &amp; \bar{\rho} \\
\bar{\epsilon} &amp; \bar{\zeta} &amp; \bar{\eta} &amp; \bar{\theta} \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} m \\
. \ . \\
n \\
. \ . \\
b \\
. \ . \\
1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 0 &amp; -1 \\
0 &amp; 0 &amp; 1 &amp; 0 \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} T_m \\
. \ . \\
T_n \\
. \ . \\
T_b \\
. \ . \\
1 \end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;
Solve for &lt;math&gt; [ T_m : T_n : T_b : 1 ]^T &lt;/math&gt;,
:&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} T_m \\
. \ . \\
T_n \\
. \ . \\
T_b \\
. \ . \\
1 \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} \bar{\alpha} &amp; \bar{\beta} &amp; \bar{\delta} &amp; -\bar{\gamma} \\
\bar{\iota} &amp; \bar{\kappa} &amp; \bar{\mu} &amp; -\bar{\lambda} \\
\bar{\epsilon} &amp; \bar{\zeta} &amp; \bar{\theta} &amp; -\bar{\eta} \\
-\bar{\nu} &amp; -\bar{\xi} &amp; -\bar{\rho} &amp; \bar{o} \end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} m \\
. \ . \\
n \\
. \ . \\
b \\
. \ . \\
1 \end{bmatrix}.  \qquad \qquad (27) &lt;/math&gt;

Equation (27) describes how 3-space transformations convert a plane (''m'', ''n'', ''b'') into another plane (''T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;, T&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, T&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt;'') where

:&lt;math&gt; T_m = {\bar{\alpha} m + \bar{\beta} n + \bar{\delta} b - \bar{\gamma} \over - \bar{\nu} m - \bar{\xi} n - \bar{\rho} b + \bar{o}}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; T_n = {\bar{\iota} m + \bar{\kappa} n + \bar{\mu} b - \bar{\lambda} \over - \bar{\nu} m - \bar{\xi} n - \bar{\rho} b + \bar{o}}, &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; T_b = {\bar{\epsilon} m + \bar{\zeta} n + \bar{\theta} b - \bar{\eta} \over - \bar{\nu} m - \bar{\xi} n - \bar{\rho} b + \bar{o}}. &lt;/math&gt;

A '''Hindu temple''' is a place of worship for followers of Hinduism. It can be a separate structure or a part of a building. A feature of most temples is the presence of ''murtis'' of the Hindu deity to whom the temple is dedicated. They are usually dedicated to one primary deity, called the presiding deity, and other subordinate deities associated with the main deity. However, some temples are dedicated to several deities, and some have symbols instead of a ''murti''.

==Nomenclature==
Hindu  temples are known by different names in different parts of the world, depending upon the language. The word ''mandir'' or ''mandira'' is used in many languages, including Hindi, and is derived from a Sanskrit word, ''mandira'', for 'house' (of a deity by implication).  Temples are known as ''Devasthana or Gudi'' in Kannada, as ''Gudi, Devalayam or Kovela'' in Telugu and ''Mondir'' (মন্দির) in Bengali, as ''Kshetram or Ambalam'' in Malayalam, as &quot;Kovil&quot; or &quot;devasthanam&quot; in Tamil.

==History==
Temple construction in India started nearly 2000 years ago. The oldest temples that were built of brick and wood no longer exist. Stone later became the preferred material. Temples marked the transition of Hinduism from the Vedic religion of ritual sacrifices to a religion of Bhakti or love and devotion to a personal deity. Temple construction and mode of worship is governed by ancient Sanskrit scriptures called agamas, of which there are several, which deal with individual deities. There are substantial differences in architecture, customs, rituals and traditions between temples in different parts of India. South India is very different from the north. Hundreds, if not thousands, of ancient temples were destroyed during Islamic rule in India (especially in North India) between 1200 CE and 1700 CE. South India therefore has more large temples still standing.

During the ritual consecration of a temple, the presence of the universal all-encompassing Brahman, is invoked into the main stone deity of the temple, through ritual, thereby making the deity and the temple sacred and divine.

==North Indian Temples==
[[File:Kedarnath Temple.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Kedarnath Temple dedicated to Shiva, in Kedarnath, Uttarakhand]]
[[File:Hindu Temple at Tilla Gogian.jpg|thumb|left|Tilla Jogian, Pakistan]]
Many of the grand ancient temples of the north no longer exist. Many were destroyed by Muslim invaders. However some ancient beautiful temples still survive in remote places such as Kajuraho, Orissa, Rajasthan etc. Many new large temples have been built in the last 100 years. Most North Indian temples however, are simple small structures meant for the needs of the local people. During the period of Islamic rule from the 12th to the 17th century, the temples lost their zeal for elaborate and expensive rituals and in most temples in North India, the rituals are very simple in contrast to the elaborate rituals of South Indian temples. Also North Indian temples tend to be less orthodox and in many cases all are permitted to enter the innermost sanctum of the deity and worship the deity personally. In such cases, the deity will not be adorned with valuable jewellery.
The innermost heart of the temple is the sanctum where the deity (usually of fixed stone) is present, followed by a large hall for lay worshippers to stand in and obtain &quot;darshan&quot; or divine audience. There may or may not be many more surrounding corridors, halls, etc. However there will be space for devotees to go around the temple in clock wise fashion as a mark of respect. In North Indian temples, the tallest towers are built over the sanctum sanctorum.

== South Indian Temples ==
[[File:Illuminated temple in the evening.JPG|right|200px|thumb|Temple in Kerala]]
[[File:Brihadishwara Temple at Sunset - Thanjavur - India 02.JPG|thumb|left|Brihadeshwara temple complex in Tanjore, Tamil Nadu]]
Many large ''bannabs'' (grand stone temples) still stand in South India. Ritual tends to be orthodox and elaborate especially in the large vedic brahmincal temples, which follow the pan-Indian Sanskrit ''agama'' scriptural traditions. Apart from the main fixed stone deities, processional deities made of ''panchaloha'' (an alloy of 5 metals - gold, silver, copper, zinc and tin) are bathed, dressed, decorated with valuables and are taken out in processions for various festivals throughout the year. The richer the temple, the more elaborate the festivals. 

==Temples in other parts of India==
Temples often greatly vary in their architecture, rituals, traditions, festivals and customs from region to region. Temples in eastern and western India also have their distinctions. In the south, Kerala temples are very different from temples in other states.

==Temples in Bengal==
[[File:Kolkatatemple.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Dakshineswar Kali Temple, Kolkata]].
In Bengal, temple architecture has assumed a unique identity due to the lack of suitable stone. In the alluvial Gangetic delta, the temple makers had to resort to other materials instead of stone. This gave rise to the practice of using terra-cotta as a medium for temple construction. Terra-cotta exteriors with rich carvings are a unique feature of Bengali temples. The town of Vishnupur in Bengal is renowned for this type of architecture. 

Usually a part of the intended total motif was carved by hand on one side of a brick and then baked. While under construction, these carved bricks were arranged to make up the entire motif.

The Bengali style of temple is not luxurious. Rather, most are modeled on the simple thatched-roof earthen hut built by Bengalis. This can be attributed to the popularity of bhakti cults which taught people to view gods as close to themselves. Thus, various styles like ''do-chala'', ''char-chala'', and ''aat-chala'' sprang up. However, there is also a popular style of building known as Navaratna (nine-towered) or Pancharatna (five-towered) in Bengal which is more luxurious than the Chala buildings. A typical example of Navaratna style is the Dakshineswar Kali Temple.

==Customs and etiquette==
[[Image:Pattadakal Virupaksha Temple.jpg|thumb|Virupaksha temple, Pattadakal, built in 740 in Dravidian style]]
[[Image:Angkor-Wat-from-the-air.JPG|thumb|An aerial view of the Angkor Wat temple complex in Cambodia]]
The customs and etiquette associated with Hindu temples have a long history and are filled with symbolism, solemn respect and veneration of Brahma's creation.

Visitors and worshipers to Hindu temples are required to remove their shoes and other footwear before entering. Most temples have an designated area to store footwear.

The Hindu religion teaches that all life-forms are created by Brahma and that mankind must share the world with the animal kingdom. It is common to see stray dogs, sacred cows and various species of birds at temples. 

Worshipers in major temples typically bring symbolic offerings for the prayer or 'puja'. This includes fruits, flowers, sweets and other symbols of the bounty of the natural world. Temples in India are typically surrounded by small stores called 'dukan' in Hindi, they sell offerings usually wrapped up in organic material such as banana leaves.
[[File:Sri Siva Vishnu Temple.jpg|thumb|left|Sri Siva Vishnu Temple in Lanham, Maryland, United States.]]
When inside the temple, visitors are expected to keep both hands folded together as a sign of respect. The worshipers approach the inner sanctum, recite sacred Sanskrit verses called 'mantras', follow the instructions of the priest called the 'pujari', meditate &amp; pray called 'puja' and present the offerings to the feet of the God-form, 'the murthy' symbolising total submission and immersion into the All Loving Being. The 'murthy' is typically placed on a 'mandap' or pedestal surrounded by beautiful offerings such as colorful cloths, flowers, incense sticks or 'agarbati' and sounds such as from a conch or large bells.

The mantras you utter are typically words like &quot;Om Namo Narayana&quot; or &quot;Om Namah Shivaya&quot; which means &quot;Obeisance to Narayana( vishnu)&quot; or &quot;Salutations to Shiva&quot;. These are followed by a series of shlokas or verses from the holy texts such as the Bhagavad Gita, Upanishads or Vedas. Upon the conclusion of the prayer, devotees get down on their knees or even fall flat on their stomach and bow before the symbol of the All Loving Being and mentally state whatever is felt in their hearts.  If a priest or 'Pujari' is present, he is likely to provide sacred food that he has blessed called 'Prasad' to the devotee. The food itself was offered to the deity by a devotee, is blessed by the Pujari and then offered back to the congregation. The ritual follows the Eastern rules of hospitality with the deity as revered guest. He may also apply a holy red mark called ' Tilak ' to the forehead of the devotee symbolising blessings. Visitors to famous temples often feel inner joy, harmony and peace at this point.

Finally the worshiper or visitor would walk clock-wise around the sanctum sanctorum , stop once on each side, close their eyes and pray to the All Loving Being. The worshipper may receive a sprinkling of the water from the holy river Ganges while the 'pujari' states &quot;Om Shanti&quot; which means &quot;peace be unto all&quot;.

During religious holidays, temples may be filled with devotees chanting and praying loudly which creates a chaotic but spiritually charged atmosphere. There may be facilitators called 'paandaas' who can help you navigate through the crowds and complete the 'puja' or prayer rituals quickly.

Temple officials announce the hours of operation, including the time for special 'pujas' to be held. For example the 'anjali' prayers are recited during the early-to-mid morning, while the 'arati' prayers are recited in the evening. There are also time schedules for devotional songs or music called bhajans,which are accompanied by a Dholak or Tabla soloist and/or Harmonium soloist. There are also dates and times for devotional dances such as the classical Bharata Natyam dance performed by accomplished dance performers.

The Hindu religion teaches compassion and tolerance towards the poor and weak. At the exit areas of the temple, worshipers or visitors often distribute Prasad and money in acts of charity towards those less fortunate then themselves.

If the visitor exits the temple experiencing a changed mental state then the ritual is understood to have been effective.

==Management==

The Archaeological Survey of India administers most of the ancient temples of archaeological importance in India. The temple is managed by a board committee that administers its finances, management and events.

The '''Puranas''' (Sanskrit: पुराण ''{{transl|sa|IAST|purāṇa}}'', &quot;of ancient times&quot;) are Hindu religious texts that are part of the ''Vedas''. They contain narratives about the history of the Universe from creation to destruction and the genealogies of kings, heroes, sages, and demigods. Some of the ''Puranas'' are discourses on cosmology, geography and Hindu philosophy. They are usually written in the form of a dialogue.

Vyasa, the narrator of the ''Mahabharata'', is traditionally considered the compiler of the ''Puranas''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dlshq.org/religions/puranas.htm The Puranas by Swami Sivananda]&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest written versions were compiled during the time of the Gupta Empire (4 - 6 century CE) and much of the material may be dated, through historical references and comparative studies, to this period and the succeeding centuries. The texts were collected from all over India and because of the similarities that are found throughout the texts, it is not possible to trace the line of influence of one ''Purana'' upon another, so the corpus is best viewed as a synchronous whole.&lt;ref name=&quot;flood&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Flood|1996|p = 359 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The date of the earliest written texts does not define the date of origin of the ''Puranas''.&lt;ref name = Johnson247&gt;{{Harvnb|Johnson|2009|p = 247}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were transmitted orally before being written down&lt;ref name = Johnson247/&gt;, while at the same time, they have been modified well into the 16th century&lt;ref name = Johnson247/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Singh|1997|p=2324}}&lt;/ref&gt; and beyond.

Serious work on the ''Puranas'' began when the All India Kashiraj Trust was formed under the patronage and guidance of Dr. Vibhuti Narayan Singh, the Maharaja of Kashi, which, in addition to producing critical editions of the ''Puranas'', also published the journal ''Puranam''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mittal|2004|p=657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[Image:Bhagavatapurana.jpg|thumb|300px|An illustration of Varaha avatar based on the Bhagavata Purana]]
An early reference is found in the ''Chandogya Upanishad'' (7.1.2). (c. 500 BCE.) The Brhadaranyaka Upanishad refers to purana as the &quot;fifth Veda&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Brhadaranyaka Upanisad 2.4.10, 4.1.2, 4.5.11. Satapatha Brahmana (SBE, Vol. 44, pp. 98, 369). {{Harvnb|Moghe|1997|pp=160,249}}&lt;/ref&gt;, ''{{transl|sa|IAST|itihāsapurāṇaṃ pañcamaṃ vedānāṃ}}'', reflecting the early religious importance of these myths, presumably then in oral form. The term also appears in the Atharvaveda 11.7.24&lt;ref name=&quot;pargiter&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Pargiter|1962|pp=30-54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;moghe&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Moghe|1997|p=249}} and the Satapatha Brahmana 11.5.6.8. and 13.4.3.13.  Sacred Books of the East|SBE Vol. 44, pp. 98, 369&lt;/ref&gt;. 
According to Matysa Purana, &lt;ref&gt; ''Matsya Purana'' 53.65&lt;/ref&gt; they are said to narrate five subjects, called Pancha Lakshana ''{{transl|sa|IAST|pañcalakṣaṇa}}'' (&quot;five distinguishing marks&quot;):&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Johnson|2009|p = 248 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''''Sarga''''': the creation of the universe.
#'''''Pratisarga''''': secondary creations, mostly re-creations after dissolution. 
#'''''Vamśa''''': genealogy of the gods and sages.
#'''''Manvañtara''''': the creation of the human race and the first human beings. The epoch of the Manus' rule, 71 celestial Yugas or 308,448,000 years.
#'''''Vamśānucaritam''''': the histories of the patriarchs of the lunar and solar dynasties. 

Some scholars have suggested that these 'distinguishing marks' are shared by other traditional religious scriptures.&lt;ref name=Rao&gt;{{Harvnb|Rao|1993|p=85-100}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
The Puranas also lay emphasis on keeping a record of genealogies. The Vayu Purana states that in ancient times the '''Sūta''' (Sanskrit:सूत bards of Puranic stories) preserved the genealogies of gods, rishis, glorious kings and the traditions of great men.

According to Pargiter (1922), the &quot;original Purana&quot; may date to the time of the final redaction of the Vedas.&lt;ref name=&quot;pargiter&quot; /&gt; and Pargiter (1979)&lt;ref name=&quot;pargiter2&quot;&gt; Pargiter 1979 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;bhargava&quot;&gt;P.L. Bhargava 1971, India in the Vedic Age, Lucknow: Upper India Publishing; Talageri 1993, 2000; Subhash Kak, 1994, The astronomical code of the Rgveda&lt;/ref&gt; 
Pargiter has argued that the Puranic Krta Yuga—in the Vayu Purana the four Yugas are divided into 4800, 3600, 2400, and 1200 years—&quot;ended with the destruction of the Haihayas [by Rama Jamadagnya]; the Treta began approximately with Sagara and ended with Rama Dasarathi's destruction of the Raksasas; and the Dvapara began with his reinstatement at Ayodhya and ended with the Bharata battle&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Pargiter|1922|p=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In Arrian's ''Indica'', Megasthenes (Greek Historian  born c. 350 BC died c. 290) is quoted as stating that the Indians counted from Shiva (Dionysos) to Chandragupta Maurya (Sandracottus) &quot;a hundred and fifty-three kings over six thousand and forty-three years.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Pliny: Naturalis Historia 6:59; Arrian: Indica 9:9&lt;/ref&gt; The list of kings in Kalhana's Rajatarangini goes back to the 19th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;Elst 1999, with reference to Bernard Sergent&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless Gavin Flood (Professor of Oxford University, Hindu Studies and Comparative Religion) connects the rise of the written ''Purana'' historically with the rise of  devotional cults centring upon a particular deity in the Gupta era: the Puranic corpus is a complex body of materials that advance the views of various competing cults.&lt;ref name=&quot;flood&quot; /&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Although these texts are related to each other, and material in one is found in another, they nevertheless each present a view of ordering of the world from a particular perspective.  They must not be seen as random collections of old tales, but as highly selective and crafted expositions and presentations of worldviews and soteriologies, compiled by particular groups of Brahmins to propagate a particular vision, whether it be focused on {{transl|sa|IAST|Viṣṇu}}, {{transl|sa|IAST|Śiva}}, or {{transl|sa|IAST|Devī}}, or, indeed, any number of deities.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Purana''s are available in vernacular translations and are disseminated by Brahmin scholars, who read from them and tell their stories, usually in Katha sessions (in which a travelling brahmin settles for a few weeks in a temple and narrates parts of a Purana, usually with a Bhakti perspective).

==Texts==

===The Mahapuranas===
Of the many texts designated ''Puranas'' the most important are the ''{{transl|sa|IAST|Mahāpurāṇa}}s''. These are always said to be eighteen in number, divided into three groups of six, though in fact they are not always counted in the same way. Combining the various lists Cornelia Dimmitt and J.A.B. van Buitenen have collated twenty names:&lt;ref name=&quot;dimmitt&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Dimmitt|van Buitenen|1978|p=373}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Agni Purana (15,400 verses) 	   	
# Bhagavata Purana (18,000 verses). One of the most celebrated and popular of the ''Puranas,''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Monier-Williams|1899|p=752}}, column 3, under the entry ''Bhagavata.''&lt;/ref&gt; telling of Vishnu's ten Avatars. Its tenth and longest canto narrates the deeds of Krishna, introducing his childhood exploits, a theme later elaborated by many Bhakti movements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Hardy|2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
# Bhavishya Purana (14,500 verses)
# Brahma Purana (24,000 verses)
# Brahmanda Purana (12,000 verses; includes Lalita Sahasranamam, a text some Hindus recite as prayer)
# Brahma Vaivarta Purana (18,000 verses)
# Garuda Purana (19,000 verses)
# Harivamsha (16,000 verses; more often considered ''itihāsa'')
# Kurma Purana (17,000 verses)
# Linga Purana (11,000 verses)
# Markandeya Purana (9,000 verses; includes Devi Mahatmyam, an important text for Shaktas)
# Matsya Purana (14,000 verses)
# Narada Purana (25,000 verses)
# Padma Purana (55,000 verses)
# Shiva Purana (24,000 verses)
# Skanda Purana (81,100 verses), the longest Purana, it is an extraordinarily meticulous pilgrimage guide, containing geographical locations of pilgrimage centers in India, with related legends, parables, hymns and stories. Many untraced quotes are attributed to this text.&lt;ref name=&quot;wendy1&quot;&gt;{{Harvnb|Doniger|1993|pp=59-83}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Vamana Purana (10,000 verses)
# Varaha Purana (10,000 verses)
# Vayu Purana (24,000 verses)
# Vishnu Purana (23,000 verses)

The Mahapuranas are frequently classified according the three aspects of the divine Trimurti,
* Brahma Puranas: Brahma Purana, Brahmānda Purana, Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Mārkandeya Purana,  Bhavishya Purana, 
* Vishnu Puranas: Vishnu Purana, Bhagavata Purana, Nāradeya Purana, Garuda Purana, Padma Purana, Varaha Purana, Vāmana Purana, Kūrma Purana, Matsya Purana, Kalki Purana
* Shiva Puranas: Shiva Purana, Linga Purana, Skanda Purana, Agni Purana, Vāyu Purana
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.puranas.org/ The Puranic Encyclopedia]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Padma Purana,''&lt;ref&gt;''Padma Purana, Uttara-khanda'', 236.18–21&lt;/ref&gt; the texts may be classified in accordance with ''the three gunas or qualities''; truth, passion, and ignorance:

*Sattva (&quot;truth; purity&quot;): Vishnu Purana, Bhagavata Purana, Naradeya Purana, Garuda Purana, Padma Purana, Varaha Purana
*Rajas (&quot;dimness; passion&quot;): Brahmanda Purana, Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Markandeya Purana, Bhavishya Purana, Vamana Purana, Brahma Purana
*Tamas (&quot;darkness; ignorance&quot;): Matsya Purana, Kurma Purana, Linga Purana, Shiva Purana, Skanda Purana, Agni Purana

===The Upapuranas===
The ''{{transl|sa|IAST|Upapurāṇas}}'' are lesser or ancillary texts: these are sometimes also said to be eighteen in number, with still less agreement as to the canonical titles. Few have been critically edited. They include: Sanat-kumara, Narasimha, Brihan-naradiya, Siva-rahasya, Durvasa, Kapila, Vamana, Bhargava, Varuna, Kalika, Samba, Nandi, Surya, Parasara, Vasishtha, Devi-Bhagavata, 
Ganesha, Mudgala, and Hamsa.&lt;ref&gt;R. C. Hazra, ''Studies in the Upapuranas, vol. I'', Calcutta, Sanskrit College, 1958. ''Studies in the Upapuranas, vol. II'', Calcutta, Sanskrit College, 1979. ''Studies in Puranic Records on Hindu Rites and Customs'', Delhi, Banarsidass, 1975. Ludo Rocher, ''The Puranas - A History of Indian Literature Vol. II'', fasc. 3, Wiesbaden: Otto Harrassowitz, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Ganesha and Mudgala Puranas are devoted to Ganesha.&lt;ref name=Thapan&gt;{{Harvnb|Thapan|1997|p=304}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://gurjari.net/ico/Mystica/html/purana.htm Purana at Gurjari]&lt;/ref&gt; The Devi-Bhagavata Purana, which extols the goddess Durga, has become (along with the Devi Mahatmya of the Mārkandeya Purana) a basic text for Devi worshipers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Mackenzie|1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many others all over the Indian subcontinent.&lt;ref&gt;''`Verbal Narratives: Performance and Gender of the Padma Purana'', by T.N. Sankaranarayana in {{Harvnb|Kaushal|2001|pp=225-234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sthala Puranas===
This corpus of texts tells of the origins and traditions of particular temples or shrines—the word ''sthala'' means &quot;spot&quot; in Sanskrit. There are numerous Sthala Puranas, most written in vernaculars, some with Sanskrit versions as well. Some appear in Sanskrit versions in the Mahapuranas or Upapuranas. Some Tamil Sthala Puranas have been researched by David Dean Shulman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shulman|1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kula Puranas===
These Puranas deal with a caste's origin myth, stories, and legends (the word ''kula'' means &quot;family&quot; or &quot;tribe&quot; in Sanskrit). They are important sources for caste identity though usually contested by rival castes. This subgenre is usually in the vernacular and may at times remain oral.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Handoo|1998|pp= 125-142}}&lt;/ref&gt; These have been little researched, though they are documented in the caste section of the British Census of India Report and the various Gazetteers.&lt;ref&gt;See for example ''Castes and Tribes of Southern India'' vol. I–V, Thurston Edgar. Cosmo Publication, Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jain and Buddhist Puranas===
Jain Puranas deal with Jain myths, history and legends and form a major part of early Kannada literature.&lt;ref name=&quot;jaini&quot;&gt;Jaini, Padmanabh S. (1993). &quot;Jaina Puranas: A Puranic Counter Tradition.&quot; in {{Harvnb|Doniger|1993|pp=207-249}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''Vedas''' are a collection of religious texts that form the foundation of Hindu theology. The word ''Veda'' is Sanskrit (वेद) for &quot;knowledge&quot;. Hindus believe that the ''Vedas'' texts are of divine origin and the term ''śruti'' (&quot;what is heard&quot;) refers to this. The Hindu belief that the cosmos is eternal; was not created and will always exist, also applies to the Hindu view of the Vedas. The Vedas is the eternal divine knowledge that is &quot;heard&quot; by humans and are ''apauruṣeya'', &quot;not of human agency&quot;. The Vedas is integrated into the life of Hindus, though many Hindus have never read it. Vedic mantras are recited at Hindu prayers, religious functions and other auspicious occasions. 

The various Indian religious sects differ in their ideas about the Vedas. Hindus cite the Vedas as scriptural authority and they class themselves as &quot;orthodox&quot; (''āstika''). Buddhism and Jainism, two religious sects with a close affinity to Hinduism, do not regard the Vedas as scriptual authority and Hindus refer to them as &quot;heterodox&quot; or &quot;non-orthodox&quot; (''nāstika''). Hinduism places very little importance on criticism of other religions because Hindus believe that the path to God transcends all human thought. In this respect, a Hindu would not consider Buddhism or Catholicism to be wrong, only different. As you familiarise yourself with the works given below; it would be wise to remember the time scale that these works occupy. The literature of the Vedas shares many similarities with the analysis and commentary on Christian literature. When Saint Augustine wrote ''Confessions''; he did so in the context of a changing Roman empire in 4 CE and over a thousand years later Luther founded the Protestant movement in a Europe dominated by the Vatican. In the Twentieth century the Jehovah Witnesses cite the Book Of Daniel. Hindu analysis and commentary on the Vedas has been shaped by the same forces: society and relevance.   

== Chronology ==
[[File:Map of Vedic India.png|thumb|right|300px|Map of North India in the Iron Age Vedic period]]
The origins of the Vedas has its roots in Northern India during the second millennium. The ''Samhitas'' are the earliest Vedas texts and date roughly from 1500 BCE  to 1000 BCE. The circum-Vedic texts and the redaction of the ''Samhitas'', date from 1000 BCE to 500 BCE. This is named the Vedic period; starting in the second millennium BCE (Late Bronze Age) and ending in the first millennium BCE (Iron Age). Gavin Flood, an eminent Professor of Hindu studies at Oxford University, has proposed these dates for the composition of the Vedas : the ''Rigveda'' was compiled from as early as 1500 BCE over a period of several centuries. The Vedic period then reaches its peak after the composition of the mantra texts and with the establishment of the various shakhas (Hindu theological schools) all over Northern India which annotated the mantra samhitas with Brahmana discussions of their meaning. Gavin Flood further proposes that classical Vedic literature ends in the age of Gautama Buddha and Pāṇini (Ancient Indian Sanskrit grammarian, circa. 4th century BC); which is around the period of the rise of the Mahajanapadas Kingdoms (archaeological period of Northern Black Polished Ware). Michael Witzel, Professor of Sanskrit at Harvard University, makes a special reference to the Syrian &quot;Mitanni&quot; civilization c. 1400 BCE, whose archaeological records are the only epigraphic finds of an Indo-Aryan society that is contemporary to the Indian Rigvedic period though it is still debated whether the Mitanni civilization are the original Aryan invaders.  Witzel proposes 150 BCE (Patañjali) as a ''terminus ante quem'' for all Vedic Sanskrit literature and 1200 BCE (the early Iron Age India) as ''terminus post quem'' for the ''Atharvaveda''. The general accepted historical chronology of the ''Samhita'' ranks the ''Rig Veda'' as the first, followed by the ''Sama Veda'', ''Yajur Veda'' and finally the ''Atharva Veda''. 

The Vedic texts were passed down to each successive generation orally. This oral tradition was essential for the preservation of texts in the Ancient World. Homer's ''Illiad'' was passed down in the same way and it wasn't until the discovery of ''Troy'' in Turkey by Heinrich Schliemann and the work of Arthur Evans at ''Knossos'' that the events described by Homer took on a new historical meaning outside of its original religious context.  The method used by Hindus priests to accurately preserve the Vedic texts using elaborate and precise patha (mnemonic techniques), has lead to the same archaeological interest in Aryan India as Homer inspired in those European adventurers who sought the evidence of their cultural origins in Ancient Greece. The literary recording of the Vedic texts started after the rise of Buddhism, during the Maurya period (Mauryan dynasty from 321 to 185 BCE) and perhaps, at the earliest, in the Kanva recension of the ''Yajurveda'' about the 1st century BCE. Kanva is a renowned ''rishi'' and author of several hymns of the ''Rigveda''. The literary tradition ran parallel with an oral tradition that was still being used up until 1000 CE. 

Due to the ephemeral nature of the manuscript material (birch bark or palm leaves), manuscripts rarely surpass an age of a few hundred years. The Benares Sanskrit University has a ''Rigveda'' manuscript of the mid-14th century and there are a number of older Veda manuscripts in Nepal belonging to the Vajasaneyi tradition that are dated from the 11th century onwards.

== Categories of Vedic texts ==
The term &quot;Vedic texts&quot; is used in two distinct meanings:
#texts composed in Vedic Sanskrit during the Vedic period (Iron Age India)
#any text considered as &quot;connected to the Vedas&quot; or a &quot;corollary of the Vedas&quot;&lt;ref&gt;according to ISKCON, [http://hinduism.iskcon.com/tradition/1105.htm Hindu Sacred Texts],  &quot;Hindus themselves often use the term to describe anything connected to the Vedas and their corollaries (e.g. Vedic culture)&quot;.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vedic Sanskrit corpus===
The corpus of Vedic Sanskrit texts includes:

* The '''''Samhita''''' (Sanskrit ''saṃhitā'', &quot;collection&quot;), are collections of metric texts (&quot;mantras&quot;). There are four &quot;Vedic&quot; Samhitas: the ''Rig-Veda'', ''Sama-Veda'', ''Yajur-Veda'', and ''Atharva-Veda'', most of which are available in several recensions (''śākhā''). In some contexts, the term ''Veda'' is used to refer to these Samhitas. This is the oldest layer of Vedic texts, which apart from the Rigvedic hymns, were essentially complete by 1200 BC. The complete corpus of Vedic mantras as collected in Bloomfield's ''Vedic Concordance'' (1907) consists of some 89,000 padas (foot (poetry)), of which 72,000 occur in the four ''Samhitas''.

# the ''Ṛigveda'': containing hymns to be recited by the hotṛ (chief priest).
# the ''Yajurveda'': containing formulas to be recited by the adhvaryu (officiating priest).
# the ''Sāmaveda'': containing formulas to be chanted by the udgātṛ (A priest who sings hymns from the ''Sāmaveda'' during a ritual). The word udgātṛ is derived from the Sanskrit root ''ud-gai'' (&quot;to sing&quot; or &quot;to chant&quot;).
# the ''Atharvaveda'': a collection of spells and incantations, stories, predictions, apotropaic charms and some speculative hymns.

* The '''''Brahmanas''''' are prose texts that discuss, in technical terms, the solemn sacrificial rituals with a commentary on their meaning and themes. Each of the ''Brahmanas'' is associated with one of the ''Samhitas'' or its recensions. The ''Brahmanas'' may either form separate texts or can be partly integrated into the text of the ''Samhitas''. They may also include the ''Aranyakas'' and ''Upanishads''.
 
*The '''''Aranyakas''''' , &quot;wilderness texts&quot; or &quot;forest treaties&quot;, were composed by ''rishis'' who followed the ascetic path of meditating as recluses. They form the third part of the Vedas and contain discussions and interpretations of dangerous rituals. They are classed as secondary literature in relation to the ''Samhitas''.

* some of the older '''''Mukhya Upanishads''''' (''Brihadaranyaka Upanishad'' {Bṛhadāraṇyaka}, ''Chandogya Upanishad'', ''Katha Upanishad'' {Kaṭha)).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Michaels|2004|p=51}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Witzel, Michael, &quot;Vedas and Upaniṣads&quot;, in: {{Harvnb|Flood|2003|p=69}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
*certain '''''Sutra''''' literature, i.e. the ''Shrautasutras'' and the ''Grhyasutras''.

The ''Shrauta Sutras'' (regarded as ''smriti'') are late Vedic period in language and content; therefore they are considered part of the Vedic Sanskrit corpus.&lt;ref&gt;Witzel, Michael, &quot;Vedas and Upaniṣads&quot;, in: {{Harvnb|Flood|2003|p=69}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For a table of all Vedic texts see Witzel, Michael, &quot;Vedas and Upaniṣads&quot;, in: {{Harvnb|Flood|2003|p=100–101}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
The composition of the Shrauta and Grhya Sutras (c. 6th century BCE) marks the end of the Vedic period. This is also the beginning of the &quot;circum-Vedic&quot; scholarship of Vedanga, the earliest flowering of classical Sanskrit literature in the Mauryan and Gupta periods.

The ''Brahmanas'' and ''Aranyakas'' texts reach their final form at the end of the Vedic period. There were a large number of ''Upanishads'' composed after the end of the Vedic period but the ten mukhya ''Upanishads'' date from the Vedic or Mahajanapada period. Most of the 108 ''Upanishads'' of the full Muktika canon were composed in the Common Era.

The ''Brahmanas'', ''Aranyakas'', and ''Upanishads'' often interpret the polytheistic and ritualistic Samhitas in philosophical and metaphorical ways to explore abstract concepts such as the Absolute (Brahman) and the soul or the self (Atman).  The ''Upanishads'' also encapsulate the Vedanta philosophy; which is the practices and methods of self-realisation by which one may understand the ultimate nature of reality (Brahman). Vedanta is one of the major trends of post-Vedic Hinduism.

The Vedic Sanskrit corpus 
were collected together under the title ''A Vedic Word Concordance'' (''Vaidika-Padānukrama-Koṣa''). Prepared in the 1930s under Vishva Bandhu and published in 1935-1965; it contains all the Vedic texts in Sanskrit and certain &quot;sub-Vedic&quot; texts.

===Shruti literature===

The texts considered &quot;Vedic&quot; , in the sense of &quot;corollaries of the Vedas&quot;, are less clearly defined and may include numerous post-Vedic texts such as the ''Upanishads'' or ''Sutra'' literature.

The latter group of texts is  called ''shruti'' (Sanskrit: ''śruti''; &quot;the heard&quot;). Since post-Vedic times they have been regarded as &quot;revealed wisdom&quot;, as distinct from other texts, collectively known as ''smriti'' (Sanskrit: ''smṛti''; &quot;the remembered&quot;); texts that are considered to be of human origin.  This indigenous system of categorization was adopted by Max Müller, one of the founders of the western academic field of Indian studies. While it is subject to some debate, it is still widely used. As Axel Michaels explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
These classifications are often not tenable for linguistic and formal reasons: There is not only ''one'' collection at any one time, but rather several handed down in separate Vedic schools; Upanişads ... are sometimes not to be distinguished from Āraṇyakas...; Brāhmaṇas contain older strata of language attributed to the Saṃhitās; there are various dialects and locally prominent traditions of the Vedic schools. Nevertheless, it is advisable to stick to the division adopted by Max Müller because it follows the Indian tradition, conveys the historical sequence fairly accurately, and underlies the current editions, translations, and monographs on Vedic literature.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Michaels|2004|p=51}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Upanishads'' are  largely philosophical works in dialog form. They discuss questions of nature philosophy and the fate of the soul. They also contain some mystical and spiritual interpretations of the Vedas. They are known as Vedānta (&quot;the end of the Vedas&quot;) and taken together, form the basis of the Vedanta school.

Other texts such as the ''Bhagavad Gita'' or the ''Vedanta Sutras'' are considered ''shruti'' or &quot;Vedic&quot; by some Hindu denominations but not universally within Hinduism. The Bhakti movement (religious path that emphasises devotion above ritual) and Gaudiya Vaishnavism (religious movement founded by Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in the 16th century) extended the term to include the Sanskrit Epics and Vaishnavite devotional texts such as the ''Pancaratra''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

== Vedic schools or recensions ==

Study of the extensive body of Vedic texts has been organized into a number of different schools or branches (Sanskrit ''śākhā'', literally &quot;branch&quot; or &quot;limb&quot;) each of which specialized in learning certain texts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Flood|1996|p=39}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Multiple recensions are known for each of the Vedas and each Vedic text may have a number of schools associated with it.  

Ancient Indian culture ensured that these texts were transmitted from generation to generation with inordinate fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Staal|1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, memorization of the sacred ''Vedas'' included up to eleven ''patha'' (forms of recitation) of the same text.  The texts were subsequently &quot;proof-read&quot; by comparing the different recited versions.  Forms of recitation included the ''jaṭā-pāṭha'' (literally &quot;mesh recitation&quot;) in which every two adjacent words in the text were first recited in their original order, then repeated in the reverse order, and finally repeated again in the original order.&lt;ref name=filliozat-p139&gt;{{Harv|Filliozat|2004|p=139}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The effectiveness of this method is to be seen in the preservation of the most ancient Indian religious text, the ''Ṛgveda''. Redacted into a single text during the ''Brahmana'' period, without any variant readings.&lt;ref name=filliozat-p139/&gt;

==The Four Vedas ==
[[Image:Rigveda MS2097.jpg|thumb|300px|''Rigveda'' (padapatha) manuscript in Devanagari, early 19th century]]
The canonical division of the Vedas is fourfold (''turīya'') viz.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Radhakrishnan|Moore|1957|p=3}}; Witzel, Michael, &quot;Vedas and Upaniṣads&quot;, in: {{Harvnb|Flood|2003|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Rig-Veda''  (RV)
#''Yajur-Veda''  (YV, with the main division Taittiriya Shakha (TS) vs. Vajasaneyi (VS]
#''Sama-Veda''  (SV)
#''Atharva-Veda''  (AV)

The first three were the original division, called ''trayī vidyā'' - &quot;the triple sacred science&quot; of reciting hymns (RV), performing sacrifices (YV), and chanting (SV).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|MacDonell|2004|p=29-39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Witzel, M., &quot;[http://www.people.fas.harvard.edu/~witzel/canon.pdf The Development of the Vedic Canon and its Schools : The Social and Political Milieu]&quot; in {{Harvnb|Witzel|1997|p=257-348}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This triplicity is stated in the Brahmanas (Shatapatha Brahmana, Aitareya Brahmana and others). The ''Rigveda'' is the older work of the three from which the other two borrow material though they do have their own independent ''Yajus'' of sorcery and speculative mantras.

Thus, the Mantras are properly of three forms:
# ''Ric'', which are verses of praise in metre for loud recitation.
# ''Yajus'', which are prose for recitation at sacrifices.  
# ''Sāman'', which are verses in metre for singing at Soma ceremonies. 

The ''Yajurveda'', ''Samaveda'' and ''Atharvaveda'' are independent collections of mantras and hymns intended as manuals for the Adhvaryu, Udgatr and Brahman priests respectively.

The ''Atharvaveda'' is the fourth Veda. Its status is ambiguous due to its use in sorcery and healing. It contains very old material and uses an early form of the Vedic language. The Manusmrti,  a discourse given by the sage Manu to a group of ''rishis'', often speaks of the three Vedas, calling them ''trayam-brahma-sanātanam'', &quot;the triple eternal Veda&quot;. The ''Atharvaveda'' like the ''Rigveda'', is a collection of incantations and other material and borrows relatively little from the Rigveda.  It has no direct relation to the solemn Shrauta sacrifices, except for the fact that the Brahmán priest observes the procedures and uses ''Atharvaveda'' mantras to 'heal'. Its recitation is believed to produce long life, cure diseases or ruin enemies.

Each of the four Vedas consists of the metrical Mantra or Samhita and the prose Brahmana. The Brahmana consists of detailed discussions and directions for the ceremonies at which the Mantras are to be used and explanations of the legends connected to the Mantras and rituals. Both these portions are ''shruti''. Each of the four Vedas have passed through numerous Shakhas, giving rise to various recensions of the text. They each have an Index or Anukramani, the principal work of this kind being the general Index or ''Sarvānukramaṇī''.

=== Rigveda ===

The ''Rigveda Samhita'' is a collection of 1,028 Vedic Sanskrit hymns and 10,600 verses in all, organized into ten books (Sanskrit: ''mandalas'').&lt;ref&gt;For 1,028 hymns and 10,600 verses and division into ten mandalas, see: {{Harvnb|Avari|2007|p=77}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The hymns are dedicated to Rigvedic deities.&lt;ref&gt;For characterization of content and mentions of deities including Agni, Indra, Varuna, Soma, Surya, etc. see: {{Harvnb|Avari|2007|p=77}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The books were composed by poets from different priestly groups over a period of several centuries and are commonly dated to the second half of the 2nd millennium BCE (the early Vedic period).

There are strong linguistic and cultural similarities between the ''Rigveda'' and the early Iranian ''Avesta''. The ''Avesta'' are a collection of the sacred texts of Zoroastrianism and they are often associated with the Andronovo culture. The earliest horse-drawn chariots found at Andronovo sites in the Sintashta-Petrovka area near the Ural mountains, date to c. 2000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Drews | first = Robert | title = Early Riders: The beginnings of mounted warfare in Asia and Europe | year = 2004 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | page = 50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Yajurveda ===

The ''Yajurveda'' Samhita consists of archaic prose mantras and some verses borrowed and adapted from the ''Rigveda''. Its purpose was practical; in that each mantra must accompany an action in sacrifice but unlike the ''Samaveda'', it was compiled to apply to all sacrificial rites, not merely the Somayajna. 
There are two major groups of shakha (recensions) of this Veda, known as the &quot;Black&quot; (Krishna) and &quot;White&quot; (Shukla) Yajurveda. The ''White Yajurveda'' separates the Samhita from its Brahmana (the Shatapatha Brahmana) and the ''Black Yajurveda'' intersperses the Samhita with Brahmana commentary. Of the Black Yajurveda four major recensions survive (Maitrayani, Katha, Kapisthala-Katha, Taittiriya).

=== Samaveda ===

The ''Samaveda'' Samhita (from '''''sāman''''', the term for a melody applied to metrical hymn or song of praise&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Apte|1965|p=981}}.&lt;/ref&gt;) consists of 1549 stanzas, taken almost entirely (except for 78 stanzas) from the Rigveda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Michaels|2004|p=51}}.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Like the Rigvedic stanzas in the Yajurveda, the Samans have been changed and adapted for use in singing.  Some of the Rigvedic verses are repeated more than once.  Including repetitions, there are a total of 1875 verses numbered in the Samaveda recension as translated by Ralph T. H. Griffith (1826-1906), scholar of Indology at Queens College.&lt;ref&gt;For 1875 total verses, see numbering given in Ralph T. H. Griffith.  Griffith's introduction mentions the recension history for his text.  Repetitions may be found by consulting the cross-index in Griffith pp. 491-99.&lt;/ref&gt; Two major recensions remain today, the ''Kauthuma/Ranayaniya'' and the ''Jaiminiya''. Its purpose is liturgical and it provides the ''udgātṛ'' with a repertoire of songs to accompany the sacrifice.

=== Atharvaveda ===

The ''Artharvaveda'' Samhita is a text belonging to the period of the Atharvan and Angirasa poets. 
It consists of 760 hymns of which 160 are repetitions from the ''Rigveda''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Michaels|2004|p=56}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  The majority of the verses in the ''Artharvaveda'' are metrical with a small section in prose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Michaels|2004|p=56}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
It was compiled around 900 BCE. Although some of its material is dated to the time of the Rigveda,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Flood|1996|p=37}}.&lt;/ref&gt; other parts of the Atharva-Veda are older than the Rig-Veda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Michaels|2004|p=56}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Atharvanaveda'' is preserved in two recensions, the ''Paippalāda'' and ''Śaunaka''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Michaels|2004|p=56}}.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Apte it had nine schools (''shakhas'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Apte|1965|p=37}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Paippalada'' text, which exists in a Kashmir and an Orissa version, is longer than the ''Saunaka'' recension; it is only partially printed in its two versions and remains largely untranslated.

Unlike the other three Vedas, the ''Atharvaveda'' has less material connected with the rituals of sacrifice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Flood|1996|p=36}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Witzel, Michael, &quot;Vedas and Upaniṣads&quot;, in: {{Harvnb|Flood|2003|p=76}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Its first part consists of spells and incantations concerned with protection against demons and disaster, spells for the healing of diseases, and spells for a long life and for various desires or aims in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Radhakrishnan|Moore|1957|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Michaels|2004|p=56}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The second part of the text contains speculative and philosophical hymns.&lt;ref&gt;
&quot;The latest of the four Vedas, the Atharva-Veda, is, as we have seen, largely composed of magical texts and charms, but here and there we find cosmological hymns which anticipate the Upanishads, -- hymns to Skambha, the 'Support', who is seen as the first principle which is both the material and efficient cause of the universe, to Prāna, the 'Breath of Life', to Vāc, the 'Word', and so on.&quot; {{Harvnb|Zaehner|1966|p=vii}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Atharvaveda'' is a comparatively late addition to the Vedas. This may be because of an extension of the sacrificial rite which involved the inclusion of the Brahman overseeing the ritual.&lt;ref&gt;
&quot;There were originally only three priests associated with the first three ''Saṃhitās'', for the Brahman as overseer of the rites does not appear in the ''Ṛg Veda'' and is only incorporated later, thereby showing the acceptance of the ''Atharva Veda'', which had been somewhat distinct from the other ''Saṃhitās'' and identified with the lower social strata, as being of equal standing with the other texts.&quot;{{Harvnb|Flood|1996|p=42}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vedanta==

Vedanta is an orthodox approach to Hinduism that reduces the emphasis on ritualism and radically re-interprets the notion of &quot;Veda&quot;. It forms the basis of modern Hinduism with its ideas on the nature of Atman (soul) and Brahma (absolute). It is the study of the Upanishads and the subsequent commentary on the correct way to interpret them. Its association with three of the Vedic texts is expressed in the ''bhūr bhuvaḥ svaḥ'' mantra which is found in the Aitareya Aranyaka: &quot;''Bhūḥ'' is the Rigveda, ''bhuvaḥ'' is the Yajurveda, ''svaḥ'' is the Samaveda&quot; (1.3.2). The Upanishads reduce the &quot;essence of the Vedas&quot; further, to the syllable Aum ({{Unicode|ॐ}}). Thus, the Katha Upanishad  has:
:&quot;The goal, which all Vedas declare, which all austerities aim at, and which humans desire when they live a life of continence, I will tell you briefly it is ''Aum''&quot; (1.2.15)&lt;!--
:''sarve vedā yat padam āmananti /   tapām̐si sarvāṇi ca yad vadanti /  yad icchanto brahmacaryaṃ caranti / tat te padaṃ saṃgraheṇa bravīmy /  om ity etat}} //''--&gt;


==Post-Vedic literature==
=== Vedanga ===

Six technical subjects related to the Vedas are traditionally known as ''vedāṅga'' &quot;limbs of the Veda&quot;. V. S. Apte defines this group of works as: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&quot;N. of a certain class of works regarded as auxiliary to the Vedas and designed to aid in the correct pronunciation and interpretation of the text and the right employment of the ''Mantras'' in ceremonials.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Apte|1965|p=387}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These subjects are treated in Sutra literature dating from the end of the Vedic period to Mauryan times, seeing the transition from late Vedic Sanskrit to Classical Sanskrit.

The six subjects of Vedanga are:
* Phonetics (Śikṣā)
* Meter (Chandas)
* Grammar (Vyākaraṇa)
* Etymology (Nirukta)
* Astrology (Jyotiṣa)
* Ritual (Kalpa)

===Parisista===

''Pariśiṣṭa'' (Devanagari: परिशिष्ट), which translates as &quot;supplement&quot; or &quot;appendix&quot;, is the term applied to various ancillary works of Vedic literature. These works elaborate on the details of ritual that were given in earlier Vedic texts : the Samhitas, Brahmanas, Aranyakas and Sutras. Parisista works exist for each of the four texts of the Vedas.  However, only the literature associated with the Atharvaveda is extensive.

*The '''Āśvalāyana Gṛhya Pariśiṣṭa''' is a very late text associated with the Rigveda canon. 
*The '''Gobhila Gṛhya Pariśiṣṭa''' is a short metrical text of two chapters, with 113 and 95 verses respectively.  
*The '''Kātiya Pariśiṣṭas''', ascribed to Kātyāyana (c. 3rd century BC Sanskrit grammarian and Vedic priest), consist of 18 works enumerated self-referentially in the fifth of the series (the Caraṇavyūha).
*The '''Kṛṣṇa Yajurveda''' has three parisistas. The ''Āpastamba Hautra Pariśiṣṭa'', which is also found as the second ''praśna'' of the ''Satyasāḍha Śrauta Sūtra'', the ''Vārāha Śrauta Sūtra Pariśiṣṭa'' and the ''Kātyāyana Śrauta Sūtra Pariśiṣṭa''.
*For the '''Atharvaveda''', there are 79 works, collected as 72 distinctly named parisistas.&lt;ref&gt;BR Modak, The Ancillary Literature of the Atharva-Veda, New Delhi, Rashtriya Veda Vidya Pratishthan, 1993, ISBN 81-215-0607-7&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===Puranas===
A traditional view given in the Vishnu Purana (likely dating to the Gupta period&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Flood|1996|p=111}} dates it to the 4th century CE.&lt;/ref&gt;) attributes the current arrangement of four Vedas to the mythical sage Vedavyasa.&lt;ref&gt;Vishnu Purana, translation by Horace Hayman Wilson, 1840, Ch IV, http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/vp/vp078.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. Puranic tradition also postulates a single original Veda that, in varying accounts, was divided into three or four parts. According to the Vishnu Purana (3.2.18, 3.3.4 etc) the original Veda was divided into four parts, and further fragmented into numerous shakhas, by Lord Vishnu in the form of Vyasa, in the Dvapara Yuga; the Vayu Purana (section 60)  recounts a similar division by Vyasa, at the urging of Brahma. The Bhagavata Purana (12.6.37) traces the origin of the primeval Veda to the syllable aum, and says that it was divided into four at the start of ''Dvapara Yuga'', because men had declined in age, virtue and understanding. In a differing account Bhagavata Purana (9.14.43) attributes the division of the primeval veda (''aum'') into three parts to the monarch Pururavas at the beginning of Treta Yuga. The Mahabharata (santiparva 13,088) also mentions the division of the Veda into three in ''Treta Yuga''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Muir|1861|pp=20-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Upaveda===
The term '''upaveda''' (&quot;applied knowledge&quot;) is used to designate the subjects of certain technical works associated with a text of the Vedas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Monier-Williams|2006|p=207}}. [http://www.ibiblio.org/sripedia/ebooks/mw/0200/mw__0240.html] Accessed 5 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Apte|1965|p=293}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  Lists of what subjects are included in this class differ among sources.  
The Charanavyuha mentions four Upavedas: 

* Medicine (Āyurveda), associated with the ''Rigveda''
* Archery  (Dhanurveda), associated with the ''Yajurveda''
* Music and classical Indian dance (Gāndharvaveda), associated with the ''Samaveda''
* Military science (Shastrashastra), associated with the ''Atharvaveda''

But Sushruta and Bhavaprakasha mention Ayurveda as an upaveda of the ''Atharvaveda''. Sthapatyaveda (architecture), Shilpa Shastras (arts and crafts) are mentioned as fourth upaveda according to later sources.
Vedas cover complete knowledge for all subjects living being requires

===&quot;Fifth Veda&quot;===
Some post-Vedic texts, including the ''Mahabharata'', the ''Natyasastra'' and certain ''Puranas'', refer to themselves as the &quot;fifth Veda&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sullivan|1994|p=385}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest reference to such a &quot;fifth Veda&quot; is found in the ''Chandogya Upanishad''. &quot;Dravida Veda&quot; is a term for canonical Tamil Bhakti texts.{{Fact|date=September 2008}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Indus river from Karakouram highway.jpg|thumb|right|The Indus River]]
The word ''Hindu'' is derived from the Sanskrit word ''Sindhu'' which is the ancient name for the Indus River that flows through the north-western part of the Indian subcontinent. Sindhu also means sea. The word Hindu or Indu was used by Greeks to denote the country and people living beyond the Indus river. Megasthenes' 'Indica' epitomizes the name for India and Indians around the 4th Century B.C.E.
This word was misunderstood to be coined by Arabs, by medieval and some modern Indian Historians. But this was only an extention of the name used by the Greeks. The Arabic term ''al-Hind'', referred to the land of the people who live across the river Indus. By the 13th century, the word ''Hindustan'' began to be used as a popular alternative name for India, meaning the &quot;land of ''Hindus''&quot;. Towards the end of the 18th century, the European merchants and colonists referred collectively to the followers of the Dharmic religions in ''Hindustan'' &amp;mdash; which geographically referred to most parts of the northern Indian subcontinent &amp;mdash; as ''Hindus''. Eventually, any person of Indian origin who did not practice Abrahamic religions came to be known as a Hindu, thereby encompassing a wide range of religious beliefs and practices. 

One of the accepted views is that the ''ism'' was added to ''Hindu'' in the early part of the nineteenth century by English writers to denote the culture and religion of the high-caste Brahmans. The word ''Hinduism'' was soon adopted by the Hindus themselves, as a term that encompassed their national, social and cultural identity.

The original word for the now-so-called Hindus is ''Sanatan'' and ''Arya''. The word Hindu is believed to not appear in the Hindu scriptures, viz, Vedas, Upanishads, and Puranhas. The contemporary Hindus are believers of and accept the authority of the said scriptures, hence, they are more accurately identified as ''Sanatanis'' or ''Aryans''. Another word which is more accurate than Hindu, is ''Bhaaratiya''. People of India are believed to be the descendants of King Bharat. From his name comes the original name of India, ''Bhaarat'', and, those residing in ''Bhaarat'' are ''Bhaaratiya''. 

In the 19th. and 20th centuries under the British Raj (Rule) of India the word Hinduism was applied to the national, social and cultural practice of the majority of Brahmanic people and their belief in a number of mythical gods and goddesses, but never suggested as being anything beyond a philosophy -- a great philosophy at that; never a religion established by a single prophet, or a holy book or scriptures. As a result of a political undercurrent, however, a few of these people have been radicalised into believing erroneously that Hinduism is a religion, when in fact it is not one.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Aum Symbol==
[[File:Om.svg|thumb|left|Aum]]
'''''Aum''''' or Om (in Devanagari ॐ) is one of the most sacred symbols in Hinduism. In Sanskrit known as  '''''praṇava''''' (प्रणव) lit. &quot;to sound out loudly&quot; or '''''oṃkāra''''' (ओंकार) lit. &quot;''oṃ'' syllable&quot;)

Hindus consider Aum to be the universal name of the Lord and that it encompasses all of creation. The sound emerging from the vocal cords starts from the base of the throat as &quot;A.&quot; With the coming together of the lips, &quot;U&quot; is formed and when the lips are closed, all sounds end in &quot;M.&quot; The &quot;amen&quot; in Christianity and the &quot;ameen&quot; in Islam and &quot;aum&quot;  may show a common linguistic ancestry within the Indo-European language group and it is conjectured that the Aum mantra may have travelled from the East to Europe changing its form and context. Judaism contains the first recorded use of &quot;amen&quot; in the context of a response by the congregation to the priest's prayer. Judaism defines the Semitic verb &quot;amen&quot; as meaning &quot;to be trusted&quot;.
      
Om symbolizes The Supreme Personality of Godhead i.e [[Parabrahman]]. It symbolizes the prana or life breath with runs through one's body bestowed by the Parabrahman. The significance and explanation of Om is given in the [[Mandukya Upanishad]].

Hindus believe that the entire essence of the Vedas (ancient Indian scriptures) is enshrined in the word Aum. The belief that the Lord started creating the world after chanting &quot;aum&quot; and &quot;atha&quot; gives this religious symbol a fundamental relevance to the Hindu view of creation.  Hence, its sound is considered to create an auspicious beginning for any task that one may undertake.

Lord [[Krishna]] says in the [[Bhagavad Gita]]:  
                                                              ''vedyam pavitram omkara 
                                              What is to be known, that I'm the purifier and the syllable OM.'' 

[[File:Lord Ganesh.jpg|right|thumb|The Hindu deity Lord Ganesh]]
Some devotees see similarities between the shape of Ganesha's body in iconography and the shape of Aum in the Devanāgarī. The upper curve is the head and the lower large one, the stomach; the side one, the trunk; and the semi-circular mark with the dot, the sweetmeat ball (modaka) in Lord Ganesha's hand. For Hindus, Aum is seen as a fundamental component of the physical and metaphysical tenets of  Hinduism - the means and the goal of life, the world and the Truth behind it, the material and the Sacred, all form and the Formless.

Aum is one of the most chanted sound symbols in India. It is believed to have a profound effect on the body and mind of the one who chants it. It is placed at the beginning of most Hindu texts as a sacred exclamation to be uttered at the beginning and the end of a reading of the Vedas or as the beginning to any prayer or mantra..  

It may also be used as a greeting - Aum or Hari Aum . Its form is worshiped, contemplated upon or used as an auspicious sign within the Hindu religion. Today, in all Hindu art and all over India and Nepal, 'Aum' can be seen virtually everywhere, a common sign for Hinduism and its philosophy and theology.

==The Swastika Symbol==

[[File:HinduSwastika.svg|thumb|left|The decorative Hindu swastika]]
The '''''swastika''''' (from Sanskrit ''svástika'') is an equilateral cross with its arms bent at right angles, in either right-facing form or its mirrored left-facing form. Archaeological evidence of swastika-shaped ornaments have been dated to the Neolithic period and was first found in the Indus Valley Civilization of the Indian Subcontinent. It occurs today mainly in the modern day culture of northern India, sometimes as a geometrical motif and sometimes as a religious symbol. 

In Hinduism, the two symbols represent the two forms of the creator god Brahma: facing right it represents the evolution of the universe (Devanagari: प्रवृत्ति, ''Pravritti''), facing left it represents the involution of the universe (Devanagari: निवृत्ति, ''Nivritti''). It is also seen as pointing in all four directions (north, east, south and west) and thus signifies a grounded stability. Its use as a Sun symbol can first be seen in its representation of the god Surya (Devanagari: सूर्य, ''Sun''). The swastika is considered extremely holy and auspicious by all Hindus, and is regularly used to decorate items related to Hindu culture. It is used in all Hindu yantras (Devanagari: यंत्र) and religious designs. Throughout the subcontinent of India, it can be seen on the sides of temples, religious scriptures, gift items, and letterheads. The Hindu deity Ganesh (Devanagari: गणेश) is often shown sitting on a lotus flower on a bed of swastikas.

==The Bindi Symbol==
[[Image:Bindi.pottu.battu.jpg|thumb|300px|A jewerly bindi worn on the forehead.]]

A '''''bindi''''' (from Sanskrit ''bindu'', meaning &quot;a drop, small particle, dot&quot;) is a forehead decoration worn in South Asia (particularly India) and Southeast Asia. Traditionally it is a dot of red colour of sandalwood paste, turmeric or vermilion applied in the center of the forehead close to the eyebrows, but it can also consist of a sign or piece of jewelry worn at this location. The tilak (Sanskrit: Tilaka means “mark”) is also used by men to show religious affiliation or by both sexes after a puja ritual to invoke religious feelings
	
Nowadays, bindis are worn throughout South Asia (India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Sri Lanka and Pakistan) by women and girls, and no longer signifies age, marital status, religious background or ethnic affiliation. The bindi has become a decorative item and is no longer restricted in colour or shape. Self-adhesive bindis (also known as sticker bindis) are available, usually made of felt or thin metal and adhesive on the other side. These are simple to apply, disposable substitutes for older tilak bindis. Sticker bindis come in many colors, designs, materials, and sizes. Fancier sticker bindis are decorated with sequins, glass beads, or rhinestones.
	 	
Outside South Asia, bindis are sometimes worn by women of Indian origin. Some Western women who have converted to Hinduism, such as in the Hare Krishna movement, also wear bindis. Sometimes they are worn as a style statement. International celebrities such as Gwen Stefani, Shakira, Madonna, Nina Hagen, Nelly Furtado, and Shania Twain have been seen wearing bindis.

A bindi can be called: 
* ''Tikli'' in Marathi
* ''Pottu'' in Tamil and Malayalam language
* ''Tilak'' in Hindi
* ''Chandlo'' in Gujarati 
* ''Bottu'' or ''Tilakam'' in Telugu 
* ''Bottu'' or ''Tilaka'' in Kannada 
* ''Teep'' (meaning &quot;a pressing&quot;) in Bengali
* ''Tipa'' in Odiya 

The area between the eyebrows (where the bindi is placed) is said to be the sixth chakra, ''ajna'', the seat of &quot;concealed wisdom&quot;. According to followers of Hinduism, this chakra is the exit point for kundalini energy. The bindi is said to retain energy and strengthen concentration.  It is also said to protect against demons or bad luck.

In addition to the bindi, a vermilion mark in the parting of the hair just above the forehead is worn by married women as a symbol of their married status. During North Indian marriage ceremonies, the groom applies sindoor on the parting in the bride's hair.

==The Sacred Thread==
[[File:Upanayanam.jpg|thumb|right
|A young Hindu undergoing the Upanayana ritual. The yellowed, thin, thread running from left shoulder to the waist is Yajnopavita. Also note the girdle of munja grass around the waist. The twig in the right hand (usually from peepa treel) siginifies his entry into Brahmacharya.]]
The Yajnopavita (sacred thread) is given to male Hindus to signify their spiritual awakening and acceptance as religious students. The ritual is usually reserved for males from the Brahman (priest) caste, the  Kshatriya (military or ruler) caste and the Vaisya (merchant-traders) caste. The scared thread is actually three intertwined threads symbolic of the Trimurti. The threads also represents three of the Vedas texts- the Rigveda, Samaveda and Yagurveda. The Artharaveda is not included. The knot in the middle of the sacred thread represents the eternal and divine force of all creation (Brahman). The thread is never meant to be taken off and a devout Hindu will bathe or swim with it on. It is hung diagonally from the left shoulder to the waist. It is placed over the right shoulder during funerals. The material of the thread may be cotton or wool not hemp. The person undergoing the ritual is referred to as &quot;twice born&quot;. The biological birth is his first birth and after the sacred thread is placed, the symbolical acceptance of a spiritual teacher as father and the Vedas as mother signifies a second birth. The initiate will shave his head and wear new clothes and during the 
ceremony a priest or guru will recite the Gayatri mantra. At the close of the ceremony a traditional dakshina (gift) is given to his teacher.

&lt;/noinclude&gt;

There are many different notions of [[w:manifold|manifold]], with more or less structure, and corresponding notions of “map between manifolds”, each of which yields a different [[w:category (mathematics)|category]] and its own [[w:classification of manifolds|classification question]].

One can relate these categories in a [[w:partial order|partial order]] via [[w:forgetful functor|forgetful functor]]s: “forgetting additional structure”. For instance, a [[w:Riemannian manifold|Riemannian manifold]] has an underlying [[w:differentiable manifold|differentiable manifold]]. For some purposes, it's useful to compare categories: which manifolds in a given category admit a structure, and how many.

In other ways, different categories have completely different theories: compare [[w:symmetric space|symmetric space]]s with [[w:homology manifold|homology manifold]]s.

This article describes many of the structures on manifolds and their connections, with an emphasis on categories studied in [[w:geometry and topology|geometry and topology]]; in some cases the formal categorical point of view is an important part of the subject, while in other cases one less formally simply discusses various types of manifolds and maps, without the apparatus of category theory.

==Kinds of structures==
* Many structures on manifolds are [[w:G-structure|G-structure]]s, where containment (or more generally, a map &lt;math&gt;H \to G&lt;/math&gt;) yields a forgetful functor between categories.
* Geometric structures often impose [[w:integrability condition|integrability condition]]s on a G-structure, and the corresponding structure without the integrability condition is called an '''almost''' structure. Examples include [[w:complex manifold|complex]] versus [[w:almost complex manifold|almost complex]], [[w:symplectic manifold|symplectic]] versus [[w:almost symplectic manifold|almost symplectic]], [[w:Hermitian manifold|Hermitian]] versus [[w:almost Hermitian manifold|almost Hermitian]], and [[w:Kähler manifold|Kähler]] versus [[w:almost Kähler manifold|almost Kähler]].
* Of these G-structures, many can be expressed via [[w:differential form|differential form]]s such as a [[w:symplectic form|symplectic form]] or [[w:volume form|volume form]], or other [[w:tensor field|tensor field]]s, such as a [[w:Riemannian metric|Riemannian metric]].

==Notable geometric and topological structures==
Notable structures on manifolds, in decreasing order of rigidity, include:&lt;ref&gt;The complex (including algebraic and Kähler) and symplectic only occur in even dimension; there are some odd-dimensional analogs.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[w:projective algebraic variety|smooth projective algebraic varieties]]
* [[w:Kähler manifold|Kähler manifold]]s
* [[w:complex manifold|complex manifold]]s / [[w:Riemannian manifold|Riemannian manifold]]s / [[w:symplectic manifold|symplectic manifold]]s&lt;ref&gt;This level is suggestive: a Kähler manifold has all of these structures, and any two compatible such structures (with integrability conditions) yields an Kähler manifold.&lt;/ref&gt;
*:Note that for symplectic manifolds, there are various notions of what maps are of interest; there is no generally agreed “category of symplectic manifolds”.
* Diff: [[w:differentiable manifold|differentiable manifold]]s (also known as ''smooth manifolds'')
* PL: [[w:PL manifold|PL manifold]]s (piecewise-linear)
*:Formally, PL and Diff are not directly comparable, so one must introduce the category [[w:PDIFF|PDIFF]] (piecewise-differentiable), which is however equivalent to PL, and thus not distinguished except in careful usage.
* Top: [[w:topological manifold|topological manifold]]s
* [[w:homology manifold|homology manifold]]s

These can be divided into geometric and topological categories:&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Geometry_and_topology#Distinction_between_geometry_and_topology|detailed distinction between geometry and topology]]&lt;/ref&gt; Diff and below are topological, while above are geometric. The topological structures have agreed category structures (such as differentiable maps), while the geometric structures have various notions of maps, and no single categorical structure – when defined by a G-structure one can take “maps respecting the G-structure”, such as isometric immersions of Riemannian manifolds, but these are not necessarily the maps of most interest.

===Special structures===
Certain structures are particularly special:
* [[w:Holonomy_group#The_Berger_classification|special holonomy]] (including [[w:Calabi–Yau manifold|Calabi–Yau manifold]]s)

The following structures are algebraic and very rigid, and admit elegant algebraic classifications:
* [[w:Lie group|Lie group]]s
* [[w:Riemannian symmetric space|symmetric spaces]] (and [[w:homogeneous space|homogeneous space]]s)

==Relation between categories==
These categories are related by [[w:forgetful functor|forgetful functor]]s: for instance, a differentiable manifold is also a topological manifold, and a differentiable map is also continuous, so there is a functor &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Diff} \to \operatorname{Top}&lt;/math&gt;.

These functors are in general neither one-to-one nor onto; these failures are generally referred to in terms of “structure”, as follows. A topological manifold that is in the image of &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Diff} \to \operatorname{Top}&lt;/math&gt; is said to “admit a differentiable structure”, and the fiber over a given topological manifold is “the different differentiable structures on the given topological manifold”.

Thus given two categories, the two natural questions are:
* Which manifolds of a given type '''admit''' an additional structure?
* If it admits an additional structure, '''how many''' does it admit?
:More precisely, what is the '''structure''' of the set of additional structures?
In more general categories, this ''structure set'' has more structure: in Diff it is simply a set, but in Top it is a group, and functorially so.

In the case of G-structures, this is exactly [[w:reduction of the structure group|reduction of the structure group]],
of which the most familiar example is [[w:orientability|orientability]]: not every manifold is orientable, and those that are admit exactly two orientations (which form a &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}/2&lt;/math&gt;-[[w:torsor|torsor]]).

In general the picture is more complicated; for the forgetful functor from differentiable (and PL, and Top) manifolds to the category of spaces with Poincaré duality, this is [[w:surgery theory|surgery theory]], and reduction of the structure group (here called the &quot;[[w:normal invariant|normal invariant]]&quot;) is the first step, and the second (and last) step is the [[w:surgery obstruction|surgery obstruction]]. For geometric structures like a [[w:complex manifold|complex structure]] or [[w:symplectic manifold|symplectic structure]], it is in general much more difficult.

Important examples where the forgetful functor is...
* ...not one-to-one: [[w:exotic sphere|exotic sphere]]s
* ...not onto: non-smoothable manifolds, like the [[w:E8 manifold|''E&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;'' manifold]]

==Examples==
Expanding a category (weakening the axioms) often yields a more flexible theory from the categorical viewpoint. On the other hand, the very constrained categories, such as Lie groups or symmetric spaces, often have very elegant theories; the intermediate theories are most complicated. This parallels how the [[w:classification of manifolds|classification of manifolds]] proceeds by dimensions: low dimensions are constrained and explicitly classified, high dimensions are flexible and algebraic, and intermediate dimension (4 dimensions) is most complicated.

===Geometric Topology===
For instance, the [[w:surgery exact sequence|surgery exact sequence]] classifies [[w:homology manifold|homology manifold]]s.
* In Diff, the structure set has no group structure, and is not functorial
* In PL, the structure set is almost a group and functorial, but there's a &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}/2&lt;/math&gt; error (the [[w:Kirby–Siebenmann invariant|Kirby–Siebenmann invariant]]),
* In Top, the structure set has a group structure and is functorial, but there is a factor of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}&lt;/math&gt; error.
* In homology manifolds, it deals with the &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{Z}&lt;/math&gt; factor.

===Algebraic Geometry===
Similarly, in the [[w:Enriques–Kodaira classification|Enriques–Kodaira classification]] of complex surfaces,
complex surfaces have complicated constrains on their [[w:Chern number|Chern number]]s (the question of which Chern numbers can be realized by complex surfaces is the [[w:Surface of general type|geography of Chern numbers]], and is still an open question), while ''almost'' complex surfaces can have any Chern numbers such that &lt;math&gt;c_1^2+c_2 \equiv 0 \pmod{12}&lt;/math&gt;.

==Other categories of manifolds==
''See also: [[w:Categories of manifolds|Categories of manifolds]]''
Manifolds are studied outside of geometric topology; the approaches and theories vary significantly between fields.

===Point-set generalizations===
Relaxing the [[w:point-set topology|point-set]] conditions in the [[w:manifold#Mathematical definition|definition of manifold]] yield broader classes of manifolds, which are studied in [[w:general topology|general topology]]:

* non-[[w:second countable|second countable]] manifolds, such as the [[w:Long line (topology)|long line]]
* [[w:non-Hausdorff manifold|non-Hausdorff manifold]]s, such as &quot;the line with two origins&quot;

===Analytic categories: infinite-dimensional===
Modeling a manifold on a possibly infinite-dimensional [[w:topological vector space|topological vector space]] over the reals yields the following classes of manifolds, which are studied in [[w:functional analysis|functional analysis]]:

*[[w:Hilbert manifold|Hilbert manifold]]
*[[w:Banach manifold|Banach manifold]]
*[[w:Fréchet manifold|Fréchet manifold]]

To explain the motivation for this entry – the notion of “forgetting structure” and “admitting a structure” is fundamental to how Geometric Topologists understand the various kinds of manifolds and their relations: this is “one way to organize your thinking about manifolds”.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;'''The Number Sets of N, Z, Q and R'''&lt;/big&gt;

'''N''' - Natural Numbers.  These are in the set (1, 2, 3...)

 We say &quot;March has 31 days&quot; or &quot;There are 15 students in my math class&quot; We count with the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4...

 We also use these numbers for ordering. We say &quot;This is the first year of my math studies course&quot; or &quot;Alison came second in the race&quot;

'''Z''' - Integers.  The set includes (...-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3...)

'''Q''' - Rational Numbers.  These are the fractions created by dividing one integer by another.  This set can include decimals numbers as long as they can be transformed into a fraction.

'''R''' - The Real Numbers.  This includes all of the above.  In addition, it includes the irrational numbers such as pi (3.14...) or e (2.71...).  Irrationals are real decimal numbers that follow no pattern and are without end.  Any decimal that ends or follows a pattern is a rational number.

Real Numbers can be understood best by comparing them with their evil twin - the imaginary numbers.  Imaginary numbers are found when someone tries to take the square root of a negative number.  Since, logically speaking, this is a no no, mathematicians use &quot;i&quot; to represent an imaginary number.  Luckily, we do not use imaginary numbers in Math Studies.  The rule of thumb for Real numbers is &quot;if you can count it, it is real.&quot;  

&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''Significant Figures'''&lt;/big&gt;

Unless otherwise written, answers in IB Math Studies are always to be given to three significant figures.  So, what, you are dying to know, is a significant figure?  Significant figures are like gremlins, they have to follow certain rules or things get out of control.  So here are the rules for keeping Gizmo safe:

1.  Always count nonzero digits

Example:  348 has three significant figures.  27 has two.

2.  Never count leading zeros

Example:  021 and 0.021 both have two significant figures

3.  Always count zeros which fall somewhere between two nonzero digits

Example:  20.8 has three significant figures, while 0.00104009 has six

4.  Zeros after the last non-zero digit are not significant

Example:  498,000 has three significant figures

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Computer Science Explored ==

Computer Science Explored is an attempt to create a public resource for middle and high school CS teachers based on the ideas of [http://www.csunplugged.org/ CSUnplugged] and [http://csta.acm.org/Curriculum/sub/ExploringCS.html Exploring Computer Science] initiatives. 
It is hoped that this will serve as a &quot;missing manual&quot; for the teachers of these courses.

* A Brief look into History
**Before computer hardware

:The first use of the word &quot;computer&quot; was recorded in 1613, referring to a person who carried out calculations, or computations, and the word continued to be used in that sense until the middle of the 20th century. This means that at first, &quot;a computer&quot; was a &quot;person&quot;.  From the end of the 19th century onwards though, the word began to take on its more familiar meaning, &quot;a machine that carries out computations&quot;, such as a physical computer device.

===='''Price Elasticity of Demand (PED)'''====
----
[[Image:Elasticdmd.jpg|300px|right]]
''The responsiveness of the quantity demanded of a good to a change in its price''
:*Elasticity measures the sensitivity of demand (quantity demanded) to changes in variables such as its own price
:*If the supply curve shifts because of government subsidies, it is useful to know the impact on the price and the quantity demanded
[[Image:Inelasticdmd.jpg|300px|right]]

'''Formula'''
:* %Change in Quantity Demanded of Good A&lt;math&gt; /&lt;/math&gt; %Change in Price of Good A (where QD means ‘change in’)
:*Measures responsiveness by dividing the percentage change in quantity demanded by the percentage change in price
:*As price and quantity demanded are inversely related the equation is always negative, but we tend to ignore the negative sign and report a whole number
:*The term on the top is the slope of the demand curve, while the term on the bottom is the slope of the ray from the origin to the point on the curve where you are measuring elasticity

'''Possible range of values'''
:*PED &gt; 1: Demand is elastic
:*PED &lt; 1: Demand in inelastic
:*PED = 1: Demand is unit elastic
:*PED = 0: Demand is perfectly inelastic
:*PED = &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;: Demand is perfectly elastic

''Elastic demand (h &gt; 1)'':
:*A subsidy leads to an outward shift in supply, prices fall leading to a large increase in quantity demanded (%Dq &gt; %Dp)
:*If price fell by 10% and quantity demanded rose by 50%, the elasticity would be equal to 5, an unusually high number for elasticity

''Inelastic demand: (h &lt; 1)'':
:*A subsidy leads to an outward shift in supply, prices fall but there is only a small increase in quantity demanded (%Dq &lt; %Dp)
:*If price fell by 10% and quantity demanded rose by only 5%, elasticity is equal to 0.5

''Unit elastic demand (h = 1)'': 
:*If the responsiveness is about the same as the change in price, then the measure will be equal to (minus) one (%Dq = %Dp)

''Perfectly inelastic (h = 0)'': 
:*No change in quantity demanded (%Dq = 0)

''Perfectly elastic (h = &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;)'':
:*Infinite change in quantity demanded (%Dq = &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;)


'''Diagrams illustrating the range of values of elasticity'''

''Point Elasticity''
:*Measures the responsiveness of quantity to price at a particular point on the demand curve
:*The slope is given by the tangent to that point, and is often measured as dq/dp, which is determined by calculus
:*The slope of the ray is given by: q/p, the p and q corresponding to that point are used (rather than average p and q over an arc of the curve)
[[Image:Elasoverstraightline.jpg|300px|right]]


'''Varying elasticity along a straight-line demand curve'''
:*Elasticity along a straight line demand curve varies from zero at the quantity axis to infinity at the price axis
:*In the diagram at right:
::*Below the midpoint of a straight line demand curve, elasticity is less than one and the ''firm wants to raise price to increase TR''
::*Above the midpoint, elasticity is greater than one and the ''firm wants to lower price to increase TR''
::*At the midpoint, E1, elasticity is equal to one
:*For the straight demand curve, the ranges of elasticity are given by the formula: η = EF / CE

:*For the curved demand curve, EF is the distance from the point where the tangent intersects the x axis to the tangency point divided by the distance from the tangency point to the intersection with the y axis
::*For a hyperbola, the point of tangency will always be the midpoint of a straight line and therefore, the elasticity is always equal to one along the curve

:*Where there are two straight line demand curves of the same slope, the one furthest from the origin is less elastic at each price than the closer one
:*Where two demand curves of different slopes intersect, the elasticities are different because the slopes are different at that point


'''Factors of PED'''
:*Closeness of substitutes
::*If there are many substitutes available, consumers can easily switch to other goods if prices rise
::*Demand within product groups tends to be fairly elastic:
:::*The demand for gas versus electricity or gas versus diesel is fairly elastic
:::*However, for energy as a whole, demand tends to be very inelastic because there are no close substitutes for hydrocarbons
:*Luxury or necessity
::*Addiction: some goods are habit forming and tend to be price inelastic: e.g., coffee
::*Need: medicine: e.g., insulin
:*Percentage of income spent on the good
::*Size of item in budget: if consumers spend only a small amount on the item (e.g., matches for lighting candles) relative to their budget, it is likely to be inelastic (not sensitive to price changes)
:*Time Period
::*It may be difficult to find substitutes in the short-run so demand is likely to be less elastic in the short run than in the long-run
:*Branding

====Price Elasticity of Supply (PES)====
----
''The measure of the responsiveness of the quantity supplied of a particular good to a change in its price''
: %Change QS / %Change in Price

'''Possible range of values''':
:*PES &gt; 1: Supply is elastic
:*PES &lt; 1: Supply is inelastic
:*PES = 0: if the supply curve is vertical, and there is no response to prices
:*PES = &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt;: if the supply curve is horizontal

'''Diagrams illustrating the range of values of elasticity''':
:*Any straight line supply curve intersecting:
::*The origin has an elasticity of one: at every point along the curve, the slope of the ray (q/p) equals the slope of the line (Dq/Dp)
::*The price axis is elastic
::*The quantity axis is inelastic

'''Determinants of PES''':
:* Number of producers (ease of entry): the fewer the barriers to entry, the easier for firms to enter the industry to increase supply in response to an increase in price and supply is elastic
:* Spare capacity: if there is unused capacity, it is easy to increase production if demand should start to shift out
:*Ease of switching: if land and labour can be shifted easily from growing one crop to another, the supply will be more elastic:
::*Even if it is possible to shift inputs, if the cost of inputs rises production costs will rise rapidly as output rises and supply will be inelastic
::*Over the longer term as cheaper inputs are substituted and new production methods incorporated into the firm, outputs will tend to increase and prices will tend to moderate
:* Ease of storage: if it is easy to store production, the more elastic supply response to increases in demand
:* Length of production period: the more quickly the good can be made, the easier to respond to an increase in price
:* Time period of training: over time the firm can train labour and invest in more capital equipment and supply is more elastic in its response to price increases
:* Factor mobility: the easier it is to move resources into the industry, the more elastic the supply curve
:* How costs react:
::*If costs rise only slowly as production increases, a rise in price will stimulate a large increase in quantity supplied
::*If costs of production rise rapidly as output rises, then the stimulus to production which comes from rising prices will quickly be choked off

====Income Elasticity of Demand (YED)====
-----
[[Image:Incomeelasticity.jpg|300px|right]]
''The responsiveness of the quantity demanded of a good to a change in income''
:*Income elasticity measures the percentage change in quantity demanded as income changes

'''Formula'''
:* %Change in QD / %Change Y

:*'''Normal goods''': when income increases, demand for normal goods increases as well
::*Positive YED
::*An increase in income leads to an increase in consumption, demand shifts to the right


:*'''Inferior goods''': when income increases, demand for this good falls 
:*Negative YED
:*The demand curve shifts left as income rises. As income rises, the proportion spent on food tends to fall while the proportion spent on services tends to rise

:*''For basic or necessity goods, where 0 &lt; h &lt; 1'':
::*Quantity demanded will not increase much as income increases (income elasticity for food = 0.2)

:*''For luxury goods, h &gt; 1'':
::*Quantity demanded rises faster than income, e.g., for restaurant meals income elasticity is higher than for food, because of the additional restaurant service
 
'''Income and Substitution Effects'''
:*When the price of a good falls there are two effects:
::*''Substitution effect'': people buy more because it is relatively cheaper.
::*''Income effect'': real income rises because of the lower price of the good:
:::*Normal goods: the consumer buys more of all normal goods, the income effect reinforces the substitution effect
:::*Inferior goods: the consumer buys less of all inferior goods, the income effect works against the substitution effect

'''Application of income elasticity to economic growth''':
:As economies grow, income elasticity helps determine what should be produced:
::*Firms will want to avoid producing inferior goods
::*Countries are at various stages of economic development and so have widely different income elasticities for the same products
::*As overseas incomes grow it may create new markets as demand shifts from inferior to normal goods

====Cross Elasticity of Demand====
----
''The responsiveness of the quantity demanded of one good to a change in price of another good''
:*Price cross elasticity tells us the relationship amongst goods:
::*Bottle makers find they are in competition with producers of cans

'''Formula'''
:*%Change in QD of Good A / %Change in the Price of Good B

'''Significance of signs with respect to compliments and substitutes
:* If the goods are ''complements'', the value will be ''negative''
::*''Complementary goods'':
:::*Quantity demanded increases when the price of the complement falls
:::*If the price of gas fell to 10 cents a litre, sales of cars would increase

:* A ''positive'' value signifies that the two goods are ''substitutes''
::*''Substitute goods'':
:::*Quantity demanded of one good falls when the price of the substitute falls
:::*If the price of coffee rises, people tend to consume less coffee and more tea

====Taxes (HL)====

----
[[Image:Adveloremtax.jpg|300px|right]]
'''Flat rate and ad valorem taxes'''
:* A flat rate tax is a tax which is the same rate regardless of price or income 
::*Greater burden on those with lower income
*An ad valorem tax is a tax which is a percentage of the price of a good
:*The United States has an ad valorem tax of ten percent

'''Incidence (burden) of indirect taxes and subsidies on the producer and consumer'''
:*Firms try to pass these increased costs on to consumers
::*An indirect tax raises the price of a good: its elasticity determines if the burden of the tax is on the producer or on the consumer 
:::*In the case of a good with inelastic demand the tax burden can be easily passed on to the consumer (PED is less than PES)
::*Who actually pays the tax very much depends on the elasticities of the two curves

'''Implication of elasticity of supply and demand for the incidence (burden) of taxation'''
:*If the product is demand inelastic or supply elastic, the consumer would need to bear the majority of the burden of tax
::*If demand is more inelastic than supply the consumer will pay a greater proportion or incidence of tax
::*It is easier for consumers to shift the tax back to the producer if there are easily available substitutes
[[Image:Specifictax.jpg|300px|right]]
:*If the product is demand elastic or supply inelastic, the producer would need to bear the majority of the burden of tax
::*If supply is more inelastic than demand, the supplier will pay a greater proportion or incidence of tax
:::*A tax on pure profits should not have any influence on price or output, thus the producer bears the full burden
::::*If the govt imposed a 15% tax, then profits would fall, but this would be true no matter what level of output would be produced
::::*If the definition of profits includes payments to factors such as shareholders, the incidence of a profits tax could be shared by shareholders (lower profits on capital), wage earners (lower wages) or by consumers (higher prices)

'''PED and government'''
:*Used by government:
::*Will help determine the impact of an indirect (sales) tax on quantity demanded and the resulting tax revenue
::*Will help determine the impact of any shift in supply due to subsidies in terms of consumer spending and producer revenues
:*Indirect taxes are placed on suppliers and have the effect of raising costs shifting the supply curve in:
::*Ad valorem taxes add a percentage on to prices
::*Specific or unit taxes adds a fixed amount on to costs
[[Image:Deadweightloss.jpg|300px|right]]
'''Deadweight Loss'''
:*If landlords try to raise rents by the amount of the tax, from A to B, there will be excess supply, rents fall and a new equilibrium at C
:*The landlord receives the rental price of R1, but pays the tax equal to the difference between R1 and R1-t
:*The landlord’s share of the burden is the difference between Ro and R1-t
:*The tenant’s share of the burden is the difference between R1 and Ro
:*The ''deadweight loss represents the loss in social net benefits that no-one receives'': it occurs because less is supplied than is socially optimal
::*If demand were perfectly inelastic, the tenant would bear the whole burden
::*If demand were perfectly elastic, the landlord would bear the whole burden
::*The deadweight loss is less the more inelastic the demand and supply
:*Often referred to as a distortion: the more quantity responds because the curves are elastic, the more quantity will fall as taxes are imposed
::*This is referred to as a tax distortion because it distorts the way demand and supply would normally respond in a tax-free market

==== Applications of concepts of elasticity====
----
'''PED and business decisions (the firm): the effect of price changes on total revenue'''
:*PED may be important for businesses attempting to distinguish how to maximize revenue
::*For example, if a business finds out its PED is very inelastic, it may want to raise its prices
::*If a business finds that its PED is very elastic, it may wish to lower its prices 
:*PED may be important for a government to find the impact of a tax or subsidy 

:*Total Revenue: is equal to P*Q
::*By estimating the effect of a price change, firms can plan the number of goods to produce and estimate their potential revenue

:*''Inelastic demand'': price and total revenue are positively related
::*If firms cut prices by 10% but sales only increase by 5%, revenues fall
::*A rise in price will not only increase revenue but will also increase profit as costs will fall because less is produced
::*The increase in the number demanded is too small to offset the drop in the price of each good sold
:::*Example: the oil industry where demand is inelastic, as prices rise, quantity demanded does not fall very much

:*''Elastic demand'': price and total revenue are negatively related
::*If demand is elastic, a fall in price will increase revenue but not necessarily increase profit as production must increase quantity demanded increases
::*If quantity demanded increased 50% when price fell by 10%, revenues increase
::*The increase in the number demanded is more than enough to offset the fall in the price of each good sold

:*''Unit elastic demand'':
::*Total revenue is constant regardless of changes in prices
::*The cut in prices is exactly offset by the increase in the quantity demanded, and total revenue to producers will stay the same


'''PED and taxation'''
:* Governments may wish to know how a tax or subsidy will affect a good 


'''Cross-elasticity of demand''':
:* Competitors may wish to know what will happen if there is a change in complements, or substitutes
:*Firms can determine the impact on sales and revenues of price changes by rivals, or when they or another industry changes the price of complements
:*During the oil crisis in the 1970s prices rose 400% in the space of three months but quantity demanded fell by less than 5% the first year
::*More energy efficient cars were bought by consumers
::*Companies switched to using coal instead of oil in their furnaces

:*In the longer term, new supplies of oil were found, and the real price of oil declined as consumers switched to substitutes
:*For goods like energy it takes time to use up the stock of appliances and machinery and switch to those using energy in a more efficient manner


'''Significance of income elasticity for sectoral change (primary&gt; secondary &gt; tertiary) as economic growth occurs'''
:*As economies grow (and move from primary to secondary to tertiary production)
::*Firms will plan on producing fewer inferior goods
::*Production and purchasing of capital goods and other factors can be planned
::*Production for exports can be planned as new markets open and close

:*Primary sector is generally income inelastic 
:*Just because a person's income changes does not mean he will buy more tomatoes
:*However, secondary and tertiary sectors tend to be income elastic; a change in income will have a big impact on quantity demanded of cars, or the demand for personal massages

      <text xml:space="preserve">===2.4 Market Failure===
----- 
''When the price mechanism fails to take into account all the costs and/or benefits in providing and/or consuming the good, the market will fail to supply the socially optimal amount''
:*The competitive forces of supply and demand will not produce quantities of goods where the prices reflect the marginal benefit (utility) of consumption - this in turn leads to over-/under consumption of the good, i.e. allocative inefficiency

====Reasons for market failure====
-----
''Most markets are NOT successful, and the government intervenes to some degree''

:*Perfect markets are socially efficient, they are operating at Pareto optimality in which no one can be made better off with someone being made worse off (zero sum) 
::*Consumer surplus is maximized
::*P=MC where MSC=MSB

:*In the real world, markets are not perfect; ''MSC does not equal MSB and market failure occurs''
:*This is because of externalities, underprovision of merit goods, the overprovision of demerit goods, a lack of public goods, and imperfect markets
:*If the free market is left to its own devices, Pareto market failure '''will''' occur 

:*'''Inefficient Producers''': producers '''do not''' produce where the average costs are at minimum 
:*Therefore they are using more resources than they need to

:*'''Positive and Negative externalities''': an externality is an effect on a third party which is caused by the consumption and/or production of a good or service 
:*There are four types of externalities
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Positive Consumption Externalities.jpg|&lt;small&gt;Positive Consumption Externality&lt;/small&gt;
File:Negative Consumption Externalities.jpg|&lt;small&gt;Negative Consumption Externality&lt;/small&gt;
File:Negative Production Externality.jpg|&lt;small&gt;Negative Production Externality&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/gallery&gt;

:*'''Short-term and long-term environmental concerns, with reference to sustainable development'''
:*'''Lack of public goods''' : public goods are goods which total cost of production does not increase with the number of consumers
&lt;br /&gt;Public goods are:&lt;br /&gt;1. non-rivalrous (consumption by one consumer will not reduce the amount available for other consumers in the market, i.e. they do not have to compete to obtain the good/service)&lt;br /&gt;2. non-excludable (no consumer is excluded from consuming such good/service)

::*The classic example is national defence
::*Other examples: street lights, roads 
:*Public goods will not be provided by the market

:*'''Underprovision of merit goods''': if left to its own devices, merit goods (a private good that society considers underconsumed, often with positive externalities) will be underprovided
::*These are goods and services which have a positive effect on society like education, healthcare and sports centers

:*'''Overprovision of demerit goods''': if left to its own devices, demerit goods (a private good that society considers overconsumed, often with negative externalities) will be overprovided
::*These are such things as prostitution, alcohol and cigarettes
::*To discourage these demerit goods the government creates: negative advertising, tax on the good, or bans it altogether

:*'''Abuse of monopoly power''': imperfect markets such as oligopolies and monopolies restrict output in an attempt to maximize profit
::*Thus, MSB is not equal to MSC / MSC is equal to MR

====Possible government responses====
-----
:*'''Legislation''': antitrust legislation can be brought in an attempt to break monopoly power and collusive oligopolies
::*Legislation to make high school attendance mandatory
::*Ban smoking in restaurants

:*'''Direct provision of merit and public goods''': governments can control the supply of goods that have positive externalities by supplying a high amount of education, public roads, parks, libraries, etc.
:*'''Taxation''': place a 'sin tax' on the sale of tobacco products to discourage consumption
::*This will internalize some of the external costs (i.e., smokers will pay for their second hand smoke through the tax)

:*'''Subsidies''': reduce the cost of university education because it has beneficial externalities 
::*The price will be reduced to reflect the benefit society attains through the education of individuals

:*'''Tradable permits''': tradable permits are permits allowing a firm to produce a given amount of pollution
::*There is limited supply for how much pollution a firm can produce so if a firm would want to pollute more it has to purchase tradable permits from other firms
::*A Carbon Tax (taxing consumption which causes pollution, such as fossil fuels) achieves the same result
::*In both cases, firms and individuals are motivated to reduce costs by reducing environmental damage

:*'''Extension of property rights''': form of privatization to privatize certain non-private goods
::*e.g., lakes, rivers, beach=&gt; create a market for pollution and charge people if they want to pollute something

:*'''Advertising to encourage and discourage consumption''':

:*'''International cooperation among governments''': in the case of acid rain, for example international cooperation among governments is necessary in order to reduce its occurrence

      <comment>/* Basic Definitions */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">====Basic Definitions====
'''Social science'''
:*''The study of society and the way individuals interact within it. 
::*Examples include sociology, political science, psychology, anthropology, history, and (of course) economics.''

'''Needs'''
:*''Something we MUST have in order to survive'' (e.g. water, food, housing)

'''Wants'''
:*''Something we desire (e.g., pens, computers, automobiles)
::*We have unlimited wants and limited resources 

'''Economics'''
:*''The study of rationing systems; of how society employs its finite resources in the attempt to satisfy infinite wants''

'''Microeconomics'''
:*''The study of individual economic units such as households and firms''
[[Image:PPF_expansion.svg‎|380px|right]]
'''Macroeconomics'''
:*''The study of the economy as a whole (e.g., a country, inflation, unemployment)''

'''Economic growth'''
:*''An increase in real GDP or an increase in the quantity of resources''
::*Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is often used to measure economic growth
::*See PPF diagram at right

'''Economic development'''
:*''A qualitative measure of a country's standard of living which takes into account numerous factors such as education and health
::*The Human Development Index is normally used to measure a country's economic development

'''Sustainable development'''
:*''The rate at which a country can develop without compromising the needs of future generations''

'''Positive and Normative Concepts'''
:*''Positive'': Based on testable theories (e.g., a hike in interest rates leads to a fall in aggregate demand can be proven using data)
::*Positive economics is based on theories which can be tested by looking at past data
::*Positive statements concern what is, was or will be: assertions about the world
:*''Normative'': Based on opinion/norms
::*Uses words such as &quot;should&quot; (i.e., the government should make fixing unemployment its number one priority)
::*Normative economics is based on opinion
::*Normative statements often include words such as ‘should’ or ought to’ and involve value judgements about what is good and what is bad
::*Normative statements are not testable: 'ought we to be more concerned about unemployment than about inflation?'
::*In democracies normative statements are often settled by voting

'''Ceteris Paribus'''
:*Latin for ''all other things being equal''
::*Since Economics is basically the study of society, we have to understand that there are thousands of variables present, and to control each one of these variables is downright impossible
::*Thus we make everything else &quot;ceteris paribus&quot; in order to see the effect of one aspect
:*With all other factors or things remaining the same:
::*This means that we change one parameter at a time and watch how it influences the variables
:::*For example: if the government cuts income taxes in order to lead to an increase in personal income, we would like to see whether consumption rises
:::*If we hold everything else constant, we expect that most people will spend more money when their income rises
:::*However, if at the same time there was a jump in prices and interest rates, people might not spend more money
::::*This is why it is so important to isolate one change from another
::::*In real life, of course, that is usually not possible and we have to make adjustments

'''Factors of production (FoP)'''
::*''Basic components or inputs which are required in the production of goods and services''
:::*'''Land''': Gifts of nature, this includes everything on the land, under the land, above the land, or in the sea (e.g., oil, water)
:::*'''Labour''': The human component hired to assist in producing a good or service
::::*Simply the number of hours of work put in by a person
:::*'''Capital''': Any man-made aid to production
::::*It is physical plant, machinery, equipment and buildings; it is not the money that you invest in the stock market
:::*'''Entrepreneurship''': Combines the other factors and takes risks recognizing the possibility of gain from employing these factors in a specific way
::::*An entrepreneur is the one who sees an economic opportunity and mixes land, labor and capital together to produce a product with economic value
::::*It is estimated that 85% of small businesses go bankrupt during the first five years; and 85% of those that survive go bankrupt in the next five years
::::*There is a great scarcity of good management talent in the world

'''Factors of Payment''':
::*Land: rent
::*Labour: wages (costs associated with using labour and are usually paid on an hourly/salary/commission basis)
::*Capital: interest
:::*Profit: this is the return on investment in capital equipment:
::::*We assume investments in capital equipment earn the opportunity cost rate of return (OCRR) in the market
::::*Anything earned in excess of the OCRR is referred to as abnormal or super-normal profit or pure profit or economic profit
:::*Abnormal profit: the amount earned in excess of normal profit and is calculated as the difference between what you receive for selling a good or service and the cost of producing it, including the effort you had to put into it and the OCRR you could expect to earn on the money invested in capital equipment
::::*We refer to the amount received as total revenue, and the costs as total costs.  Thus profit is equal to total revenue minus total cost
::::*Most firms maximize profits by trying to increase revenues through better marketing, and decreasing costs through more efficient systems of production
::::*If firms do not maximize profits, they will either not grow anymore because there are no profits to re-invest in the business, or they will be bought out by someone else who will then force the firm to profit maximize
::*Entrepreneurship: profit

:*Natural resources include all the resources we use such as land, trees, water, minerals
::*In Europe, rent is the income paid on natural resources such as land
::*In North America, rent is what is paid to rent an apartment and payments for using natural resources are called natural resource costs or raw material costs
:*There is some controversy about how to include environmental resources such as clean air, clean water, quietness etc.
::*When these are polluted there is a cost, how should that be included, and who should pay for it?

'''Economic Sectors'''
::*The primary sector involves the extraction of resources: farming, fishing, forestry and mining
::*The secondary sector involves the conversion of natural resources into goods: manufacturing and construction
::*The tertiary sector involves the production of services: finance and tourism
::*The quarternary sector involves production of technology, information services, education

:*In the private sector resources are owned by private individuals
::*Consumers are grouped into households which own the resources and decide what to buy and in what quantities 
:*Rather than specialize on their own, most people sell their labour services to a firm and receive money wages in return
:*They also sell the services of other factors to firms in return for income
:*Producers expect to cover their costs with the revenue they obtain from selling:
::*Profit maximization is essential otherwise the firm falls behind or is bought up by another firm which will force the first firm to maximize profits
::*Firms are the principle users of factors of production, they account for 85% of employment in most Industrialized countries
	
:*In the public sector production is in public hands: owned and controlled by the state which both buys and produces goods and services
::*We cannot assume that govts. always act in a consistent manner
::*Various governments make laws, the courts interpret these laws and uphold them
::*Any government measures that impose large costs with few obvious benefits to the current generation are unlikely to be popular:  
:::*Long run benefits are sometimes ignored: the planting of trees will only be enjoyed by future generations which do not have a vote today, therefore govt. will not spend money on planting trees
:::*There is uncertainty about the future: it is hard to make decisions today which may have long term consequences

====Choice====
-----

'''Scarcity'''
:*''The observation that no resource is infinite''

'''Utility'''
::*''The satisfaction gained from the consumption of a good or service''
::*Most people are assumed to be motivated by rational desires
::*Most people derive enjoyment or utility from the goods and services they consume, and most understand that the first amount of enjoyment from consuming a good is often the highest
:::*As more and more is consumed, the level of enjoyment starts to decrease
::::*This is referred to as the concept of diminishing marginal utility
:::*The demand curve slopes downward because of the law of diminishing marginal utility (extra happiness)
:::*The marginal utility is the enjoyment received from the next unit of whatever is being consumed, and it diminishes as more is consumed
::::*Most people try to maximize total utility or enjoyment by consuming more than one good: as the marginal utility from consuming one good starts to fall from consuming more, you switch to another good where the marginal utility is higher (e.g., we do not just eat one food such as hamburger, we get more enjoyment from mixing it with other foods such as salad, potatoes and vegetables)
:::*The marginal utility gained from buying an extra ice cream decreases with every ice cream we buy at a fixed price
[[Image:Ppf2_small.png‎|400px|right]]

'''Opportunity cost'''
::*''The cost of the next best alternative forgone'' 
::*The cost of using a resource measured in terms of the sacrifice foregone in the next best alternative
::*When the best alternative is chosen from a range of alternatives the second best choice is the opportunity cost
:::*If I have $5.00 and can either buy a tamogotchi or dinner, and I buy the tamogotchi, then the opportunity cost is the dinner I could have bought
::::*Defined in terms of the THING that is forgone (i.e., not the monetary value)

'''Production Possibility Frontier (PPF)'''
::*''A curve depicting all maximum output possibilities for two or more goods given a set of inputs (resources, labor, etc.). The PPF assumes that all inputs are used efficiently.

'''Free Goods'''
::*''A good with no scarcity, that has unlimited supply and therefore no price'' 
:::*Free goods involve no opportunity cost such as fresh air, but they become economic goods if opportunity costs are involved in such things as removing pollution from the air
:::* A good which has no opportunity cost associated with its consumption

'''Economic goods'''
::*''A good which is scarce and therefore has a possible opportunity cost''
::*Consumption goods are purchased by consumers and consist of perishable goods such as fresh food, semi-durable goods such as clothing, and durable goods such as cars
::*Capital goods also referred to as producer goods are simply capital used in the production of consumer goods
[[Image:PPF_opportunity_cost.svg‎|330px|right]]
:*'''Specialization'''
::*Populations were fairly limited until the agricultural revolution and hunter gatherers were forced to do everything for themselves
::*Once agriculture developed people were able to specialize in the things they were best at doing, productivity increased dramatically  
::*This created a surplus which could be traded for goods produced by people who had specialized in other areas

'''Trade'''
::*Trading occurred in markets where people could buy things more cheaply than they could make them
::*Originally, goods were traded through barter, but this required a simultaneity of desire: you had to find someone who had what you wanted and at the same time they had to want what you had to offer  
::*Time was wasted trying to find satisfactory exchanges, and money was invented which eliminated the inconvenience of barter.  
:::*This release of wasted time led to a further increase in the surplus
	
'''Industrialization'''
::*The industrial revolution introduced machinery allowing further specialization:
:::*Division of labour: workers specialized at tasks increasing productivity
:::*Economies of scale: gains from bulk buying, large scale financing, and the use of large scale machinery permitted even further gains in productivity
:*We moved from labour intense production which uses relatively large amounts of labour compared to other factors, to capital intense production where relatively large amounts of capital are used compared to other factors
:*Resequencing: there are many ways to fabricate the parts for a product, and many different ways of assembling it
::*By altering the sequence of actions, a firm can find the most efficient way to fabricate parts and assemble them into a final product creating further gains in productivity and reductions in cost

==Introduction==

Reggae is a musical form that is rarely treated in guitar books. Its a syncopated music which is often difficult to notate and reggae guitarists are rarely given the chance to play extended solos. In many respects, the reggae guitarist is a fundamental part of the rhythm section. The guitar is often heard doubling the bassline with muted pick work or providing a steady chordal backbeat on the 2nd and 4th beat. This simple assignment of guitar role belies the true complexity of what is a fascintaing guitar style. 

Reggae was born out of the West Indian 1950s rhythm 'n' blues music scene. It was a unique local rhythmic twist of a very popular world-wide genre. An excellent example is Easy Snappin' by Theophilus Beckford. This huge 1950s West Indian hit record is pure rhythm 'n' blues in structure but there's a change in the syncopation. Its more emphasised and the vocals have a vernacular flavour. The guitarist on this seminal record is Ernest Ranglin. Ranglin plays an incredibly fast blues inflected line to support the rhythm. The guitar sound belongs to the period that gave us Chuck Berry but the solo itself is uniquely Jamaican. The guitar work of Peter Tosh with The Wailers provides a blueprint for the 1970s. To hear Tosh play &quot;Stir It Up&quot; on the recording is a revelation. The effect laden guitar part is so integrated into the performance that it difficult to hear it as a single entity. Rock guitar has given us riffs such as &quot;Satisfaction&quot; by The Rolling Stones or &quot;Sweet Child Of Mine&quot; by Guns and Roses and these riffs can be learned and enjoyed separate from the songs they originated from. Reggae is the opposite; it demands of the guitarist complete rhythmic awareness of the other instruments and the ability to submerge the guitar into the harmonic and rhythmic framework.


====Harmony====
The chords used in reggae are the same as most other genres but due to the need to create a syncopated rhythm open chords are rarely used throughout a piece. The most common chord shapes are barres or half-barres with emphasis placed on the treble strings. It is quite common in reggae to use minor keys and to use the dominant chord in its minor form and therefore the music may never form a perfect cadence. Here is a sixteen bar reggae chord progression in the key of Gm:

{|class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center; width:220px;&quot;

Try to play the chord progression with a reggae rhythm using the chords below. Note the fingering given for the Dm chord.

File:Dm chord for guitar (5th position 2nd inversion).png|'''Dm'''

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/font&gt;

====Offbeat====

The most common approach to reggae rhythm guitar is to play the chords on the offbeat. The majority of reggae songs use common time. Common time has four beats to a bar and the offbeats are 2 and 4. To play a reggae rhythm you count &quot;1 - 2 - 3 - 4 -&quot; and only strike the chord on 2 and 4. Its a common technique to dampen the chord after striking so as to create a percussive short sound. Damping can be achieved in two ways: either by using the right-hand palm flesh to stop the notes from sounding or by releasing the finger pressure of the left hand that holds a chord shape. The left-hand technique is favoured by reggae guitarists since the placing of the right-hand palm edge against the strings near the bridge is more awkward to use. When you relieve the finger pressure of the left-hand; do not remove your fingers from the chord. To produce a short precussive sound you only need to release the pressure you are applying ensuring that the chord stops sounding and that your fingers are in-place to press  down again. The left-hand offbeat technique is not ideal for chords that contain open strings and is most typically used with chords that have no open strings sounding (see chords above).

==Exercise One==

Here is a typical reggae rhythm played on the offbeat. After striking the chord remember to release the pressure on the strings immediately to produce a short percussive sounding chord.

&lt;br style=&quot;clear:both&quot; /&gt;
====Doubling The Bassline====

Reggae guitarists often &quot;double the bassline&quot;. The top four strings of the guitar are the same as the bass guitar. The guitarist will play the same notes with the same rhythm as the bass usually in the same position. Sometimes the guitarist will choose to dampen the strings by placing the fleshy edge of their right-hand palm lightly against the strings near the bridge. The aim of this is not to stop the strings from sounding but to slightly dampen the strings so that they have a percussive attack. 

Its not always the case that the guitar doubles the bass exactly. A common variation, borrowed from the soul and blues genres, is the playing of triplets using a fast up-and-down pick technique and using the same notes usually in the same position. This use of triplets against a &quot;four-to-the-floor&quot; bassline can impart a sense of driving rhythmic unity with variation.

====Working Out Horn Riffs====

Horns riffs are used in reggae to provide melodic support. For guitarists it helps when counting bars to understand what the horns are doing. A common device is to use horn riffs across barlines. This further adds to the syncopated feel of reggae. The horns may start on the 3rd or 4th beat of a bar playing the riff until the 2nd beat of the next bar. With practice it becomes very easy to count out these &quot;across the barline&quot; horn riffs. It may also provide the guitarist with riffs that he can use across barlines when playing with another guitarist who is strictly playing rhythm.

==Lesson==
===What is a Query===
A query is a way of asking the database some questions. 
*What clients' name begins with &quot;M&quot;?
*What clients are located on Main Street?
*What clients have paid more than $100.00?
*What clients belong to a certain employee?
*What client names begin with &quot;M&quot; and has paid more than $100.00?

===Query Guidelines===
===Simple Query Wizard===
*Go to the CREATE Tab
*Go to the OTHER group on the far right
*Click on Query Wizard
*This is just like creating a report
**Pick the table you want to query
**Pick the fields you want to look at
**Click NEXT
**Type in the title of the Query
**Click FINISH
Use the drop downs at the top of each column to sort, or limit the data. 
===Criteria Query===
*Click on View
*Click on Design View
[[File:AC2-Query_Design_View_Criteria.jpg]]
*Go to the Criteria for the Client Number and type in BOKE
*Click the exclamation point for RUN at the top
*The query will return only the records with an employee number of BOKE.

===Wildcards in Query===
&lt;p&gt;You use a wildcard to fill in for characters that you don't know.  If  you wanted to find a client whose name began with B you could do a query for B* like below. 
&lt;p&gt;[[File:AC2-Wildcard_Query.jpg]]
&lt;p&gt;Then when you run the query you get the results: 
&lt;p&gt;[[File:AC2-Wildcard_Query_Results.jpg]]
&lt;p&gt;You can also use a question mark for a wildcard.  A question mark replaces on character only. The asterisk replaces a group of characters. If you had employees Tom and Tim and wanted to list all of their clients you could do this by typing in T?M into the criteria field.

===AND Criteria Query===
&lt;p&gt;You can fill in multiple criteria from one column to the next and this will take on an AND relationship. 
&lt;p&gt;[[File:AC2-AND_Query.jpg]]
&lt;p&gt;Here we are querying companies that are on Main Street and paid more than $100.00

===OR Criteria Query===
&lt;p&gt;If you move one of the query criteria down one row to the OR field you create an OR Criteria. 
&lt;p&gt;[[File:AC2-OR_Query.jpg]]
&lt;p&gt;This query will list all the companies that are on Main Street OR paid more than $100.00

===Parameter Query===
&lt;p&gt;A parameter query is one that lets the user answer the question each time it is run to get to the records that they want.  This is very useful if a help desk person needs to access the records of a client each time they call to look up information quickly.  
&lt;p&gt;To set up this query you will need to type [] into the criteria field. 
&lt;p&gt;[[File:AC2-Parametery Query.jpg]]
&lt;p&gt;The program will then prompt the user to enter the Employee number when it is run and the following Pop-up will be displayed. 
&lt;p&gt;[[File:AC2-Popup_Parameter_Query.jpg]]
&lt;p&gt;The user would type in an employee number such as EJ and click OK
&lt;p&gt;Access would only display the records for employee number EJ
&lt;p&gt;[[File:AC2-Parametery_Query_Results.jpg]]

===Top Values Query===
*Go to Design View on your Query
*Go to the Design Tab
*Change the Return box to the number of records you want
*Change one of the items to be sorted
*Run the query

===Join Query===
*Click the Create Tab
*Go to the Other Group
*Click on Query Design
*Click on the tables and then ADD, one at a time
*Make sure the tables are RELATED - have a line joining them
**If they do not go to the Database Tools Tab and fix the relationship
**Or make sure the names are typed exactly the same
**Make sure the data types are the same
**Make sure the field size is the same
*Click and drag fields from each table into the query
*Click on RUN

===Calculation Query===
Sometimes you will want to calculate a value from values that you already have. 
*Create a query that has more than one either number, or currency field
*Go to Design View
*Go to the first column after all the fields you have already created
*Right click in the Field row
*Click on Zoom
*Type in the name of the column and then a colon
*Type in the field names in [] and then type the operation between the fields, do not put in any spaces
**total cost:[amount owed]-[amount paid]
*Click OK
*Run the Query

===Calculate Statistics===
*Create a query of Employee Number and Amount Paid from the client table
*Go to Design View
*Click on the TOTAL button at the top in the ribbon
*In the total row under Employee Number make sure it says Group By
*In the total row under Amount Paid change it to SUM or AVG
*Run the Query

===Crosstab Query===
*Click Create TAB
*Click Query Wizard
*Choose Crosstab Query and OK
*Click the table you want to work with - Client and click OK
*Move the Type of Advertisement to the Selected Fields side
*Click Next
*Click Employee Number
*Click Next
*Click Amount Due under field
*Click SUM under Function
*Click Next
*Type in a name for this query
*Click Finish

===Sorting===
There are two ways to sort your query: 
&lt;p&gt;From the query you can click the drop down and choose ascending or descending.  
[[File:AC2-Sort_from_Dropdown.jpg]]
&lt;p&gt;From the Design View you can choose different fields.  The field to the left is the primary sort key. 
&lt;p&gt;[[File:AC2-Sort_From_Design_view.jpg]]
&lt;P&gt;In this shot this will sort by the Clients and then by how much they have paid

===Sort and Omit Duplicates===
To omit duplicates you will need to open the Properties Sheet from the ribbon. Then go to the Unique Values item and change that to YES.

===Report of Query===

      <text xml:space="preserve">In this chapter we walk through two simple Gtk2-Perl applications. We will introduce some terminology and demonstrate some of the basic concepts of GUI programming with Gtk2-Perl.


== Hello World! ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
use strict;     
use warnings;   

use Gtk2;      
Gtk2-&gt;init;

my $window = Gtk2::Window-&gt;new;
my $label  = Gtk2::Label-&gt;new('Hello World!');

$window-&gt;signal_connect('delete-event' =&gt; sub { Gtk2-&gt;main_quit });

$window-&gt;add($label);

$label -&gt;show;
$window-&gt;show;

Gtk2-&gt;main;
&lt;/source&gt;



=== Breaking it down ===


&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
use strict;     
use warnings; 
&lt;/source&gt;

Because if someone hasn't told you to include these at the top of every Perl program you write, I'm telling you now.
&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
use Gtk2;      
&lt;/source&gt;

The Gtk+ libraries are included under the Gtk2 namespace.
&lt;br/&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;    
Gtk2-&gt;init;
&lt;/source&gt;

This method needs to be called from every Gtk2 application. It initializes the library for use, setting up things things like the color map and connecting the default signal handlers. This method also checks the arguments that have been passed to your application on the command line.  The following arguments are accepted by all Gtk applications. They will be removed from the argument list, leaving the rest for your application to handle.

    * --gtk-module
    * --g-fatal-warnings
    * --gtk-debug
    * --gtk-no-debug
    * --gdk-debug
    * --gdk-no-debug
    * --display
    * --sync
    * --name
    * --class

Instead of explicitly calling the init method yourself, you could call it implicitly like this.

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
use Gtk2 '-init';
&lt;/source&gt;



&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my $window = Gtk2::Window-&gt;new('toplevel');
my $label  = Gtk2::Label-&gt;new('Hello World!');
&lt;/source&gt;

These two lines create new &lt;b&gt;widgets&lt;/b&gt;. A widget is an element of the GUI. Windows, labels, buttons, menus, images are all examples of widgets. In this example we can see that the constructor to the window widget takes an argument telling it to make a top-level window, and the label widget can take some text to display. Different widgets accept different parameters to the constructor. Check the Gtk documentation for more information on specific widgets.



&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
$window-&gt;add($label);
&lt;/source&gt;

This line packs the label into the window. A window widget is an example of a container. A container widget is used to control how its children will be displayed on the screen. Container widgets have a variety of methods that can be used to add children. Here we are using a very basic example to display a label inside a window.



&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
$label -&gt;show;
$window-&gt;show;
&lt;/source&gt;
Can you guess what these lines do? 



&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
$window-&gt;show_all;
&lt;/source&gt;
We could have said this instead.



&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
Gtk2-&gt;main;
&lt;/source&gt;
Every Gtk application has must have a call to the main method. This turns control over the the Gtk main loop which waits for events to occur and then takes the proper action.



&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
$window-&gt;signal_connect('delete-event' =&gt; sub { Gtk2-&gt;main_quit });
&lt;/source&gt;

This line isn't forgotten. Here we attach a callback to the 'delete-event' of the window. A callback is a reference to a function. In this example we use an anonymous subroutine, which interrupts Gtk's main loop and returns control back over to the program. Any code after the call to Gtk2-&gt;main will be executed, in our example the program just closes. Had we not connected this callback to the 'delete-event', the window would have closed but our program would still have been running in the main loop, and the user would have no easy way to exit the application. (You could kill it with Ctrl+c.)




== What does this do? ==

Before running this script or reading the explanation below, read through though the program and see if you can tell what it does. After you think you figured it out, try running it. What happens when you press Alt+s or Alt+x? What do you notice when you change the size of the window?


&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
use warnings;
use strict;

use Glib qw(TRUE FALSE);
use Gtk2 '-init';

my $window = Gtk2::Window-&gt;new;
$window-&gt;set_title('Quick Note');

$window-&gt;signal_connect('delete-event'  =&gt; sub { $_[0]-&gt;destroy  });
$window-&gt;signal_connect('destroy'       =&gt; sub { Gtk2-&gt;main_quit });


my $hbox   = Gtk2::HBox-&gt;new;

my $label  = Gtk2::Label-&gt;new('Note');

my $entry  = Gtk2::Entry-&gt;new();

my $save_btn = Gtk2::Button-&gt;new_with_mnemonic('_Save');
$save_btn-&gt;signal_connect('clicked' =&gt; \&amp;save_note, $entry);

my $exit_btn = Gtk2::Button-&gt;new_with_mnemonic('E_xit');
$exit_btn-&gt;signal_connect('clicked' =&gt; sub { $window-&gt;destroy });

$hbox-&gt;pack_start($label   , FALSE, FALSE, 0);
$hbox-&gt;pack_start($entry   , TRUE , TRUE , 0);
$hbox-&gt;pack_start($save_btn, FALSE, FALSE, 0);
$hbox-&gt;pack_start($exit_btn, FALSE, FALSE, 0);

$window-&gt;add($hbox);

$window-&gt;show_all;

Gtk2-&gt;main;


sub save_note {
    my $save  = shift;
    my $entry = shift;
    my $text  = $entry-&gt;get_text;
    $entry-&gt;set_text('');

    open my $OUTFILE, '&gt;&gt;notes.txt'
        or die &quot;could not open notes.txt for appending&quot;;
    flock $OUTFILE, 2;
    print $OUTFILE join '|', time, $text . &quot;\n&quot;;
    close $OUTFILE;
}

&lt;/source&gt;



=== What's new ===

In this script, we introduced a few new widgets. The HBox is a container widget which we used to control the layout of the other widgets in the window.  The two others are the Entry and Button widgets, which allow the user to interact with the program.



=== Breaking it Down ===


&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
use Glib qw(TRUE FALSE);
&lt;/source&gt;
Glib is a dependency of Gtk. We include this line in our program to gain access to the constants TRUE and FALSE. You may simply use the Boolean values 1 and 0, but we will use TRUE and FALSE for clarity.



&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
$window-&gt;signal_connect('delete-event'  =&gt; sub { $_[0]-&gt;destroy  });
$window-&gt;signal_connect('destroy'       =&gt; sub { Gtk2-&gt;main_quit });
&lt;/source&gt;
You can see we took a slightly different approach when binding to our signals/events. Here we call the destroy method (which emits the 'destroy' signal) on the window when the 'delete-event' occurs. Connected to the 'destroy' signal, we have instructions to quit running in Gtk's main loop.  This approach was used because we want the program to exit when the application window is destroyed in any manner, not just when the user presses the close button in the window title bar. Later on we connect to the 'clicked' signal of $exit_btn to destroy the window, thereby exiting the application.

Despite using the same method to connect, there '''is''' a distinction between an event and a signal (these signals are not the same as Unix system signals, nor implemented using them, but the terminology is very similar). There will be more on this later.



&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my $save_btn = Gtk2::Button-&gt;new_with_mnemonic('_Save');
&lt;/source&gt;
This creates a new Button widget that has the label '&lt;u&gt;S&lt;/u&gt;ave'. Notice we used the method 'new_with_mnemonic' here. This sets up the keyboard shortcut Alt+s to fire the 'clicked' event on the button. The 'S' in 'Save' also becomes underlined to alert the end user to the existence of they keyboard shortcut.  

Because we are using the Perl bindings, we could have gotten away with saying:
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my $save_btn = Gtk2::Button-&gt;new('_Save');
&lt;/source&gt;
This is because the Perl bindings realize that we really want to be using the 'new_with_mnemonic' constructor that is supplied in the underlying C library.  Other widgets that also have 'new_with_mnemonic' or 'new_with_label' constructors usually allow you to do this as well. Many people still prefer to use the 'new_with_label' or 'new_with_mnemonic' constructors regardless.



&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
$save_btn-&gt;signal_connect('clicked' =&gt; \&amp;save_note, $entry)
&lt;/source&gt;
Here we use a reference to a subroutine instead of an anonymous one. The $entry will be passed in as an argument when the callback is executed.



&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
my $exit_btn = Gtk2::Button-&gt;new_with_mnemonic('E_xit');
$exit_btn-&gt;signal_connect('clicked' =&gt; sub { $window-&gt;destroy });
&lt;/source&gt;
It should now be clear to you what these two lines do.



&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
$hbox-&gt;pack_start($label   , FALSE, FALSE, 0);
$hbox-&gt;pack_start($entry   , TRUE , TRUE , 0);
$hbox-&gt;pack_start($save_btn, FALSE, FALSE, 0);
$hbox-&gt;pack_start($exit_btn, FALSE, FALSE, 0);
&lt;/source&gt;
These lines pack our interface widgets into the HBox widget. The syntax is:
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
$container-&gt;pack_start($widget, $expand, $fill, $padding)
&lt;/source&gt;
If the $expand argument is FALSE, the container will be shrunk tight around the widget. If the $expand argument is TRUE, the container will expand around the widget to fill the space its parent has allotted. When the $fill argument is TRUE, the extra space within the container is allocated to the child widget. When set to FALSE, the extra space is left as padding in the container widget. The $fill argument only has any effect when the $expand argument is TRUE as well.

In our example, the $entry object is packed with the $expand and $fill parameters set to TRUE. When you change the size of the window, the box around the $entry expands, allowing the $entry to fill the remaining area. The other objects, which were packed with FALSE $expand and $fill values, will remain their natural sizes.



&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
sub save_note {
    my $save  = shift;

== Summary ==

Walking through two applications, we introduced some of the fundamental concepts of GUI programming with Gtk2-Perl.

* Signals
* Callbacks
* Widgets
* Packing

The point of this chapter was simply to get you familiar with these ideas. We will be covering them in more detail over the next few chapters.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Who is this book for? ==

The book is targeted to people with at least some experience programming with Perl.  General programming topics and semantics of the Perl programming language will not be discussed. The focus will be on using the Gtk2-Perl API to create graphical applications. If you are new to programming or to Perl - you should do some [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Perl_Programming soul searching] before continuing on.

== What is Gtk+? ==

Gtk is a library for creating graphical user interfaces. Gtk stands for the GIMP toolkit - named because it was developed for the [http://www.gimp.org/ GNU Image Manipulation Program].  Gtk is free open-source software. It is licensed under the LGPL, which means you can develop free/open software or commercial software with it without paying licensing fees.

The Gtk+ libraries are written in the C programming language, but can be used from a multitude of other languages such as Perl, Python, Ruby, PHP, Java and others. A complete list of supported language bindings can be found at [http://www.gtk.org/language-bindings.html http://www.gtk.org/language-bindings.html].

Gtk2 is built on top of four primary components. 

=== Gdk and gdk-pixbuf ===

The GIMP drawing kit and gdk-pixbuf are low level functions for window handling and image manipulation. The two Perl modules for these libraries can be found within the Gtk2 namespace as Gtk2::Gdk and Gtk2::Gdk::Pixbuf.  

=== Glib ===

Glib replaces some native *nix call with it's own versions, to either add functionality or the increase portability of Gtk. Glib also provides the underlying type system behind Gtk's class hierarchy, the signal system used in Gtk, a thread API as well a facility for loading of modules. The Glib library is bound under the Glib namespace.

=== Pango ===

Pango is a library for handling (internationalized) text output. Pango is bound under the Gtk2 names space as Gtk2::Pango.

== Acquiring Gtk2-Perl ==

Gtk2-Perl is the name given to a set of Perl bindings for Gtk+ and related libraries. Using Gtk2-Perl requires that the following be installed on your system:

* Perl
* Gtk+ binaries and dependencies
* Gtk2-Perl module and dependencies

=== Linux ===

Perl is most likely installed on your computer. If it's not - get it [http://www.perl.com/download.csp here].

Gtk+ is also probably installed on your system. If not, you should look for pre-built binaries on the internet specifically for your operating system. A simple Google search will most likely yield the results you are looking for. If there are no binaries available for your operating system, you can [http://www.gtk.org/download-linux.html compile Gtk+ on your own].

Once you have Gtk+ and Perl on your system, you need to install the Perl language bindings. Like most great things perl, you can install the gtk-perl libraries via CPAN. Enter the following command at a prompt to automatically install.

&lt;blockquote&gt;perl -MCPAN -e 'install Gtk2' &lt;/blockquote&gt;

If you have issues installing from the CPAN utility, you can [http://search.cpan.org/~tsch/Gtk2-1.221/ download] the module and install it manually. After downloading and extracting the archive, issues these commands from the root of the extracted folder.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
perl Makefile.pl&lt;br/&gt;
make&lt;br/&gt;
make test&lt;br/&gt;
make install&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Windows ===

Getting Gtk2 and Gtk2-Perl running on windows has its caveats, due to the fact that windows doesn't ship with all the necessary utilities to compile it(and lots of other great open-source software). Here are your three options.

==== The Easy Way ====

1. Install latest version of ActiveState perl from [http://www.activestate.com/ here]

2. Add sisyphusion repository in PPM (Select it from PPM Gui -&gt; Edit -&gt; Preference -&gt; Repositories -&gt; Suggested)

3. Install Glib, Gtk2, Cairo, Pango modules from [http://www.sisyphusion.tk/ppm sisyphusion] repository.

And the recommended way. Download and install [http://code.google.com/p/camelbox/ camelbox]. Bam - you're done. The drawback is that things that are readily available from ActiveState's ppm repository like libexpat and libgd are not readily available with camelbox. It may be more difficult to compile these libraries, should you need them, than that it is to compile your own Gtk+ from source. In general, camelbox should be sufficient for most users and has the options and tools to install a lot of useful modules and utilities.

==== The Old Easy Way ====

Follow the instructions at [http://lostmind.de/gtk2-perl/ http://lostmind.de/gtk2-perl/]. This website details everything you need to get Gtk2-perl working using ActiveState Perl 5.8.8 build 819. The drawback: it is all dated. It is an old version of Perl and more importantly and old version of Gtk+. There are a lot of features that have been implemented in both Gtk+ and the Perl language bindings that just did not exist at the time.

==== The Hard Way ====

This is for advanced users. Build Gtk+ from source on your system. Build the gtk2-perl libraries against your Gtk+ and Perl builds. Instructions on how to do this are beyond the scope of this book.

'''Blocking''' is the technical method by which [[Wikibooks:Administrators|administrators]] can prevent users from editing Wikibooks.   

Wikibookians can request a block in the [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Administrative Assistance|reading room for administrative assistance]]. The request should supply credible evidence of the circumstances warranting a block. Administrators should investigate the situation themselves and may place a block if appropriate. Blocks can be appealed or reviewed; it is important that the blocking and reviewing administrators each communicate with and take care to inform the other.

Blocks should only be applied if all other possible attempts to resolve the issues have been considered.

Except in cases of unambiguous error, administrators should not undo other administrators' blocks without prior discussion; see [[#Unblocking|below]].

== Purpose and goal ==
All blocks ultimately exist to protect Wikibooks from harm, and reduce likely future problems, not to punish users.  Blocks sometimes are used as a deterrent, to discourage whatever behavior led to the block and encourage a productive editing environment.  When lesser measures are inadequate, or problematic conduct persists, appropriate use of a block can help achieve this in four important ways:

# ''Preventing'' imminent or continuing damage or disruption to Wikibooks.
# ''Deterring'' the continuation of disruptive behavior by making it more difficult to edit.
# ''Encouraging'' a rapid understanding that the present behavior cannot continue and will not be tolerated.
# ''Encouraging'' a more productive, congenial editing style within community norms.
{{-}}&lt;div align=&quot;center&quot;&gt;
{| style=&quot;border: 1px solid black; background-color: #d8ffd8; text-align: center;&quot; width=&quot;80%&quot;
! Blocks are intended to reduce the likelihood of ''future'' problems, by either removing, or encouraging change in, a source of disruption. They are not intended for use in retaliation, as punishment, or where there is no current conduct issue which is of concern.
|}
&lt;/div&gt;{{-}}
For the purposes of protection and encouragement, blocks may escalate in duration to protect Wikibooks, while allowing for the cessation of the disruptive editing.

==Common rationales for blocks==
As a rule of thumb, when in doubt, do not block; instead, consult other administrators for advice. After placing a block that may be controversial, it is a good idea to make a note of the block at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room/Administrative Assistance|reading room for administrative assistance]] for peer review.

Administrators should take special care when dealing with new users. Beginning editors are often unfamiliar with Wikibooks policy and convention, and so their behavior may initially appear to be disruptive. Responding to these new users with excessive force can discourage them from editing in the future. See [[Wikibooks:Please do not bite the newcomers]].

===Protection===
A user can be blocked when necessary to protect the rights, property or safety of the [[foundation:About|Wikimedia Foundation]], its users or the public. A block for protection may be necessary in response to:
* persistently making personal attacks;
* making personal, professional or legal threats (including outside the Wikibooks site);
* performing actions that place users in danger;
* disclosing personal information (whether or not the information is accurate);
* persistently violating copyrights;
* persistently posting unreferenced or potentially defamatory information about living persons;
* accounts that appear to have been compromised, as an emergency measure.

===Disruption===
A user can be blocked when his or her conduct severely disrupts the project; that is, when his or her conduct is inconsistent with a civil, collegial atmosphere and interferes with the process of editors working together harmoniously to create textbooks. A block for disruption may be necessary in response to:
* vandalism; 
* gross incivility;
* harassment;
* spamming;
* edit warring;
* sock puppetry;
* persistently violating other [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|policies or guidelines]].

====Disruption-only====
Furthermore, some types of user accounts are considered disruptive and can be blocked without warning, usually indefinitely:
* accounts used exclusively for disruptive purposes, such as vandalism.
* public accounts (where the password is publicly available or shared with a large group);
* accounts with inappropriate usernames;
* [[Wikibooks:Bots|bots]] operating without approval or outside their approval;
* accounts that appear, based on their edit history, to exist for the sole or primary purpose of promoting a person, company, product, service, or organization.

===Evasion of blocks===
An administrator may reset the block of a user who intentionally evades a block, and may extend the duration of the block if the user engages in further blockable behavior while evading the block. User accounts or IP addresses used to evade a block may also be blocked.

===Recording in the block log after username change===
Editors can cite [[meta:Right to vanish|the right to vanish]] and rename themselves, asking that their previous username not be disclosed and that their user and talk pages be deleted by an administrator. If such editors have been blocked previously then the administrator who has been requested to make the deletion should contact a [[meta:CheckUser policy|CheckUser]] so that the connection between the accounts can be verified. The CheckUser should then add short blocks to the new account to denote each entry in the user's old account log. Such short blocks should provide protection in case the &quot;right to vanish&quot; was based on a genuine risk of off-wiki harassment, by not disclosing the previous username, while at the same time eliminating the possibility of avoiding the scrutiny of the community. 

The short blocks should be described in the block summary as &quot;previous account block&quot; and the final duration of the block should be noted. Blocks placed in error and lifted early should not be noted at all.

==When blocking should not be used==

===Self-requested blocks===
Sometimes people request that their account be blocked, for example to enforce a wikibreak. Typically, such requests are refused.

===Cool-down blocks===
Blocks intended '''solely''' to &quot;cool down&quot; an angry user should ''not'' be used, as they often have the opposite effect. However, an angry user who is also being disruptive can be blocked to prevent further disruption.

===Recording in the block log===
Blocks used solely for the purpose of recording warnings or other negative events in a user's block log. The practice, typically involving very short blocks, is often seen as punitive and humiliating. Bureaucrats occasionally make an exception to provide a link to the prior block log of a user who has undergone a username change.

Very brief blocks can be used in order to record, for example, an apology or acknowledgment of mistake in the [[Special:Log/block|block log]] in the event of a wrongful or accidental block, unless the original block has not yet expired (in which case the message may be recorded as the reason for the status alteration).

== Explanation of blocks ==
Blocking is a serious matter. The community expects that blocks will be made with good reasons only, based upon reviewable evidence and reasonable judgment, and that all factors that support a block are subject to independent peer review if requested. 

=== Notifying the blocked user ===
Administrators must supply a clear and specific block reason which indicates why a user was blocked. Block reasons should avoid the use of jargon as much as possible so that blocked users may better understand them. Administrators should also notify users when blocking them by leaving a message on their user talk page unless they have a good reason not to. It is often easier to explain the reason for a block at the time than it is to explain a block well after the fact.

When implementing a block, a number of block reasons are available in a [[MediaWiki:Ipbreason-dropdown|drop-down menu]]; other or additional reasons can also be added. Users can be notified of blocks and block reasons using a template message&amp;mdash;see [[Template:Blocked]].

=== Other important information ===
If there are any specific recommendations or circumstances that a reviewing administrator would need to know, or which may help to avoid administrator disputes upon review of a block, the blocking administrator should consider including this information in the block notice. For example:

* When there is information or evidence that may not be obvious, fully appreciated, or otherwise be relevant.
* Prior endorsement that if any administrator wishes to unblock, or there is consensus for it, they may without consulting the blocking administrator.
* Suggested conditions for an unblock.

===Confidential evidence===
If a user needs to be blocked based on information that will not be made available to all administrators, that information should be sent to a [[meta:CheckUser policy|CheckUser]] for action. These editors are qualified to handle non-public evidence, and they operate under strict controls. The community has rejected the idea of individual administrators acting on evidence which cannot be peer-reviewed.

An exception is made for administrators who hold CheckUser privileges; such administrators may block users based on non-public information revealed through the CheckUser tool as such an administrative action is generally viewed to be made in the user's capacity as a CheckUser, although the action itself is an administrative one.

: '''Contact details:''' ''individual [[Wikibooks:Administrators|CheckUsers]] are listed on the relevant page.''

==Unblocking==
Unblocking or shortening of a block is most common when a blocked user appeals a block. An uninvolved administrator acting independently reviews the circumstances of the block, their prior conduct, and other relevant evidence, along with any additional information provided by the user and others, to determine if the unblock request should be accepted. Common reasons include: the circumstances have changed, a commitment to change is given, or there was a clear mistake.

===Block reviews===
As part of an unblock request, uninvolved administrators can discuss a block, and the blocking administrator is often asked to participate and provide further information. (see [[#Other important information|Information provided by blocking administrator]].)

Except in cases of ''unambiguous'' error, administrators must avoid unblocking users without first attempting to contact the blocking administrator and discuss the matter with them.  If the blocking administrator is not available, or if the administrators cannot come to an agreement, then a discussion at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room/General|general reading room]] is recommended. The blocking administrator should '''also''' [[#Other important information|wish to note]] as part of the block notice that there are specific circumstances by which the reviewing administrator should not unblock.

Administrators reviewing a block should consider that some historical context may not be immediately obvious. Cases involving sockpuppets, long-term disruption, harassment, or privacy concerns are particularly difficult to judge. At times such issues have led to contentious unblocks.

===Altering block options===
Administrators can unblock a user in order to re-block them with different blocking options selected, where that is necessary (for example, if a block on a registered account is causing significant collateral effects to a shared IP address or a blocked user is abusing the [[Special:Emailuser]] function).

===Temporary circumstances blocks===
Some types of blocks are used in response to particular temporary circumstances, and should be undone once the circumstance no longer applies:
* blocks of unapproved or malfunctioning bots should be undone once the bots gain approval or are repaired;
* blocks for making legal threats should be undone once the threats are confirmed as permanently withdrawn and no longer outstanding.

===Temporary circumstances unblocks===
As a form of discretionary sanction, a user can be temporarily and conditionally unblocked in order to respond to a discussion regarding the circumstances of their block. Such temporary and conditional unblocks are made on the understanding that edits (besides their user talk page) of other page(s) must be explicitly specified by the unblocking admin. The user is effectively prohibited from editing any other pages. Breaching this ban will be sanctioned appropriately. When the discussion concludes, the block should be removed unless there is a consensus to keep the block.

===Checkuser blocks===
[[Special:ListUsers/checkuser|CheckUsers]] are privy to confidential system logs not accessible by the public or [[Wikibooks:Administrators|administrators]] due to the Wikimedia Foundation's [[foundation:Privacy_policy|privacy policy]], and therefore '''[http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Administrators%27_noticeboard&amp;diff=101898276&amp;oldid=101897313 must]''' be consulted before a block marked as a &quot;checkuser block&quot; can be removed.

==Education and warnings==
Everyone makes mistakes. That's why when we welcome newcomers, we are [[Wikibooks:Please do not bite the newcomers|patient with them]], and [[Wikibooks:Assume good faith|assume]] that most people work to benefit the project, not hurt it. We ask that newcomers make an effort to learn about [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|our policies and guidelines]] so that they avoid making mistakes.

Before a block, efforts should be made to educate the user about our policies and guidelines, and to warn them when their behavior conflicts with our policies and guidelines. A [[Wikibooks:Templates/User notices|variety of template messages]] exist for convenience, although purpose-written messages are often preferable.

Warning is not a prerequisite for blocking (particularly with respect to blocks for protection) but administrators should generally ensure that users are aware of policies, and give them reasonable opportunity to adjust their behavior accordingly, before blocking. Users who have been made aware of a policy and have had such an opportunity, and accounts whose main or only use is forbidden activity (sock-puppetry, obvious vandalism, personal attack, and so on) do not require further warning.

An administrator should consider that a user may not immediately notice the warning on his talk page until he has navigated to a new Wikibooks page.  This may include the saving of a newly and also inappropriately edited page.  Edits made immediately following a warning should be rolled back so as to allow time for the warning to be seen, before taking further action.

==Implementing blocks==
Technical instructions on how to block and unblock, and information on the blocking interface, is available at [[m:Help:Block and unblock|Help:Block and unblock]]. The following is advice specifically related to blocking and unblocking on Wikibooks.

===IP address blocks===
In addition to the advice below, there are special considerations to take into account when blocking IP addresses. IP address blocks can affect many users, and IPs can change. Users intending to block an IP address should at a minimum check for usage of that address, and consider duration carefully. IP addresses should rarely, if ever, be blocked indefinitely.

==== Collateral damage====
When an IP range is blocked, other users who also use that range may be unintentionally affected. If you propose to block a significant IP range, especially for a significant time, consider asking a user with [[Wikibooks:Administrators|CheckUser]] access to check for collateral damage on that range&amp;mdash;that is, for the presence of other users who may be unintentionally affected by the range block. They should be given [[Wikibooks:IP block exemption|IP block exemption]] so they will not be affected.

===Duration of blocks===
The purpose of blocking is prevention, not punishment. The duration of blocks should thus be related to the likelihood of a user repeating inappropriate behavior. Longer blocks for repeated and high levels of disruption is to reduce administrative burden; it is under presumption that such users are likely to cause frequent disruption or harm in future. Administrators should consider:
* the severity of the behavior;
* whether the user has engaged in that behavior before.

Blocks on shared or dynamic IP addresses are typically shorter than blocks on registered accounts or static IP addresses made in otherwise similar circumstances, to limit side-effects on other users sharing that IP address.

While the duration of a block should vary with the circumstances, there are some broad standards:
* incidents of disruptive behavior typically result in blocks long enough to discourage repeat incidents and should be made longer for successive violations;
* accounts used primarily for disruption can be blocked indefinitely without warning;
* protective blocks typically last as long as protection is necessary, often indefinitely.

====Indefinite blocks====
An ''indefinite'' block does not have a fixed duration.  They should be applied when there is significant disruption or major breaches of policy to prevent further issues until the matter can be resolved by discussion.  It is possible in some cases, to achieve the more usual desired outcome, in a commitment to observe Wikibooks policies and&amp;mdash;if unblocked&amp;mdash;to refrain from the problematic conduct in future.

Until an administrator lifts the block, the blocked user is effectively considered to have been banned by the community.

===Setting block options===
There are several options available to modify the effect of blocks, which should be used in certain circumstances.

;Anon-only:When blocking IPs, this setting should be checked unless necessary to stop disruption (ie the intent of the IP or range block is to block logged-in users). (Abbreviated AO)

;Autoblock:Must be ''disabled'' when blocking unapproved or malfunctioning bots (so as not to block the bot's operator, or other bots operating from the same IP address), though it should be ''enabled'' when blocking malicious bots. (Abbreviated AB)

;Prevent account creation:Should typically be ''disabled'' when blocking accounts with inappropriate names (to allow the user to create an account with an appropriate name), though it should be ''enabled'' when blocking bad-faith names (for example, clear attacks on other users) or vandalism-only accounts. (Abbreviated ACB)

;Block e-mail:Will disable the user from accessing [[Special:Emailuser]] for the duration of the block. This option should '''not''' be used by default when blocking an account, but rather it should only be used in cases of abuse of the &quot;email this user&quot; feature, or where such abuse is likely.

;Allow this user to edit own talk page while blocked:If unchecked will prevent the blocked user from editing their own talk page, including requesting unblock. This option should '''not''' be unchecked by default; editing of the user's talk page should only be disabled in the case of continued abuse of the talk page, or where such abuse is likely.

The most common types of blocks when blocking an IP are commonly known as a '''soft block''' ''(autoblock disabled, account creation not disabled, blocking only anonymous users enabled)'' which block anonymous users but allow editing by registered users when logged in (commonly used when blocking shared IP addresses); '''soft block with account creation disabled''' ''(same but account creation disabled)'' used in most cases where vandalism or disruption is occurring via registered accounts; and '''hard block''', which disables all editing whether logged in or not, other than administrators and other [[Wikibooks:IP block exemption|IP-block exempt]] users&amp;mdash;used when the level of vandalism or disruption via creation of &quot;throwaway&quot; accounts is such that editing from the IP is to be prevented other than after individual checking of requests.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In the &quot;Special cases&quot; section where the technique of switching signs is mentioned, there is an error in the given example.
It says x =&gt; -6 and then switched to x &lt;= -6
After the switch, the -6 should become positive.
Isn't that right?

:Yes, but it appears that was intentional after reading further. [[Special:Contributions/67.111.137.227|67.111.137.227]] ([[User talk:67.111.137.227|talk]]) 22:35, 27 January 2010 (UTC)

:I think the point is that the first answer of x =&gt; -6 was wrong. If you multiply or divide both sides of an inequality by a negative number, then you need to turn round the inequality. e.g. 4 =&gt; 3 becomes -4 &lt;= -3 etc. Perhaps the expression &quot;switching the sign&quot; is confusing.

== Inequalities-special  cases. ==

The presenter recommends solving 2/(x-1)&lt;1 in a somewhat lengthy way.
I suggest it be replaced by the following.
x-1=0 when x=1, when x&gt;1 denominator &gt;0 and multiplying both sides by (x-1) gives 2&lt;2x-2 or x&gt;2
which requires x&gt;2.
When x&lt;1 denominator &lt;0 and multiplying by (x-1) gives 2&gt;2x-2 or x&lt;2 which requires x&lt;1.
Overall this requires x&lt;1 and (or) x&gt;2.
I think an expression such as 1&gt;x&gt;2 should be avoided.</text>

As dori sa scriu o carte despre Comunitati sexuale din orasul meu (Braşov, România), stiu ca exista o comunitate dezvoltata de Homosexuali, bisexuali si lezbiene daca detineti Date despre Acestia Mar ajuta foarte mult.
As dori sa dezvolt Aceste subiecte pentru o putea dezvolta si o agentie neguvernamentala pentru o sprijini Prevenirea bolilor din randul acestora Deoarece din informatiile mele barbati hetero de diferite varste pouleaza Aceste Comunitati si indirecte, duc la raspandirea acestor boli transmise pe cale sexuala.
Daca noi putem sa facem ceva atunci putem aduna informatii si de o construi si Explora fundatii de îngrijire Sa fie, în primul rand cu acces la public si sa privim putin si cu compasiune nu numai cu ura.Ca acest lucru sa se poata pune in practica am nevoie de Ajutorul vostru.
Daca voi reuşi sa joc de cuvinte pe hartie si sa publice aceasta carte Aceste Comunitati vor avea ONU sprijin favorabil din partea mea.
Al 2-lea de îngrijire Proiect ca vrea sa Al supun discutiei ar fi ca pot sa construi un centru de îngrijire pot sa ciudat toti orfanii din România cuprinsi intre varstele 5-12 ani, în vederea reeducarii si le asigura un viitor al ONU, am Un proiect conceput inca nu e finalizat dar poate imi puteti sugera si voi.Sunt lucruri care de simplu pe noi nici nu le mai bagam in seama Dar pentru ei sunt minuni Venite de la oameni asa ca hai sa dam o sansa si sa facem lucruri bune pentru comunitatea în îngrijirea Traim.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Poland==

:The first meter stamps appeared in 1927. All stamps are inscribed “POLSKA” alone or with “POCZTA”.
:Early, pre-WW2, meter stamps contained a meter number with prefix based on the meter model. Later the meter number was dropped and a license number with prefix based on the town replaced it.
:Poland had one native meter manufacturer, UKA, which produced a small number of machines right before WW2. Additionally Postalia produced the “Junior 100” and “Junior 200” models locally in the town of Mera-Elzab during the 1970s.
:Catalog values are not provided for many of the listed types because of insufficient data. Some of these could be quite rare.
:The stamps are grouped according to frank design, inscription, and use:
:: '''A''' - round design with squares in corners
:: '''B''' – frame with three vertical lines and triangular notches at each side
:: '''C''' - single-line outer frame with inner frame around value figures
:: '''D''' - horizontal frank with frame line across bottom only
:: '''E''' - eight-sided frank
:: '''F''' - upright rectangle with triangular notches in sides
:: '''G''' - single-line outer frame, no inner frame
:: '''H''' - frameless or unengraved designs
:: '''PO''' - special purpose stamps, used only in post offices
:: '''PV''' - stamp from public, self-service vending machine
:: '''GO''' - German occupation issues, inscribed “GENERAL GOUVERNMENT” (A) and &quot;DANZIG&quot; (B)
----
&lt;font size=3&gt;'''NOTE''': For specialized information about the meter stamps of Poland see ''Polskie Frankatury Mechaniczne'' by Tadeusz Hampel, Lodz, 1992. The listings in this chapter were heavily influenced by Mr. Hampel’s work. The illustrations of frank frames without value figures and town mark are taken from the Hampel catalog.

Given the two-point boundary value problem

&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{cases}
-u''+\alpha u  = f(x), \quad 0 \leq x \leq 1, \quad \alpha &gt;0 \\
u'(0)=A,\\

Set up the finite element approximation for this problem, based on piecewise linear elements in equidistant points. Determine the convergence rate in an appropriate norm

|}

==Solution 4a==
Let &lt;math&gt;V= \{v \in H^1[0,1] \} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;

Find &lt;math&gt;u \in V \!\,&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;v \in V \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\int_0^1 -u''v + \alpha \int_0^1 uv = \int_0^1 fv \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


or after integrating by parts and including initial conditions

&lt;math&gt; \int_0^1 u'v' + \alpha \int_0^1 uv = \int_0^1 fv + Bv(1)-Av(0)\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

===Discrete Variational Form===
&lt;math&gt;V_h = \{ v \in H^1[0,1]: v  =\!\,&lt;/math&gt; piecewise linear &lt;math&gt; \} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\{ \phi_i \}_{i=0}^{N+1} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is basis for &lt;math&gt;V_h \!\,&lt;/math&gt;;&lt;math&gt;h=\frac{1}{N+2} \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


For &lt;math&gt;i=1,2,\ldots,N \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\phi_i =
\begin{cases}
\frac{x-x_{i-1}}{h} \mbox{ for } x \in [x_{i-1}, x_i ] \\
\frac{x_{i+1}-x}{h} \mbox{ for } x \in [x_i, x_{i+1}] \\
0 \mbox{ otherwise} 
\end{cases}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; 
\phi_i'=
\begin{cases}
\frac1h \mbox{ for } x \in [x_{i-1},x_i] \\
-\frac1h \mbox{ for } x \in [x_i, x_{i+1}] \\
0 \mbox{ otherwise}
\end{cases}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; 
\int \phi_i \phi_j = 
\begin{cases}
\frac23 h \mbox{ for } i=j \\
\frac16 h \mbox{ for } |i-j| =1 \\
0 \mbox{ otherwise}
\end{cases}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; 
\int \phi_i' \phi_j' =
\begin{cases}
\frac2h \mbox{ for } i=j \\
-\frac1h \mbox{ for } |i-j|=1 \\
0 \mbox{ otherwise}
\end{cases}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \phi_0 =
\begin{cases}
\frac{x_1-x}{h} \mbox{ for } x \in [x_0,x_1] \\
0 \mbox{ otherwise }
\end{cases}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; 
\phi_{N+1} =
\begin{cases}
\frac{x-x_N}{h} \mbox{ for } x\in [x_N, x_{N+1}] \\
0 \mbox{ otherwise }
\end{cases}
\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Find &lt;math&gt;u_h \in V_h \!\,&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;v \in V_h \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\int u_h' v_h' + \alpha \int_0^1 u_h v_h = \int_0^1 f v_h + Bv(1)-Av(0) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Since &lt;math&gt;\{ \phi_i \}_{i=0}^{N+1} \!\,&lt;/math&gt; forms a basis


&lt;math&gt;u_h = \sum_{i=0}^{N+1}u_{h_i} \phi_i \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


Therefore we have system of equations


For &lt;math&gt;j=0,1,\ldots, N+1 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i=0}^{N+1} u_{h_i}\int_0^1 \phi_i' \phi_j' + \alpha \sum_{i=0}^{N+1} u_{h_i} \int_0^1 \phi_i \phi_j = \int_0^1 f \phi_j + B\phi_j(1) -A \phi_j(0) \!\,&lt;/math&gt;


&lt;math&gt; 
\begin{bmatrix}
\alpha \frac13 h + \frac1h &amp; \frac{\alpha}{6} h - \frac{1}{h}  &amp; &amp; \\
\frac{\alpha}{6} -\frac1h &amp; \alpha\frac23 h + \frac{2}{h} &amp; \frac{\alpha}{6}h - \frac{1}{h} &amp; \\
 \ddots&amp;\ddots &amp; \ddots&amp; \\
       &amp; \frac{\alpha}{6} h -\frac16 &amp; \alpha \frac23 h + \frac2h &amp; \frac{\alpha}{6} h - \frac1h \\
       &amp;                              &amp;       \frac{\alpha}{6} h -\frac1h &amp; \alpha \frac13 h + \frac1h
\end{bmatrix}

\begin{bmatrix}
u_{h_0}\\
u_{h_1}\\
\vdots \\
u_{h_N}\\
u_{h_{N+1}}
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
\int_0^1 f \phi_0 -A \\
\int_0^1 f \phi_1 \\
\vdots \\
\int_0^1 f \phi_N \\
\int_0^1 f \phi_{N+1} +B
\end{bmatrix}

\!\,&lt;/math&gt;


===Convergence Rate===

In general terms, we can use Cea's Lemma to obtain


&lt;math&gt; \| u - u_h\|_1 \leq C\inf_{v_h \in V_h}  \| u - v_h \|_1   &lt;/math&gt;


In particular, we can consider &lt;math&gt; v_h \!\,&lt;/math&gt; as the Lagrange interpolant, which we denote by &lt;math&gt; v_I \!\,&lt;/math&gt;. Then, 


&lt;math&gt; \| u - u_h\|_1 \leq C \| u - v_I \|_1 \leq Ch \| u\|_{H^2(0,1)}  &lt;/math&gt;.


It's easy to prove that the finite element solution is nodally exact. Then it coincides with the Lagrange interpolant, and we have the following punctual estimation:


&lt;math&gt; \|u(x) - u_h(x)\|_{L^{\infty}([x_{i-1},x_i])} \leq \max_{x \in [x_{i-1},x_i]} \frac{u^{(2)}(x)}{(2)!} \left(\frac{h}{2}\right)^2  &lt;/math&gt;

Explain whether &lt;math&gt;\alpha &gt;0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt; is necessary for the convergence in part (a).

==Solution 4b==

If &lt;math&gt;\alpha \geq 0 \!\,&lt;/math&gt;, then the stiffness matrix is diagonally dominant and hence solvable.

        &quot;Signal is a set of data and information with the function of an independent variable or graph.&quot;

Features of Signals:
1.signal is a generalized term.
2.Each Signal can be represented mathematically.
3.Signal is mostly in the form of graph.

Independent Variable:
                     &quot;Such variables which is out of control in a frame is called as independent variable&quot;

Examples:
1.Time
2.Space etc

Systems:
       &quot;System is an entity that processes a set of signal(input) to yield a set of another signal(output).&quot;</text>

      <comment>/* Disconnecting and Blocking */ corrected syntax: changed } to );</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Signals ==

The Gtk framework is event driven. This means it will remain idle in Gtk's main loop until an event occurs, at which point a signal will be emitted. If we have connected a callback to the signal, it will be executed before returning control back to the main loop.


In the last chapter we connected to the clicked signal of a button in order save some user input to a file.
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
$save_btn-&gt;signal_connect('clicked' =&gt; \&amp;save_note, $entry);

sub save_note {
    my ($save_btn, $entry) = @_;
    my $text  = $entry-&gt;get_text;
    $entry-&gt;set_text('');
 
    open my $OUTFILE, '&gt;&gt;notes.txt'
        or die &quot;could not open notes.txt for appending&quot;;
    flock $OUTFILE, 2;
    print $OUTFILE join '|', time, $text . &quot;\n&quot;;
    close $OUTFILE;
}
&lt;/source&gt;


=== Signal Connect ===
Here is the syntax of the signal_connect method which is provided in the Glib::Object base class - which all widgets inherit from. In addition to the name of the signal and callback, you may optionally pass in a scalar to be passed to the callback function when it is executed.
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
$widget-&gt;signal_connect($signal_name, \&amp;callback, [$data])
&lt;/source&gt;


=== Callbacks ===

Callbacks are subroutine references that will be executed when a signal is emitted.  When you define your callback function you will get the emitting widget and optionally a $data value as arguments.
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
sub callback {
    my ($widget, $data) = @_;

    #...
}
&lt;/source&gt;


Callbacks can also be anonymous subroutines. You can then use encapsulation to avoid passing in an argument.
This approach is best used for short, simple callbacks.  Take the example below.  

&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
$entry = Gtk2::Entry-&gt;new;

$button-&gt;signal_connect(clicked =&gt; sub {
    print $entry-&gt;get_text, &quot;\n&quot;;
});
&lt;/source&gt;

== Events ==

There also exists a set of events that you can connect callbacks to. Use the same signal_connect method in exactly the same manner as when connecting to signals.  These events reflect the those of the x event mechanism. Here is a complete listing.

&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
* event
* button_press_event
* button_release_event
* scroll_event
* motion_notify_event
* delete_event
* destroy_event
* expose_event
* key_press_event
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
* key_release_event
* enter_notify_event
* leave_notify_event
* configure_event
* focus_in_event
* focus_out_event
* map_event
* unmap_event
* property_notify_event
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
* selection_clear_event
* selection_request_event
* selection_notify_event
* proximity_in_event
* proximity_out_event
* visibility_notify_event
* client_event
* no_expose_event
* window_state_event
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


=== Callbacks ===

The callback function is slightly different for events.
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
sub callback_func {
    my ($widget, $event, $data) = @_;
    
    # ...
    
    return $ret;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

The $event argument is an object that inherits from Gtk2::Gdk::Event. The actual package name will depend on the which event occurred. You can call the 'type' method on the $event to retrieve the type of event that occurred.  You may also be able to call other methods on the $event that may be of interest, but that will vary depending on the type of event.


=== Event Types ===

Here is a list of possible values that could be returned from the type method.

&lt;table cellpadding=&quot;5&quot; cellspacing=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
*nothing 
*delete 
*destroy  
*expose  
*motion-notify   
*button-press   
*2button-press   
*3button-press   
*button-release   
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
*key-press   
*key-release   
*enter-notify   
*leave-notify   
*focus-change   
*configure   
*map   
*unmap   
*property-notify   
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
*selection-clear   
*selection-request   
*selection-notify   
*proximity-in   
*proximity-out   
*drag-enter   
*drag-leave   
*drag-motion   
*drag-status   
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
*drop-start   
*drop-finished   
*client-event   
*visibility-notify   
*no-expose   
*scroll   
*window-state   
*setting     
&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;


=== Return Values === 

The value returned from your callback function determines whether events should be propagated further. Returning a TRUE value will stop the propagation of events, while a FALSE value will continue one with normal event handling.



== Disconnecting and Blocking ==

By storing the Integer value returned from the 'signal_connect' method, we can disconnect the callback later.
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
$id = $widget-&gt;signal_connect($signal =&gt; \&amp;callback, $data );

$widget-&gt;signal_handler_disconnect($id);
&lt;/source&gt;



You can also temporarily disable a callback from firing.
&lt;source lang=&quot;perl&quot;&gt;
$widget-&gt;signal_handler_block($id);

$widget-&gt;signal_handlers_block_by_func(\&amp;callback, $data);

$widget-&gt;signal_handler_unblock($id);

$widget-&gt;signal_handlers_unblock_by_func(\&amp;callback, $data);
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Vayishlach  Genesis 32-36

Twenty years have passed since Yaacov was in his homeland. Yahweh took him out and He brought him back in fulfillment of his prayer. During this period Yaacov had matured through the many experiences which he had while away.

Jacob (Yaacov) has prospered in all of his undertakings. He wishes to return to the land of his fathers, and sends messengers on ahead to his brother Esau, who lives in the land of Edom, to seek reconciliation. The messengers returned to Yaacov, saying, &quot;We came to your brother Esau, and furthermore he is coming to meet you, and four hundred men are with him.&quot;   Genesis 32: 6 
These are presumably armed men. Yaacov went into panic!  Immediately he went about devising a strategy so as to protect his family from possible annihilation.   Yaacov prepares to meet Esau by preparing his family for a conflict and strategically placing them so as to preserve some alive, he also sends gifts to appease Esau's anger, meeting Esau's materialistic mindset.   Most importantly, he prepared himself spiritually by calling upon Yahweh.   Genesis 32: 9-12

Yaacov knew God, he acknowledged I'm sure His awesome power, but he never really trusted in God, he never really fully relinquished control of his life to Him. Now he had no choice, his options suddenly expired.
Yahweh can't use us when we are in control, He needs broken spirits, contrite hearts and humility, and some times he has to afflict us in order to achieve them. 

The three methods of preparation which he made seem contradictory,  - aggression for battle and paying tribute in servanthood.   His first recourse was to Yahweh and then to prepare on a natural level.   He responds with understanding of Esau's loss of the blessings in making gifts to him, which shows a maturity which he did not previously possess, whilst also preparing to confront his anger by self-defence.   His moment of truth had arrived and he was about to have the encounter of a lifetime.  
 
Ya'acov Wrestled
The name &quot;YA'acov' (Ya'acov) means “Heel-grabber.”  The name is a reference to his talent for not letting go.  It is a wrestling name. Up till now, all the blessings Ya'acov had acquired were through deceit and cunning - the way of the flesh.   Also he had heavily followed the wishes of his mother and lived up to his name 'heel' or a 'follower'.  From the womb he had followed Esau, grasping for the blessings.

Ya'acov who had wrest the blessings from man in the past, now has to wrestle with the Angel and obtain the blessing on his own merits.   He had to rise up out of the fleshly nature and attain the blessing on a spiritual level.

Before his encounter with Esau, Ya'acov finds himself wrestling during the night with this mysterious stranger.  If we can imagine the situation, we see that under the canopy of a star-lit sky, a man and an angelic being are wrestling. Ultimately, the whole world would be affected by the match that took place in the quiet gorge.  The audience, the heavenly hosts, looked on in awe, as the two rolled vigorously in the dust, limbs intertwined.
Ya'acov clung tenaciously to the angelic being.  Mysteriously, the angel could not overcome the human being, and yet he had the power to dislocate Ya'acov's hip with a touch.  After wrestling all night, the angel said, &quot;‘Let me go, for it is daybreak.'  But Ya'acov replied, ‘I will not let you go unless you bless me.'   The 'man' asked him, ‘What is your name?' ‘Ya'acov,' he answered&quot; (Genesis 32:26-27, NIV).

The angelic being replied, &quot;‘No longer will it be said that your name is Ya'acov, but Israel, for you have striven with the Divine and with human and have overcome'....and he blessed him there&quot; (Genesis 32:29-30, ATS)

Yaacov's Encounter
Who was the stranger with whom our forefather wrestled?   
Yaacov named the place Peniel where he strove with the &quot;angel of Yahweh&quot; during the night, for he said, &quot;I have seen God face to face, yet my life has been preserved.&quot;  (32:31).   The name Peniel means the 'face of El' but if there were a different interpretation of vowel markings, it could mean &quot;turn to El'  or, 'my face (is toward) EL'.    Yaacov saw the face of El and was changed.   Each of the patriarch had a personal manifestation of Yahweh the Word, the 'face' of God.
&quot;Unto you who fear My Name shall the sun of righteousness arise with healing in His wings&quot;   Malachi 4: 2

Yaacov was being released from his old nature in this struggle so that he would emerge in full submission and obedience to his Father.   The man who had wrestled with Yaacov was Yahweh.  

All his life he had wrestled with Yahweh to obtain things his way.   He had been the believing heir to the promises but had sought to implement it in his own strength and by his own resources.   Although his wrestlings in the past were with man in the natural, it was really with Yahweh that he was contending and finally in this final conflict Yahweh has broken the power of his natural strength and disabled his old nature.  Now Yahweh could give him victory and he prevailed in his conflict with Esau.

Now Yaacov has a new identity, he is a &quot;prince with God&quot; and reigns victorious with Yahweh, and also over his previous enemy Esau.    When we trust Him to overcome the difficulties of life we also reign in life with Him.
How is it that Ya'acov became known as Israel, as one who prevails?

The Hebrew verb rendered as either &quot;overcome&quot; or &quot;prevailed&quot; is yakol, meaning &quot;be able, to suffer, to endure, and thus to prevail, and overcome. &quot; In this verse, it specifically speaks of &quot;men in wrestling or battling.&quot;

Ya'acov “wrestled,” meaning he showed forth his strength, he fought, even as the Word instructs us to “fight the good fight of faith” (1 Timothy 6:12).  Ya'acov fought even though he was alone.  He did not give up because no one joined him in the battle.  Ya'acov drew on his God-given abilities and endured the situation.  With resolute determination he grabbed hold of the God/man and refused to let go until He blessed him (32:26).

Ya'acov the deceiver, the supplanter, wrestles with Yahweh in such a consuming agony of soul that he as it were, almost wrenches from the &quot;Angel&quot; the spiritual transformation required for him to no longer function in his old  fallen nature with its corrupt character traits of self-seeking and self-preservation, but instead to reign as a prince with Yahweh, to rule over the flesh and its inherent weakness and become the Israel of God,  the man of spiritual stature that is able to birth the nation.

The struggle was so fierce that in the heat of the conflict, the sinew of Ya'acov's thigh was shrunk and thereafter he walked with a limp.    What mighty wrestlings with the Almighty were necessary before Ya'acov was able to yield, and having been touched to the depths of his being, he was thereafter never the same again, he always walked with a limp.   And Ya'acov saw the face of God and the evidence of that encounter was with him forever.
He was a changed man.    Genesis 32:24-32

Ya'acov's wrestling all night with the Angel resulted in him coming out a lame and a humbled man with a new name (identity).   Did he gain the victory through appeasing Esau (v. 20) or by wrestling with his own limitations ?  
We all need to come to the place of our Peniel where we meet Yahweh face to face and come to the end of ourselves.

Herein lies the secret to becoming Israel: We must grab hold of the God/man, Messiah Yeshua; we must grab hold of the hem of His garment and cling to this, His tzit tzit.  We must hold on to Him and resolutely refuse to let go (Numbers 15:38; Matthew 14:36).  Then we will be made whole.  Then we will prevail and obtain the blessing.  Then we will be called Israel.

Israel is a name that was given as a blessing.  It is variously said to mean, one who wrestles with God, or, powerful prevailing prince, a soldier of the Almighty, one who rules with God. Israel is a most important name, one that men have fought to claim for themselves for multiplied generations.

Who is the heir of this blessed title?  To whom does it rightfully belong? 
We see a hint at the answer in Ya'acov’s division of his family into two camps prior to meeting with Esau.  These two camps hint at the fact that Ya'acov’s family would one day be divided into two houses of Israel (Isaiah 8:14).   Like their forefathers, they too would be sent forth in the earth.  They would be used as “two witnesses” for the Holy One of Israel.  They would declare the truth about the written Torah and about the Living Word.  Ultimately, they will declare to the world that one is not completely understood without the other.

To Those Who Overcome
In the book of Revelation, the Master describes Israel in terms of those who overcome.  
1. To him who overcomes, I will grant to eat of the tree of life which is in the Paradise of God. (Revelation 2:7)
2. He who overcomes will not be hurt by the second death. (Revelation 2:11)
3. To him who overcomes, to him I will give some of the hidden manna, and I will give him a white stone, and a new 	name written on the stone which no one knows but he who receives it. (Revelation 2:17)
4. He who overcomes, and he who keeps My deeds until the end, ‘To him I will give authority over the nations...’ (Revelation 2:26)
5. He who overcomes will thus be clothed in white garments; and I will not erase his name from the book of life, and 	I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels. (Revelation 3:5)
6. He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he will not go out from it anymore; and I will write on him the name of My God, and the name of the city of My God, the new Jerusalem, which comes 
down out of heaven from My God, and My new name. (Revelation 3:12)
7. He who overcomes, I will grant to him to sit down with Me on My throne, as I also overcame and sat down with My Father on His throne. (Revelation 3:21)
8. He who overcomes will inherit these things, and I will be his God and he will be My son. (Revelation 21:7)  

Esau's Response
Esau is overwhelmed by Yaacov's generosity and by all his possessions,  and it seems to make a deep impression. Yaacov bowed before him seven times. Is this a symbol of complete submission to Esau which touches his brother's heart to forgive?

Compare Matthew 18:21-22.    
The result was a beautiful reunion.
Esau at first refuses the gift but he later accepts the gifts upon Yaacov's insistence that he has plenty.  

Note Yaacov is giving out of a pure heart that which he had taken previously of that part of the blessing which Esau had desired - the material blessings.    Is Yaacov outlining his possession so that Esau knows that he can now restore to him financially the loss of the material part of the birthright?

Yaacov has the true riches, the spiritual blessing and is content with what he has, therefore he has a freedom to give out from that with which he had been blessed.   Genesis 33:10;  Philippians 4:11-13;  1 Timothy 6: 6-11 

The first time he was in Bethel, he was by himself and his vision was his alone.  Now, he can proclaim the sanctity of the place to mankind.   More importantly, he can use his own life as a demonstration and proof of Yahweh’s care: 
&quot;And he built there an altar and he called the place E-l Bet-El (God the God of Bethel), because there HA’EL-HIM (this refers to the angels on the ladder) were revealed to him when he fled from before his brother (35:7).   
Yahweh appeared to Yaacov again when he came from Paddan Aram and He blessed him. And God said to him,   “Your name is Yaacov; your name shall not be called only Yaacov, but Yisrael shall be your name.”  And He called his name Yisrael (35:9,10).

This time, the name Yisrael is not derived, as the manlike angel said (32:29), from SIN-RESH-HEI, &quot;he who strives,&quot; but from YUD-SHIN-RESH, &quot;he who is upright with God.&quot; Yaacov is established in his newly attained walk of righteousness, the flesh has been dealt with.

And God said to him, “I am El Shaddai (the One Who is Sufficient). Be fruitful and multiply. A nation and a congregation of nations shall be from you, and kings shall come forth from your loins. And the land which I gave to Avraham and to Yitzchak, to you I will give it, and to your seed after you will I give the land” (35:11,12).

Here Yahweh confirms the chosenness of Yaacov as one through whom the covenants of his forbears would be fulfilled and confirms the promises to his descendants.   He also reveals His Name as He who is Sufficient to fulfill the promises to him, thus giving him reassurance and establishing him in his faith.

In the Land
As they left Bethel after the covenant had been confirmed of his full inheritance of the promises, Rachel his beloved, goes into childbirth and in the process - dies giving birth to Benjamin, whom she chooses to name Ben-oni, son of my sorrow or my strength (passing).  Yaacov chose to name him 'son of my right hand'  (Bin Yamin) as a token to Rachel who was as his right hand.  His name also has the meaning of 'son of the south' referring to the fact of being born in the land (to the south)  and also, 'son of days' or 'son of happiness' - the son of his old age.

Rachel had stolen the household gods from her father Laban when they left the land, no doubt feeling justified to have a token of the family inheritance of their father after his spoiling of Yaacov.    Yaacov had uttered a judgement of death upon whoever had  stolen the 'teraphim', unknowingly that Rachel was the culprit.    And so, the curse of the death sentence came upon her, but in His goodness He withheld it until she was in the land and she had delivered her second son and received her portion of the allotted inheritance in the building of the nation.

Some observe that it also fulfilled the righteous requirements of the Torah that Yaacov only have one wife in the land of their inheritance.  It was no fault of Rachel that she was married to Yaacov after Leah, but it was contrary to Torah that a man marry two sisters,  and to maintain the sanctity of the land of their inheritance, he could no longer be married to two sisters in the land of Israel.   For that reason also she was not buried in the Cave of Macphelah as his wife, but was buried in the future territory of her son Benjamin in the land.    Leviticus 18:18

Today that traditional site is located four miles south of Jerusalem and one mile north of Bethlehem.   1 Samuel 10:2 mention Rachels' tomb being well marked at that time.

At the time of Ya'acov's return, Esau was dwelling in the land and had the actual possession of the inheritance due to Ya'acov's absence.  Although he had the blessing and the promises, he did not have possession of them experientially. In time Esau acknowledges the rights of Ya'acov to have the land and he departs to live in Seir.  Genesis 36: 6-8

Just as Ya'acov took possession of his inheritance then, so it is prophesied that &quot;the house of Ya'acov will possess their possessions&quot; also in the future and none shall make them afraid.  For it shall be for those who overcome.  Obadiah 17

It is understood that Yaacov spent the next period of his life with his father Isaac before he passed on from this life.  Yaacov and Esau bury him.  (Genesis 35:27-29)   The scripture says that He had fulfilled his days and we understand from that he had fulfilled all the purposes of Yahweh for his days.

The remainder of this scripture portion is given to Esau and his descendants.   Esau obtained Mt. Seir which he gained from the Horites, descendants of Seir, and which Yahweh had allotted to him (Deuteronomy 2: 5)
He became the father of the Edomites who later were hostile to Israel when they came through the wilderness to take their allotted inheritance in the land.   Numbers 20:19-21

      <text xml:space="preserve">The '''pancreas''' is a conglomerate gland lying transversely across the posterior wall of the abdomen. It varies in length from 15 to 20 cm (6 to 8 in) and has a breadth of about 3.8 cm (about 1.5 in) and a thickness of from 1.3 to 2.5 cm (0.5 to 1 in). Its usual weight is about 85 gm (about 3 oz), and its head lies in the concavity of the duodenum.

The pancreas has both an exocrine and an endocrine secretion. The exocrine secretion is made up of a number of enzymes that are discharged into the intestine to aid in digestion. The endocrine secretion, insulin, is important in the metabolism of sugar in the body. Insulin is produced in small groups of especially modified glandular cells in the pancreas; these cell groups are known as the islets of Langerhans. The failure of these cells to secrete sufficient amounts of insulin causes diabetes. In 1968 a team of surgeons at the medical school of the University of Minnesota performed the first pancreas transplants on four diabetics, using the pancreases of cadavers. Pancreas transplants remain notably difficult, with only about one in ten lasting for more than a year, even with the advent of drugs such as cyclosporine.

Diseases of the pancreas are not common. Hemorrhage in the pancreas and acute pancreatitis are, however, serious conditions. If not relieved rapidly, they may cause death. The symptoms are not definite, resembling those of peritonitis or intestinal obstruction.

&lt;p&gt;
[http://www.datanucleus.org/products/accessplatform DataNucleus AccessPlatform] is a Java persistence solution, supporting JDO and JPA specifications, providing much more than a simple ORM provides.
&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
The goal of DataNucleus is to provide support for persistence of Java objects using JDO or JPA APIs to a range of datastores. These currently include RDBMS, ODBMS, XML, ODF, Excel, LDAP, JSON, Google BigTable, Amazon S3, HBase, Cassandra and Neo4j. This range of possible datastores is by far the widest available with any JPA implementation, and in addition allows use of JDO metadata and persistence using JPA's API if required, or indeed use of JPA metadata and persistence using JDO's API, again more flexible than available with any other JPA implementation.
To view further details about current capabilities of AccessPlatform, please visit the [http://www.datanucleus.org/documentation/products/accessplatform.html DataNucleus AccessPlatform] website.

==Class Project Guidelines==
You may find this page helpful: [[Wikibooks:Guidelines_for_class_projects]]. It would also be good if you could encourage your students to create their own Wikibooks accounts rather than editing pages anonymously like recent edits to [[Survey_of_Information_Policy_Issues/Satellite_Communications]]. Anonymous editing is a trick used by a small number of vandals who try to disrupt our work here, so the fewer anonymous edits occur the easier it is for the local counter-vandalism team to maintain the site.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Blood Transfusion''' in medicine, the procedure of introducing the blood of a donor or blood predonated by the recipient (autologous transfusion) into the bloodstream. It is a highly effective form of therapy and has saved the lives of incalculable numbers of people suffering from shock, hemorrhage, or blood diseases. Blood transfusion is employed routinely in cases of surgery, trauma, gastrointestinal bleeding, and in childbirths that involve great loss of blood.

In the 17th century, the French physician Jean Baptiste Denis performed the first recorded transfusion by infusing sheep's blood into a human. Most later attempts were unsuccessful. Even when human blood was used, the majority of recipients died because of blood incompatibility. With the discovery of the major blood groups and the introduction of blood typing in the 20th century, transfusion became routinely successful.

Transfusions still tend to cause the development of sensitivity and increase the possibility that the recipient will react to any later transfusions. Transmission of viral hepatitis was a major risk until a method of screening blood for infectivity was developed in the 1960s; some other forms of hepatitis, however, are not detected by this test. In 1985 a test was introduced that screens donated blood for an antigen associated with AIDS.

For most of this century, transfusion was accomplished with whole blood. Methods of separating blood into its components were devised during the 1960s. Between 1970 and 1980 the use of these blood components became more frequent than the use of whole blood. Replacement with packed red blood cells (concentrated blood cells that have been separated from the blood plasma) is now the preferred treatment for most blood loss caused by injury or surgery.

In some instances the circulating blood volume can be depleted by loss of fluid but little or no loss of red cells. For example, this can occur soon after a severe burn, during peritonitis, and after a limb has suffered a crush injury. The purpose of transfusion in these instances is to bring the amount of circulating fluid back to or toward normal. For such transfusions red blood cells are not necessary; plasma or, better, serum albumin, a plasma derivative, is more appropriate. Fresh-frozen plasma can be stored for as long as a year, but it still has the potential for transmitting hepatitis and is best used only when blood-clotting factors (proteins in the plasma that assist in the clotting process) are needed. Albumin solution, on the other hand, is heat-treated to destroy hepatitis infectivity. It is used in the management of shock and burns, and for some patients with kidney and liver disease. A less pure fraction of plasma called plasma protein fraction can be used for many of the same purposes.

Clotting factors isolated from blood are used to treat some hereditary bleeding disorders such as hemophilia. Patients undergoing chemotherapy for cancer may have too few platelets, small blood components that help prevent or stop bleeding, both separate from and as part of the clotting process; they may be given an infusion of platelets to speed clotting.

Various synthetic plasma substitutes, such as the carbohydrate compound dextran, as well as various saline solutions, have been used in recent years to replenish the blood-fluid level that often falls dangerously low in cases of sudden shock. These substances, called plasma volume expanders, are more readily available than blood products. During the late 1970s, a synthetic blood-carrying substance called Fluosol-DA, a fluorinated hydrocarbon, was successfully used in several patients who could not or, for religious reasons, would not receive transfusions of natural blood products. Research is also being conducted into ways of converting one blood type into another; if developed, this process would help increase the availability of blood products to all patients.

Although blood can be transferred directly, the usual practice for hospitals is to use blood that has been collected earlier and stored in so-called blood banks. The use of stored blood began during World War I (1914-1918), but the first large-scale blood bank was not created until 1937, in Chicago. Many health-care centers now maintain their own blood banks, using more than 98 percent volunteer donors; the American Red Cross also runs a large volunteer program. A donor supplies 480 ml (about 1 pint) each time, and samples are also taken for typing and screening.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Map of territorial growth 1775.svg|thumb|In 1775, the British claimed authority over the red and pink areas on this map and Spain ruled the orange. The red area is the area of the thirteen colonies open to settlement after the Proclamation of 1763]]
The '''Thirteen Colonies''' were part of what became known as British America, a name that was used by Great Britain until the Treaty of Paris recognized the independence of the original thirteen United States of America in 1783. These British colonies in North America rebelled against British rule in 1775, in what is called the American Revolution in the United States and the American War of Independence in other countries. A provisional government was formed which proclaimed their independence, which is now celebrated as having occurred on July 4, 1776 (Independence Day), and subsequently became the original thirteen United States of America. The colonies were founded between 1607 (Virginia), and 1733 (Georgia), although Great Britain held several other colonies in North America and the West Indies that did not join the rebellion in 1775.

[[File:Thirteen Colonies Original Highlighted.svg|thumb|250px|The original 13 states today]]
The Thirteen Colonies gave rise to eighteen present-day states: the original thirteen states (in chronological order of their ratification of the United States Constitution: Delaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Maryland, South Carolina, New Hampshire, Virginia, New York, North Carolina, Rhode Island), Vermont (which had been disputed between New Hampshire and New York, and was an independent republic from 1777 to 1791), Kentucky (which had been part of Virginia until 1792), Tennessee (which had been part of North Carolina until 1790 and then the federally administrated Southwest Territory until 1796), Maine (formerly part of Massachusetts until 1820), and West Virginia (part of Virginia until 1863).

[[File:Us flag large Betsy Ross.png|thumb|The flag of the 13 colonies]]
==List of colonies==
Contemporaneous documents usually list the thirteen revolutionary colonies of British North America in geographical order, from the north to the south.

'''New England Colonies'''
 
* Province of New Hampshire, later New Hampshire
* Province of Massachusetts Bay, later Massachusetts and Maine
* Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations, later Rhode Island and Providence Plantations
* Connecticut Colony, later Connecticut

'''Middle Colonies''' 

* Province of New York, later New York and Vermont
* Province of New Jersey, later New Jersey
* Province of Pennsylvania, later Pennsylvania
* Delaware Colony (before 1776, the Lower Counties on Delaware), later Delaware

'''Southern Colonies'''
 
(depending on the subject under discussion, Virginia and Maryland may be grouped as the Chesapeake Colonies)
* Province of Maryland, later Maryland
* Colony and Dominion of Virginia, later Virginia, Kentucky and West Virginia
* Province of North Carolina, later North Carolina and Tennessee
* Province of South Carolina, later South Carolina
* Province of Georgia, later Georgia

      <comment>/* Using Your Renderer */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Getting Started ==
First of all, open up Visual c#, and select 'File'/'New Project'. From there select to create a new C# project.

[[File:XNA New Project.gif|centre|border]]

What you should see in front of you are the standard starting XNA starting code. Add the projects 'SkinnedModelPipeline' and 'SkinnedModelWindows' from the previously downloaded skinned model sample, and add a reference to them by entering &lt;code&gt;using SkinnedModel;&lt;/code&gt; along with your other using statements and by right clicking on your project and selecting them under 'Add Reference'.

[[File:XNA Add reference.gif|centre|border]]

Plus ensure that the class is referencing the 'Game' class as below by changing the first line of your class.
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
public class ModelRenderer : Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Game
&lt;/source&gt;

And place the 'SkinnedModel.fx' file from 'SkinnedModelWindows' project into your projects content folder as your model will use it to render.

== Fish Renderer ==
Next up, create a new game component file called 'ModelRenderer'. From this, add the following class variables.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
public AnimationPlayer animationPlayer; //Controls the animation, references a method in the pre-loaded project
public AnimationClip clip; //Contains the animation clip currently playing
public Model currentModel; //Model reference
public SkinningData skinningData; //Used by the AnimationPlayer method
public Vector3 Translation = new Vector3(0, 0, 0); //Fishes current position on the screen
public Vector3 Rotation = new Vector3(0, 0, 0); //Current rotation
public float Scale = 1.0f; //Current scale
&lt;/source&gt;

Change the constructor as follows.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
public ModelRenderer(Model currentModelInput)
{
    currentModel = currentModelInput;
    // Look up our custom skinning information.
    skinningData = currentModel.Tag as SkinningData;
    if (skinningData == null)
        throw new InvalidOperationException
            (&quot;This model does not contain a SkinningData tag.&quot;);
    // Create an animation player, and start decoding an animation clip.
    animationPlayer = new AnimationPlayer(skinningData);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This code, more or less taken from original sample, initialises methods which will eventually be used for the animation process.

Next, remove the code from the pre-made update method, and replace it with this.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
if ((clip != null))
    animationPlayer.Update(gameTime.ElapsedGameTime, true, Matrix.Identity);
&lt;/source&gt;

The .Update method here will ensure that the animation currently playing by the method will be played in sequence and in time with everything else using the passed 'gameTime'.

The active ingredient of this class is the below Draw method:
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
public void ModelDraw(GraphicsDevice device, Vector3 cameraPosition, Vector3 cameraTarget, float farPlaneDistance)
{
    Matrix[] bones = animationPlayer.GetSkinTransforms();
    for (int i = 0; i &lt; bones.Length; i++)
    {
        bones[i] *= 
              Matrix.CreateRotationX(Rotation.X) //Computes the rotation
            * Matrix.CreateRotationY(Rotation.Y)
            * Matrix.CreateRotationZ(Rotation.Z)
            * Matrix.CreateScale(Scale) //Applys the scale
            * Matrix.CreateWorld(Translation, Vector3.Forward, Vector3.Up); //Move the models position
    }

    float aspectRatio = (float)device.Viewport.Width /
                        (float)device.Viewport.Height;

    // Compute camera matrices.
    Matrix view = Matrix.CreateLookAt(cameraPosition, cameraTarget, Vector3.Right);

    //Create the 3D projection for this model
    Matrix projection = Matrix.CreatePerspectiveFieldOfView(MathHelper.ToRadians(45.0f), aspectRatio,
        1.0f, farPlaneDistance);

    // Render the skinned mesh.
    foreach (ModelMesh mesh in currentModel.Meshes)
    {
        foreach (Effect effect in mesh.Effects)
        {
            effect.Parameters[&quot;Bones&quot;].SetValue(bones);
            effect.Parameters[&quot;View&quot;].SetValue(view);
            effect.Parameters[&quot;Projection&quot;].SetValue(projection);
        }
        mesh.Draw();
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

We don't need to worry about this too much for the sake of this tutorial.

Add a new method which will be called from the parent file which will call elements of the pre-loaded 'SkinnedModel', playing the animation.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
public void PlayAnimation(String Animation)
{
    clip = skinningData.AnimationClips[Animation];
    if (clip != animationPlayer.CurrentClip)
    animationPlayer.StartClip(clip);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

We will be adding to this code as we extend the logic of the actual gameplay (as its quite a convienent place to store instance variables on the fish we will be using), but for now this more than covers the basics which are needed for the system, and next we can worry about using it to render the model.

== Using Your Renderer ==
Create a new folder under 'Content' in your project called 'Models', and add your fish model and all the .tga texture files.
Now right click on the 'References' folder, and add 'SkinnedModelPipeline'. This will allow you to select the correct renderer for your model by going into your models properties and changing it to the new 'SkinnedModelProcessor'.
If you are unable to select it, ensure that the two 'SkinnedModel' projects are built by right clicking on them and selecting 'Build'.

Now go back to your parent file. Add some new class variable;
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
ModelRenderer FishMen; //Your new Fish model
Vector3 cameraPosition; //Defines the position of the camera in the 3D space
Vector3 cameraTarget; //Defines your camera target
float farPlaneDistance = 400f; //Defines your plane distance, the higher, the less 3D 'fog' and the more is displayed
&lt;/source&gt;

And put it into use by going into your update method and adding the line
&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
FishMen.Update(gameTime);
cameraPosition = cameraTarget = FishMen.Translation;
cameraPosition.Z += 20.0f;
&lt;/source&gt;
at the start of the method, and in the draw method adding &lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;FishMen.ModelDraw(device, cameraPosition, cameraTarget, farPlaneDistance);&lt;/source&gt; after your &lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;GraphicsDevice.Clear(Color.CornflowerBlue);&lt;/source&gt; line.

And finally, add the following in the start of your 'LoadContent' method.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
Model currentModel; //Temporary storage for your new model

Content.RootDirectory = &quot;Content&quot;;
currentModel = Content.Load&lt;Model&gt;(&quot;Models\\FishModel&quot;); //Loads your new model, point it towards your model
FishMen = new ModelRenderer(currentModel);
FishMen.Translation = new Vector3(0f);//Move it to the centre
FishMen.PlayAnimation(&quot;Swim&quot;);//Play the default swimming animation
&lt;/source&gt;

[[File:XNA Finished Fish.gif|centre|border]]

Now, run your application, and everything should work.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== BBC Weather forecasts ==

Some weather data is available from the BBC as RSS feeds.  Currently this includes the [http://newsrss.bbc.co.uk/weather/forecast/3/ObservationsRSS.xml current conditions] and the [http://newsrss.bbc.co.uk/weather/forecast/3/Next3DaysRSS.xml 3-day forecast].  Lacking a standard set of tags fro weather properties, the conditions are expressed in a string and string parsing is needed to access the elemental data.

For other forecasts such as the 24-hr and 5 day which are not available as RSS we must scrape the HTML page.  

One approach to this task is this [http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/pipe.edit?_id=1HlcTL8F3hGF7NSlPxJ3AQ Yahoo Pipe] which converts the page to an RSS feed. However the data would be more useful converted to XML elements.

== Dates and times ==

In all these pages and feeds there is a problem to assign a date to a forecast or observation. Dates are often omitted or expressed as a day-of-the week. This leads to complications in processing both RSS and HTMl pages.

== 24-hour forecast ==

This script uses the eXist module httpclient to get the HTML, parses the HTML and generates an XML file.  This XML could then be transformed via XSLT to a viewable page.


=== Interface ===

This script has two parameter:
* region - required - a numeric code unique to the BBC (? code list)
* area - optional - a sub region , typically the beginning of the postcode

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;(This is not an automated message, I'll be watching during a time for any reply you make to it...)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 06:59, 10 December 2009 (UTC)

==Blanking of Experiential_Learning==
I noticed that you recently blanked the page [[The_Practice_of_Learning_Theories/Experiential_Learning]]. Some justification for this action on its discussion page might be a good idea, as blanking pages for no reason is often done by vandals and could result in the restoration of the page by the Wikibooks counter-vandalism team.

=Introduction=

The mean stress during a load cycle can be compressive, zero or tensile.  A compressive mean stress reduces the rate of micro crack growth, and consequently increases the fatigue life.  A tensile mean stress on the other hand has the reversed effect on fatigue life.  The impact of mean stress can be very significant.   

There are several potential causes of non-zero mean stress, including: biased external loading, residual stresses and structural nonlinearities.

One frequently used term is the stress ratio &lt;math&gt;R = \frac{\sigma_{min}}{\sigma_{max}}&lt;/math&gt;.  This measure offers a convenient way to classify different stress constellations, as follows:

* &lt;math&gt;R = 1 \Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; constant stress
* &lt;math&gt;R = \pm \infty \Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; no tension, only cyclic compression
* &lt;math&gt;R = 0 \Rightarrow&lt;/math&gt; no compression, only cyclic tension

=Introduction=

The goal of this section is to lay out some common methods for assessing the total fatigue damage effect of varying loads.  
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
It is not unusual to have several varying loads affecting an engineering product.  Unfortunately, textbooks on fatigue analysis seldom offer adequate descriptions of how such systems should be analyzed.  Section [[/Multiple Loads/]] presents a discussion on this matter.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;'''Electronic Records and Trust Frameworks''' &lt;/big&gt;

==Abstract==
With the onset of the digital age most of the records are still retained on paper but as the electronic record system flourishes it also gives rise to certain issues pertaining to it. The aim of this chapter is to provide suggestions to establish trust in the electronic record framework. This chapter deals with basic functionalities of an electronic record management system like accessing the data, retrieving the data and retention policies. The lifecycle of electronic records such as identifying, capturing and storage of electronic records has been described. The chapter also touches upon the options of implementing open source systems to manage electronic records within an organization or state agency. It also helps in understanding various record management systems available in the market and making a proper choice for their implementation in an organization.

==Introduction==
Electronic record management is an essential issue which needs to be addressed in every company implementing information systems. In recent years the federal agencies have embraced the idea of electronic records over the traditional paper records. Due to the need for archiving the data the paper based records face the problem of becoming increasingly difficult to manage. As this occurs, legal requirements and management efforts designed for paper records become progressively less satisfactory to ensure an adequate legal and historical record of organizations or state agencies decision making. 

==Content, Structure and Context with regard to electronic records==
Electronic Records warrant special regard with respect to their management due to the following characteristics associated with them: 
#	Content:  The part of the record that conveys the actual message which may be text, video or sound. 
#	Context: The information that helps in understanding the origins of the record and the business, technological, procedural or legal framework that the record is a part of.  
#	Medium: The physical carrier that stores/transfers the content of the record. 
#	Structure: The arrangement of the content within the record i.e. formatting etc. 
An electronic record can be considered to be complete only if all the above mentioned characteristics are maintained. From a legal standpoint, an electronic record is not admissible as evidence if it cannot be reconstructed in its entirety, with all of its characteristics consolidated in a meaningful manner.   For an electronic record management framework to be effective it should emphasize on maintaining all of the attributes of a record, namely the content, context, medium and structure. 
Metadata for electronic records needs to be maintained to provide the business, technical and contextual information and to establish an audit trail. The creation of metadata should be an integral component of the record keeping system.

==Ensuring Legal Admissibility== 
In order to meet the requirements of legal admissibility, electronic records need to be authentic and reliable. For a record to be authentic, it needs to be what it claims to be. An authentic record ‘does not result from any manipulation, substitution, or falsification occurring after the completion of its procedure of creation, and it is therefore what it purports to be’.  ‘A record is considered to be reliable when it can be treated as a fact in itself’ (Duranti, 1994). For a record to be reliable its creation needs to be procedurally controlled.   
In the case of business records, there is an increasing shift towards implementing controls in the record keeping process to ensure the reliability and authenticity of electronic records. From a legal standpoint, if the record keeping process is designed and implemented with adequate controls and if this is verifiable through the presence of an audit trail, the records are generally admissible in court. 

==Electronic Storage Reliability==
The Uniform Photographic Copies of Business and Public Records as Evidence Act (there are both federal and state versions) states that a reproduction made by any &quot;process which accurately reproduces or forms a durable medium for reproducing the original is as admissible in evidence as the original itself. With the advent of electronic records paper records are still considerably significant in many organizations. Therefore mixed data storage is utilized in various companies. For example, many companies store scanned documents and electronic/hard copy faxes in addition to completely electronic exchange storage, such as email. 
This act is important because it bridges electronic and hard storage. It also helps to define what is considered &quot;an original&quot; document. For a reproduction of an electronic record to be as acceptable as the original, the medium used for the storage of records must be reliable and must support the reproduction of an accurate facsimile of the original record. The United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regulation mandates that &quot;the electronic storage media must: preserve the records exclusively in a non-rewriteable, non-erasable format.&quot; This regulation also stipulates that &quot;if employing any electronic storage media other than Optical Disk technology, the member, broker, or dealer must notify its designated examining authority at least 90 days prior to employing such storage media. (Charla,G-B)

==Recordkeeping Systems== 
Record keeping systems are manual or automated systems in which records are collected, organized, and categorized to facilitate their preservation, retrieval, use, and disposition must be established that will: 
#	Organize records; 
#	Index records; and 
#	Allow appropriate staff access to all records. (Budget, 1998) 

==Electronic Recordkeeping System== 
An electronic system in which records are collected, organized, and categorized to facilitate their preservation, retrieval, use, and disposition may be either 
#	A distinct system designed specifically to provide recordkeeping functionality or 
#	Part of another system. (Agency Recordkeeping Requirements, 2004)
A distinct electronic recordkeeping system may comprise of an application program which provides recordkeeping functionality, data and metadata needed for management of the records controlled by the system, and any electronic records managed by the system. An electronic recordkeeping system may be part of another system, such as an application system or an electronic document management system, when the design of that system includes recordkeeping functionality (South Carolina Department of Archives &amp; History, 2005)
Characteristics of Recordkeeping Systems
A recordkeeping system must be designed to manage and retrieve information admissible for legal actions and available as evidence for audits and other legal scenarios where the record may be presented as evidence. This is accomplished through the development of policies that promote the creation and maintenance of trustworthy systems to produce authentic and reliable records. 

==Creating Electronic Record Systems==
Electronic recordkeeping systems must have accurately documented policies, assigned responsibilities, and formal methodologies for their management. At the same time the organization needs to ensure that the system itself is safe guarded from external and internal sources in such a way that those with proper access alone should be able to access the system only when it’s required.
Electronic recordkeeping systems must meet the following criteria:
# Consistent: recordkeeping systems must process information in a manner that assures that the records they create are credible.
# Complete: contain content, structure, and context generated by the transaction they document.
# Accurate: quality controlled at input to ensure the information in the system correctly reflects what was communicated in the transaction.
# Preserved: records must continue to reflect content, structure, and context within any system by which the records are retained over time. (South Carolina Department of Archives &amp; History, 2005)

For electronic records systems that produce, use, or store data files, disposition instructions for the data should be incorporated into the system's design.
All organizations should maintain adequate technical documentation for each electronic records system, including documentation of system design, implementation, use, and migration.

==Identifying Electronic Records==
Organizations have traditionally used records surveys and inventories to identify which records they maintain and to decide what to do with those records. In an electronic context, surveys of physical storage media (e.g. tape libraries or workstation hard drives) do not provide much useful information for determining which records exist or for deciding what to do with them. In order to enhance performance and convenience, most information systems make use of redundant data, through such practices as caching, disk duplexing, mirroring, clustering, client-side processing, desktop information management, disaster recovery measures, and routine system backups. Instead of attempting to inventory all of this data that exists at any one time, electronic records management requires the identification of organization functions, processes, transactions and activities to be documented. Once these have been identified, it will be possible to determine which data and associated metadata must be retained to serve as an official record.


==Capturing Electronic Records==
Strategies for capturing electronic records will differ, depending on the opportunities presented by an organization's hardware and software environment. Locations at which records can be captured include software layers (especially suited to open systems environments) and at every interface between hardware components through which the relevant data passes. The technological environment will influence the decisions as to whether records are captured through:
#	The user interface layer, 
#	Modification of the application software, 
#	The operating system, 
#	The application program interface (API), or 
#	The front end to a corporate filing system.( Kansas Electronic Records Management Guidelines)
Also there are various other factors that influence when and how these records are captured such as the organizational environment will also influence the point at which records are captured. This will include perceptions about what constitutes a record, assignment of responsibility, agency requirements to create records, and staff understanding of the technology involved.
Regardless of the approach an organization takes, it must be able to identify specific information objects as records and somehow distinguish between the types of records to which different business and retention requirements must be applied. Possible approaches include: 
#	Business transaction information is identified in an &quot;envelope&quot; or file header, so the file does not need to be opened to be identified. 
#	The record creator is responsible for capturing his or her own records and assigning management practices to them at the point of creation. This could be implemented as a screen the user fills in before documents can be saved or messages can be sent. 
#	A user interface is designed so that users can choose between a number of icons representing business tasks or style templates, e.g., &quot;send policy&quot; or &quot;make appointments.&quot; The choice of icon can engage the appropriate application, distribution lists, and style sheets and records disposal authorities. The sender thus affects scheduling but need not make conscious decisions about assigning retention periods to records. 


==Access to Electronic Records==
Access to any given electronic record is governed by the Open Records Act of 1983. The record essentially allows public access to records regardless of their physical format or location. The access to the documents however needs to be governed. Now, more than ever, the responsibility for reference and access is a shared responsibility between the Archives and government or any kind of agencies. State archives are the higher bodies which deal with the electronic record keeping. 
Government agencies are required to retain electronic records to meet minimal legal retention requirements imposed by statute, or business or administrative needs. Electronic records which are to be preserved for a longer period of time need to be preserved in a form which is accessible to all the users who have access to it. It should also be in a usable form by the state agencies or any particular private agency. Any electronic cannot be arbitrarily destroyed from the archive it needs to be legally destroyed following the records disposition act issued by the state archive or the governing body. (Aveni,Kowlowitz, and Mashburn, 2001)

At a broader level, the State Archives' role will be to:
#	Advise organizations on matters related to access to records with enduring value,
#	Set standards for their preservation and accessibility, and
#	Work with agencies to identify the access status of classes of records during system design, major modification or appraisal. (Kansas Electronic Records Management Guidelines)
Safeguarding access: The electronic records are distributed and replicated over various systems. Public access is not given to the live system but rather to a mirror site or parallel system. Any sensitive or classified records should be appropriately encrypted to prevent unauthorized access. Standard authentication like a username and password need to be followed in any case. Users are to be given access rights and only users with the appropriate rights are allowed to make changes to the electronic record. 

==Retrieval of electronic records==
Using of electronic records brings in more challenges like maintenance of existing system, migrating to a new system and/or system redesign. There are chances that during the implementation of the new system certain data or documents may be lost or accidently deleted. Retrieval of such documents is very important. All information in the current system must be migrated to the new system. The conversion must ensure that the converted records are authentic, reliable, and usable and have integrity. A new system can be developed which allows multiple user access to the system and makes a log of every transaction or changes made to a record. It will assure continued access to current records while permitting the future migration to new hardware and software. It will allow rapid retrieval of information while providing frequent backups and disaster recovery. 

''Establish standards for file formats'': A policy should be in place which associates an approved data file format for every record. Even after using particular software for data retrieval and display it is subject to change either by updating it to the new version or migrating to a new system from an old one. To avoid any glitch in the data retrieval process a policy of approved media formats for records storage will facilitate data migration to ensure long-term retrieval of electronic records.

==Record Retention Policies and Procedures== 
Record retention refers to the amount of time the record is to be kept and managed before it can be destroyed. This length of time is determined by assessing the value and the authenticity of the record from a legal and business standpoint. Having a retention policy in place is necessary due to the unusually large amounts of data we are inundated with, in the present age. Hence the record keeping agency needs to identify records that are of enduring value and ensure that they are maintained on the record keeping system for a defined period of time.  According to the Interpares project (Terry Eastwood) if it is determined that an electronic records does not convey the meaning that it did at the time of its creation, the appraiser can decide that the record need not be preserved. Another determining factor that can affect record retention policies is the feasibility of preservation of the record. This depends on the record keeping agency’s hardware and software capabilities along with the financial and storage constraints. An example that illustrates the importance of a well-defined record retention policy is the deletion of an official e-mail by former Assistant Secretary – Indian Affairs, Neal McCaleb due to the allocation of too little hard disk space. (Wright, 2009)



==Written Procedures/Training==
Since computer systems are used to create and store records, organizations should write procedures to control the use, access, and productivity on the personal computer. All employees with access to these systems should receive guidance on the following issues:
#	How to distinguish official records from non record material;
#	How to know when receipts or acknowledgments for e-mail messages are needed for recordkeeping purposes;
#	How and when to generate a recordkeeping copy of e-mail messages, receipts or acknowledgments, spreadsheets, word processing documents, and data base reports;
3	How to mark or classify documents for filing or incorporation into an electronic system with recordkeeping capabilities, when appropriate; and
#	How to contact the record coordinator in their agency or the records analyst from ISD Records Management for assistance. (South Carolina Department of Archives &amp; History, 2005)

==Managing Legacy Records==
One of the inherent issues with electronic records is their dependency on the underlying technology that is used to create/store/modify the records. This dependency proves to be a deterrent in the maintenance, access and retrieval of records that are stored on legacy systems.  As the information system becomes redundant, so do all the records that are stored on them. As the (Dollar, 2005) mentions, media renewal is one way of dealing with issues of continued readability and accessibility of records stored on legacy systems.  It involves copying data over to new storage media while maintaining the processibility and the essential characteristics of the records.  One of the approaches for dealing with legacy records is software emulation that involves using present-day software to replicate the functionality of another information system (a legacy information system in this scenario) with the intent to enable access to legacy records.   
Data migration is another solution where the emphasis is on converting legacy records to technology neutral files formats to do-away with the dependency on the underlying technological platform. However this process needs to be carried out with a stringent quality control mechanism to ensure that the data is transferred without introducing errors and losing the defining characteristics of the original record.  

==The Importance of Open Standards for Electronic Records Management==
Open source systems can be embraced by every agency enabling record management. Data interchange, interoperability, migration of system etc all depend on the open source standards. The motive being that the electronic record or data should not be dependant or attached to one particular software or hardware of a proprietary vendor. Any kind of file formats, protocols and various system specifications which are adopted by the state agencies should be recognized by various standard international or national bodies. Since the standards which fulfill the requirements are publically documented and accepted by standard governing bodies and multiple vendors, the agencies will be less likely stuck with records which are valuable but inaccessible. Hence the companies will tend to switch over to open system over closed system to enable standardized methodology for data management.  
Open sources are cheap alternatives to commercial systems which enable electronic record management. Various companies and government organization are willing to switch on to open source standards. The only problem here is that open sources standards are not very well developed in the industry as of yet. Open source is great but it should be done on a pragmatic basis. 

==Inter-Agency Transfer of Records== 
When electronic records are transferred from one agency to the other, apart from the content it is necessary to transfer contextual information along with the metadata related to the record. There must be a well defined protocol for the interagency transfer of records. The National Archives and Records Administration (NARA) in its code of regulations lists that in addition to the record, agencies must transfer documentation that aids in the interpretation of the content. Any agengy transferring records to the U.S. National archives is mandated to complete a Technical Description form (NARA form 14097) and an Information System Description Form (NARA Form 14028). In the case of databases record layouts, data element definitions and code translation tables for coded data values are required to be submitted. (NARA Code of Federal Regulations, 2009)

==Digital signatures== 
We can use digital signatures to identify whom an electronic record stored in PDF format  came from and how a signed document has been modified before it was transferred or stored in the system. Digital signatures can provide electronic records the same, or better, assurances that many paper-based processes have in the past. 
There are many types of electronic signatures. We can write our name on an electronic signature pad, or it can simply be a record of a user clicking an ‘I Agree’ button on a web page. However, electronic signatures don’t necessarily mean that the documents are genuine or have not been tampered with before they are stored or accessed. Thus a better way is to also provide digital signatures.
A digital signature is a specific type of electronic signature that includes technology to establish the authenticity of the signed content. Software should use digital signatures that are based on public key infrastructure (PKI) technologies to establish authenticity in PDF documents if these documents are being transferred between groups or departments. PKI systems use certificates and keys to identify individuals or organizations. (Adobe systems INC., 2007) The owner uses a key to “sign” the document, and the recipient uses a key to verify the signature and the authenticity of the signed document. Supporting technologies help establish other non repudiation features like the time of signing and the status of the signing keys. Signature appearances help human verifiers understand the nature of a signature. The signing party usually determines the appearance of a digital signature in a PDF document. The signature image can be a simple text box, a corporate or organizational logo, a photo, or even an image or capture of a handwritten signature, depending on the nature of the record and the context of the signature.

==Records Management Software==
Records management software systems help businesses and government agencies manage a variety of activities and functions, from file requesting and tracking to retention and disposition to access and security. Records management focuses on preserving the integrity of records throughout their lifecycle. Records management systems are designed to maintain a record’s integrity and to track the chain of custody and manage retention and destruction. Furthermore, in a records management software solution, records in any form (electronic or physical) can be managed in a single collaborative system.
To select proper management software we need to make an inventory of the records. The inventory should include the location of the data, the condition of the data, the access rules etc. We then need to determine what kind of software we need after completion of the inventory. We need to investigate the functionality of software. Functionality essentially includes help features, menus and commands, speed and accuracy and access security classification. After determining the requirements choosing the software is relatively an easy job. There are many off-shelf software available in the market. Another option is to get a software custom-made to the user requirements. The decision is basically in the hands of the organization to select which is the most efficient and cost effective software. (Moreland, 2002)

==Conclusion==
Building controls into the record keeping system can go a long way in establishing trust in the electronic records stored on the system. Record keeping systems need to be designed in a manner that increases transparency and accountability. There must be stringent procedures, guidelines and control mechanisms established for every stage of the electronic record life-cycle. Effective record management procedures must be seamlessly integrated into the business processes of an organization or state agency. Without the development of modern recordkeeping policies, procedures, and practices for both manual and electronic formats, there is a danger that many of the gains that had been made in recent years would be at risk in the future. Organizations and state agencies need to ensure that the records of day-to-day business are authentic, accurate, reliable and complete from a legal standpoint, while citizens needed to be certain that records would be properly managed to ensure accountability and transparency of organizations and state agencies, to protect their rights and entitlements.

      <text xml:space="preserve">

The effect of mean stress, &lt;math&gt;\sigma_m&lt;/math&gt;,can be modeled by the following relations:

*&lt;b&gt;Soderberg&lt;/b&gt;:    &lt;math&gt; \sigma_a = \sigma_{a, \sigma_m = 0} (1 - \frac{\sigma_m} {\sigma_y}) &lt;/math&gt;; &lt;br&gt;which is conservative for most engineering alloys

*&lt;b&gt;Modified Goodman&lt;/b&gt;:     &lt;math&gt; \sigma_a = \sigma_{a, \sigma_m = 0} (1 - \frac{\sigma_m}{\sigma_u}) &lt;/math&gt;; &lt;br&gt; which is nonconservative when &lt;math&gt; \sigma_m &lt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;.  It is however, a good approximation for brittle materials and conservative for ductile alloys, when &lt;math&gt; \sigma_m \leq 0 &lt;/math&gt;

*&lt;b&gt;Gerber&lt;/b&gt;:     &lt;math&gt; \sigma_a = \sigma_{a, \sigma_m = 0} (1 - {\frac{\sigma_m}{\sigma_u}}^2) &lt;/math&gt;; &lt;br&gt; which is only valid when &lt;math&gt;\sigma_m \geq 0 &lt;/math&gt;, as a result of the quadratic term.  It is a good approximation for ductile alloys

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Load histories in real applications are often complex and irregular.  The total fatigue effect of such loads can be estimated by the Miner-Palmgren rule, see the equation below.  Fatigue failure is assumed to occur when the Miner-Palmgren equation is true. 

&lt;math&gt;D = \sum{\frac{n_i}{N_i}}&lt;/math&gt;

Where:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;D=&lt;/math&gt; a constant, often ranging between 0.33 and 3 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;n_i=&lt;/math&gt; the number of occurrences of a specific load cycle progression, &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;math&gt;N_i=&lt;/math&gt; the fatigue life of a specific load cycle progression, &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; &lt;br&gt;


==Shortcomings of Miner's rule==
The Miner-Palmgren rule is rather rough and neglects several important qualities of a general load history.  Among these properties are the order and shape of the individual cycles.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Library Locations=

OpenSCAD uses three library ''locations'', the installation library, built-in library, and user defined libraries.
# The ''Installation'' library location is the &lt;code&gt;libraries&lt;/code&gt; directory under the directory where OpenSCAD is installed.
# The ''Built-In'' library location is O/S dependent. Since version 2014.03, it can be opened in the system specific file manager using the &quot;File-&gt;Show Library Folder...&quot; menu entry.&lt;br /&gt;
#* Windows: &lt;code&gt;My Documents\OpenSCAD\libraries&lt;/code&gt;
#* Linux: &lt;code&gt;$HOME/.local/share/OpenSCAD/libraries&lt;/code&gt;
#* Mac OS X: &lt;code&gt;$HOME/Documents/OpenSCAD/libraries&lt;/code&gt;
# The ''User-Defined'' library path can be created using the &lt;tt&gt;OPENSCADPATH&lt;/tt&gt; Environment Variable to point to the library(s). &lt;tt&gt;OPENSCADPATH&lt;/tt&gt; can contain multiple directories in case you have library collections in more than one place, separate directories with a semi-colon for Windows, and a colon for Linux/Mac OS. For example:

::Windows: &lt;code&gt;C:\Users\A_user\Documents\OpenSCAD\MyLib;C:\Thingiverse Stuff\OpenSCAD Things;D:\test_stuff&lt;/code&gt; 
:: ''&lt;small&gt;(Note: For Windows, in versions prior to 2014.02.22 there is a bug preventing multiple directories in &lt;tt&gt;OPENSCADPATH&lt;/tt&gt; as described above, it uses a colon (:) to separate directories. A workaround, if your libraries are on C: is to leave off the drive letter &amp; colon, e.g. &lt;code&gt;\Thingiverse Stuff\OpenSCAD Things:\stuff&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/small&gt;''
::Linux/Mac OS: &lt;code&gt;/usr/lib:/home/mylib:.&lt;/code&gt; 

::OpenSCAD will need to be restarted to recognise any change to the &lt;tt&gt;OPENSCADPATH&lt;/tt&gt; Environment Variable.

::Where you specify a ''non-fully qualified'' path &amp; filename in the '''&lt;code&gt;use &lt;...&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''' or '''&lt;code&gt;include &lt;...&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''' statement that path/file is checked against the directory of the calling .scad file, the ''User-Defined'' library paths (&lt;tt&gt;OPENSCADPATH&lt;/tt&gt;), the ''Built-In'' library (i.e. the O/S dependent locations above), and the ''Installation'' library, '''''in that order'''''. NOTE: In the case of a library file itself having '''&lt;code&gt;use &lt;...&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''' or '''&lt;code&gt;include &lt;...&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''' the directory of the library .scad file is the 'calling' file, i.e. when looking for libraries within a library, it does not check the directory of the top level .scad file.

For example, with the following locations &amp; files defined: (with &lt;tt&gt;OPENSCADATH&lt;/tt&gt;=&lt;code&gt;/usr/lib:/home/lib_os:.&lt;/code&gt;)
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;1. &lt;installation library&gt;/lib1.scad
2. &lt;built-in library&gt;/lib2.scad
3. &lt;built-in library&gt;/sublib/lib2.scad
4. &lt;built-in library&gt;/sublib/lib3.scad
5. /usr/lib/lib2.scad
6. /home/lib_os/sublib/lib3.scad
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The following '''&lt;code&gt;include &lt;...&gt;&lt;/code&gt;''' statements will match to the nominated library files
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
include &lt;lib1.scad&gt;  // #1.
include &lt;lib2.scad&gt;  // #5.
include &lt;sublib/lib2.scad&gt;  // #3.
include &lt;sublib/lib3.scad&gt;  // #6.
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Since 2014.03, the currently active list of locations can be verified in the &quot;Help-&gt;Library Info&quot; dialog.

The details info shows both the content of the &lt;tt&gt;OPENSCADPATH&lt;/tt&gt; variable and the list of all library locations. The locations will be searched in the order they appear in this list. For example;

&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;
OPENSCADPATH: /data/lib1:/data/lib2
OpenSCAD library path:
  /data/lib1
  /data/lib2
  /home/user/.local/share/OpenSCAD/libraries
  /opt/OpenSCAD/libraries
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

===Setting &lt;tt&gt;OPENSCADPATH&lt;/tt&gt;===

In Windows, Environment Variables are set via the &lt;code&gt;Control panel&lt;/code&gt;, select &lt;code&gt;System&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;Advanced System Settings&lt;/code&gt;, click &lt;code&gt;Environment Variables&lt;/code&gt;. Create a new &lt;code&gt;User Variable&lt;/code&gt;, or edit &lt;tt&gt;OPENSCADPATH&lt;/tt&gt; if it exists.

On Linux (probably also on Mac), to simply add the environment variable to all users, you can type in terminal:
&lt;code&gt;
sudo sh -c 'echo &quot;OPENSCADPATH=$HOME/openscad/libraries&quot; &gt;&gt;/etc/profile'
&lt;/code&gt;
to set the &lt;tt&gt;OPENSCADPATH&lt;/tt&gt; to &lt;tt&gt;openscad/libraries&lt;/tt&gt; under each user's home directory. For more control on environment variables, you'll need to edit the configuration files; see for example [http://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/117467/how-to-permanently-set-environmental-variables this page].

=MCAD=

OpenSCAD bundles the [https://github.com/openscad/MCAD MCAD library]. 

There are many different forks floating around (e.g.[https://github.com/SolidCode/MCAD], [https://github.com/elmom/MCAD], [https://github.com/benhowes/MCAD]) many of them unmaintained.

MCAD bundles a lot of stuff, of varying quality, including:

* Many common shapes like rounded boxes, regular polygons and polyeders in 2D and 3D
* Gear generator for involute gears and bevel gears.
* Stepper motor mount helpers, stepper and servo outlines
* Nuts, bolts and bearings
* Screws and augers
* Material definitions for common materials
* Mathematical constants, curves
* Teardrop holes and polyholes

The git repo also contains python ncode to scrape OpenSCAD code, a testing framework and SolidPython, an external python library for solid cad.

== [[Japanese]] ==
I noticed you've transcluded much of the [[Japanese]] book on a sub-page of your userpage. A couple of points: As you may have noticed, transcluding doesn't really work because it breaks the relative links. If you are interested in printing the page, you might want to have a look at the Print/export links (in one of the boxes under the Wikibooks logo).

== [[Template:Paper money]] ==

Hi Aaron,

I notice that you just added a category to [[Template:Paper money]].  I know that I'm using it in [[Adventist Youth Honors Answer Book]], and in fact, I created it for use there.  However, I tried to make it ''generally'' useful so that if someone else wanted to make a book about coin collecting or international currency, or maybe the BSA Merit Badge books, the template would apply equally there.  Same thing with [[Template:Knot]] and [[Template:Bible verse]].  Does tagging it with the book that it's used in really help?  I'm not opposed to having it in there - I just don't know that it's the right thing to do.

For example, we would never do that to [[Template:Stages]], because it's more generally used.  Does this not fall into the same category?  --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 22:58, 19 November 2009 (UTC)

:I see your point.  I'll put them in [[:Category:Infobox templates]] for now, until a better category can be determined.  It may be good to put usage information on them similar to what you have on [[Template:Bible verse]], as that will make it easier for others to use. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:11, 20 November 2009 (UTC)

== [[Wikibooks:NPOV dispute]] ==

I've been examining the changes done to [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]], regarding the bit &quot;Frequently Asked Questions&quot; I'm attempting to merge it with the text where relevant, it links to the page [[Wikibooks:NPOV dispute]] that seems in conformity with what is practiced on the project but there is a red link to [[Wikibooks:List of controversial issues|controversial issues]], do you think it should be removed/created it (I know at least one project that could be listed there, and IIRC over the time I've tagged one or two as NPOV violation). Not extremely important but the text would benefit from a removing the red link...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:54, 23 November 2009 (UTC)

Another solution would be to replace the link with the [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view]] policy (since linking non community approved texts in a policy ought to be avoided) and move [[Wikibooks:NPOV dispute]] as an unstable version that policy (it more or less a duplication).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:59, 23 November 2009 (UTC)

:The link was to a page that no longer existed; you can see the [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion/Wikibooks:List of controversial issues|RFD]] on it as for why it was deleted.  Since the community decided to delete the page in question, I've removed that red link from the page.  -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 04:37, 23 November 2009 (UTC)

== Mandarin ==

Hello, about [[Mandarin Chinese]], I did not want it to be inactive, and only became so because I forgot to work on the book.  All the info is correct, it is summarized from Prentice Hall Chinese Link Textbook.  However, if you could, could you make the book look nicer, and tell me what kinds of grades what I have would get? Thanks in advance --[[User:Master lan|Master lan]] ([[User talk:Master lan|talk]]) 13:50, 25 November 2009 (UTC)
:It looks good so far.  I can't really comment on translations as I have no knowledge of Mandarin Chinese.  I wouldn't worry about how long it takes to get the book done.

::::Thanks for you reconsideration. I agree on your assertion of that user interest to what goes on this project in specific terms. I agree that there is a thin line on what constitutes a good intervention on a Wikibookians personal space, in the specific case you point out that user was a vandal (http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special:Contributions/Barta_bus), if a single post (with the same content) was made on another users talk page I wouldn't have reversed it, the content doesn't make it particular offensive, it all depends on the context and civility level, something an outsider to the interchange may not be aware of. Consider the same action by another user with something on the lines of &quot;Break a leg&quot; on several Wikibookains pages, to an outsider it would again constitute possible spam (in depth analyses would require examining past actions of that user on the project), but on the other hand, all the users that got the post may be part of a theater group...
::::On the action that initiated this thread, some of the posts weren't even slightly aggressive, most of those that had aggressive connotations were somehow out of context since they (I presume) refer to actions that took place elsewhere and most if not all were unsigned, by removing them you took an active role on those disputes that were personal in nature (if outside of the userspace they indeed should be deleted). I didn't read them all but those I read didn't have any unacceptable content, I had similar posts on my own userspace that have gone to similar levels, I've been called a dick and a troll by acting admins but what is important is the context of the remarks, and giving equal chance to those engaged on the interchange to address the issues at least that is my opinion.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 01:19, 5 December 2009 (UTC)

== What is the maximum width for images that allows the html, print and pdf version to render consistently ==

Hi Adrignola

Cheers for doing the article imports into the Wikibooks on Hinduism and Sikhism. I was just wondering if you knew the maximum width for an image for Wikibooks. I read in the Wiki edit guide that 550px is the safest width that browsers will render. I have some fretboard and scale diagrams in the wikibook on Guitar that should go all across the page for easy reading. Also, does this affect the Print version and the PDF version. One last question, is their any format advice to ensure consistent layout for those viewing with a widescreen monitor. --[[User:Sluffs|Sluffs]] ([[User talk:Sluffs|talk]]) 14:07, 7 December 2009 (UTC)
:I don't believe there's a technical limit to the width of an image in the wiki software itself, but you don't want an image inline to be so wide that those viewing the book at a lower resolution have to scroll horizontally to view the image.  The 550px width was probably written when you had to worry about a screen size of 800px minimum, with the difference being taken up by the navigation at the left.  You can safely assume a minimum width of 1024px today.  You'd have to experiment with a print version to see what pixel width corresponds to the width of your printed page.  You can test it with your browser's print preview.  An image that fits the print version will fit the PDF version as well.  Hope that helps. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:55, 7 December 2009 (UTC)

== Copyright question ==

Hey Adrignola, quick question, I'm co-coordinating the Wikibook for my class, and noticed that one of the chapters was flagged for possible copyright violation. The chapter has recently undergone changes, with citations and sources added toward the end of the page. I understand that to prevent deletion, the contributors need to specify that the authors must grant copyright permission. I am unclear if there is a specific paragraph that violates this policy or the whole chapter itself?????

:I think if you're just quoting material or paraphrasing it and providing proper references there shouldn't be a problem.  The addition of that notice (wasn't me) was likely because a portion of the page appeared to be a copy-and-paste from another website.  My opinion is now that the page has developed further, there isn't a problem.  It's analogous to citations in a paper document; now that you have them, you can't be accused of plagiarism.  The book is developing nicely, by the way.

== A Level Mathematics ==

Hi Aaron,

When I saw this guy's request my first thought was &quot;We surely have this already.&quot;  So I went to the Subjects page, drilled down the Mathematics, and then... couldn't figure out how to get there from here.  When you undid the request, I followed your link to the book and found that it was in study guides.  Maybe someone who knows what A-level means would know that it's a study guide, but I sure didn't.  Food for thought. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 16:27, 14 December 2009 (UTC)
:It can also be found via this route: [[Subject:Standard curricula|Standard curricula]] → [[Subject:International curricula|International curricula]] → [[Subject:GCE Advanced Level|GCE Advanced Level]].  Indeed that's not much better.  We've got about 3,000 books now and this would be indicative of problems that could be encountered upon further growth.  Unfortunately, we can't really put all the books in [[Subject:Mathematics]].  I do note that &quot;a-level maths&quot; or &quot;a level maths&quot; in the search box would have either sent this user to the book directly via a redirect or shown them the book as the first result.  They could also browse alphabetically, clicking on the &quot;alphabetical&quot; link via the &quot;browse&quot; link at left and finding the book among others in [[:Category:Alphabetical/A]], where all the books begin with &quot;A-level&quot;.  I'm always open to suggestions. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:48, 14 December 2009 (UTC)
::I called it &quot;food for thought&quot; because I don't ''have'' any suggestions.  It's just a good problem for us to stew over as we go along.

:::Sorry, didn't mean to imply that you had to come up with any.  I notice that at [[Wikibooks:Card Catalog Office]] the subjects don't expand like the categories.

== Hmmmmmmmm? ==

Y'know, I've loved all things Wiki for a long time now. I just seem to struggle with understanding what Wikibooks is all about. I had this idea of writing a book about clergy and their answer to some questions......really a piece of journalism......I'm not going to interpret their responses or anything like that....and certainly (with Wikibooks being what it is) others can contribute or delete all manner of stuff. I just don't know if such a book would/would not be appropriate here.  Your thoughts? [[User:Buddpaul|Buddpaul]] ([[User talk:Buddpaul|talk]]) 21:37, 15 December 2009 (UTC)

I assume this is in reference to [[Twenty Questions For Twenty Preachers: An early 21st Century Perspective]].  If you choose to continue this at Wikinews or some other project, you can add {{tlx|delete|author requested}} to the pages of that book.

::So far the only reason I see for the process to fail is if you decide to withdraw your acceptance for the job. There is no time limit for requests and no one has objected to it. In any case one of the other bureaucrats on the project should take the reasonable steps to inform the creators of the requirement for a fixed number of votes and explain that it is impractical and does affect multiple Wikimedia projects (for what I understand you will be CU of Wikibooks, Wikijunior, Wikiversity and by how I see it to Cookbook, all self contained entities mostly working to become independent, if it was a reality today all would have the same problem we are facing). An improvement to the process would be to use a percentage based on the number of administrators since those are the ones that seem to participate on general discussions. I also advance the idea that this alienation of the common Wikibookians has increased (since it was always reduced due to the project characteristics) due to disappearance of other global community functions and processes like book of the month, patrollers, etc...

:: I had been thinking about this recently too and how having a fixed number of people supporting is odd. Looking at RFP right now...

Of these, seven (so more than 50%) have supported you already. While I would never suggest admins have more say (as this could create a self-electing &quot;club&quot;), it is at least some indication of the level of support you have from the more active and / or long standing contributors.  Of the remaining supporters, you have (for example, Panic, Pi Zero, Chazz) some of the most active community types too.

I've noticed that the page &quot;http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Special:Upload&quot; has been modified in the past hours will it be open for editing (by the admins+) as it would be extremely important that it would not only state who can have access but what the access is for and in the case of uploads to point prominently to commons (since the upload file function is still very accessible from the menus and we shouldn't scare people attempting to provide content).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 22:51, 26 December 2009 (UTC)

== Get Browser to remember where I left off reading - How to? ==

I checked FAQ and reading room. I found nothing on this subject so far.

I am actively working my way through a how-to book with many chapters. How can I tag or bookmark where I leave off reading within the tools available on Wikibooks. I know I can bookmark a page with my browser or google bookmarks, but I keep having to reset this every time I am forced to stop reading by other demands on my time.

Is there a better way to get Wikibooks, on log in, to remember (i) what I am actively reading and (ii) where I left off? If this is explained already somewhere, sorry I missed it.
[[User:Ashokdad|Ashokdad]] ([[User talk:Ashokdad|talk]]) 12:42, 19 October 2009 (UTC)
ashokdad, 10/19/09 ~8:45 AM Eastern US time.

: To understand why it is difficult, let us look at the nature of the interface to Wikimedia products, like this wiki. You page through the book, by pressing links that move you from page to page within the book. These links, in turn, are similar to HTML anchors, in that they contain only the information on which page you have selected. Your browser can therefore buffer only the page URL, and if you bookmark it, it can return you only to the page you were reading. Books with long pages, will tend to demand more from the reader, because they will cause the reader to have to window down the page to the area where they were reading, in much the same way you have to scan the page of a book you have put down, in order to find where on the page you left off.

: If there is a printable version or an PDF version of the book, your problem can be solved by downloading the printable version or PDF to your home computer where you can leave it running in its own window, and only have to scan the screen to find where you left off. For the PDF a free PDF reader is available from Adobe, which you will find invaluable if you want to read lots of books, and articles.--[[User:Graeme E. Smith|Graeme E. Smith]] ([[User talk:Graeme E. Smith|talk]]) 15:19, 31 October 2009 (UTC)

:: It depends on the article/book but if the article you're reading is divided into lots of sections then you could simply bookmark the section each time as each section contains the URL for that article but also an anchor to the section.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 00:38, 5 November 2009 (UTC)
== Protect [[WB:FB|Featured Books]] listing ==

I propose that we increase the protection placed on [[WB:FB|Featured Books]] so that it can be edited only by admins.  There have been several edits to this page in the past where people have added books that have not been officially featured.  These are usually caught and rolled back, but not always.  In one case, a book was added that doesn't even exist here, and it was not caught until today. Since promoting a book to FB status requires a discussion and consensus, I really don't see a reason why any registered user should be able to edit the official list.  This suggestion was prompted by an anonymous user who [[Wikibooks talk:Featured books|noted]] that there are several books on the list that do not indicate their status on their own pages (which is fine).  I did some digging and found that most (perhaps all) of these books actually are featured, but the authoritative source of that info is in the archives.  We could have a lot more trust in [[WB:FB]] if it were protected. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 13:38, 10 November 2009 (UTC)

:What went wrong with your edit to that page?  The description says you were removing &quot;Proakis&quot; (though what that is, I'm not actually sure), but in fact you removed two books that, honestly, I thought ''were'' legitimately featured, and added a random word to the bottom of the page.  If the former weren't mistakes, the latter surely was.  (And you want to protect the page such that only an admin could fix little flubs like that? ...&amp;nbsp;asked the non-admin.)

:It does seem as if ideally the page would simply be subject to review, which should limit editing to registered users with a bit more maturity (or if not, then perhaps they should lose that bit).  Might we move Featured Books to a reviewable namespace (or, more radically, make the Wikibooks: namespace reviewable)?

:(BTW, in composing this note I actually had some of my edit buffer get garbled somewhere in process, which makes me wonder if that could have happened to the edit to Featured Books.)  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 14:47, 10 November 2009 (UTC)

::I have no idea what went wrong with that edit.  I rolled it back.  I can also not find any trace of the Proakis entry.  (Proakis is the author of several books on Digital Signal Processing, but of course, none of those are available here.  Someone had at one point added one of his DSP books to [[WB:FB]].)  Maybe I was hallucinating, but I am somewhat relieved of that notion by your note that you too have experienced a bit of weirdness. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 16:42, 10 November 2009 (UTC)

== How to contact editor of a page? Or make comment to clarify issue on page. ==

I am just getting started with wiki-books and need a bit of help.
I don't want to go editing another persons hard work needlessly.

There is a page whereon the editor used a term midway with no definition of that term. I would like to contact them to ask for a definition of that term.

Is there a way to contact that person without &quot;editing&quot; his/her page?

I cannot &quot;edit&quot; the page because I do not know the intended use of that word.

Mindbender 10 NOV. 2009[[User:Mindbender|Mindbender]] ([[User talk:Mindbender|talk]]) 17:48, 10 November 2009 (UTC)

:Usually the thing to do is to ask your question (about the meaning of the term, in this case) on the talk page of the page in question.  Click on the &quot;discussion&quot; tab when viewing the page; that will take you to its talk page.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 18:24, 10 November 2009 (UTC)

== Source Tag is Changed ==

Hello, 

I notice that the source tags have changed.   They no longer wrap long lines in the numbered mode.   As such the change now invalidates much of the content of the section in [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Editing_Wikitext/Preformatted_Text#The_.27Source.27_Tags Source Tags].

Can an administrator please advise on the matter?

:This is an issue you'd need to discuss at [[mw:Extension:SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi|Extension:SyntaxHighlight_GeSHi]] as administrators do not have control over which extensions are installed or their source code.  Only the site's JavaScript and CSS can be edited by administrators and I do not see anything directly applicable to this extension, nor do the installation instructions on the above page request any changes be made to [[Mediawiki:Common.css]] to implement the extension.

== Wiktionary Hover: a JavaScript on double-click ==

[[n:en:MediaWiki_talk:Gadget-dictionaryLookupHover.js#Request_for_translations|Wikinews]] proposes a script to display the Wiktionary definition in a small board, when one double-click on a word.

#[[Help:Wikibooks for Wikimedians]] (which is far too wp-centric in my opinion) says &quot;Wikibooks use wikilinks conservatively&quot;. Does this mean that, for example, language wikibooks containing links to Wiktionary are a bad idea?

:Thanks for coming by Wikibooks!  I'll try to provide some insights.
:#If your book's name is a long one and you start out your templates with the book's name, followed by a slash, you can use {{tlx|BOOKTEMPLATE}} as a shortcut notation.  For example if you have [[Wikijunior:Solar System]], you can call [[Template:Wikijunior:Solar System/Coolfacts]] using {{{{tl|BOOKTEMPLATE}}/Coolfacts}}.  Wikibooks sometimes has to find workarounds for methods better suited to an encyclopedia in the wiki software.
:#Wikibooks tries to define terms within the book they are used, making it easier to print out a book as a self-contained item.  Links to external websites make it more difficult to have a complete printed textbook and also take users off-site rather than keeping them here.  Keep in mind this isn't a policy.  True, too many things are wp-centric in the Wikimedia world, including the Mediawiki software itself, but we can't really avoid the 600 lb (kg) gorilla that is Wikipedia.  It's expected that most people will be coming here with preconceptions formed by Wikipedia.
:#Those buttons link to some toolserver tools that check for images without proper licensing information on their image pages.  Last time I checked, one of them didn't even work, and the other I don't really use because there are so few uploads, so I simply disabled them by checking the &quot;Remove Image Tools&quot; option on the gadgets tab of my [[Special:Preferences|preferences]].

== Right-hand indents caused by review status box. ==

hi, On all the pages i've created with a right-floating template infobox (e.g. [[Practical_Electronics/IC/4023]]) the little box showing the page review status causes it to be indented, leaving a huge and ugly space on the right hand side. Just adding a newline doesn't help, and infoboxes should be at the top of the markup.

Perhaps some sort of div element could be added to whetever code generates that box? What I know about HTML can be written on a postage stamp, so I can't give a better suggestion than that. [[User:Inductiveload|Inductiveload]] ([[User talk:Inductiveload|talk]]) 23:02, 21 September 2009 (UTC)

'''Production Possibility Curves/Production Possibility Frontiers'''
:*Points A and B on the PPF shows the maximum that can be produced with existing resources and technology, it is a point of productive efficiency
:*The negative slope of the PPF reflects basic scarcity 
:*The law of diminishing returns implies a convex PPF: as resources are transferred from one use to another, the increment in output becomes smaller, the opportunity cost larger
::*Resources are being released in the wrong combination 
::*The resources being released are less and less suited to the new use

:*Area U inside the frontier is productively inefficient: more of one good could be produced without sacrificing any of the other: 
::*Under market systems it is called unemployment 
::*Under central planning it is called inefficiency

:* Impossible points outside the PPF can only be reached through: 
::*Trade 
::*The discovery of more resources 
::*Increased labour productivity from greater education and training 
::*Increased capital productivity from an increase in technological knowledge

'''''Basic Economic Questions'''''
*The basic question of modern economics is that of scarcity. Production is limited by entrepreneurial ability, natural resources, capital, labor, and technology. Humans have basically limitless wants in a world of limited resources. Economics is the question of the allocation of those resources, as well as that of the output produced.
**What goods and services should be produced with the resources available?
**How can factors of production be used efficiently to produce what is chosen?
**For whom should these goods and services be produced?

*'''Factors of production''': 
**'''Land Resources''': not man made: land, minerals, wood, fish
**'''Labour''': human resources determined by population, age, skill and training
**'''Capital''': man made tools such as buildings, equipment, and machinery
**'''Entrepreneurship''': undertake the risk of organizing and combining factors for production

*In order to maximize welfare we must produce in the most efficient manner possible to get the most out of our limited resources: this will put us on the production possibility frontier
*This point is defined when:
*:Marginal Social Benefit = Marginal Social Cost

*But how do we distribute production in such a way as to maximize utility for society as a whole?
**Marginal utility for rich people is low as they have the money to afford to buy everything: in other words they are bored from over consumption
**Marginal utility for poor people is high because they have only limited income
**The problem is: 
***If income is distributed from the rich to the poor, there is less incentive for people to work; command systems such as the Stalinist communist system was found to lead to great inefficiency and unfairness
***Those who work hard in the market system are rewarded so efficiency is achieved, but many become losers and are marginalized
	
*What is produced is largely determined by the needs and wants of people
*How it is produced depends on available resources and technology
*For whom depends on how goods are distributed: by traditional systems, central planning (dictatorship) or the free market


'''Traditional Economies'''
-----
*Resources and production systems are owned by the community
*Production takes place using traditional technology
*Allocation is based on long established patterns of community sharing.
*The production possibility boundary tended to expand and contract slowly as population grew, there were climatic changes, and new tools were invented
*Advantages of traditional systems:
**Resources are protected and the systems have proven to be sustainable over long periods of time
**Losses and profits are shared by the whole community, peer pressure forces decision makers to be careful
*Disadvantages of traditional system: Growth is very slow
	
What are the basic economic questions?
:* What to produce?
:* How to produce it?
:* For whom to produce?


'''Command Economy'''
-----
''A market where the government or some central authority decides where to allocate resources''

Advantages and Disadvantages of a Planned Economy

Advantages:
:* The government can influence the distribution of income.
:* The government can determine which goods are supplied. 

Disadvantages:
:* In order to function well, requires an enormous amount of information which is difficult to obtain.
:* No real incentive for individuals to be innovative. Goods are of poor quality since there is a lack of profit motive.
:* May NOT lead to [[w:allocative efficiency|allocative efficiency]] or [[w:productive efficiency|productive efficiency]] due to lack of competition and profit motives.
:* Corruption - the government has the ability to abuse its absolute power.
:* The economy does not respond as well to supply and demand, firms are simply told to produce a certain number of goods or services


Central planning:
*Resources and production systems are owned by the central government which allows the government to determine what is produced, how and for whom.
*Enormous information is required due to centralized planning and control.  Government planners must:
**Predict patterns of consumer demand
**Estimate technological possibilities and production capabilities
**Estimate the opportunity cost of resources in alternative uses.
*Producers are motivated to underestimate their capability
*Advantages of central planning:
**The govt. can make the distribution of income more equal
**The govt. determines what goods are produced and can prevent production of socially undesirable goods.
**Initially higher growth rates for Russia and China would suggest that as a system of organizing economic activity, central planning is successful in the early stages of economic development
*Disadvantages of central planning:
**Requires large amounts of information: forecasting people’s desires is difficult and the lack of incentives have led to a number of problems:
*Decision makers do not experience profits and losses and are not strongly motivated to make the right decisions
*Incentives to falsify production information lead to poor production decisions and massive pollution,
*A reluctance to change with the market in forecasting demand:
*There are queues when there are shortages (quantity rationing), and stockpiles if there are surpluses.
**State owned enterprises are managed inefficiently.
**There is no incentive for individuals and firms to be innovative.  With no profit motive goods are often of poor quality and choice is very limited.


'''Free Market'''
-----
''The forces of supply and demand decide the economic questions and therefore where to allocate resources''

Advantages and Disadvantages of the Free Market

Advantages
:* Resources allocated more efficiently by the price mechanism.
:* The profit motive is a great incentive, and forces producers to reduce costs and be innovative.
:* With no imperfections, the free market maximizes community surplus.

market system relies on a number of factors to ensure that it works efficiently.

•The profit motive - the incentive for a reward for enterprise
•Good levels of information being available to both producers and consumers
•Price accurately reflecting the costs and benefits of consumption and production
•The ease with which resources can move to different uses
At the heart of the market system is the profit motive.


Disadvantages:
:* Instability
:* Market failure- see Chapter II.
:* Monopolies and corruption - The natural goal of all firms is to attain monopoly, as this eliminates competition, eliminating the associated costs and thus maximizing profit.  If the market structure does not include limiting social forces, financial forces will cause firms to externalize costs such as pollution to gain monopoly.  [[W:Bhopal disaster|Union Carbide's gas leak in Bhopal]] is an example of such an externalized cost.

Free market
*Resources and production systems are owned by individuals and the allocation of resources, what, how and for whom, is left to the forces of supply (production) and demand (consumers) operating in a relatively free market.
*Producers attempt to maximize profits, but if they are poor at predicting: 
**They produce too much (surpluses) and will lose money.
**They underestimate (shortages), will miss the potential profit and a competitor will make the profit instead.
*Only those firms which can predict most closely what consumers will want will earn adequate money to stay in business.
*Advantages of free market:
**Resources are allocated by market forces and the price mechanism without govt. intervention.
**Profits provide an incentive to reduce costs and be innovative.
**The free market maximizes community surplus if there are no failures and imperfections.
*Disadvantages of the free market:
**Market failures and imperfections occur because of public goods, merit goods, externalities and lack of competitive markets.
**The system of profits and losses is thought to be unfair, substantial government intervention is needed to cope with income redistribution problems.
*The wealthy are taxed to reduce profits
*Those marginalized by the system, are supported with tax money
**The system is incapable of controlling pollution and producing sustainable growth, planning has been introduced to correct for this problem.


'''Mixed Economies'''
-----
''An economy consisting of both free market and command economies - some decisions are made by market forces while some other decisions are made by the government or some central authority''
*Most countries in the world have moved gradually toward a mixture:
**Free markets are used to allocate resources to achieve efficiency.
**Government planning is used where markets fail to operate successfully, and to redistribute income to those who are marginalized by the market system.

      <text xml:space="preserve">In computer operating systems there are various ways in which the operating system can store and retrieve data from secondary storage for use in main memory. One such memory management scheme is referred to as paging. In the paging memory-management scheme, the operating system retrieves data from secondary storage in same-size blocks called pages. The main advantage of paging is that it allows the physical address space of a process to be noncontiguous. Prior to paging, systems had to fit whole programs into storage contiguously which caused various storage and fragmentation problems.

Paging is an important part of virtual memory implementation in most contemporary general-purpose operating systems, allowing them to use disk storage for data that does not fit into physical Random-access memory (RAM). Paging is usually implemented as architecture-specific code built into the kernel of the operating system.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{Wikipedia|Memory segmentation}}

Segmentation is one of the most common ways to achieve memory protection. In a computer system using segmentation, an instruction operand that refers to a memory location includes a value that identifies a segment and an offset within that segment. A segment has a set of permissions, and a length, associated with it. If the currently running process is allowed by the permissions to make the type of reference to memory that it is attempting to make, and the offset within the segment is within the range specified by the length of the segment, the reference is permitted; otherwise, a hardware exception is raised.

In addition to the set of permissions and length, a segment also has associated with it information indicating where the segment is located in memory. It may also have a flag indicating whether the segment is present in main memory or not; if the segment is not present in main memory, an exception is raised, and the operating system will read the segment into memory from secondary storage. The information indicating where the segment is located in memory might be the address of the first location in the segment, or might be the address of a page table for the segment, if the segmentation is implemented with paging. In the first case, if a reference to a location within a segment is made, the offset within the segment will be added to address of the first location in the segment to give the address in memory of the referred-to item; in the second case, the offset of the segment is translated to a memory address using the page table.

In most systems in which a segment doesn't have a page table associated with it, the address of the first location in the segment is an address in main memory; in those systems, no paging is done. In the Intel 80386 and later, that address can either be an address in main memory, if paging is not enabled, or an address in a paged &quot;linear&quot; address space, if paging is enabled.

A memory management unit (MMU) is responsible for translating a segment and offset within that segment into a memory address, and for performing checks to make sure the translation can be done and that the reference to that segment and offset is permitted.

This usage should not be confused with that of the memory segments used by early x86 processors such as the Intel 8086 and Intel 8088, as they did not provide any protection (any program could access any segment with no restrictions, and a segment consisted of only a starting location and a fixed length of 64 KiB); segmentation in the Intel 80286 and later provided protection.

== Rearrange book ? ==
It may be just me, but I find the organization confusing. For example &quot;Conditional and Iterator Functions&quot; a relative sophisticated feature comes before plain &quot;Mathematical operators&quot;. Som chapters are needlessly split up (Import/export STL) and so on. 

I am also of the opinion the book should have 3 sections (possibly 3 books)
* Tutorial - this contains the introduction, a few step-by-step examples, some description of the distribution supplied examples.
* Reference - which is most of the current book, in particular OpenSCAD langauge, 2D/3D and DXF stuff
* Installation (or Internals) - the chapters for the linking and adaption of OpenSCAD to platforms, external editors and so on.

Before I make a detailed suggestions, any thoughts on this?
[[User:Msquare|Msquare]] ([[User talk:Msquare|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Msquare|contribs]]) 19:43, 15 November 2012 (UTC)

:[[User:Msquare|Msquare]] ([[User talk:Msquare|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Msquare|contribs]]) 21:41, 17 November 2012 (UTC) : I moved one section - the conditional/iterator one. Done it in the print vaersion and the short reference, too.

=Old discussions (done things)=
== This is better than 0% ==

I suggest the completion status is moved to 25%. The manual is useful and possibly even 50%. (I was looking at the recomended grading of status - [[Help:Development_stages#Book_completion_status]]) I have only really looked at chapter 4, but probabl the rest is reasonable, too. [[User:Msquare|Msquare]] ([[User talk:Msquare|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Msquare|contribs]]) 16:20, 24 September 2012 (UTC)

''(One month later)'': No discussion - so I decided and have started to do it [[User:Msquare|Msquare]] ([[User talk:Msquare|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Msquare|contribs]]) 21:57, 27 October 2012 (UTC)

== Command Gloassary added ==
I don't see any place to add documentation of how to use the GUI viewer.  For example, I figured out how to zoom the viewport in and out by trial and error, and it would be great if I could add that somewhere.  (also, I see a distance variable in the viewport, but can't see a way to set it or figure out what it means)

I propose making a section called &quot;Using the GUI&quot; and moving the import/export stuff under it.  I would do this myself, but that's a fairly large change to the organizational structure of the doc, so I'm just proposing it here.

I created a new section http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Command_Glossary.  The goal here being to have a consolidated list of commands and very basic syntax.  I found myself hunting though the various pages to find syntax and was going to make a &quot;cheat sheet&quot; for myself but thought this would be better.

== command len() ==

I would like to add the command len() to the wiki. As I have no experience with wikis I will run an account of what I want to do and what I´m doing here.

According to:
https://github.com/openscad/openscad/blob/master/RELEASE_NOTES

the command len() was implemented first in OpenSCAD 2011.12:

o Added len() function. Takes one vector or string parameter and returns its length.

Where would be the right place to add this command? It really is not a mathematical function, but it returns a number.

OK, I´ll just put it to the mathematical funktions, maybe it has to be moved away later on.

Now, I can edit (pressing the little edit botton) an existing function, but how do I create a new one?

OK, go to the main subject heading:
http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=OpenSCAD_User_Manual/Mathematical_Functions&amp;stable=0
and press the rider 'EDIT' in the second top most line of the (html) page.
Insert '=== len ===' and some text at the alphabetical correct position ( before ln() )
Then a subheading with len appears and can now be edited with the little red edit-buttom to theb right.

Now, I want to add some examples. 

OK, I wrote a little example scad program and copied it and the result.

Now, how do I get the nice little box around it?

OK, starting a line with a 'space' seems to create the little box around the text.

Now I mared some changes as minor, but they actually were not. I´m sorry.
(minor change should only be used for formating and simple spell checing)

Now, do I have to add the len command also in the glossary?

OK, I added it into the Command Glossary.

BUT MY, the C.C. is not at all up to date.

Enjoy

Also, questions should go into Talk, rather than appearing in the article.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]].
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks is a collection of open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer on how things work here (it's a little different).
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to maintain a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you want to ask a question, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;(This is not an automated message, I'll be watching during a time for any reply you make to it...)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

:Remember to sign your posts. The above post was removed from the Wikibooks:Reading room/Assistance since it isn't a request for assistance.  On another note, feel free to start a project on these topics. But remember to maintain a neutral point of view, mythology is OK but don't advance aliens or &quot;evil spirits&quot; as facts, feel free to describe any alternative '''possibile''' interpretations, but verifiable or reasonable ones. I myself have been for a long time interested in the [[w:Nazca Lines|Nazca Lines]] and things like the similitude of the constructions on South America, some pacific Islands and Egypt, the last thing that amazed me on this subject was the acoustic properties found [http://www.acoustics.org/press/136th/lubman.htm Mayan pyramid at Chichen Itza, in the Yucatan Region of Mexico] (besides the mathematical correlations and shadow effects projected on the structures by the movement of the planet around the sun), this things are really amazing and should get more visibility.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 04:59, 11 December 2009 (UTC)

== Mexican Pyramids - Removal from Wikibooks ==
REASON [[User:Quikstudykansas|Quikstudykansas]] ([[User talk:Quikstudykansas|talk]]) 05:29, 11 December 2009 (UTC)Yes i understand why you removed it. Learn from mistakes.  After some research here can I post my &quot;CONTENT Page&quot; as a &quot;Module&quot;? Could you point me the way to get started on this as i truly fel the National News (TV Cable News Channels) are missing the point on this.  I am 64 and a former News Editor for Newsp w/ circ of 33,000.

Thx, Any help Appreciated - Happy Holidays to all,

:I understand that you may be confused but please take the time to understand how things work, other users my get annoyed by having you making posts out of order in pages that aren't intended for the function you are using them...
:Read the Welcome post I made here on your talk page, see if you understand the structure and post here any doubts you have.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 05:36, 11 December 2009 (UTC)

:Wikibooks projects can be called modules, projects or even Wikibooks, modules mostly refer to single pages but its interpretation is open-ended.  Try to create some content on [[User:Quikstudykansas/Sandbox|Your sandbox]] (in the first post above there is a link to the global sandbox were users can make test edits), your own sandbox resides in your userspace and under your control (you can even sketch your project there). All pertinent information will most probably already be on the Welcome post above...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 05:39, 11 December 2009 (UTC)

:Another issue you have to consider is if this is the right place for the information you intent to contribute. Wikibooks is about providing textbooks, annotated texts, instructional guides, and manuals. These materials can be used in a traditional classroom, an accredited or respected institution, a home-school environment, as part of a Wikiversity course or for self-learning. So to create the project you seem to want you have to establish an acceptable scope, from the structure you provided above I find several issues you go from Mexico to Giza (so titling the work as Mexican Pyramids or a variation isn't what you want), probably something on the lines of The End of Times Myth could work (but people will be free to also contribute other information that goes beyond what you probably intent), another solution is something like Understanding  Mayan's Mythology (this could cover the Maya issue but will make any relation to other info only referential and out of scope), see if you can think on an acceptable solution for what you need. If you can't work with the restrictions imposed for a Wikibook, make a post on [[Wikibooks:Reading room/General]] and ask if someone knows another place you can work with a greater freedom in creativity (as I said before aliens, spirits and outlandish speculations can't be included as facts on a Wikibook), you can nevertheless point that some people believe on those (since that is a fact)...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 05:58, 11 December 2009 (UTC)

:I have run a check an there isn't mush on the Maya subject on Wikibooks and since I don't fully understand all the issues you can contribute with some consistency see if you can build on the info already available in [[World History/Precolumbian History of the Americas]] as a section on the Maya calendar and their astronomical knowledge (without the unneeded esoteric information, since it would be outside of the scope of that book).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 06:18, 11 December 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Epidemiology is often regarded as a central part of all types of health practices, whether this is the practice of health examinations, disease treatment, prevention activity, administration, policymaking or research activity. However, in maritime 
health, the epidemiologic method has not been used very widely and the aim of this module is to encourage to use the epidemiology in maritime health much more. 

To understand the basic concepts, prevalence and incidence, their different forms, the relative measures of these in different strata in the populations and the relation to the time perspective in the populations, is the primary goal. Populations are aging, dying, migrating, newborns are coming in and the exposures in the surroundings are continuously changing year by year, not at least in the maritime area. The disease patterns change from mild to severe forms and sometimes with total recovery. This should be considered in the epidemiological studies. 

Take a helicopter perspective and imagine how the exposures and the life and health events changes over time and varies in the different social and geographical strata and poses different health problems. In addition, use a close-up perspective to perform the details of the studies. The health events happen and changes in the populations over time with different health problems are the objects of studies. 

The events occurring in a study population over time can be seen as a particular part of the humans´ and the natures´ own unconscious experimental population that was chosen as the object of study. 
Alternatively, the study populations are the consciously chosen populations used for experiments initiated by the humans, intervention studies, prognostic studies or clinical trials in which we consciously introduce supposed health bringing changes.  

==Epidemiology in practice ==

Multifactorial disease models with a multitude of causal risk factors and health promoting factors are probably often used for planning of the studies. Probably, because this is not always expressed in the published papers with the results. Nevertheless, is it believable that anybody would initiate a large study without using a disease model, even unconsciously? There is nothing as practical as a good theory! (See Power Point presentation 1, with some theoretical models). 
Having described the health problems, the presumed theoretical interactions in the causal web of the different determinants in the study population and the aims of the study, we chose the specific type of study population, which is best suited for the aims of the study. 
==Theory==
Theoretical models are useful to point out which types of risk factors or health bringing factors that is relevant to be studied in relation to the health problem and the aim of a study. 
There is a logical correspondence between the main types of epidemiological studies and the main types of health activities in general practice. The type of study relates to the aims in general of the studies while the study design or research design relates to the procedures and methods to be adhered to in conducting a research project. Within each type of study are used different study designs (Figure 1 and 2).</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{TODO|'''This section is still being written. But feel free to add your contribution or help in any way'''}}

= Introduction =
A hierarchical clustering method consists into grouping data objects into a tree of clusters. There are two main types of techniques: a bottom-up and a top-down approach. The first one starts with small clusters composed by a single object and, at each step, merge the current clusters into greater ones, successively, until reach a cluster composed by all data objects. The second approach use the same logic, but to the opposite direction, starting with the greatest cluster, composed by all objects, and split it successively into smaller clusters until reach the singleton groups. Besides the strategies, other important issue is the metrics used to build (merge or split) clusters. Such metrics can be different distance measures, described next section.

= Inter-cluster Metrics =
Four widely used measures for distance between clusters are as follows. Where &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;p'&lt;/i&gt; are two different data object points, &lt;i&gt;m&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is the mean for cluster &lt;i&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, &lt;i&gt;n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt; is the number of objects in cluster &lt;i&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/i&gt;, and &lt;i&gt;|p - p'|&lt;/i&gt; is the distance between &lt;i&gt;p&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;p'&lt;/i&gt;.


&lt;big&gt;'''Minimum distance'''&lt;/big&gt;: &lt;math&gt;d_{min}(C_i, C_j) = min _{p \in C_i, p' \in C_j}\mid p - p'\mid&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''Maximum distance'''&lt;/big&gt;: &lt;math&gt;d_{max}(C_i, C_j) = max _{p \in C_i, p' \in C_j}\mid p - p'\mid&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''Mean distance'''&lt;/big&gt;:    &lt;math&gt;d_{mean}(C_i, C_j) = \mid m_i - m_j \mid&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;big&gt;'''Average distance'''&lt;/big&gt;: &lt;math&gt;d_{avg}(C_i, C_j) = \frac{1}{n_i n_j} \sum_{p \in C_i} \sum_{p' \in C_j} \mid p - p' \mid&lt;/math&gt;

= Algorithms =
One algorithm that implements the bottom-up approach is AGNES (AGglomerative NESting). The main idea of AGNES is, at its first step, create clusters composed by one single data object, and then, using a specified metric (such the ones mentioned previous section), merge such clusters into greater ones. The second step is repeated iteratively until only one cluster is obtained, composed by all data objects. Another example of algorithm implementing this approach is Cure, where instead dealing all the time with the whole set of entities, the clusters are shrank to its centers.

DIANA (DIvisive ANAlysis) is an example of an algorithm that implements top-down approach, starting with a single big cluster with all elements and iteratively spliting the current groups into smaller ones. As happens with AGNES and Cure, is necessary to define some metric to compute the distance inter-clusters, in order to decide how (where) they have to be splitted.

=Implementation=
In order to use Hierarchical Clustering algorithms in R, one must install &lt;i&gt;cluster&lt;/i&gt; package. This package includes a function that performs the AGNES process and the DIANA process, according to different algorithms.

== AGNES Function ==
The AGNES function provided by &lt;i&gt;cluster&lt;/i&gt; package, might be used as follow:

&lt;big&gt;&lt;code&gt;agnes(x, diss = inherits(x, &quot;dist&quot;), metric = &quot;euclidean&quot;,
stand = FALSE, method = &quot;average&quot;, par.method,
keep.diss = n &lt; 100, keep.data = !diss)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

where the arguments are:
* &lt;b&gt;x&lt;/b&gt;: data matrix or data frame (all variables must be numeric and missing values are allowed), or dissimilarity matrix (missing values aren't allowed), depending on the value of the &lt;i&gt;diss&lt;/i&gt; argument.
* &lt;b&gt;diss&lt;/b&gt;: logical flag. if TRUE (default for dist or dissimilarity objects), then &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; is assumed to be a dissimilarity matrix. If FALSE, then &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; is treated as a matrix of observations by variables.
* &lt;b&gt;metric&lt;/b&gt;: character string specifying the metric to be used for calculating dissimilarities between observations. The currently available options are &lt;i&gt;euclidean&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;manhattan&lt;/i&gt;. Euclidean distances are root sum-of-squares of differences, and manhattan distances are the sum of absolute differences. If &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; is already a dissimilarity matrix, then this argument will be ignored.
* &lt;b&gt;stand&lt;/b&gt;: logical ﬂag: if TRUE, then the measurements in &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; are standardized before calculating the dissimilarities. Measurements are standardized for each variable (column), by subtracting the variable’s mean value and dividing by the variable’s mean absolute deviation. If &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; is already a dissimilarity matrix, then this argument will be ignored.
* &lt;b&gt;method&lt;/b&gt;: character string deﬁning the clustering method. The six methods implemented are &lt;i&gt;average&lt;/i&gt; ([unweighted pair-]group average method, UPGMA), &lt;i&gt;single&lt;/i&gt; (single linkage), &lt;i&gt;complete&lt;/i&gt; (complete linkage), &lt;i&gt;ward&lt;/i&gt; (Ward’smethod), &lt;i&gt;weighted&lt;/i&gt; (weighted average linkage) and its generalization &lt;i&gt;flexible&lt;/i&gt; which uses (a constant version of) the Lance-Williams formula and the par.method argument. Default is &lt;i&gt;average&lt;/i&gt;.
* &lt;b&gt;par.method&lt;/b&gt;: if method = &lt;i&gt;flexible&lt;/i&gt;, numeric vector of length 1, 3, or 4.
* &lt;b&gt;keep.diss, keep.data&lt;/b&gt;: Logicals indicating if the dissimilarities and/or input data &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; should be kept in the result. Setting these to FALSE can give much smaller results and hence even save memory allocation time.

AGNES algorithm has the following features:
* yields the agglomerative coeficient which measures the amount of clustering structure found
* provides the hierarchical tree and the banner, a novel graphical display

The function AGNES returns a &lt;i&gt;agnes object&lt;/i&gt; representing the clustering. This agnes object is a list with the components listed below:
* &lt;b&gt;order&lt;/b&gt;: a vector giving a permutation of the original observations to allow for plotting
* &lt;b&gt;order.lab&lt;/b&gt;: a vector similar to order, but containing observation labels instead of observation numbers. This component is only available if the original observations  were labelled.
* &lt;b&gt;height&lt;/b&gt;: a vector with the distances between merging clusters at the successive stages.
* &lt;b&gt;ac&lt;/b&gt;: the agglomerative coefﬁcient, measuring the clustering structure of the dataset.
* &lt;b&gt;merge&lt;/b&gt;: an (n-1) by 2 matrix, where &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; is the number of observations.
* &lt;b&gt;diss&lt;/b&gt;: an object of class &lt;i&gt;dissimilarity&lt;/i&gt;, representing the total dissimilarity matrix of the dataset.
* &lt;b&gt;data&lt;/b&gt;: a matrix containing the original or standardized measurements. This is available only if the input structure were different from a dissimilarity matrix.

=== Visualization ===
To visualize the AGNES function result might be used the funcionts: &lt;i&gt;print&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;plot&lt;/i&gt;.

The first function simply print the components of object &lt;i&gt;agnes&lt;/i&gt; and the second one plot the object, creating a chart that represents the data.

Here, it is a example of use function plot:

&lt;big&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot(x, ask = FALSE, which.plots = NULL, main = NULL,sub = paste(&quot;Agglomerative Coefficient = &quot;,round(x$ac, digits = 2)),adj = 0, nmax.lab = 35, max.strlen = 5, xax.pretty = TRUE, ...)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

The arguments used are:

* x: object agnes
* ask: If TRUE and which.plots = NULL, plot.agnes operates an interactive mode, via menu.
* which.plots: integer vector or NULL (default), the latter producing both plots
* main, sub: main and sub title for the plot, each with a convenient default.
* adj: For label adjustment in bannerplot
* nmax.lab: nteger indicating the number of labels which is considered too large for singlename labelling the banner plot.
* max.strlen: positive integer giving the length to which strings are truncated in banner plot labeling.
* xax.prety: positive integer giving the length to which strings are truncated in banner plot labeling.
* ...: graphical parameters.

And here, it is the example of use function print:

print(x, ...)

The arguments are:

* x: object agnes
* ...: potential further arguments (require by generic functin print)

== DIANA Function ==
The DIANA function provided by &lt;i&gt;cluster&lt;/i&gt; package, might be used as follow:

&lt;big&gt;&lt;code&gt;diana(x, diss = inherits(x, &quot;dist&quot;), metric = &quot;euclidean&quot;, stand = FALSE, keep.diss = n &lt; 100, keep.data = !diss)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

where the arguments are:
* &lt;b&gt;x&lt;/b&gt;: data matrix or data frame (all variables must be numeric and missing values are allowed), or dissimilarity matrix (missing values aren't allowed), depending on the value of the &lt;i&gt;diss&lt;/i&gt; argument.
* &lt;b&gt;diss&lt;/b&gt;: logical flag. if TRUE (default for dist or dissimilarity objects), then &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; is assumed to be a dissimilarity matrix. If FALSE, then &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; is treated as a matrix of observations by variables.
* &lt;b&gt;metric&lt;/b&gt;: character string specifying the metric to be used for calculating dissimilarities between observations. The currently available options are &lt;i&gt;euclidean&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;manhattan&lt;/i&gt;. Euclidean distances are root sum-of-squares of differences, and manhattan distances are the sum of absolute differences. If &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; is already a dissimilarity matrix, then this argument will be ignored.
* &lt;b&gt;stand&lt;/b&gt;: logical; if true, the measurements in &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; are standardized before calculating the dissimilarities. Measurements are standardized for each variable (column), by subtracting the variable’s mean value and dividing by the variable’s mean absolute deviation. If x is already a dissimilarity matrix, then this argument will be ignored.
* &lt;b&gt;keep.diss, keep.data&lt;/b&gt;: Logicals indicating if the dissimilarities and/or input data &lt;i&gt;x&lt;/i&gt; should be kept in the
result. Setting these to FALSE can give much smaller results and hence even save memory allocation time.


DIANA algorithm is probably unique in computing a divisive hierarchy, whereas most other software for hierarchical clustering is ag
glomerative. It has the same features as AGNES functions as follows:
* yields the agglomerative coeficient which measures the amount of clustering structure found
* provides the hierarchical tree and the banner, a novel graphical display

The function DIANA returns a &lt;i&gt;diana object&lt;/i&gt; representing the clustering. This agnes object is a list with the components listed below:
* &lt;b&gt;order&lt;/b&gt;: a vector giving a permutation of the original observations to allow for plotting
* &lt;b&gt;order.lab&lt;/b&gt;: a vector similar to order, but containing observation labels instead of observation numbers. This component is only available if the original observations  were labelled.
* &lt;b&gt;heigh&lt;/b&gt;: a vector with the distances between merging clusters at the successive stages.
* &lt;b&gt;dc&lt;/b&gt;: the divisive coefﬁcient, measuring the clustering structure of the dataset.
* &lt;b&gt;merge&lt;/b&gt;: an (n-1) by 2 matrix, where &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; is the number of observations.
* &lt;b&gt;diss&lt;/b&gt;: an object of class &lt;i&gt;dissimilarity&lt;/i&gt;, representing the total dissimilarity matrix of the dataset.
* &lt;b&gt;data&lt;/b&gt;: a matrix containing the original or standardized measurements. This is available only if the input structure were different from a dissimilarity matrix.

=== Visualization ===
To visualize the DIANA function result might be used the funcionts: &lt;i&gt;print&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;plot&lt;/i&gt;.

The first function simply print the components of object &lt;i&gt;agnes&lt;/i&gt; and the second one plot the object, creating a chart that represents the data.

&lt;big&gt;&lt;code&gt;plot(x, ask = FALSE, which.plots = NULL, main = NULL, sub = paste(&quot;Divisive Coefficient = &quot;, round(x$dc, digits = 2)),
adj = 0, nmax.lab = 35, max.strlen = 5, xax.pretty = TRUE, ...)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

The arguments used are:
* &lt;b&gt;x&lt;/b&gt;: object &lt;i&gt;diana&lt;/i&gt;
* &lt;b&gt;ask&lt;/b&gt;: If TRUE and which.plots = NULL, plot.diana operates an interactive mode, via menu.
* &lt;b&gt;which.plots&lt;/b&gt;: integer vector or NULL (default), the latter producing both plots
* &lt;b&gt;main, sub&lt;/b&gt;: main and sub title for the plot, each with a convenient default. 
* &lt;b&gt;adj&lt;/b&gt;: For label adjustment in bannerplot
* &lt;b&gt;nmax.lab&lt;/b&gt;: nteger indicating the number of labels which is considered too large for singlename labelling the banner plot.
* &lt;b&gt;max.strlen&lt;/b&gt;: positive integer giving the length to which strings are truncated in banner plot labeling.
* &lt;b&gt;xax.prety&lt;/b&gt;: positive integer giving the length to which strings are truncated in banner plot labeling.
* &lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt;: graphical parameters.

And here, it is the example of use function &lt;i&gt;print&lt;/i&gt;:

&lt;big&gt;&lt;code&gt;print(x, ...)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/big&gt;

The arguments are:
* &lt;b&gt;x&lt;/b&gt;: object &lt;i&gt;diana&lt;/i&gt;
* &lt;b&gt;...&lt;/b&gt;: potential further arguments (require by generic functin print)

= Use Case =

In this section it is illustrate a example of using hierarchical clustering in some Italian cities. In the example below, it is used mean distance, or single-linkage method.

== Scenario ==
Given the distances in kilometers between Italian cities, the object is to group them into clusters in a agglomerative way.
For examples in R is used the function &lt;i&gt;agnes&lt;/i&gt;.

== Input Data ==
The input data is a table containing the numeric values of distances between cities in Italy. The table consists of six columns (and rows), representing Italian cities. Each cell has a numeric value representing the distance in kilometers between them. The table can be loaded from a spreadsheet or from a text file.

Figure 1 illustres the cities used in this example.

== Execution ==
The function &lt;i&gt;agnes&lt;/i&gt; can be used to define the groups of countries as follow:

&lt;pre&gt;
# import data
x &lt;- read.table(&quot;data.txt&quot;)

# run AGNES
ag &lt;- agnes (x, false, metric=&quot;euclidean&quot;, false, method =&quot;single&quot;)
 
# print components of ag
print(ag)

# plot clusters
plot(ag, ask = FALSE, which.plots = NULL)
&lt;/pre&gt;


The value of the second parameter of &lt;i&gt;agnes&lt;/i&gt; was FALSE, because &lt;b&gt;x&lt;/b&gt; was treated as a matrix of observations by variables. The fourth parameter also is FALSE because isn't necessary standardizing each column.

== Output ==

The result of printing the components of the class &lt;i&gt;agnes&lt;/i&gt; returned by the function application is shown below:

&lt;pre&gt;
Call:    agnes(x = x, diss = FALSE, metric = &quot;euclidean&quot;, stand = FALSE,      method = &quot;single&quot;) 
Agglomerative coefficient:  0.3370960 
Order of objects:
[1] BA VO RM FI MI TO
Height (summary):
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max. 
  295.8   486.0   486.5   517.6   642.6   677.0 

Available components:
[1] &quot;order&quot;     &quot;height&quot;    &quot;ac&quot;        &quot;merge&quot;     &quot;diss&quot;      &quot;call&quot;     
[7] &quot;method&quot;    &quot;order.lab&quot; &quot;data&quot;
&lt;/pre&gt;

The result of plotting the class returned by the function application it is shown below:
&lt;gallery&gt;
File:Dendograma.JPG|Dendograma
&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Analysis ==

The algorithm always cluster the nearest pair of cities so, in this case, the &quot; neighborhood &quot; cities are clusterized first. In single link clustering the rule is that the distance from the compound object to another object is equal to the shortest distance from any member of the cluster to the outside object

However, there are a few weaknesses in agglomerative clustering methods:

* they do not scale well: time complexity of at least &lt;i&gt;O(&lt;math&gt;n^2&lt;/math&gt;)&lt;/i&gt;, where &lt;i&gt;n&lt;/i&gt; is the number of total objects;
* they can never undo what was done previously.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== General information ==
An '''Aldose''' contains an '''aldehyde''' with two or more hydroxyl groups attached; one of the hydroxyl groups is at end opposite to the aldehyde. An '''Aldose''' is a type of [[Structural Biochemistry/Carbohydrates/Monosaccharides|'''monosaccharides''']], which is a chiral molecule that plays a key role in the development of nucleic acids. The two simplest forms of Aldoses are L- and D-Glyceraldehydes, which are three-carbon structures that each contain one aldehyde and two hydroxyl groups. The L and D symbols apply to the two different configurations of the asymmetric carbon farthest from the aldehyde group.
[[File:DRibose Fischer.svg|thumb|D-Ribose]]
In the figure below, the common D-aldose sugars are shown: [[File:Family Tree of D-Aldoses.jpg|center|thumb|500px|[[D-Aldoses containing three, four, five and six carbon atoms]]]] Family Tree of D-Aldoses.jpg

[[File: CCF11302011_00001.jpg |thumb|450px||right| The Aldoses: triose, tetroses, pentoses, and hexoses]]

== Hemiacetal ==
The carbonyl group in aldehydes and ketones may react with one molecule of alcohol to form a hemiacetal. The ‘-OR’ group in alcohol attacks the carbonyl carbon in aldehydes or ketones, thus breaking the ‘C-O’ double bond. Proton transfer either intramolecularly or via solvent completes the reaction. Hemiacetal formation may be either acid or base catalyzed. Under acidic condition, however, the carbonyl group may react one more time when alcohol is in excess to form an acetal. The following two diagrams depict an example of hemiacetal and acetal found in carbohydrates. 
[[File:Glucopyranose.jpg|center|thumb|500px]]
[[File:Carbohydrate - Acetal.jpg|center|thumb|500px]]
The red arrows shown in the Fischer projection of a glucose molecule demonstrate the brief overview of mechanism for the hemiacetal formation. The (*) mark on the oxygen of aldehyde indicates the position of the oxygen after the ring formation, while the numbers on each stereocenters indicate the position of each carbon. [[File:HemiacetalFormation.png|thumb|HemiacetalFormation]]

== Ring formation ==
Most of the sugars form cyclic rings, which are more stable than the open chain form. To enable ring formation, the aldehyde can react with an alcohol to form a hemiacetal. Carbohydrates may form either five or six membered rings depending on which hydroxyl group undergoes the hemiacetal formation. A five membered ring is called furanose, while a six membered ring is called pyranose. Furanoses form when the hydroxyl group on C4 reacts with the carbonyl group, while pyranoses form when the hydroxyl group on C5 reacts. This forms the intramolecular hemiacetal in the ring structure. In carbohydrates, the hemiacetal/acetal carbon (C1) in cyclic form is called the anomer. This carbon may be labeled as α or β depending on the position of the (*)-labeled oxygen in the figure. If the (*)-labeled oxygen in the picture is above the ring, the anomeric carbon is labeled as β. If below, it is labeled as α. 
The following is the formation of a five membered ring by a glucose molecule:

== Overview ==

'''''Fang''''' is a boarhound, one of [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Rubeus Hagrid|Hagrid]]'s pets. Unlike many of Hagrid's &quot;pets&quot;, Fang is not dangerous; he is merely extremely large, and tends to slobber all over [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Harry Potter|Harry]]'s robes when Harry visits Hagrid.

== Role in the Books ==

{{Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Beginner Spoiler}}

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Philosopher's Stone|Philosopher's Stone]] ===

We first meet Fang when Harry and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Ron Weasley|Ron]] visit Hagrid after the first week of classes. Harry's knock is answered by booming barks and Hagrid's telling Fang to get down. Once they are inside and Hagrid can release Fang, he immediately starts licking Ron's ears. Seated at Hagrid's table, which is oversized as Hagrid is himself, Harry finds that Fang can rest his head on Harry's knee without stretching.

Perhaps curiously, there is no mention of what Fang is doing during [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Norbert|Norbert's]] relatively brief stay in Hagrid's hut.

Harry, [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Hermione Granger|Hermione]], [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Neville Longbottom|Neville]], and [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Draco Malfoy|Draco]] are given detention for being out of the dormitories after hours. This detention is served with Hagrid, who has them going into the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Forbidden Forest|Forbidden Forest]] hunting for something that is killing [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Unicorn|unicorns]]. Hagrid separates them into two groups. Draco insists on getting Fang in his group, even though Hagrid tells Draco that Fang is a coward. Draco, Fang, and Neville head off in one direction, while Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid head in another. After Draco scares Neville, Hagrid reshuffles groups, putting Harry, Draco, and Fang together. When Harry and Draco find the dead Unicorn and the thing that has been killing them, Fang immediately turns tail and flees, as does Draco.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Chamber of Secrets|Chamber of Secrets]] ===

When Hagrid is taken to [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Places/Azkaban|Azkaban]] by [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Characters/Cornelius Fudge|Cornelius Fudge]], the last thing he says, to the hidden Harry and Ron, is that someone should feed Fang.

Harry and Ron then take Fang with them to the Forbidden Forest, as they follow the spiders. Fang is as quickly captured by the [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Magic/Acromantula|Acromantulae]] as Harry and Ron are. The two boys have to push Fang into the Ford Anglia when it rides to their rescue.

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Prisoner of Azkaban|Prisoner of Azkaban]] ===

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Goblet of Fire|Goblet of Fire]] ===

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Order of the Phoenix|Order of the Phoenix]] ===

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Half-Blood Prince|Half-Blood Prince]] ===

=== [[Muggles' Guide to Harry Potter/Books/Deathly Hallows|Deathly Hallows]] ===

== Strengths ==

Fang is extremely friendly to most people, including Harry, Ron, and Hermione; however, if someone attacks Hagrid, such as when Umbridge attempts to arrest him in ''Order of the Phoenix'', he will defend Hagrid even at his own risk.

== Weaknesses ==

According to Hagrid, Fang is &quot;just a big softie&quot;. He does seem to have an excellent instinct for self-preservation, running away from the dark figure in the Forbidden Forest in the first book, and trying to run from the Acromantulae in the second.

== Relationships with Other Characters ==

Fang is Hagrid's dog and as such is quite loyal to him.

== Analysis ==

== Questions ==

#Where would Fang have been during Norbert's stay with Hagrid?
#What would have happened to Fang when Hagrid was forced to flee his house after hosting a &quot;Support Harry Potter&quot; party?

 Thank you for your recent message concerning my submission, &quot;How to improvise
 morality role plays.&quot;  I am including the idea genesis transcript and the chapter
 outline below.  
 
 I propose that this work be a collaborative effort with the proceeds going to charity. 
 
 Please let me know whether you will support this publishing effort in the humanities.
 
 Yours sincerely,
 G. and M.

= How to improvise morality role plays =

It was a dark and stormy night.  Lightning burst out from the horizon, harkening back to the days when the heretics' fates at the hands of the Temple of Zeus made Galileo's look like Club Med.

 [14:25]  M: Press enter press enter!
 [14:25]  M laughs
 [14:26] G:

Grey figures appear in the distance. A light is shone on one of their faces, and per Heisenberg, your observation becomes an interaction.

 [14:27]  M laughs
 [14:28]  M: That is lovely and also very geeky too!
 [14:28]  M: For fun you should look at http://writebadlywell.blogspot.com/
 [14:28]  G: 

You see a government agent, the representative of their entire genetic makeup. An attractive specimen.  

 [14:28]  G: thank you &lt;3
 [14:29]  G: should I post this outline in comments?
 [14:29]  G: or will they ding me for falling back on the dark/stormy/night canard?
 [14:29]  M laughs
 [14:31]  G: 

A bright day in a beautiful field, the documents have been prepared for signature....  

An ominous sting of static electricity harkens back to the fates of the heretics of amber at the hands of the Temple of Zeus, making Galileo's look like Club Med. The treaty could end the longest running conflict in all of the parties' history, but nobody had a protocol for an event like this.  You peer out of your broken car, wishing this book was still in your hand.&quot;

== Chapter 1. Character development. ==
Make sure you have all your alts ready in advance and they don't look like noobs and they have the right group memberships, titlers, decorum, outfits, etc.  Put some backstory into the first page of their profile so your audience doesn't have to go looking when you're in the thick of things, but add stuff to their pics so they look real.

== Chapter 2. Practice makes perfect. ==
Start small with single character role play, and join role-play &quot;chat&quot; groups to learn the best tips and techniques.  Don't try to set up a morality play until you feel comfortable and a sound mastery of the basics of role play.

== Chapter 3. Set, setting, and scenario. == 
You need to have the right mindset, and know that you will be free from distractions for the multiple hours it might take to get it right.  Don't be afraid to start again later.  You need to find a roleplay location which is both populated with experienced roleplayers and suitable for the topic you wish to address.  Often you will find the perfect setting unoccupied, or a poor setting with a lot of good RP, so be prepared to make compromises.  But always stay true to your ideals.

== Chapter 4. Seeing other people's points of view.  ==
* How can you best understand how other people feel? 
* What kinds of questions do you need to ask to find out?

== Chapter 5. Tactics and strategy. == 
* What is it you want to say? 
* How do you think you would communicate that to your audience most closely if you knew exactly how you wanted to say it? 
* Are you promoting the common good? 
* Are you abiding by the principles of peace, justice, harmony, and truth?  Is what you are saying worth saying?

== Chapter 6. The history of morality.  ==
* Do we learn from the things which surprise us? 
* Are those the only things we do ever learn from? [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kullback-Leibler_divergence]
* Why are some facts ironic? 
* What is the best for you and the people around you?

== Chapter 7. Ethics: Morality Applied. ==
* When is civil disobedience the right thing to do? 
* How can you take part in insuring that the best possible outcomes occur?

== Chapter 8. Government. ==
* Who has the most power over you, and why? 
* How can you communicate best with the people involved with the decisions that affect your life? 
* Why is science as much as a part of forensics as improvisational drama?

== Chapter 9. Resolution.  ==
When is it time to step back and recognize that the point is made, and it's time to get on planning a new, ever more fun and insightful point in the future?</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Guidelines for Creating Your Own Voice=


Writing style can mean some things. It can mean the features that make the person or authors type of writing unique. On the other end of the spectrum there is a legal or scientific style of writing, referring to writing characteristics shared by certain groups of professionals, like lawyers or scientists. Style can also mean a communication's readability, if it is written in a clear manner, a muddy, inspiring or dull style. At work, you observe the stylistic convention of your profession and your employer's organization, simultaneously expressing your individuality, make reading easy for your audience and impacting them while they are reading. Consider your options in light of the way they will affect your readers' view of your communication's usability and persuasiveness.
Based on what readers see, they draw conclusions about you and your attitudes that can enhance or distract from the persuasiveness of your communications. Your ability to craft and control your voice is essential to your success at writing.


==Guideline 1: Find Out What is Expected==
An effective voice is one that matches your reader's sense of what is appropriate. However, you have the option to choose who your audience is by topic, word choice, and formality. You have to have a tone and style that is pertinent to your readers. The voice needs to be clear as to who it is directed towards.

• How formal do my readers think my writing should be?

When you use contractions and colloquial words and phrases it starts to sound informal, like a conversation. Note: short words do not indicate an informal style. In fact, many people prefer plain language to create an ease of reading of difficult ideas or concepts to comprehend. Also, longer words may confuse your readers, or make the writing sound arrogant. This is also the same for long sentences. Avoid these in either formal/informal writing. A formal style of writing uses correct word usage, sentence structure, formal phrasing, and appropriate language.  Always be conscious of who your audience is when determining your writing style.  There are many instances to use a formal language. Speeches, services, eulogy, and papers. These are good examples of how no matter the age of the audience, a formal document may suit any age. Some examples when one would use informal language would be writing letter to friends or in your journal. Sometimes informal writing may seem more sincere since it sends more emotions. 

• How subjective or objective do my readers believe my writing should be?

In subjective writing you word opinions by using &quot;I&quot;, in which you introduce yourself to your writing. In objective style you hide your presence of opinion, simply stating your beliefs as facts and by reporting about your own actions in the third person or in a passive tone. Objective writing is more formal and is expected in professional and technical writing situations.

• How much &quot;distance&quot; do my readers expect me to establish between them?

In personal style, you appear close to your readers because you use personal pronouns and address readers directly. How conversational the piece is may also convey this message. In an impersonal style  you distance yourself from your readers by avoiding personal pronouns and by talking about yourself and your readers in the third person. The style you choose depends on the purpose of the writing and the audience. 


&lt;u&gt;Major Factors that may influence your readers' expectations about style:&lt;/u&gt;

• Your professional relationship with your readers.

• Your purpose.

• Your subject.

• Your personality.

• Customs in your employers' organization.

• Customs in your field, profession, or discipline.


&lt;u&gt;
What If the Expected Style is Ineffective?&lt;/u&gt;

Note that sometimes the expected style may be less effective than others. For example, in some organizations the expected style is a widely condemned style called ''bureaucratese''. This type of style is characterized by wordiness that buries significant ideas and information, by weak verbs that disguise action, and by abstract vocabulary that detaches meaning from the practical world of people, activities and objects. Often this style of writing features an inflated vocabulary and a general pomposity that slows or completely blocks comprehension of what the writer is trying to get across.

'''Bureaucratese''': According to optimal quality-control practices in manufacturing any product, it is important that every component part that is constituent of the product be examined and checked individually after being received from its supplier or other source but before the final, finished product is assembled. (45 words)

'''Plain English''': Effective quality control requires that every component be checked individually before the final product is assembled. (16 words)

'''Bureaucratese''': Over the most recent monthly period, there has been a large increase in the number of complaints that customers have made about service that has been slow. (27 words)

'''Plain English''': Last month, many more customers complained about slow service. (9 words)

Bureaucratese is such a serious barrier to understanding that many states in the United States have passed laws ''requiring'' plain English in government publications and other documents, such as insurance policies. The guidelines will help you avoid bureaucratese. However, some managers and organizations want employees to use that puffed-up style, thinking it sounds impressive. If you are asked to write in bureaucratese, try to explain why a straightforward style is more effective. If you fail to persuade, be prudent. Use the style that is required. Even within the confines of a generally bureaucratic style, you can probably make improvements. For instance, if your employer expects a wordy, abstract style, you may still be able to use a less inflated vocabulary.

==Guideline 2: Consider the Roles Your Voice Creates for Your Readers and Yourself==

When you choose the voice with which you will address your readers, you define a role for yourself. As a manager of a department, you could adopt the voice of a stern taskmaster or an open-minded leader. The voice you choose also implies a role for your readers. Their response to the role given to them can significantly influence your communication's overall effectiveness. If you choose the voice of a leader who respects your readers, they will probably accept their role as a valued colleague. If you choose the voice of a superior, unerring authority, they may resent their implied role as error-prone inferiors and resist the substance of your message.

By using the appropriate voice in your communication you can increase your ability to elicit the attitudes and actions you want to inspire.

==Guideline 3: Consider How Your Attitude Toward Your Subject Will Affect Your Readers==

In addition to communicating attitudes about yourself and your readers, your voice communicates an attitude toward your subject. Feelings are contagious. If you write about your subject enthusiastically, your readers may catch and exibit your enthusiasm. If you seem indifferent, they may adopt the same attitude. Make sure you believe what you say or pretend like you believe it. If you talk down to people or belittle them,  you will lose their loyalty and willingness to follow your lead. If you use a pretentious voice when writing to superiors you will probably make them angry because they may feel that you are undermining their authority. 


E-mail presents a special temptation to be careless about voice because it encourages spontaneity. Your risk of regretting an e-mail you've written is increased by the ease with which e-mails can be forwarded or sent to readers you didn't intend to see the message. Never include anything in an e-mail that you wouldn't want a large audience to view, like a court room. E-mails and text messages can be the basis of a trial or lawsuit. Check carefully for statements that your readers might interpret as having a different tone than the one you intended. Never talk badly about someone in an E-mail, and make sure to keep this mail in a file for future reference. Keeping the e-mail in a file will help protect yourself as a writer from lost or altered material. As long as you keep personal problems and biases out of office emails you should be just fine.

==Guideline 4: Say Things in Your Own Words==

No matter what style of voice you choose, be sure to retain your own thoughts in your writing. This can be achieved even in formal writing. When you are using a formal style, the objective is not to silence your own voice; it's to let your style sound like ''you'', writing in a formal situation.


To check whether you are using your own voice, try reading your drafts aloud. Where the phrasing seems awkward or the words are difficult for you to speak, you may have adopted someone else's voice-or slipped into bureaucratese, which reflects no one's voice. Reading your drafts aloud will also help you spot other problems with voice, such as sarcasm or condescension.


Although it will sometime be appropriate for you to suppress your own voice. Like when a report is written by multiple people in a group, you should strive to achieve a unified voice so the paper is cohesive and all parts of the paper fit together well. An example of when you should suppress your own voice is when writing something like a policy statement which is written in the employer's style, not the individual writer's style.

==Guideline 5: Global Guideline: Adapt Your Voice to Your Readers' Cultural Background==

From one culture to another, general expectations about the voice vary considerably. Understanding the differences between the expectations of your culture and those of your readers can be especially important because the voice you use tells your readers about the relationship you believe you have with them.


In the United States and Europe, employees often use an informal voice and address their readers by their first names. In Japan, writers commonly use a formal style and address their readers by their titles and last names. If a U.S. writer used a familiar, informal voice in a letter, memo, or e-mail, Japanese readers might feel that the writer has not properly respected them. On the other hand, Japanese writers may seem distant and difficult to relate to if they use the formality that is common in their own cultures when writing to U.S. readers. In either case, if the readers judge that the writer hasn't taken the trouble to learn about or doesn't care about their culture they may be offended.


Directness is another aspect of voice. When writing to people in other cultures, try to learn and use the voice that is customary there. You can also learn about the voice used in your reader's culture by studying communications they have written. If possible, ask for advice from people who are from your reader's culture or who are knowledgeable about it.

==Guideline 6: Ethics Guideline: Avoid Stereotypes==

What do stereotypes have to do with voice and ethics? Stereotypes are very deeply embedded in many cultures. Most of us are prone to use them occasionally especially when conversing informally. As a result, when we use more colloquial and conversational language to develop our distinctive voice for our workplace writing, we may inadvertently employ stereotypes. Unfortunately, even inadvertent uses of stereotypes have serious consequences for individuals and groups. People who are viewed in terms of stereotypes lose their ability to be treated as individual human beings. If they belong to a group that is unfavorably stereotyped, they may find it nearly impossible to get others to take their talents, ideas and feelings seriously. The range of groups disadvantaged by stereotyping is quite extensive. People can be stereotyped because of their race, religion, age, gender, sexual orientation, weight, physical handicap, occupation and ethnicity. In some workplaces, manual laborers, union members, clerical workers, and others are the victims of stereotyping by people in white-collar positions.


There is absolutely no tolerance for stereotypes in professional writing. Anything you write will be worthless to most audiences if you include any type of stereotypes. Using stereotypes, even accidentally, will seriously damage your reputation with your readers and may even cause your professional relationship to end. So be very aware of any stereotypes that may exist especially when writing cross-culturally.

==Constructing Sentences==

Researchers who have studied the ways our minds process information have provided us with many valuable insights about ways to write reader-centered sentences. Based primarily on these research findings, the following six guidelines explain ways to construct highly usable, highly persuasive sentences.


==='''Guideline 1: Simplify Your Sentences'''===

The easiest way to increase usability is to simplify your sentences. Reading is ''work''. Psychologists say that much of the work is done by short-term memory. It must figure out how the words in each sentence fit together to create a specific meaning. Fewer words means less work. In addition, research shows that when '''we''' express '''our''' message concisely, '''we'''make it more forceful, memorable, and persuasive.


&lt;u&gt;Simplifying Sentences&lt;/u&gt;

1. Eliminate unnecessary words.
Look for places where you can convey your meaning more directly. 

'''Consider''': The &lt;u&gt;physical size&lt;/u&gt; of the workroom is too small &lt;u&gt;to accommodate&lt;/u&gt; this equipment.

By removing unnecessary words, the sentence is just as clear and more emphatic: The workroom is too small for this equipment.

2. Place modifiers next to the words they modify.

Short-term memory relies on word order to indicate meaning.  If you don't keep related words together, your sentence may say something different from what you mean.

'''Example''': A large number of undeposited checks were found in the file cabinets, which were worth over $41,000.

3. Combine short sentences.

Often, combining two or more short sentences makes reading easier because doing so both reduces the total number of words and helps the reader see the relationships among the points presented.

'''Separate''': Water quality in Hawk River declined in March. This decline occurred because of the heavy rainfall that month.  all the extra water overloaded Tomlin County's water treatment plant.

'''Combined''': Water quality in Hawk River declined in March because heavy rainfalls overloaded Tomlin County's water treatment plant.

==='''Guideline 2: Put the Action in Your Verbs'''===

Most sentences are about action. Sales rise, equipment fails, engineers design, managers approve. Yet, many people bury the action in nouns, adjectives, and other parts of speech. 
Consider the following sentence: Our department accomplished the conversion to the new machinery in two months.
It could be energized by putting the action (converting) into the verb: Our department converted to the new machinery in two months.

&lt;u&gt;Focusing Sentences on Action&lt;/u&gt;

• Avoid sentences that use the verb ''to be'' or its variation (''is, was, will be, etc.'').

The verb ''to be'' often tells what something is, not what it does.

'''Original''': The sterilization procedure &lt;u&gt;is a protection&lt;/u&gt; against reinfection.

'''Revised''': The sterilization procedure &lt;u&gt;protects&lt;/u&gt; against reinfection.

• Avoid sentences that begin with ''It is'' or ''There are''

'''Original''': &lt;u&gt;It is&lt;/u&gt; because the cost of raw materials has soared that the price of finished goods is rising.

'''Revised''': Because the cost of raw materials has soared, the price of finished goods is rising.

'''Original''': &lt;u&gt;There are&lt;/u&gt; several factors causing the engineers to question the dam's strength.

'''Revised''': Several factors cause the engineers to questions the dam's strength.

• Avoid sentences where the action is frozen in a word that ends with one of the following suffixes: ''-tion, -ment, -ing, -ion, -ance'' These words petrify the action that should be in verbs by converting them into nouns.

'''Original''': consequently, I would like to make a &lt;u&gt;recommendation&lt;/u&gt; that the department hire two additional programmers.

'''Revised''': Consequently, I &lt;u&gt;recommend&lt;/u&gt; that the department hire two additional programmers.


Although most sentences are about action, some aren't. For example, topic and forecasting statements often introduce lists or describe the organization of the discussion that follows.

Topic sentence for which the verb to be is appropriate: There are three main reasons the company should invest money to improve communication between corporate headquarters and the out-of-state plants.

==='''Guideline 3: Use the Active Voice Unless You Have a Good Reason To Use the Passive Voice'''===

Another way to focus your sentences on action and actors is to use the ''active voice'' rather than the ''passive voice''. To write the active voice, place the actor--the person or the thing performing the action--in the subject position. Your verb will then describe the actor's action. 

'''Active Voice''': The consultant recommended these changes.

In the passive voice, the subject of the sentence and the actor are different.  The subject is ''acted upon'' by the actor.

'''Passive Voice''': The changes were recommended by the consultant.

'''Passive Voice''': The Korean ore was purchased by us.

'''Active Voice''': We purchase the Korean ore.

Research shows that readers comprehend active sentences more rapidly than passive ones. Also, the active voice eliminates the vagueness and ambiguity that often characterize the passive voice. In the passive voice, a sentence can describe an action without telling who did it. For example, &quot;The ball was hit&quot; is a grammatically correct sentence but doesn't tell who or what hit the ball. With the active voice, the writer identifies the actor: &quot;Linda hit the ball.&quot;

Although the passive voice generally reduces readability, it has some good uses. One occurs when you don't want to identify the actor. If the writer decided that it would be ethically acceptable to communicate this news to the reader without naming the person who made the report, then she has used the passive voice effectively. Also be careful, to avoid using the passive voice to hide an actor's identity when it is unethical to do so, like when trying to avoid accepting responsibility for your employer's actions.

==='''Guideline 4: Emphasize What's Most Important'''===

Another way to write clean, forceful sentences is to direct your readers' attention to the most important information you are conveying.


&lt;u&gt;Emphasizing What's Most Important&lt;/u&gt;

1. Place the key information at the end of the sentence

To position the key information at the end of a sentence, you may sometimes need to rearrange your first draft.

'''Original''': The department's performance has been superb in all areas.

'''Revised''': In all areas, the department's performance has been superb.

'''Original''': The &lt;u&gt;bright exterior design&lt;/u&gt; is one of the product's most appealing features to college-age customers.

'''Revised''': One of the product's most appealing features to college-age customers is its &lt;u&gt;bright exterior design.&lt;/u&gt;

2. Place the key information in the main clause

If your sentence has more than one clause, use the main clause for the information you want to emphasize.  Compare the following versions of the same statement:

Although our productivity was down, our profits were up.

Although our profits were up, our productivity was down.

In the first version, the emphasis is on profits because ''profits'' is the subject of the main clause.  The second version emphasizes productivity because ''productivity'' is the subject of the main clause. (Notice that the emphasized information is the main clause and also at the end of the sentence.)

3. Emphasize key information typographically

Use boldface and italics. Be careful, however, to use typographical highlighting sparingly.  When many things are emphasized, none stands out.

4. Tell readers explicitly what the key information is

You can also emphasize key information by announcing its importance to your readers.

Example: Economists pointed to three important causes of the stock market's declining: uncertainty about the outcome of last month's election, a rise in inventories of durable goods, and--most important--signs of rising inflation.

5. Avoid filler. While this is true in most writing situations, it is more important to do it in business writing than any other writing. In the business world, time is money. If your boss or your clients have to spend time reading your filler filled emails, they are wasting time. When rereading your documents, ask your self if what you write seems obvious. 

Example: The time on the face of the clock showed that he was late getting to his job, where he would start his work.

Obviously, the time was on the clock and what else do people do at their jobs besides work. This is a crude example, but it shows that length of a document does not, necessarily, improve the quality of the document. In most business settings, shorter, simpler documents work better than wordy, drawn out documents.

==='''Guideline 5: Vary Your Sentence Length and Structure'''===

If all the sentences in a sentence group have the same structure, two problems arise:  Monotony sets in, and  (because all the sentences are basically alike) you lose the ability to emphasize major points and under emphasize minor ones

You avoid such monotony and loss of emphasis in two ways:

• Vary your sentence length
- Longer sentences can be used to show the relationships among ideas. Shorter sentences provide emphasis in the context of longer sentences.

• Vary your sentence structure.
- For example, the grammatical subject of the sentence does not have to be the sentence's first word. If it did, the English language would lose much of its power to emphasize more important information and to deemphasize less important information. One alternative to beginning a sentence with its grammatical subject is to begin with a clause that indicates a logical relationship.

'''Introductory clause''': &lt;u&gt;After we complete our survey&lt;/u&gt;, we will know for sure whether the proposed site for our new factory was once a Native American camping ground.

'''Introductory clause''': &lt;u&gt;Because we have thoroughly investigated all the alternatives&lt;/u&gt;, we feel confident that a pneumatic drive will work best and provide the most reliable service.

==='''Guideline 6: Global Guideline: Adapt your Sentences for Readers Who Are Not Fluent in Your Language'''===

The decision you make about the structure of your sentences can affect the ease with which people who are not fluent in English can understand your message. Companies in several industries, including oil and computers, have developed simplified versions of English for use in communications for readers in other cultures. In addition to limited vocabularies, simplified English has special grammar rules that guide writers in using sentences that will be easy for their readers to understand. Because readers may not need this degree of simplification, be sure to learn as much as possible about your specific readers. Remember that simplifying  your sentence structure should not involve simplifying your thought.


&lt;u&gt;Guidelines for Creating Sentences for Readers Who Are Not Fluent in English&lt;/u&gt;

• Use simple sentence structure- the more complex your sentences, the more difficult they will be for readers to understand.

• Keep sentences short- a long sentence can be hard to follow, even if its structure is simple. Set twenty words as a limit.

• Use the active voice- readers who are not fluent in English can understand the active voice much more easily than they can understand the passive.

==Selecting Words==

When selecting words, your first goal should be to increase the usability of your writing by enabling your readers to grasp your meaning quickly and accurately. At the same time, keep in mind that your word choices affect your readers' attitudes toward you and your subject matter. Therefore you also need to choose words that will increase your communication's persuasiveness. Word choice could make a difference of how your voice is heard, like how formal it is.


==='''Guideline 1: Use Concrete, Specific Words'''===

Almost anything can be described either in relatively abstract, general words or in relatively concrete, specific ones. You may say that you are writing on a piece of electronic equipment or that your are writing on a laptop computer connected to a color laser printer. You may say that your employer produces consumer goods or that it makes cell phones.

When groups of words are ranked according to degree of abstraction, they form hierarchies. You can increase the clarity, and therefore the usability, of your writing by using concrete, specific words rather than abstract general ones. Concrete words help your readers understand precisely what you mean. If you say that your company produces television shows for a younger demographic segment, they won't know whether you mean teenagers or toddlers. If you say that you study natural phenomena, your readers won't know whether you mean volcanic eruptions or the migrations of monarch butterflies. Such vagueness can hinder readers from getting the information they need in order to make decisions and take action. Of course, abstract and general terms do have important uses. Like in scientific, technical and other specialized fields, writers often need to make general points, describe the general features of a situation, or provide general guidance for action. Your objective when choosing words is not to avoid abstract general words altogether, but rather to avoid using them when your readers will want more specific ones.

==='''Guideline 2: Use specialized Terms When- And Only When- Your Readers Will Understand Them'''===

You can increase the usability and persuasiveness of your writing by using wisely the specialized terms of your own profession. In some situations, specialized terms help you communicate effectively:

• They convey precise, technical meanings economically - Many terms have no exact equivalent in everyday speech.

• They help you establish credibility - By using the special terms of your field accurately, you show your fellow specialists that you are adept in it.

However, you should avoid using technical terms your readers won't understand.

==='''Helpful Hints on Word Choice'''===
To write concise sentences, use clear, concise words and phrases. Avoid using longer words when shorter ones will do just as well. (Write to express, not to impress.)

==How to Explain Unfamiliar Terms If You Must Use Them==

Sometimes  you may need to use specialized terms even though some people in your audience may not understand them. For instance, you may be writing to a group of readers that includes people in your field and others outside of it, or you may be explaining an entirely new subject to your readers. In such cases, there are several ways to define the terms for readers who are not familiar with them.


&lt;u&gt;Defining Terms Your Readers Don't Know&lt;/u&gt;

1. Give a synonym.  Example: On a boat, a rope or cord is called a line.

2. Give a description. Example: The exit gate consists of tow arms that hold a jug while it is being painted and then allow it to proceed down the production line.

3. Make an analogy.  Example: An atom is like a miniature solar system in which the nucleus is the sun and the electrons are the planets that revolve around it.

4. Give a classical definition.  In a classical definition, you define the term by naming some familiar group of things to which it belongs and then identifying the key distinction between the object being defined and the other member of the group.

'''Examples''': 

Word is '''bold''', Group is ''italics'', and distinguishing characteristic is &lt;u&gt;underlined&lt;/u&gt;.

'''A crystal is a''' ''solid'' &lt;u&gt;in which the atoms or molecules are arranged in a regularly repeated pattern&lt;/u&gt;.

'''A burrow is a''' ''hole in the ground'' &lt;u&gt;dug by an animal for shelter or habitation&lt;/u&gt;.


==='''Guideline 3: Use Words Accurately'''===

Whether you use specialized terms or everyday ones and whether you use abstract, general or concrete, specific ones, you must use all your words accurately. This point may seen obvious, but inaccurate word choice is all too common in on-the-job writing. Errors  can distract readers from your message by drawing their attention to your problems with word choice, and they may lead your readers to believe their attention to your problems with word choice, and they may lead your readers to believe that your are not skillful or precise in other areas, such as laboratory or analytical skills.

How can you ensure that you use words accurately? There is no easy way. Consult a dictionary when ever you are uncertain. Be especially careful when using words that are not yet part of your usual vocabulary. Pay attention as well to the way words are used by other people.


==='''Guideline 4: Choose Plain Words Over Fancy Ones'''===

You can also make your writing easy to understand by avoiding using fancy words where plain ones will do. At work, some writers do just the opposite, perhaps thinking that fancy words sound more official or make them sound more knowledgeable. 

There are two important reasons for preferring plain words over fancy ones:


1. Plain words promote efficient reading

- Research has shown that even if your readers know both the plain word and its fancy version, they will still comprehend the plain word more rapidly.

2. Plain words reduce your risk of creating a bad impression

-If you use words that make for slow, inefficient reading, you may annoy your readers or cause them to conclude that you are behaving pompously, showing off, or trying to hide a lack of ideas and information behind a fog of fancy terms. 

'''Pompous word choice''': I am transmitting the enclosed resume to facilitate your efforts to determine the pertinence of my work experience to your opening.

Don't misunderstand this guideline. It doesn't suggest that you should use only simple language at work. When addressing people with vocabularies comparable to your own, use all the words at your command. Provided that you use them accurately and appropriately. This guideline merely cautions you against using needlessly inflated words that bloat your prose and open you to criticism from your readers.
==='''Guideline 5: Choose Words with Appropriate Associations'''===

The three previous guidelines for choosing words relate to the literal or dictionary meaning of words. At work, you must also consider the associates your words have for your readers. In particular, be especially sensitive to your words' ''connotation'' and ''register''.

Connotation

Connotation is the extended or suggested meaning that a words has beyond its literal meaning. For example, according to the dictionary, ''flatfoot'' and ''police detective'' are synonyms, but the connote very different things: ''flatfoot'' suggests a plodding, perhaps not very bright cop, while ''police detective'' suggests a trained professional.

Verbs, too, have connotations. For instance, to ''suggest'' that someone has overlooked a key fact is not the same as to ''insinuate'' that she has. To ''devote'' your time to working on a client's project is not the same as to ''spend'' your time on it.

The connotations of your words can shape your audience's perceptions of your subject matter. 

'''First version''': Our sales team is constantly trying to locate new markets for our various product lines.

In the second version of this sentence, the researchers replaced the flexible word by trying with the stiff word driving.

'''Second version''': Our sales team is constantly driving to locate new markets for our various product lines.

The researchers found that people who read the flexible version believed that the company would actively commit itself to the welfare and concerns of its employees, voluntarily participate in affirmative action programs for women and minorities, receive relatively few labor grievances, and pay its employees well. People who read that version also said they would recommend the company to a friend as a place to work. People who read the stiff version reported opposite impressions of the company. That readers' impressions of the company could be affected so dramatically by just seven non substantive words highlights the great importance of paying attention to the connotations of the words you use.

Register

Linguists use the term ''register'' to identify a second characteristic exhibited by words: their association with certain kinds of communication situations or context. For example, in an ad for a restaurant we might expect to see the claim that it offers ''amazingly'' delicious food. However, we would not expect to see a research company boast in a proposal for a government contract that it is capable of conducting ''amazingly'' good studies. The word ''amazingly'' is in the register of consumer advertising but not in the register of research proposals.

If you inadvertently choose words with the wrong ''register'', your readers may infer that your don't fully grasp how business is conducted in your field, and your credibility can be lost.

==='''Guideline 6: Global Guideline: Consider your Readers' Cultural Background when Choosing Words'''===

Take special care in your choice of words when writing to readers in other cultures. Some words whose meaning is obvious in your own culture can be misunderstood or completely mystifying to readers from other cultures. This is true whether your communication will go to your readers in English or whether it will be translated for them. In fact, misunderstanding can even occur when you are writing to readers in other cultures where the native language is English. In the United States, people play football with an oblong object which they try to carry over a goal line or kick through uprights. In England, India, and many other parts of the world, football is played with a round object that people are forbidden to carry and attempt to kick into a net.

The following guidelines will help you choose words your readers will understand in the way you intend. Of course, different readers in other cultures have different levels of facility with English, so follow the guidelines only to the extent that your readers require.

'''Guidelines for Choosing Words for Intercultural Communications:'''

1.) '''Use simple words'''. The more complex your vocabulary, the more difficult it will be for readers not fluent in English to understand you.

2.) '''Use the same word each time you refer to the same thing'''. For instance, in instructions, don't use both &quot;dial&quot; and &quot;control&quot; for the part of a text instrument. In context, those two terms may be synonyms in your language, but they will each be translated into a different word in the other language, where the translated words may not be synonyms.

3.) '''Avoid acronyms your readers won't understand'''. Most acronyms that are familiar to you will be based on words in your language: AI for Artificial Intelligence; ACL for anterior Cruciate Ligament.

4.) '''Avoid slang words and idioms'''. Most will have not meaning for people in other cultures. Instead of &quot;We want a level playing field,&quot; say &quot;We want the decision to be made fairly.&quot; Instead of saying &quot;We want to run an idea pat you,&quot; say &quot;We'd like your opinion of our idea.&quot;

Even if you follow these guidelines, it's best always to ask someone familiar with that culture to review the words you've chosen. Doing so can also help you avoid another type of problem caused by words in your language that sound like words in another language but can have a completely different meaning. 

==='''Guideline 7: Ethics Guideline: Use Inclusive Language'''===

When constructing your voice, use language that includes all persons instead of excluding some. For example, avoid sexist language because it supports negative stereotypes. Usually, these stereotypes are about women, but they can also adversely affect men in certain professions, such as nursing. By supporting negative stereotypes, sexist language can blind readers to the abilities, accomplishments, and potential of very capable people. The same is true of language that insensitively describes people with disabilities, illnesses, and other limitations.

'''Using Inclusive Language'''

1.)Use nouns and pronouns that are gender-neutral rather than ones containing the word ''man''.

'''Instead of''': businessman, workman, mailman, salesman

'''Use''': businessperson, manager, or executive; worker, mail carrier; sales person

'''Instead of''': man made, man hours, man-sized job

'''Use''': synthetic, working hours, large job

2.) Use plural pronouns or he or she instead of sex-linked pronouns when referring to people in general.

'''Instead of''': &quot;Our home electronics cater to the affluent shopper. She looks for premium products and appreciates a stylish design.&quot;

'''Use''': &quot;Our home electronics cater to the affluent shopper. They look for premium products and appreciate a stylish design.&quot;

'''Instead of''': &quot;Before the owner of a new business files the first year's tax returns, he might be wise to seek advice from a certified public accountant.&quot;

'''Use''': &quot;Before the owner of a new business files the first year's tax returns, he or she might be wise to seek advice from a certified public accountant.&quot;

3.) refer to individual men and women in a parallel manner.

'''Instead of''': &quot;Mr. Sundquist and Anna represented us at the trade fair.&quot;

'''Use''': &quot;Mr. Sundquist and Ms. Tokagawa represented us at the trade fair&quot; or &quot;Christopher and Anna represented us at the trade fair.&quot;

4.) Revise salutations that imply the reader of a letter is a man.

'''Instead of''': Dear Sir, Gentlemen

'''Use''': The title of the department or company or the job title of the person you are addressing: Dear Personnel Department, Dear Switzer Plastics Corporation, Dear Director of Research

5.) When writing about people with disabilities, refer to the person first, then the disability.

'''Instead of''': the disabled, mentally retarded people

'''Use''': people with disabilities, people with mental retardation


== What about ''Miss, Mrs., and Ms.''? ==

People are unsure whether or not to use the more traditional terms of ''Miss'' or ''Mrs.'' or use the newer term ''Ms.''  On one hand, people believe that using the former terms suggests that a woman's marital status is somehow relevant to her ability to perform her job.  After all, they point out, all men, whether married or single, are addressed as ''Mr''. On the other hand, some women prefer to be addressed as either ''Mrs.'' or ''Miss.''  If you know an individual's preference, make sure to follow it.  If you do not know the individual's preference, however, use the more modern term of ''Ms.'', which has now been accepted as the nonsexist term in the workplace.



----

=Conclusion=

Making sure you solidify your writing style matters a great deal in successful, technical and professional writing.  The most pertinent aspects to be mindful of include the aforementioned: your voice, sentence structure and your word selection choices.  The more you are attentive to these good practices of writing, the more you will connect with your readers and better persuade them to take your writing seriously.

{{wikipedia|Daiquiri}}
The '''daiquiri''' is a classic rum [[Bartending/Cocktails|cocktail]], consisting of white rum, lime juice, and sugar or syrup; it is a basic rum sour. It is particularly associated with Cuba and with [[w:Ernest Hemingway|Ernest Hemingway]].

Classically it is a simple drink (a rum sour), served in a cocktail glass; it also exists in numerous variations, and is often blended with fruit and ice to make fruit daiquiris.

== Recipes ==
IBA standard (9:4:1):
* 45 ml (9 parts) white rum
* 20 ml (4 parts) lime juice
*  5 ml (1 part) [[w:gomme syrup|gomme syrup]]

''[[w:The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks|The Fine Art of Mixing Drinks]]'' (8:2:1):
* 8 parts white Cuban rum
* 2 parts lime juice
* 1 part [[w:simple syrup|simple syrup]]
The 8:2:1 ratio was the author [[w:David A. Embury|David A. Embury’s]] preferred ratio for sour-type cocktails.

== Variants ==
Daiquirí Natural is the basic mix, that serves as the starting point to the more complex cocktails of the family: 1.3 oz (40&amp;nbsp;mL) light-dry rum, 0.7 oz (20&amp;nbsp;mL) lime juice, 1 teaspoon (5&amp;nbsp;mL) sugar, crushed ice. Mix the ingredients in a shaker and serve.

Daiquiri Floridita is the most common and famous version of this cocktail, allegedly it was invented by Constantino Ribalaigua Vert, barman and owner of the Floridita in the 1950s, whom Ernest Hemingway nicknamed El grande Constante. This recipe is also known as Daiquirí Frappé:  1.5 oz (45&amp;nbsp;mL) light-dry rum, the juice of 1 lime, 1 tsp (5&amp;nbsp;mL) sugar, crushed ice, 10 drops of maraschino liqueur. Mix all the ingredients in a blender until the ice is finely crushed and serve iced.

Papa's is the version of the cocktail that Hemingway allegedly preferred (Papa is the nickname that fishermen gave Hemingway in Cuba), is identical to the Floridita Daiquiri, it only substitutes lime juice with grapefruit juice. It is said that Hemingway drank this cocktail with no sugar and doubled the rum.

Mulata is the same cocktail as the Floridita Daiquiri, but instead of light-dry rum (which is colourless) it requires aged rum, which gives the cocktail an amber colour. 

== Fruit daiquiris ==
Daiquiris are commonly blended with crushed ice and fruit to make party drinks, or rather, a rum-based blended ice and fruit drink is conventionally called a fruit daiquiri; this is analogous to tequila-based blended ice and fruit drinks being conventionally called fruit margaritas. Examples include the banana daiquiri and strawberry daiquiri.

Virgin (no alcohol) fruit drinks are often referred to as “virgin fruit daiquiris”, as in the [[Bartending/Cocktails/Virgin Strawberry Daiquiri|virgin strawberry daiquiri]].

=== Strawberry Daiquiri ===
* 1/2 oz (15&amp;nbsp;mL) strawberry schnapps,
* 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) light rum,
* 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) lime juice,
* 1 tsp (5&amp;nbsp;mL) powdered sugar,
* 1 oz (30&amp;nbsp;mL) strawberries,
* crushed ice.
Mix all the ingredients in a blender until the ice is finely crushed and serve iced.

==Intercepts==
To find where the equation of a line crosses the X or Y axis, you don't need much information.  In this section we will look at how to find the where the line crosses the axes using the standard form for the linear equation.  After we look at how slope works we will see we can convert between the various types of linear equations into the standard form.

==X and Y axis intercepts==

An axis intercept point is a point where the graph of a function, relation, or equation intersects the X or Y axes.  This section is about finding out how a particular set of functions: linear functions cross the axes.  

We know that the domains of most lines are infinite because they are defined at every value of X.  The exception is lines that are defined as &lt;math&gt;X=c&lt;/math&gt; where c is a number we choose when we write the function.  By definition this line is only defined for one value of X. Since the domain maps onto more than one value for the range this is actually a relationship and not a function.  We've seen the graph of this relationships is a vertical line that passes through the point (c,Y).  In the picture below we show that when c=0 then our line is the same as the Y axis.  When &lt;math&gt; c \ne 0 &lt;/math&gt; (as in the drawing where X = 3) then the line can never intercept the Y axis.  

{{todo|Need graphs showing x=0 and x=3}}

Lines with the equation X=C intersect the X axis once and the Y axis 0 or infinite times.

We can also restrict the range of a function by simply writing &lt;math&gt;Y=c&lt;/math&gt; where c is again any number we choose. The graph of this line is a horizontal line that passes through the point (X,c).  When Y=o this line is the same as the X axis.  when &lt;math&gt;c \ne 0 &lt;/math&gt; (as in the drawing where Y = 3)then the line can never intercept the X axis.

{{todo|Need graphs showing y=0 and y=3}}

Lines with the equation Y=C intersect the Y axis once and the X axis 0 or infinite times.

When looking at Cartesian graphs and linear equations we run into a mathematical axiom: &quot;Two points determine a line.&quot;.  We will see how this axiom affects the slope-intercept definition of a line &lt;math&gt;y= f(x) = m x + b&lt;/math&gt; in the next section.  When two lines intersect they intersect at a point.  If a line is not horizontal or perpendicular it will have to intersect the X and Y axes once, but only once.  


In this book we are going to accept the [[w:Parallel_postulate|statement]] &quot;At most one line can be drawn through any point not on a given line parallel to the given line in a plane.&quot;  There is a branch of mathematics called &quot;non-euclidean geometry&quot; that was founded a little more than 160 years ago.  Even if you are not interested in mathematics it is worth looking at this Wikipedia article on [[w:Geometry|''geometry'']] to get a feel for how formalizing geometry with algebraic methods and then moving beyond them has changed civilization. If you continue in a career requiring advanced mathematics such as Engineering or Physics you might want to follow your interests to see the effect of non-euclidean geometry in your career.  


We've seen that for the equation Y=mX + b the Y intercept will always be at b because that is where X=0.

Using Algebra we can subtract b from both sides:
Y - b = mX

and multiply by &lt;math&gt;\frac {1}{m}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt; \frac {Y}{m} - \frac {b}{m} = X&lt;/math&gt;

we can see that the X intercept is going to be &lt;math&gt;-\frac{b}{m}&lt;/math&gt;.


An axis intercept may simply refer to the number value on the axis where the intersection occurs.  For brevity we may say the line has an X intercept of 1 and a Y intercept of 2.  After graphing just a few lines you will be able to tell this line points down and runs through quadrants II, I, and IV.  With a little more practice you will be able to know that the equation for the line is Y=-2x + 2. We will see that by specifying the two points we are actually implying the slope of the line.  There is an exception to this rule.  If we say a line crosses the axes at 0 we know that the line will pass through 2 quadrants instead of 3, but we won't know which quadrants or how steep the line is.  When we look at slope in the next section we will see why the equations above specify a point and a slope.


When you are trying to graph a linear equation finding the axes intercepts is often the easiest way to go about doing it.  To find the x-intercept, set y = 0 and solve for x.  To find the y-intercept, set x = 0 and solve for y.  For most examples the intercepts are different points, and a line can be drawn through the two intercepts. If both intercepts are (0,0), then another point must be determined to graph the line. If the equations is in the form x = c or y = c, the horizontal or vertical lines are very simple to plot.


{{todo|Need example graphs showing lines}}


{{todo|Need problems}}

==Example==

* &lt;math&gt;Y = 5 \times x + 2&lt;/math&gt;

Original equation


* &lt;math&gt;Y = 5 \times 0 + 2&lt;/math&gt;

Substitute zero for x


* &lt;math&gt;Y = 2&lt;/math&gt;

Solution

Therefore, the Y-Intercept of Y = 5x + 2 is 2.

This works for any form of equation.

{{closed|Closed as [[File:Symbol keep vote.svg|15px]] '''Keep''' Consensus overwhelmingly towards keeping. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 17:26, 13 December 2009 (UTC)}}
Beside others, I am the main contributer. Meanwhile, I see 2 major problems with this book. First, I think that its shear existance discourages the creation of a Mandarin Chinese Grammar handbook (which I find way more desirable for this Wiki project than a book that caters only to the users of a particular learning program). Second, there might occur copyright problems due to the commercial nature of the learning program. Please, delete.

An abandoned stub with suspect title and almost no content. --[[User:Dan Polansky|Dan Polansky]] ([[User talk:Dan Polansky|talk]]) 20:50, 17 September 2009 (UTC)
:If this goes, then probably the entire Conworld (Constructed World) project should go... but despite the silly name, I see this as being somewhat useful: SF writers must routinely generate worlds, and if there is any real content in this series it could be useful in that endeavor. '''Tentative''' {{keep}} [[User:Chazz|Chazz]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Chazz|talk]])&lt;/small&gt; 20:56, 17 September 2009 (UTC)

:[[Image:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comments''' both on the series as a whole, and on that particular book:
:* All but one of the series are, I believe, abandoned in the sense of having no regular contributors &amp;mdash; the exception being [[Conlang]], which is also more developed than the rest of the series put together.  (I'd have noticed regular contributors to the others, since they're all on my watchlist.)
:* Even after that one is excepted, all the books in this series are not equally deletable.  Being abandoned is, yet again, not in itself grounds for deletion.  The (or at least ''a'') relevant question is whether, if someone wanted to pick up one of these topics, the existing content would be helpful to them.  As I recall, some of them do have some worthwhile substance &amp;mdash; I have in mind [[Conworld]] and [[Conplanet]], especially, with perhaps [[Conreligion]] coming in third on that score (but to make that call with confidence I'd have to go back over the whole set).
:* The words ''conlang'' and ''conworld'' are pretty standard, but ''conphilosophy'', ''conreligion'', and even ''conplanet'' are less widely recognizable unless one happens to already be in the context of a discussion of conlangs or conworlds.  (''Conplanet'' is probably the third most standard, though.)
:* If some of the more obscure and underdeveloped books in the series are seen here as a problem, they might be moved under the aegis of [[Conworld]].  If this were done to any of them, Conphilosophy would definitely be one such.  (At the other end of the spectrum, [[Conlang]] is definitely standalone.)
:--[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 22:02, 17 September 2009 (UTC)

:[[File:Symbol comment vote.svg|15px]] '''Comment''': [[Conmap]] has the same amount of content as this book and [[Consociety]] has even less.  It's too bad that they aren't more developed, as it will create inconsistency to have some be under Conworld and some be standalone if these two or the one in question above face a serious threat of deletion. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 20:50, 5 October 2009 (UTC)
*'''Keep'''. A part of a legitimate series, the con- books. A neutral book can be written on this, and it's based on what has already been established in the study of philosophies, so it's not original research.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Metabolic Pathways =
The living systems are highly ordered and utilize enerygy. This energy is not created by the living system. It is instead, obtain from the environment, and then processed into usable forms. 
[[Structural Biochemistry/Metabolism|Metabolism]] is a series of chemical reactions beginning with a particular molecule and converting it into another molecule or molecules. It has many defined pathways in the cells which are interdependent and their activity is coordinated very sensitively by means of communication in which [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Allosteric Enzymes|allosteric enzymes]] are predominant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Berg | first = Jeremy | authorlink = | coauthors = John L. Tymoczko, Lubert Stryer | title = Biochemistry, 6th Edition | publisher = Sara Tenney | year = 2007 | location = New York, New York | pages =410–411 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-7167-8724-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The overview of the process is that through photosynthesis, carbon dioxide and water, with the help of light, is converted into organic molecules, or food in our sense. Through cellular respiration, the organic molecules are converted back into carbon dioxide and water. Metabolism is the total chemical reaction occuring in the body, and it involves molecular interaction. It is highly regulated and yields a change in energy content of the reactants. The metabolic pathways is a series of reaction controlled by multiple enzymes. 

= Energy Transformation =
Organisms transform energy, and energy is the capacity to do work. There are kinetic energies and potential energy. Kinetic energy is the energy of motion, it can be used to perform work. Examples of kinetic energy are light, heat, and electricity. Potential energy is stored energy. An example is electrochemical gradients. Light can be transformed into chemical bonds. Chemical bonds can be transformed to be used for mechanical work. Energy transformation must follow the two thermodynamic laws. The first law -conservation of energy - is that energy can neither be created or destroyed; it can only change forms. The Universe has a constant form of energy. The second law of that energy transformation yields an increase in the entropy of the universe. Entropy is a measure of disorder. But this is referring to the a closed system, one in which matter is isolated from the surrounding. So as long as the entropy of the system and surrounding increases, entropy of the system itself may decrease.

==Classes==
===Catabolic Reactions===
[[Structural Biochemistry/Catabolism|Catabolic Reactions]] are metabolic pathways in which reactions convert energy from fuels into biologically useful forms.

===Anabolic Reactions===
[[Structural Biochemistry/Anabolism|Anabolic Reactions]] are metabolic pathways in which reactions require energy to proceed.

===Amphibolic Reactions===
Amphibolic reactions are metabolic pathways that involves both catabolic and anabolic reactions.

==Unifying Themes==
===Activated Carriers===
ATP is an acivated carrier of phosphoryl groups because phosphoryl transfer from ATP is an [[Structural Biochemistry/Exergonic reaction|exergonic process]]. The use of activated carriers is a motif in biochemistry and most function as coenzymes:

1. Activated Carriers of Electrons for Fuel Oxidation. In aerobic organisms electrons are not transferred directly to O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; despite being the ultimate electron acceptor. Rather, fuel molecules transfer electrons to special carriers which are either pyridine nucleotides or flavens. The reduced form of these carriers then transfer their high-potential electrons to O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. 

2. Activated Carrier of Electrons for Reductive Biosynthesis. High potential electrons are required in most biosynthese because the precursors are more oxidized then the products. Hence, reducing power is needed in addition to ATP.  

3. An Activated Carrier of Two-Carbon Fragments. Coenzyme A, another central molecule in metabolism is a carrier of acyl groups. Acyl groups are important constituents in both [[Structural Biochemistry/Catabolism|catabolism]], and [[Structural Biochemistry/Anabolism|anabolism]]. The terminal sulfhydryl group of CoA is the reactive sites. Acyl groups are linked to CoA by thioester bonds resulting derivative called acyl CoA. The hydrolysis of thioester is thermodynamically favorable that that of an oxygen ester because the electrons of C=O cannot form resonance structures with C - bonds, making acetyl CoA have a high acetyl-group transfer potential because transfer of acyl group is exergonic. Acetyl CoA carries an activated acetyl group, just as ATP carries an activated phosphoryl group. 
 [[Image:Acetyl-CoA.svg‎]]
[http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Acetyl-CoA.svg] Aceyl-CoA

Use of activated carriers illustrates that Kinetic stability of these molecules in the absence of specific catalysts is essential for their biological function because it enables [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme|enzymes]] to control the flow of [[Structural Biochemistry/Free energy|free energy]] and reducing powers. Secondly most intercharges of activated groups in metabolisms are accomplished by rather small set of carriers such as ATP, NADH and NADPH.

====Vitamins====
Almost all activated carriers that act as conezymes are derived from [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemistry of important organic molecules in Biochemistry/Vitamins and Cofactors|vitamins]]. Vitamins are organic molecules that are needed in small amounts in the diets of some animals. They play the same roles in nearly all forms of life, but higher animals have lost the capacity to synthesize the in the course of evolutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Berg | first = Jeremy | authorlink = | coauthors = John L.

===Reiteration in Metabolism===
Six fundamental reaction types that are the basis of metabolism: 

1. Oxidation-reduction reactions are essential components of pathways. Useful energy is derived from the oxidation of carbon compounds. 

2. Ligation reactions form bonds by using free energy from ATP cleavage

3. Isomerization reactions rearrange particular atoms within a molecule. 

4. Group-transfer reactions play a variety of roles.

5. Hydrolytic reactions cleave bonds by the addition of water. 

6. Functional groups may be added to double bonds to form single bonds or removed from single bonds to form double bonds.

&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Berg | first = Jeremy | authorlink = | coauthors = John L. Tymoczko, Lubert Stryer | title = Biochemistry, 6th Edition | publisher = Sara Tenney | year = 2007 | location = New York, New York | pages =425–427| url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-7167-8724-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regulation in Metabolism===
Metabolic reactions must be to rigorously related but at the same time must be flexible to adjust metabolic activity to constantly changing external environment cells. Metabolism are regulated through:

1. Controlling the Amounts of Enzyme. Amount of particular enzyme depends on both its rate of synthesis and its rate of degradation. 

2.Controlling Catalytic Activity. Catalytic activity of enzymes are controlled in several ways:
     (a.) reversible [[Structural Biochemistry/Protein function/Allosteric Regulation|allosteric control]]
     (b.) [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme Regulation/Feedback inhibition|feedback inhbition]]
     (c.) reversible covalent modification
     (d.) hormones coordinate metabolic relations between different tissues
     (e.) energy status of cell --&gt; energy charge 

3. Controlling the Accessibility of Substrate. Compartmentalization segregates opposed reactions and Controlling the flux of substrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Berg | first = Jeremy | authorlink = | coauthors = John L. Tymoczko, Lubert Stryer | title = Biochemistry, 6th Edition | publisher = Sara Tenney | year = 2007 | location = New York, New York | pages =428–429| url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-7167-8724-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Metabolism from RNA World==
The current thinking is that RNA was an early biomolecule that in an early RNA world would have served as a catalyst and information-storage. Activated carries such as ATP, NADH, FADH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and coenzyme A contain adenosine diphosphate units evolved from early RNA catalyst. Non-RNA units such as isoalloxazine ring may have been recruited to serve as efficient carriers of activated electrons and chemical units, which were functions not performed by RNA itself. Then when a more versatile proteins replaced RNA as the major catalytsts, the ribonucleotide coenzymes stayed essentially unchanged because they were already well suited to their metabolic roles. With the advent of protein enzymes, these important cofactors evolved as free molecules without losing adenosine diphosphate vestiage of their RNA-world ancestry explaining why molecules and motifs of metabolism are common to all forms of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Berg | first = Jeremy | authorlink = | coauthors = John L. Tymoczko, Lubert Stryer | title = Biochemistry, 6th Edition | publisher = Sara Tenney | year = 2007 | location = New York, New York | pages =429| url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-7167-8724-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=Thermodynamics of Pathways=
Thermodynamically unfavorable reactions can be driven by a thermodynamically unfavorable reaction when it is coupled. This is because a pathway must satisfy two criteria: (1.) the individual reactions must be specific and (2.) the entire set of reactions that constitute the pathway must be thermodynamically favored. A reaction that is specific will yield only one particular product or set of products from its reactants due to [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme Catalytic Mechanism/Restriction Enzyme#Specificity|enzyme specificity.]] 
Thermodynamics of metabolism is most readily approached in relation to [[Structural Biochemistry/Free energy|free energy]], which states that a reaction can occur spontaneously only if &lt;math&gt;\Delta G&lt;/math&gt; is negative. This is due to the formation of products C and D from subtrates A and B given by the formula
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta G = \Delta G^\circ + R T \ln Q [C][D]/[A][B] \,&lt;/math&gt;

Thus &lt;math&gt;\Delta G&lt;/math&gt; depends on the nature of the reactants and their concentrations, which leads to thermodynamically fact that overall free-energy change for a chemically coupled series of reactions is equal to the free-energy changes of the individual steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Berg | first = Jeremy | authorlink = | coauthors = John L. Tymoczko, Lubert Stryer | title = Biochemistry, 6th Edition | publisher = Sara Tenney | year = 2007 | location = New York, New York | pages =410–411 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-7167-8724-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">The Greatest common Factor (GCF) of two whole numbers is the highest number that can be divided by both of the original numbers to get a whole number result.

==Finding the GCF of a number==
#Write down to prime factorization of the two numbers.
#Find prime factors that are the same.
#Multiply the same prime factors together for the GCF.

===Example===
#&lt;math&gt;28 = 2 \times 2 \times 7&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;98 = 2 \times 7 \times 7&lt;/math&gt;
#Notice that two and seven are used in both the equations?
#&lt;math&gt;2 \times 7 = 14&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Therefore, the GCF of 28 and 98 is 14.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) is a nucleotide that consists of an adenosine and a ribose linked to three sequential phosphoryl (-PO32-) groups via a phosphoester bond and two phosphoanhydride bonds. ATP is the most abundant nucleotide in the cell and the primary cellular energy currency in all life forms. The primary biological importance of ATP rests in the large amount of free energy released during its hydrolysis. This provides energy for other cellular work, such as biosynthetic reactions, active transport, and cell movement. ATP is used in cellular metabolism in plants. It involved with light to create energy for plant. Besides, ATP is also one of components of DNA. 

==Definition==
[[File:Adenosintriphosphat protoniert.svg|thumb|right|Chemical structure of ATP]]
'''[[Structural Biochemistry/ATP/ATP/ATP|ATP]]''' also known as adenosine 5'-triphosphate. It is formed from adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and orthosphosphate (P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;). When fuel molecules are oxidized in chemotrophs or when light is trapped by phototrophs. This nucleotide is tremendously important since it is the most commonly used energy currency. The energy is released from the cleave of the triphosphate group is used to power many cellular processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Berg | first = Jeremy | authorlink = | coauthors = John L. Tymoczko, Lubert Stryer | title = Biochemistry, 6th Edition | publisher = Sara Tenney | year = 2007 | location = New York, New York | pages =110–111 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-7167-8724-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physical and Chemical Properties of ATP ==

ATP consists of '''adenosine''' and is composed of an adenine ring, ribose sugar, and three phosphate groups (triphosphate). The groups of the phosphate group are usually called as the alpha (α), beta (β), and gamma (γ) phosphates. It is typically related to a monomer of RNA called adenosine nucleotide. Gamma phosphate group is the primary phosphate group on the ATP molecules that is hydrolyzed when the energy is needed to drive anabolic reactions. Basically gamma phosphate is typically located the farthest from the ribose sugar and has a higher energy of hydrolysis than either that of the alpha and beta phosphate. The bonds that are formed after hydrolysis or the phosphorylation of a residue by ATP are lower in energy than that of the phosphoanhydride bonds of ATP. 

ATP is very soluble in water and is a quite stable solution that has a pH of 6.8-7.4, but is rapidly hydrolysed at extreme pH. Thus, ATP is best stored as an anhydrous salt. 

Although, ATP is quite stable in solution, it is an unstable molecule in unbuffered water. This is because, once ATP gets in contact with unbuffered water, it hydrolyses to ADP and phosphate due to the strength of the bonds between the phosphate groups in ATP is commonly seen to be less than the strength of the hydrogen bonds (hydration bonds) between its products (ADP + phosphate) and water. Therefore, if ATP and ADP are in chemical equilibrium in water, almost all the ATP will form into ADP because of the reaction that will occur. Gibbs free energy is when a system is far from equilibrium and it is able to do some kind of work. It is seen that typical living cells maintain the ratio of ATP and ADP at a point ten orders of magnitude from equilibrium. However, this may only occur if ADP is thousand fold lower in concentration than that of ATP. This shows that hydrolysis of ATP in cells usually release a large amount of free energy in reaction. 

However, even with releasing a large amount of free energy during reaction, any unstable system of potentially reactive molecules could potentially serve as a way of storing free energy. This is only if the cells maintain their concentration far from the equilibrium point of the reaction. However, the idea of both energy-release and entropy-increase always occur during the breakdown of RNA, DNA, and ATP into simpler monomers. 

In an ATP molecule, two high-energy phosphate bonds called phsophoanhydride bonds are responsible for high energy content of this molecule. Based on biochemical reaction, these anhydride bonds are often referred to as high-energy bonds. Also the released of hydrolysis of the anhydride bonds can happen in the energy stored ATP.

==Binding to Proteins==
Rossmann fold is a type of protein fold that some proteins and ATP bind together as. This characteristic protein fold is a general nucleotide-binding structural domain that can also bind the coenzyme NAD. Kinase is the most common ATP-binding protein. They share a small number of common folds and there biggest kinase superfamily all share common structural features specialized for ATP binding and phosphate transfer. 

ATP also requires the presence of a divalent cation that is almost as magnesium as a metal used. This metal binds to the ATP phosphate groups. This metal ion can also serve as a mechanism for kinase regulation. The presence of magnesium greatly decreases the dissociation constant of ATP from its protein binding partner without even affecting the ability of the enzyme to catalyze its reaction once the ATP has bound.

==Intracellular ATP==
Intracellular ATP hydrolysis is catalyzed by intracellular ATPases. For example, the (Na+-K+)-ATPase located in the plasma membranes of higher eukaryotes drives active transport of Na+ and K+ coupled to ATP hydrolysis, and generates electrochemical gradients across the cell membrane. Another important intracellular ATPase is myosin. The myosin heads form the cross-bridges to thin filaments in intact myofibrils and its ATP-powered movement is responsible for muscle contraction.

==Extracellular ATP==


ATP is also present in extracellular spaces in nanomolar to micromolar concentrations, which are 3-6 orders of magnitude lower than intracellular ATP concentration (1, 2). ATP is released from cells to extracellular spaces by regulated exocytosis or plasma membrane channels (Figure 1). Regulated exocytosis is an important process used to release substances such as hormones or neurotransmitters from the cell and is triggered by an increase in cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration (2, 3). ATP efflux also occurs through plasma membrane conductance channels, transporters, or constitutive secretory pathways as residual cargo products (2). Extracellular ATP acts as a neurotransmitter and an autocrine/paracrine chemical messenger in non-neural tissues. Its effects are mediated by the P2 purinergic receptors and elicit a variety of physiological responses, such as neurotransmission, regulation of secretion, modulation of immune functions, pain transmission, apoptosis etc.

P2 receptors consist of two major subfamilies, P2X and P2Y. P2X receptors are ligand-gated ion channels and P2Y receptors are G protein-coupled receptors. The concentration of extracellular ATP is regulated by its hydrolysis that is catalyzed by extracellular ATPases. Thus the physiological responses mediated by the purinergic receptors are modulated by extracellular ATPases (Figure 2). For example, Sesti et al. reported that ATP modulates norepinephrine release from cardiac sympathetic nerve endings and this action of ATP is controlled by purinergic receptors in cardiac synaptosomes and modulated by extracellular ATPases (4). Di Virgilio et al. reported that a potent platelet aggregating factor is ADP and its amount is regulated by the activity of extracellular ATPases on endothelial cells (5). However, the precise relationship of multiple P2X and P2Y receptor subtypes to extracellular ATPases remains to be determined.

==Exergonic Reaction==
The role of ATP is an energy-rich molecule because its triphosphate unit contains two phosphoanhydride bonds. Large amounts of [[Structural Biochemistry/Free energy|free energy]] is liberated when ATP is hydrolyzed to adenosine diphosphate (ADP) and orthosphosphate (P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;) or when ATP is hydrolyzed to adenosine monophosphate (AMP) and pyrophosphate (PP&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;). The precise &lt;math&gt;\Delta G^\circ&lt;/math&gt; for these reactions depend on [[Structural Biochemistry/Chemical Bonding/Ionic interaction|ionic]] strength of the metal such as Mg &lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;. The free energy is liberated in hydrolysis of ATP is harnessed to drive reactions that require an input of energy for muscle contraction. The formation of ATP from ADP and P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; is known as the ATP-ADP cycle is the fundamental mode of energy exchange in biological systems. It is intriguing to note that although, all nucleotide triphosphates are energetically equivalent, ATP is the primary cellular energy carrier. Under cellular conditions, the hydrolysis of ATP shifts the equilibrium of a coupled reaction by a factor of 10&lt;sup&gt;8&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Berg | first = Jeremy | authorlink = | coauthors = John L. Tymoczko, Lubert Stryer | title = Biochemistry, 6th Edition | publisher = Sara Tenney | year = 2007 | location = New York, New York | pages =413–415 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-7167-8724-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phosphoryl Potential ==
ATP has a particularly efficient phosphoryl-group donor that can best be explained by features of the ATP structure:

'''Resonance Structures'''. ADP and P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; have greater resonance stabilization than does ATP. Orthophosphate has multiple resonance forms of similar energy whereas the &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; phosphoryl group of ATP has a smaller number due to its unfavorability of the positively charged oxygen atom that is adjacent to a positively charged phosphorus atom.

'''Electrostatic Repulsion'''. At pH 7, triphosphate unit of ATP carries four negative charges which repel one another due to their close proximity. The repulsion between them is reduced when ATP is hydrolyzed. 

'''Stabilization Due to Hydration'''. More water can bind effectively to ADP and P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; than can bind to the phosphoanhydride part of ATP, stabilizing the ADP and P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; by hydration.

==Comsumption of ATP==
The large amounts of energy provided by the hydrolysis of ATP are necessary to overcome the large free energy changes necessary to create the large macromolucule proteins.  The cleavagle of the phosphoanhydride bonds in ATP provides the source for free energy to make biological reactions spontaneous (negative free energy).  Because the amount of entropy of the universe is continually increasing it is unfavorable for large macromolecules to form without the use of ATP.  Because of this, the free energy generated by the ATP is always immediately consumed by nearby endergonic (energy-reguiring) biological reactions.  The exergonic reaction of the ATP is only able to proceed if it is coupled to an endergonic reaction, otherwise thermodynamic equilibrium would not be obtained.  The consumption of ATP proceeds with the first step of having an enzyme attache an amino acid to the a-phosphate of ATP.  This results in the release of a pyrophosphate. This release is called an aminoacyl-adenylate intermediate.  The reaction then proceeds to the enzyme catalyzing transfer of an amino acid to one of two -OH locations on the ribose portion of the adenosine residue.  ATP is able to release energy into cells because cells maintain a concentration of ATP that is far higher above the equilibrium conentrations.  The high concentration of ATP allows it to be the main provider of driving endergonic reactions in cells.  This coupling of energy releasing and consuming systems through a common intermediate is vital to energy exchange in living systems.

=Importance of Oxidation of Carbon=
==Formation of ATP==
ATP is a principal immediate donor of free energy in biological systems meaning that it is consumed within a minute of it formation. The carbon in fuel molecules such as [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/Sugars|glucose]] and [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids|fats]] are oxidized to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the energy released is used to regenerate ATP from ADP and P&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. Oxidation in fuel takes place one carbon at a time and the carbon-oxidation energy is used in some cases to create compounds with high phosphoryl-transfer potential and other cases to create ion gradient as well with the end formation of ATP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Berg | first = Jeremy | authorlink = | coauthors = John L. Tymoczko, Lubert Stryer | title = Biochemistry, 6th Edition | publisher = Sara Tenney | year = 2007 | location = New York, New York | pages =417 | url = | doi = | id = | isbn = 978-0-7167-8724-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Coupling with Carbon Fuels==
ATP is coupled with oxidation of carbon fuels directly and through the formation of ion gradients. Energy of oxidation is initially trapped as high-phosphoryl-transfer potential compound and then used to form ATP.  In ion gradients the electrochemical potential, produced by oxidation of fuel molecules or by photosynthesis, which ultimately powers the synthesis of most ATP in cells. ATP hydrolysis can be used to form ion gradients of different types and functions.

==Energy from Food==
Described by Hans Krebs the three stages in generation of energy from oxidation of foodstuffs:

1. Large molecules in foods are broken down into smaller units in a process known as digestion. Proteins are hydrolyzed to their 20 different [[Structural Biochemistry/Proteins/Amino Acids|amino acids]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Carbohydrates/Polysaccharides|polysaccharides]] are hydrolyzed into simple [[Structural Biochemistry/Nucleic Acid/Sugars|sugars]] and lastly [[Structural Biochemistry/Lipids|fats]] are hydrolyzed to glycerol and fatty acids. 

2. Numerous small molecules are degraded to a few simple units that play a central role in metabolism. Sugars, fatty acids, glycerol and several amino acids are converted into the acetyl unit of acetyl CoA. Some ATP is generated but not a substantial amount.

3. ATP is produced from the complete oxidation of acetyl unit of acetyl CoA. Final stage consist of citric acid cycle and oxidative phosphorylation  which are the final pathways in oxidation of fuel molecules. Acetyl CoA brings acetyl units into the citric acid, where they are completely oxidized to CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Four pairs of electrons are transferred for each acetyl group that is oxidized. Then a proton gradient is generated as electron flows from the reduced forms of these carriers to O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and the gradient is used to synthesize ATP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Berg | first = Jeremy | authorlink = | coauthors = John L.

Setting up the Problem

'''[...]'''

If you're trying to come up with an algorithm, it's handy to step through the problem a piece at a time. The first thing we're going to do is copy the first pixel three times:
  	  	 
'''[I believe there should be something here]'''

We need to continue copying 3 pixels for every pixel in the source image until we hit the end of the row to properly scale the width of the image:
  	  	  	  	  	  	  	  	 
'''[I believe there should be something here]'''


Then we need to repeat this 3 times to properly scale the height of the image:

'''[I believe there should be something here]''' 


Which drawn on the screen looks like:

      <comment>/* Installing */ updated latest version information</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">{{book title|FreeMind}}

[http://freemind.sourceforge.net Freemind] is a program used to create [[w:Mind map|mind maps]]. Freemind is Free Open Source Software and is currently in version 0.9.0 RC6 on which this article will be based. 

This book aims to be an overview of how to use FreeMind and what features are available. I will describe how to access functions with keyboard shortcuts when I know of them because that way the program is useful for taking notes in class and is generally faster to work with. 

=== If you are running Linux or windows ===

Please note that keyboard shortcuts differ on different platforms. 
I am on an Apple MacBook which means I have a &lt;command&gt; key. Where-ever I write &lt;command&gt;, I believe you can substitute it for the &lt;ctrl&gt; key if you are running Linux or Windows.

=== Installing ===

To install FreeMind on your system you point your browser to their [http://freemind.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Download Download page], which currently will tell you that the latest version is 0.8.1*, and there you will find detailed installation instructions. At the bottom of the page you will find a link to the [http://sourceforge.net/projects/freemind/files/freemind-unstable|latest &quot;unstable&quot; version], which is what I will be using. If you decide on the older version, some functionality might differ or be missing.

*Update: Latest Stable Release shows as version 1.0.0

== Getting started ==

When the installation is done and you have started the program you are presented with the main view, containing an empty mind map. 

=== Terminology ===

The grey elliptical blob with &quot;New Mindmap&quot; on it is called the ''root'' node. It is the node from which all other nodes stem. An end node is called a ''leaf'' and a node with other nodes attached to it is called a ''branch''. Nodes you add to another node are called its ''children'' and the node having children added to it is called their ''parent''. A child of a node's parent is called a ''sibling''. ''Ancestor'' and ''descendant'', ''grandchild'' and ''grandparent'' are defined analogously. The line between two nodes is called an ''edge''.

Emulating this with a list will give an example:

* Root
** Branch
*** Leaf
*** Leaf
** Leaf
** Child of root
** Node1 
*** Child of Node1
**** Child of 'Child of Node1', descendant of Node1
** Parent of Node2, Node3 and Node4
*** Node2
*** Node3 (a sibling of Node2 and Node4)
*** Node4

These are all common terms used to talk about [[w:Tree structure|tree-like structures]] in science.

=== Basics ===

Clicking the root node will let you rename it. When you have typed a new name you press &lt;enter&gt; to confirm or &lt;escape&gt; to cancel. To add a new node you press &lt;tab&gt; or &lt;enter&gt; and type its name. When a node is selected its background is grey, and you can rename it by pressing F2 or just start typing.

To create a sibling node of the currently selected node, press &lt;enter&gt;. To create a child node, press &lt;tab&gt;. To navigate between nodes use the arrow keys. You can also select a key by placing the mouse cursor on top of it. (If this annoys you as much as it annoys me, you change this setting in the preferences: under ''Behaviour'' you change ''selection method'' from ''delay'' to ''by click''.)

=== Decoration ===

To change the appearance of nodes you can add icons, change their style and their colour and you can format their text if you like.

'''To add an icon''' to a node, you either just click one of the icons in the leftmost icon-list or you press &lt;alt&gt;+c to get an icon palette that you can navigate with the arrow keys or select from with the mouse. To remove an icon you press the red x in the icon list, and to remove all added icons you press the rubbish bin in that same list.

To '''change a node's style''' you have to right-click the node and choose ''Format'' and then either ''Fork'' (default) or ''Bubble'' (gives the node an outline). When you change the style of a node, all its descendants change as well (unless previously given an explicit style). This behaviour can be changed in the preferences though.

To '''change a node's colour''', you can either right-click it and choose ''Format''&amp;rarr;''Node Colour...'' or you can press &lt;shift&gt;&lt;alt&gt;+c. From the right-click pop-up–list you can also change the node background colour and its edge colour (&lt;shift&gt;&lt;alt&gt;+e).

To '''format the text of a node''' you press &lt;alt&gt;+&lt;enter&gt; to get a rich text editor to pop up. When you are satisfied you press &lt;alt&gt;+&lt;enter&gt; again. That means you can use &lt;enter&gt; to get line breaks in the text.

== Using FreeMind to take notes ==

After having learned the basic functionality you can now use FreeMind to take notes during a lecture. That means you can focus on contents and let the structure be apparent automatically. When the lecture is over you can spend a little time to format and restructure the notes into a powerful memory aid.

=== An example ===

Suppose we are attending a lecture on using FreeMind.

The lecturer starts by explaining the terminology used: node, root, parent, child etc.; and then he groups them into three different metaphor systems, deriving from: trees, family relationships and geometry. After having listened to him talk about this you get this map:

(http://bayimg.com/image/aaibhaacb.jpg)

This is not optimally organised, you would rather have the nodes attached to their respective metaphor. So you drag them one at a time to the corresponding metaphor (or holding shift you can mark several and drag them all together).
This can also be achieved with the keyboard if you want. You navigate which node is selected by the arrow keys, and then hold &lt;command&gt; (on a mac,  probably &lt;ctrl&gt; on windows or linux) while using the arrow keys to move the selected node in the tree. &lt;Up&gt; and &lt;down&gt; work as expected and &lt;left&gt; and &lt;right&gt; as well, except you will want to notice that when moving nodes away from the root, it will select the sibling above itself as its new parent.


After having rearranged the nodes like this you can move the metaphor node's children up to the terminology node and then delete the metaphor node.

When you are pleased with the structure you can change the layout as well. To change the position of a node and its descendants you hover your mouse pointer where the edge form the parent comes in to see a small black oval. Click and drag it to move the node around.

(http://bayimg.com/image/daibaaacb.jpg)

Restructuring efforts like this are probably best made with the mouse. And if the lecture is high pace you might want to wait until the end with doing it.

When the lecture continues with keyboard shortcuts you continue taking notes. You select the root and press &lt;tab&gt; or &lt;enter&gt; to get a new child.
After taking some notes, and making use of icons now (&lt;alt&gt;+i, remember?) we get this sub-map:

(http://bayimg.com/image/eaibhaacb.jpg)

Then you spend some time formatting the map to aid memory better, maybe adding some small things you found on your own:

(http://bayimg.com/image/gaibiaacb.jpg)

In here you see examples of some features I have not covered. Let's go through them now:

;Hyper-links : makes a node link to a web page (but can also be used to link to a local file). For this, press &lt;command&gt;+K (or &lt;shift&gt;&lt;command&gt;+K for a local file). Here I have formatted one word in the node as underlined blue to make it obvious what the link will point to. A hyper-linked node is decorated with a red little arrow icon in front of it.
;Links : You create links between nodes simplest by dragging a node into another with the right mouse button, but you can also drag it normally and hold &lt;shift&gt; and &lt;alt&gt; when dropping. A third option is to mark two nodes and press &lt;ctrl&gt;+L. Right-clicking the created link or arrow will give you the option of deciding its direction (this way, that way, both ways or no arrow-head at all) and its colour. To change its path you click somewhere on the arrow and drag while holding. Start this action at different points of the link and notice the different effect. You will see a faint visualisation of the bezier control points while holding the mouse button, but unfortunately you do not seem to be able to manipulate them directly.
;Searching : Press &lt;command&gt;+F to search the current node and its children for a phrase. If you want to search the whole map, you press escape first to select the root node.
;Clouds : You can mark a whole sub-tree as a unit by enclosing it in a cloud, by pressing &lt;shift&gt;&lt;command&gt;+b. That will create a cloud around the currently selected node and all its descendants.

You can find all available functions by exploring the menus and they will tell you about the keyboard shortcuts too.

Free energy is needed to pump ions in a single direction across the membrane, and that free energy is provided by the interconversion between the tow conformational states.

      <comment>/* Beginning A Communication */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">=Beginning A Communication=
Reading is a dynamic interaction between your readers and your words and graphics. Your reader's response to one sentence or paragraph can influence their reactions to all the sentences and paragraphs that follow. Consequently, the opening sentence or section takes on a special importance. It helps to establish the frame of mind readers bring to all the sentences and sections that follow. It also grabs the viewer's attention and keeps them focused until the end. 

In the beginning, you will learn eight reader-centered strategies for beginning your communications in highly usable and highly persuasive ways. Rarely, if ever, will you use all eight at once. To decide to use one or a combination in a particular circumstance, you will need to build on the knowledge of your readers that you gained while defining your communication's objectives. The chapter's ninth guideline discusses ethical approaches to situations in which people at work sometimes wonder whether they should begin to try communicating at all.

The first three guidelines announce the topic, state the main point, and forecast your communication's organization.


'''Guideline 1: Give Your Readers A Reason To Pay Attention'''

The most important function of the beginning is to persuade your readers to devote their full attention to your message rather than skimming it or setting it aside unfinished. At work, people complain that they receive too many e-mails, memos, and reports. Your goal is to convince them not only to pay some attention to the message but to pay close attention. Doing so will be especially important when your communication is primarily persuasive. Research has shown that the more deeply people think about a message while reading or listening to it, the more likely they are to hold the attitudes it advocates, the more likely they are to resist attempts to reverse those attitudes, and the more likely they are to act upon those attitudes.

To grab your reader's attention you must do two things:

• Announce Your Topic

• Tell your readers how they will benefit from the information you are providing

Be sure to do both things. Don't assume that your readers will automatically see the value of your information after you have stated your topic. Benefits that appear obvious to you may not be obvious to them.

== Importance of Subject Lines ==

Subject lines are used to grab the readers attention, and are generally only a few words long. When writing a subject line, keep in mind the following:

• Keep it brief. The subject line is supposed to inform the reader about the content, not be the content

• Make it interesting. When people read your subject line, will they want to read more?

• Make sure it is on topic. The subject line is used to inform the reader of what is to come. 

E-mails present a special challenge. They have in effect two beginnings: the subject line and the first sentences of the email. Your intended reader won't read unless your subject line persuades them to open your message. Name your topic precisely and indicate that what you have to say about it will benefit your readers. Take advantage of subject lines in memos and letters as well.

==Two Ways to Highlight Reader Benefits==

Two strategies are particularly effective at persuading individuals who will overall benefit from reading your communication.


'''Refer to Your Reader's Request'''

At work, you will often write because a coworker, manager, or client has asked you for a recommendation or information. To establish the reader benefit of your reply, simply refer the request.

'''Offer to Help Your Readers Solve a Problem'''

The second strategy for highlighting reader benefits at the beginning of a communication is to tell your readers that your communication will help them solve a problem they are confronting. Most employees think of themselves as problem-solvers. Whether the problem involves technical, organizational, or ethical issues, the reader or individual will welcome communications that help them find a solution.

Communication experts J.C. Mathes and Dwight W. Stevenson have suggested an especially powerful approach.  The key is writing beginnings that builds on readers concerns by offering problem solving/time saving solutions. First, list problems that are important to the readers you are going to address. From the list, pick one problem that your information and ideas will provide the readers with solutions. When you've done that, you have begun to connect yourself and readers as partners in a joint problem-solving effort in which your communication plays a critical role. Once you have determined how to describe a problem-solving partnership between you and your readers, draft the beginning of your communication.

&lt;u&gt;Establishing a Problem-Solving Partnership with Your Readers&lt;/u&gt;

1. Tell your readers the problem you will help them solve. Be sure to identify a problem your readers deem important.

2. Tell your readers what you have done toward solving the problem. Review the steps you have taken as a specialist in your own field. For example, you may develop a new feature for one of your employer's products or your findings while investigating products offered by competition. Focus on building up on why your research or information will be significant to your readers rather than listing everything you've personally done to boast.

3. Tell your readers how your communication will help them perform their jobs more efficiently and how their contributions will further the problem-solving efforts of the joint cooperation.

&lt;u&gt;Here are some situations in which a full description of the problem-solving situation usually is desirable&lt;/u&gt;

• Your communication will be read by people outside your immediate working-group.
The more distant some or all of your readers are, the less likely that they will be familiar with your message's context.

• Your communication will have a binding and a cover.
Bound documents are usually intended for large group of current readers and they often filed for consultation by future readers. Both groups are likely to include at least some readers who will have no idea of the problem-solving situation you are addressing.

• Your communication will be used to make a decision involving a significant amount of money.
Such decisions are often by high-level managers who need to be told about the organizational context of the reports they read.

==Defining the Problem in Unsolicited Communications==

In your career, you will have many occasions to make a request or recommendation without being asked to do so. When writing these unsolicited communications, you may need to persuade your readers that a problem even exists. This can require some creative, reader centered thinking.

'''Guideline 2: State Your Main Point'''

You can usually boost your communication's usability and persuasiveness by stating your main point in your beginning. Three major reasons for doing so:

• You help your readers find what they most want or need

• You increase the likelihood that your readers will accurately read your main point instead of putting your communication aside before they get to it.

• You provide your readers with a context for viewing the details that follow

==Choose Your Main Point Thoughtfully==

Choose the main point of your communication in the same way you choose the main point of each segment. If you are responding to a request, your main point will be the answer to the question your reader asked. If you are writing on your own initiative, your main point might be what you want your readers to think or do after reading your communication. For example, if you need your boss to sign off on something, you might make your subject line &quot;Signature Required,&quot; and then explain what needs to be signed as the main point of your document. 

'''Guideline 3: Tell Your Readers What to Expect'''

Unless your communication is very short, its beginning should tell readers what to expect in the segments that follow.  A forecasting statement positioned at the beginning of a communication should focus its organization and scope. This will serve a couple of purposes. First, it will narrow the readers attention to only what needs to be addressed. Second, it will deter some of the readers who you are not intending to write for. This could help in avoiding lawsuits.

==Tell about Your Communication's Organization==

By telling your readers about your communication's organization in your beginning you provide them with a framework for understanding the connections among the various pieces of information you convey. This framework substantially increases your communication's usability by helping your readers to see immediately how each new point you make relates to point they have already read. It also helps skimming readers to navigate quickly to the information they are seeking.

==Tell about Your Communication's Scope==

Readers want to know from the beginning what a communication does and does not contain. Even if they are persuaded that you are addressing a subject relevant to them, they may still wonder whether you discuss the specific aspects of the subject they want to know about. Often you will tell your readers about the scope of your communication when you tell about its organizations: When you list the topics it addresses, you indicate its scope. There will be times however, when you will need to include additional information. That happens when you your to understand that you are not addressing your subject comprehensively or that you are addressing it from  a particular point of view. 

'''Guideline 4: Encourage Openness to Your Message'''

Other chapters in this book have emphasized that readers can respond in a variety of ways as they read a communication. When they read a set of instructions you have prepared, they can follow your directions in every detail or attempt the procedure on their own, consulting your instruction only if they get stumped. Because the way you begin a communication has a strong effect on your readers' response, you should always pay attention to the persuasive dimension of your beginnings. Always begin in a way that encourages your readers to be open and receptive to the rest of your communication.

==Readers' Initial Reactions Can Vary==

Ordinarily, you will have no trouble eliciting a receptive response because you will be communication with fellow employees, customers, and others who want the information you are providing. In certain circumstances, however, your readers may have more negative attitude toward your message. In such situations, you will need to take special care in drafting the beginning of your communication if you are to win a fair hearing for your message. Your readers' initial attitude toward your message will be negative if the answer to any of the following questions is &quot;yes&quot;. If that is the case, try to pinpoint the attitudes that are likely to shape your readers reactions to your communication, and then devise your beginning accordingly.

• Does your message contain bad news for your readers?

• Does your message contain ideas or recommendations that will be unwelcome to your readers?

• Do your readers feel distrust, resentment, or competitiveness toward you, your department, or your company?

• Are your readers likely to be skeptical of your subject or situation?

• Are your readers likely to be suspicious of motives?


The strategy that is most likely to promote a positive initial reaction or to counteract a negative one differs from situation to situation. However, these are the three strategies that often work.

&lt;u&gt;Strategies for Encouraging Openness&lt;/u&gt;

• Present yourself as a partner, not as a critic or a competitor. Suggest the you are working with your readers to help solve a problem they want to solve or to achieve a goal they want to achieve.

• Delay the presentation of your main point. An initial negative reaction may prompt your readers to aggressively devise counterarguments to each point that follows. Therefore, if you believe that your readers may react negatively to your main point in your beginning. If you delay the presentation of your main point, your readers may consider at least some of your other points objectively before discovering your main point and reacting against it.

• Establish your credibility. People are more likely to respond favorably to a message if they have confidence in the person delivering it. Consequently, you can promote openness to your message if you begin by convincing your readers that you are an expert in your subject and are knowledgeable about the situation. This does not mean, however, that you should announce your credentials, you merely burden your readers with unnecessary information. Avoid discussing your qualifications when writing to people, such as your coworkers, who have already formed a favorable opinion of your expertise.

• Ask for assistance. Most individuals are more receptive to new ideas when being asked for help. Even if you know everything about the situation, you might not be able to solve it on your own. In these situations it would be beneficial to ask the reader for help. This shows your reader that even if you know everything there is to know on the situation at hand, you don't know everything there is to know. When writing, it is often important not to come off as arrogant or snobbish. Sometimes we have to swallow our pride to get things done. Try to connect with people on the same level. Acting like you know more will invite more negative reaction.

==Tell Yourself A Story==

Although the strategies suggested will often encourage openness, don't employ them mechanically. Always keep in mind the particular attitudes, experience and expectations of your readers as you craft the beginning of a communication. You might do this by telling yourself a story about your readers. The central figure in your story should be your reader, an individual if you are writing to one person, or a typical member of your audience if you are writing to a group. Begin your story a few minutes before this person picks up your communication and continue it until the moment he or she reads your first words. Although you would not actually include the story in your communication, creating it can help you decide how to begin.

'''Guideline 5: Provide Necessary Background Information'''

As you draft the beginning of a communication, ask yourself whether your readers will need any background information to understand what you are going to tell them.

&lt;u&gt;Situations that might require information at the beginning&lt;u&gt;

• Your readers need to grasp certain general principles in order to understand your specific points.

• Your readers are unfamiliar with technical terms you will be using

• Your readers are unfamiliar with the situation that you are discussing

Not all background information belongs at the beginning of your communication. Information that pertains only to certain segments should appear at the beginning of those segments. In the beginning of your communication include only background information that will help your readers understand your overall message.

'''Guideline 6: Include a Summary Unless Your Communication is Very Short'''

Summaries help busy managers learn the main points without reading the entire document, and they give those readers an overview of the communication's content and organization. For longer communications, especially those that are longer enough to have covers and tables of contents, these summaries are longer and often printed on a separate page.

'''Guideline 7: Adjust the Length of Your Beginning to Your Readers' Needs'''

There is no rule of thumb that tells how long the beginning should be. A good, reader-centered beginning may require only a phrase or may take several pages. You need to give your readers only the information they don't already know.

&lt;u&gt;Readers Should Know the Following&lt;/u&gt;

- The reason they should read the communication

- The main point of the communication

- The organization and scope of the communication

- The background information they need in order to understand and use the communication

If you have given your readers all this information, and have encouraged them to receive your message openly, then you have written a good beginning, regardless of how long or short it is.

'''Guideline 8: Adapt your Beginning to your Readers' Cultural Background'''

Readers' expectations and preferences about the beginning of a communication are shaped by their culture. The suggestions your have just read are suitable for readers in the United States and some other Western countries. However, costume carries widely. You must have good understanding of the communication customs of your readers' culture in order to create an effective opening. If you do not have this understanding, do some research or seek out someone who is from that culture to ask them.

'''Guideline 9: Ethics Guideline: Begin to Address Unethical Practices Promptly and Strategically'''

Suppose you learn that your employer is engaged in an action you consider to be unethical. Or you are asked to write something that violates your sense of what is ethical. Should you speak up or express your concerns in writing? New employees are sometimes advised to wait until they have achieved security and status before trying to bring about change. But that means you could spend years before addressing a practice you regard as ethical. Ignoring an unethical act would be seen as unethical in itself. When determining how to draw attention to something you consider  to be ethical you face a challenge similar to that of figuring out how to begin a memo in which you will recommend a course of action with which you believe your readers will disagree.

&lt;u&gt;3 Strategies for Changing Unethical Practices without Risking Your Job&lt;/u&gt;

- Plant the seeds of change

- Use reason rather than accusation

- Remain open to others' view 


You may someday witness a practice that is so outrageous that you will be willing to risk future promotions and even your job in order to stop it. If you find yourself in that situation, seek the aid of influential people inside your company. If the practice you object to violates the law or a government regulation, alert the appropriate agency. This is called whistle blowing. There are some state and federal laws to protect whistle blowers.

==10 Questions to Ask Yourself==

As you plan your letters, e-mail, and other routine communications ask yourself the following:

# How well do I know this person?
# How much do they know about the topic discussed in the letter?
# How will they respond to what I will need to say? In what ways can I use this communication to build rapport for the firm?
# What exactly am I trying to accomplish with this message?
# What is their level of knowledge about the concepts discussed?
# What is their attitude toward me and the firm?
# What previous business dealings have I/we had with them?
# How much and what kind of information should I include, based on their profile?
# How technical can I be in presenting my message?
# What strategies can I use to make this message easy to read and understand?

      <text xml:space="preserve">== AceSEF - Joomla! SEO Suite ==

AceSEF is a flexible and powerful SEF URLs and Meta Tags generator with an easy-to-use graphical user interface that simplifies the generation and management of your URLs.

As experts on JoomSEF and sh404SEF, we've included in AceSEF almost all features that these components have and fulfilled their lacks. You can also migrate from sh404SEF or JoomSEF to AceSEF easily using Migration page of AceSEF.

AceSEF supports JoomFish intergration for multilingual websites, offers to set automaticly or manually the meta tags of your pages and is 100% written in a modular way so each component has its own settings. &lt;gallery&gt;&lt;/gallery&gt;

'''100% modular'''
As you can see from the few options in General Configuration, AceSEF is 100% written in modular way so each component has its own URL Layout and Automatic Meta Tags options. In fact this is also the main concept of Joomla!, modular structure that offers a CMS for general purposes.



'''Automatic meta tags'''
AceSEF is not just a SEF URL generator but also a perfect solution for creating automatic meta tags for each component. AceSEF can generate for you automatic meta title, description and even keywords. So you dont have to install SEO plugins such as joomSEO, SEOGenerator, SEOSimple etc.


'''Extensions for 3rd Party Components'''
AceSEF came out with over than 100 extensions available for 3rd party components, so you wont have any problem in migration from other Joomla! SEF components. All AceSEF extensions are compatible with JoomFish .



'''Alias option for all components'''
This is the biggest lack of JoomSEF and sh404SEF, you can set alias or title ONLY for Articles (Content) component. But because of AceSEF is written 100% in modular way you can set alias or title for ALL components.




'''Duplicated URLs management'''
With sh404SEF you can manage duplicated URLs but its too hard, with AceSEF you need just a click to choose which one of duplicated URLs will be used. You can also switch to numerating style of duplicated URLs like JoomSEF.




'''Advanced router options'''
AceSEF can rewrite SEF URLs in 3 ways, according AceSEF Extension, J! 1.5 router.php file or AceSEF basic rewriting. Most of Joomla! 1.5 Native components inludes router file so you're not forced to buy AceSEF extensions. But with sh404SEF you have to use/buy an extension to make SEF URLs.



'''Meta Manager'''
This is a brand new feature of AceSEF 1.2 . You can manage Meta Tags of ALL components in batch mode. Currently there are some SEO components that has a similar feature but non of them supports ALL components. You can also filter your URLs.



'''Accurated Pagination'''
AceSEF, contrarily from JoomSEF or sh404SEF has a 100% accurated calculation of pagination. Even if your component doesnt use the $limit (items per page) value you can add it through the component's extension parameters.



'''Migration'''
This is a future that only AceSEF has, its a perfect solution if you're using JoomSEF or sh404SEF and you want to use the great AceSEF funtions. Doing this you wont lose your old SEF URLs structure so your site position on search engines wont be affected.

== Updating this tutorial for 2.5x in the works ? ==

I'm just wondering if there is anyone working on updating this tutorial. Although it does say on blender.org that the python API is going to change quite a bit in comping releases.

Sept 10, 2011.  Good question.  I just found a great tutorial on advanced python scripting, for blender 2.44.  I'm using blender 2.59 and would like to update the page.  One thing the wikibooks doesn't seem to have is a contact list for all past and present contributors.  I'd like to get approval or know if a port to 2.5x is already started, but I guess i'll just get started.


== Doesn't work for 2.6 at all ==

Getting a lot of error messages. Can't find any good tutorial.
does anyone know of good python tutorials ?

Here's a mediocre one but it's the best I could find:

      <text xml:space="preserve">I am a farm boy from a small town in south central Minnesota. I hate using technology if it doesn't help me. I don't feel like this Wiki project hasn't helped me one bit. Twelve hours worth is to much. I work to afford school, plus all of my other courses, 3562W alone has enough work, why add more? Maybe my opinion isn't right, but I find it pointless. I haven't used the course book yet anyways. And I am not a strong writer so editing this is hard for me.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==

You want to create a feed for the [http://www.pachube.com/ Pachube] application. A Pachube application allows you to store, share &amp; discover realtime sensor, energy and environment data from objects, devices &amp; buildings around the world. This provides a platform for sensor data integration. History gathered by Pachube can be presented in various formats and used by other applications to mashup feeds.

== Modules and concepts ==

* eXist httpclient to GET, POST and PUT
* eXist scheduler for job scheduling
* eXist update extension
* server-side XSLT

==  Tower Bridge  ==

The idea of a feed of the open/closed status of Tower Bridge in London was borrowed from [http://twitter.com/ni @ni]. 

A [http://twitter.com/towerbridge Twitter] stream  provides the base data for a simple status feed. The [http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/14012942.rss RSS feed] from this stream is read by an XQuery script, the status deduced from the text and an XML file representing the current status updated. 

This XML file has an attached XSLT stylesheet so that when the file is pulled on schedule from the eXist database, it is  first transformed on the server-side into the [http://www.eeml.org/ EEML] format required for Pachube feeds.  As configured on the UWE server, this uses Saxon XSLT-2. 

=== XQuery script ===

&lt;pre&gt;
let $rss := httpclient:get(xs:anyURI(
    &quot;http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/14012942.rss&quot;
   ),false(),())/httpclient:body
let $lastChange:= $rss//item[1]
let $bridgeStatus :=  doc(&quot;/db/Wiki/Pachube/bridge.xml&quot;)/data/status
return 
  if (exists($lastChange) and exists($bridgeStatus))
  then
     let $open := if(contains($lastChange/description,&quot;opening&quot;))  then &quot;1&quot; else &quot;0&quot;
     return update replace $bridgeStatus with  
                element status {
                     attribute bridge {$open},
                     attribute lastChange {$lastChange/pubDate},
                     attribute lastUpdate {current-dateTime()}
                }
     else ()
&lt;/pre&gt;

1.  httpclient is used here because doc() throws an error about duplicate namespace declarations - under investigation

=== Bridge status ===
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;?xml-stylesheet type=&quot;text/xsl&quot; href=&quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Pachube/bridge.xsl&quot;?&gt;
&lt;data&gt;
    &lt;status bridge=&quot;0&quot; lastChange=&quot;Mon, 14 Dec 2009 12:09:02 +0000&quot; lastUpdate=&quot;2009-12-14T16:57:00.679Z&quot;/&gt;
&lt;/data&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== XSLT ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot; version=&quot;2.0&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xsl:output media-type=&quot;application/xml&quot; method=&quot;xml&quot; indent=&quot;yes&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;/data&quot;&gt;
        &lt;eeml xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot; xmlns=&quot;http://www.eeml.org/xsd/005&quot; xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://www.eeml.org/xsd/005 http://www.eeml.org/xsd/005/005.xsd&quot; version=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
            &lt;environment updated=&quot;{current-dateTime()}&quot;&gt;
                &lt;title&gt;Tower Bridge &lt;/title&gt;
                &lt;feed&gt;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Pachube/bridge.xml&lt;/feed&gt;
                &lt;description&gt;The status of the lifting Tower Bridge: 1 is open , 0 is closed. &lt;/description&gt;
                &lt;email&gt;kit.wallace@gmail.com&lt;/email&gt;
                &lt;location exposure=&quot;outdoor&quot; domain=&quot;physical&quot; disposition=&quot;fixed&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;name&gt;Tower Bridge&lt;/name&gt;
                    &lt;lat&gt;51.5064186&lt;/lat&gt;
                    &lt;lon&gt;-0.074865818&lt;/lon&gt;
                &lt;/location&gt;
                &lt;data id=&quot;0&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;tag&gt;bridge open&lt;/tag&gt;
                    &lt;value minValue=&quot;0&quot; maxValue=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
                        &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;status/@bridge&quot;/&gt;
                    &lt;/value&gt;
                &lt;/data&gt;
            &lt;/environment&gt;
        &lt;/eeml&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

===  Job scheduling ===

The XQuery update script is invoked by the eXist job scheduler every 1 minute:

&lt;pre&gt;
let $login := xmldb:login( &quot;/db&quot;, &quot;user&quot;, &quot;password&quot; ) 
let $del := scheduler:delete-scheduled-job(&quot;BRIDGE&quot;)
let $job := scheduler:schedule-xquery-cron-job(&quot;/db/Wiki/Pachube/pollbridgerss.xq&quot; , &quot;0 0/1 * * * ?&quot;,&quot;BRIDGE&quot;)
return $job
&lt;/pre&gt;
=== Feed view ===

There is a public view of the Feed as processed by Pachube : http://www.pachube.com/feeds/3922

=== Discussion ===

The Pachube interface refreshes the automatic feeds every 15 minutes (for the free service). Since typical bridge lifts last 10 minutes, there is a likelihood that a lift will be missed.  The alternative is to push changes to Pachube when detected.

==  Weather Push Feed ==
Many amateur weather stations use [http://www.weather-display.com/index.php Weather Display] software.  This software writes current observations to a space-delimited text file to support interfaces to viewing software, such as the Flash Weather Display Live.  The text files are generally web accessible, so that any client has access to this raw data, although it is polite to ask for access. 

One such station is run by Martyn Hicks at http://www.martynhicks.co.uk/weather/data.php located in Horfield, Bristol.  The raw data file is http://www.martynhicks.co.uk/weather/clientraw.txt 

In this Push implementation, a manual feed is defined in Pachube via the API by POSTing a full EEML document. An XML descriptor file defines the mapping between values in the data file and data streams in the feed.  A scheduled XQuery script reads the data file and transforms it via the mapping file to EEML format prior to PUTing to the Pachube API.


=== XQuery feed creation ===

The feed is defined in an EEML document which is POSTed to the Pachube API.  A return code of 201 indicates that the feed has been created.

&lt;pre&gt;
let $url := xs:anyURI(&quot;http://www.pachube.com/api/feeds/&quot;)
let $headers := 
        &lt;headers&gt;
            &lt;header name=&quot;X-PachubeApiKey&quot; value=&quot;...api key ....&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/headers&gt;
let $feed :=
          &lt;eeml  xmlns=&quot;http://www.eeml.org/xsd/005&quot;&gt;
            &lt;environment updated=&quot;{current-dateTime()}&quot;&gt;
                &lt;title&gt;Horfield Weather&lt;/title&gt;
                &lt;description&gt;The weather observed by a weather station run by Martyn Hicks.  Public interface is http://www.martynhicks.co.uk/weather/data.php   &lt;/description&gt;
                &lt;email&gt;kit.wallace@gmail.com&lt;/email&gt;
                &lt;location exposure=&quot;outdoor&quot; domain=&quot;physical&quot; disposition=&quot;fixed&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;name&gt;Horfield&lt;/name&gt;
                    &lt;lat&gt;51.4900&lt;/lat&gt;
                    &lt;lon&gt;-2.5805&lt;/lon&gt;
                &lt;/location&gt;
            &lt;/environment&gt;
        &lt;/eeml&gt;
return
     httpclient:post($url,$feed,false(),$headers)
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Mapping File ===

An XML document defines the origin of the raw data, the Pachube appid and the mapping from data values (1-based) to data streams (numbered from 1 in document order).
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;weatherfeed xmlns = &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/wdl&quot;&gt;
    &lt;data&gt;http://www.martynhicks.co.uk/weather/clientraw.txt&lt;/data&gt;
    &lt;appid&gt;4013&lt;/appid&gt;
    &lt;format&gt;
        &lt;field n=&quot;2&quot; unit=&quot;kts&quot;&gt;Average Wind Speed&lt;/field&gt;
        &lt;field n=&quot;4&quot; unit=&quot;degrees&quot;&gt;Wind Direction&lt;/field&gt;
        &lt;field n=&quot;5&quot; unit=&quot;Celcius&quot;&gt;Temperature&lt;/field&gt;
        &lt;field n=&quot;7&quot; unit=&quot;hPa&quot;&gt;Barometer&lt;/field&gt;
    &lt;/format&gt;
&lt;/weatherfeed&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Update script ===

This script is scheduled to run every minute (as above).  

The mapping file namespace needs to be declared:

&lt;pre&gt;
declare namespace wdl = &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/wdl&quot;;
&lt;/pre&gt;

First a function to read the raw data file and tokenize to a sequence of values:
&lt;pre&gt;
declare function local:client-data ($rawuri) {
 let $headers :=
    element headers{
       element header {
         attribute name {&quot;Cache-Control&quot;},
         attribute value {&quot;no-cache&quot;}
      }
    }
 let $raw := httpclient:get(xs:anyURI($rawuri),false(),$headers )/httpclient:body
 return tokenize($raw,&quot;\+&quot;)
};
&lt;/pre&gt;

Then  a function to transform from the sequence of values to the Pachube data chanels:
&lt;pre&gt;
declare function local:data-to-eeml ($data,$format) {
         for $field at $id in $format/wdl:field
         let $name := string($field)
         let $index := xs:integer($field/@n)
         return 
            element data {
                attribute id {$id},
                element tag { string($field)},
                element value {$data[$index] },
                element unit {string($field/@unit)}
            }
};
&lt;/pre&gt;

The main line fetches the feed definition file (here hard-coded but it could be passed in as a parameter). The data values are obtained, the EEML generated and PUT to the Pachube API.
&lt;pre&gt;
let $feed := doc(&quot;/db/Wiki/Pachube/horfieldweather.xml&quot;)/wdl:weatherfeed
let $data := local:client-data($feed/wdl:data)
let $appid := $feed/wdl:appid
let $APIKey := &quot;eeda7c27ff8b7c49e8529e4eb4b3f57724c5b609db0d22904df11edd4742e92c&quot;
let $url := xs:anyURI(concat( &quot;http://www.pachube.com/api/&quot;,$appid))
let $headers := 
        &lt;headers&gt;
            &lt;header name=&quot;X-PachubeApiKey&quot; value=&quot;{$APIKey}&quot;/&gt;
        &lt;/headers&gt;
let $eeml:=
     &lt;eeml xmlns=&quot;http://www.eeml.org/xsd/005&quot;&gt;
          &lt;environment updated=&quot;{current-dateTime()}&quot;&gt;          
           {local:data-to-eeml($data,$feed/wdl:format)}
          &lt;/environment&gt;
   &lt;/eeml&gt;
return
       httpclient:put($url,$eeml,false(),$headers)
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Feed view ===
There is a public view of the Pachube feed at http://www.pachube.com/feeds/4013

{{BookCat}}


== Weather Pull Feed ==

The alternative approach is simpler and relies on Pachube to pull data on their schedule.

In this example, weather station data consolidated by [http://www.wunderground.com/ WeatherUnderground ] and republished as XML is transformed to EEML. 

===  Weatherundgerground Feed ===

A typical XML feed for a station in weatherunderground is http://api.wunderground.com/weatherstation/WXCurrentObXML.asp?ID=IBAYOFPL1

===  XSLT transform ===

This XML can be transformed to EEML using XSLT:

&lt;source lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot; version=&quot;2.0&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xsl:output media-type=&quot;application/xml&quot; method=&quot;xml&quot; indent=&quot;yes&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;/current_observation&quot;&gt;
        &lt;eeml xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;
            xmlns=&quot;http://www.eeml.org/xsd/005&quot;
            xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://www.eeml.org/xsd/005 http://www.eeml.org/xsd/005/005.xsd&quot;
            version=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
            &lt;environment updated=&quot;{current-dateTime()}&quot;&gt;
                &lt;title&gt;Weather Report&lt;/title&gt;
                &lt;location exposure=&quot;outdoor&quot; domain=&quot;physical&quot; disposition=&quot;fixed&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;name&gt;
                        &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;location/full&quot;/&gt;
                    &lt;/name&gt;
                    &lt;lat&gt;
                        &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;location/latitude&quot;/&gt;
                    &lt;/lat&gt;
                    &lt;lon&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;location/longitude&quot;/&gt;
                    &lt;/lon&gt;
                &lt;/location&gt;
                &lt;data id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;tag&gt;Average Wind speed&lt;/tag&gt;
                    &lt;value&gt;
                        &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;round-half-to-even(wind_mph * 1.15077945,1)&quot;/&gt;
                    &lt;/value&gt;
                    &lt;unit&gt;kts&lt;/unit&gt;
                &lt;/data&gt;
                &lt;data id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;tag&gt;Wind Direction&lt;/tag&gt;
                    &lt;value&gt;
                        &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;wind_degrees&quot;/&gt;
                    &lt;/value&gt;
                    &lt;unit&gt;degrees&lt;/unit&gt;
                &lt;/data&gt;
                &lt;data id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;

                    &lt;value&gt;
                        &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;temp_c&quot;/&gt;
                    &lt;/value&gt;
                    &lt;unit&gt;Celcius&lt;/unit&gt;
                &lt;/data&gt;
                &lt;data id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;tag&gt;Barometric Pressure&lt;/tag&gt;
                    &lt;value&gt;
                        &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;pressure_mb&quot;/&gt;
                    &lt;/value&gt;
                    &lt;unit&gt;hPA&lt;/unit&gt;
                &lt;/data&gt;
            &lt;/environment&gt;
        &lt;/eeml&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

===  Connecting XML to XSLT ===

A simple XQuery script accepts one parameter, the station id, fetches the XML feed and transforms using XSLT to EEML:

&lt;pre&gt;
let $id := request:get-parameter(&quot;id&quot;,())
let $ss := doc(&quot;/db/Wiki/Pachube/weatherunderground.xsl&quot;)
let $data := doc(concat(&quot;http://api.wunderground.com/weatherstation/WXCurrentObXML.asp?ID=&quot;,$id))
return
  transform:transform($data,$ss,())
&lt;/pre&gt;

The script can be invoked: http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Pachube/weatherunderground.xq?id=IBAYOFPL1.

Since this script is parameterised, it could be used with any weatherUnderground station.

=== Pachube Feed ===

An automatic feed can be created - http://www.pachube.com/feeds/4037 which uses this feed.


== NOAA Feed ==

We can adopt a similar approach with the feeds for [http://www.weather.gov/xml/current_obs/ US ICAO stations].  NOAA provide XML feeds such as http://www.weather.gov/xml/current_obs/KEWR.xml .  The format is nearly the same as the weatherunderground feed and is documented: http://www.weather.gov/view/current_observation.xsd.  Update rate is hourly but there is no way currently to configure Pachube to update at that frequency.

=== XSLT ===

&lt;source lang=&quot;XML&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot; version=&quot;2.0&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xsl:output media-type=&quot;application/xml&quot; method=&quot;xml&quot; indent=&quot;yes&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;/current_observation&quot;&gt;
        &lt;eeml xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;
            xmlns=&quot;http://www.eeml.org/xsd/005&quot;
            xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://www.eeml.org/xsd/005 http://www.eeml.org/xsd/005/005.xsd&quot;
            version=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
            &lt;environment updated=&quot;{current-dateTime()}&quot;&gt;
                &lt;title&gt;NOAA Weather Report&lt;/title&gt;
                &lt;location exposure=&quot;outdoor&quot; domain=&quot;physical&quot; disposition=&quot;fixed&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;name&gt;
                        &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;location&quot;/&gt;
                    &lt;/name&gt;
                    &lt;lat&gt;
                        &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;latitude&quot;/&gt;
                    &lt;/lat&gt;
                    &lt;lon&gt;&lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;longitude&quot;/&gt;
                    &lt;/lon&gt;
                &lt;/location&gt;
                &lt;data id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;tag&gt;Average Wind speed&lt;/tag&gt;
                    &lt;value&gt;
                       &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;wind_kt&quot;/&gt;
      
                    &lt;/value&gt;
                    &lt;unit&gt;kts&lt;/unit&gt;
                &lt;/data&gt;
                &lt;data id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;tag&gt;Wind Direction&lt;/tag&gt;
                    &lt;value&gt;
                        &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;wind_degrees&quot;/&gt;
                    &lt;/value&gt;
                    &lt;unit&gt;degrees&lt;/unit&gt;
                &lt;/data&gt;
                &lt;data id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;tag&gt;Temperature&lt;/tag&gt;
                    &lt;value&gt;
                        &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;temp_c&quot;/&gt;
                    &lt;/value&gt;
                    &lt;unit&gt;Celcius&lt;/unit&gt;
                &lt;/data&gt;
                &lt;data id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;tag&gt;Barometric Pressure&lt;/tag&gt;
                    &lt;value&gt;
                        &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;pressure_mb&quot;/&gt;
                    &lt;/value&gt;
                    &lt;unit&gt;hPA&lt;/unit&gt;
                &lt;/data&gt;
            &lt;/environment&gt;
        &lt;/eeml&gt;
    &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

=== XQuery Script ===

&lt;pre&gt;
let $id := request:get-parameter(&quot;id&quot;,())
let $ss := doc(&quot;/db/Wiki/Pachube/NOAA.xsl&quot;)
let $data := doc(concat(&quot;http://www.weather.gov/xml/current_obs/&quot;,$id,&quot;.xml&quot;))
return
  transform:transform($data,$ss,())
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Feed ===

The transformed XML  http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Pachube/NOAA.xq?id=KEWR is the basis for the manual feed http://www.pachube.com/feeds/4047

== XSLT only ==

If Pachube supported XSLT on the server side, the whole task could be handled by a single XSLT script.  For the sake of generalisation, its helpful to provide an interface which allows parameters to be passed to the script but it is not necessary:

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;xsl:stylesheet xmlns:xsl=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/XSL/Transform&quot; version=&quot;2.0&quot;&gt;
    &lt;xsl:output media-type=&quot;application/xml&quot; method=&quot;xml&quot; indent=&quot;yes&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;xsl:param name=&quot;station&quot; select=&quot;'KEWR'&quot;/&gt;
    &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;/&quot;&gt;
        &lt;xsl:variable name=&quot;url&quot; select='concat(&quot;http://www.weather.gov/xml/current_obs/&quot;,$station,&quot;.xml&quot;)'&gt;&lt;/xsl:variable&gt;
         &lt;xsl:apply-templates select=&quot;doc($url)/current_observation&quot;/&gt;
     &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
    &lt;xsl:template match=&quot;current_observation&quot;&gt;
         &lt;eeml xmlns:xsi=&quot;http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance&quot;
            xmlns=&quot;http://www.eeml.org/xsd/005&quot;
            xsi:schemaLocation=&quot;http://www.eeml.org/xsd/005 http://www.eeml.org/xsd/005/005.xsd&quot;
            version=&quot;5&quot;&gt;
            &lt;environment updated=&quot;{current-dateTime()}&quot;&gt;
                &lt;title&gt;NOAA Current weather for {station_id}&lt;/title&gt;
                &lt;location exposure=&quot;outdoor&quot; domain=&quot;physical&quot; disposition=&quot;fixed&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;name&gt;
                        &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;location&quot;/&gt;
                    &lt;/name&gt;
                    &lt;lat&gt;
                        &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;latitude&quot;/&gt;
                    &lt;/lat&gt;
                    &lt;lon&gt;
                        &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;longitude&quot;/&gt;
                    &lt;/lon&gt;
                &lt;/location&gt;
                &lt;data id=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;tag&gt;Average Wind speed&lt;/tag&gt;
                    &lt;value&gt;
                        &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;wind_kt&quot;/&gt;
                    &lt;/value&gt;
                    &lt;unit&gt;kts&lt;/unit&gt;
                &lt;/data&gt;
                &lt;data id=&quot;2&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;tag&gt;Wind Direction&lt;/tag&gt;
                    &lt;value&gt;
                        &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;wind_degrees&quot;/&gt;
                    &lt;/value&gt;
                    &lt;unit&gt;degrees&lt;/unit&gt;
                &lt;/data&gt;
                &lt;data id=&quot;3&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;tag&gt;Temperature&lt;/tag&gt;
                    &lt;value&gt;
                        &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;temp_c&quot;/&gt;
                    &lt;/value&gt;
                    &lt;unit&gt;Celcius&lt;/unit&gt;
                &lt;/data&gt;
                &lt;data id=&quot;4&quot;&gt;
                    &lt;tag&gt;Barometric Pressure&lt;/tag&gt;
                    &lt;value&gt;
                        &lt;xsl:value-of select=&quot;pressure_mb&quot;/&gt;
                    &lt;/value&gt;
                    &lt;unit&gt;hPA&lt;/unit&gt;
                &lt;/data&gt;
            &lt;/environment&gt;
        &lt;/eeml&gt;        
    &lt;/xsl:template&gt;
&lt;/xsl:stylesheet&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The server can just run this standalone to generate the EEML feed.  This small XQuery script uses the SAXON processor on the eXist platform:

&lt;pre&gt;
  transform:transform((),doc(&quot;/db/Wiki/Pachube/NOAA3.xsl&quot;),())
&lt;/pre&gt;

[http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Pachube/NOAA3.xsl XSLT]  [http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Pachube/NOAA3.xq Execute]  (currently fails - under investigation)

== XSLT Feed service ==

=== Automatic Feed ===
The XSLT conversion could be provided as a service by an eXist db.  It would need:

* an XML database of connection definitions e.g.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;PachubeFeeds&gt;
    &lt;PachubeFeed id=&quot;2001&quot;&gt;
        &lt;data&gt;http://www.weather.gov/xml/current_obs/KORS.xml&lt;/data&gt;
        &lt;xslt&gt;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Pachube/NOAA7.xsl&lt;/xslt&gt;
        &lt;params/&gt;
    &lt;/PachubeFeed&gt;
    &lt;PachubeFeed id=&quot;2002&quot;&gt;
        &lt;data&gt;http://www.weather.gov/xml/current_obs/KEWR.xml&lt;/data&gt;
        &lt;xslt&gt;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Pachube/NOAA7.xsl&lt;/xslt&gt;
        &lt;params/&gt;
    &lt;/PachubeFeed&gt;
&lt;/PachubeFeeds&gt;

&lt;/source&gt;

* a script to locate and execute a feed:

&lt;pre&gt;
let $id := request:get-parameter(&quot;id&quot;,())
let $feed := doc(&quot;/db/Wiki/Pachube/feeds.xml&quot;)//PachubeFeed[@id=$id]
return 
 transform:transform(
     doc($feed/data),
     doc($feed/xslt),
     $feed/params
     )

&lt;/pre&gt;

* Pachube automatic feeds can now be created with a URL like
   http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Pachube/getFeed.xq?id=2001   

e.g. http://www.pachube.com/feeds/4661

* User interface and database to allow users to register, create and edit feeds

There are issues here with loading and with unsafe code in the stored XSLT.

=== Output === 

Similarly output processing of either the current EEML or a specific datastream's csv history could be provided with a bit of code and XSLT.  Since this may  require authentication, API keys would have to be stored on this database too.  Jobs could be generated and scheduled to implement triggers but this will need a timed pull of the required data.

Code is needed to convert the history feeds provided by Pachube to XML since these are only available in CSV. Once in XML, XSLT can transform to the format required. Of course it would be preferable if Pachube provided XML feeds in addition to the CSV feeds.

==== Archive ====

The full archive is provided as a csv file.  We can convert that to XML with the following script:

&lt;pre&gt;
import module namespace csv = &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/csv&quot; at &quot;../lib/csv.xqm&quot;;

let $feed := request:get-parameter(&quot;feed&quot;,&quot;&quot;)
let $stream := request:get-parameter(&quot;stream&quot;,&quot;&quot;)
let $archiveurl := concat(&quot;http://www.pachube.com/feeds/&quot;,$feed,&quot;/datastreams/&quot;,$stream,&quot;/archive.csv&quot;)
let $data:= csv:get-data($archiveurl)
let $rows :=  tokenize($data,$csv:newline)
let $now := current-dateTime()
return
&lt;history feed=&quot;{$feed}&quot; stream=&quot;{$stream}&quot; dateTime=&quot;{$now}&quot;  count=&quot;{count($rows)}&quot;&gt;
{for $row in $rows
let $point := tokenize($row,&quot;,&quot;)
return
  &lt;value dateTime=&quot;{$point[1]}&quot;&gt;{$point[2]}&lt;/value&gt;
}
&lt;/history&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Pachube/getArchive.xq?feed=4037&amp;stream=2

==== 24 Hour History ====
In the csv stream, these are untimed.  The time has to be estimated and calculated using xs:dateTimeDuration:

&lt;pre&gt;
import module namespace csv = &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/csv&quot; at &quot;../lib/csv.xqm&quot;;

let $feed := request:get-parameter(&quot;feed&quot;,&quot;&quot;)
let $stream := request:get-parameter(&quot;stream&quot;,&quot;&quot;)
let $historyurl := concat(&quot;http://www.pachube.com/feeds/&quot;,$feed,&quot;/datastreams/&quot;,$stream,&quot;/history.csv&quot;)
let $data:= csv:get-data($historyurl)
let $values :=tokenize($data,&quot;,&quot;)
let $now := current-dateTime()
let $then := $now - xs:dayTimeDuration(&quot;P1D&quot;)
return
&lt;history feed=&quot;{$feed}&quot; stream=&quot;{$stream}&quot; dateTime=&quot;{$now}&quot;  count=&quot;{count($values)}&quot;&gt;
{for $value at $i in $values
let $dt := $then + xs:dayTimeDuration(concat(&quot;PT&quot;,15*$i,&quot;M&quot;))
return
  &lt;value dateTime=&quot;{$dt}&quot;&gt;{$value}&lt;/value&gt;
}
&lt;/history&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;

http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/Pachube/getHistory.xq?feed=4037&amp;stream=2

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ion Channels: make the movement of ions to be fast across the hydrophobic barrier or the membrane. The use of Patch-clamp techniques allow the activity of single ion-channel molecules to be observed. Many ion channels have a common structural framework. Potassium channels: hydrated potassium ions must transiently lose their coordinated water molecules as the move to the narrowest part of the channel ([[/Selectivity filter|selectivity filter]])

      <text xml:space="preserve">The original tutorial that this text stems from can be found at [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/Advanced Tutorials/Python Scripting/Export scripts]].

----

Some prerequisites: 
* Familiarity with Blender.
* Fundamental understanding of python. (read the Python manual once, do the tutorials)
* Most importantly: a desire to learn. Understanding of the material will increase as we progress, along with complexity

To accompany this tutorial, bookmark: http://www.blender.org/documentation/248PythonDoc.
248PythonDoc covers all exposed methods that we can access via Python. It will benefit you to
have a browse through it once at your own pace, before going further, even if little of it makes sense.


NOTE: I use Windows so some info here may be different on Mac OS X and Linux.

Change a windowtype to Scripts, then click ''Scripts'' → ''System'' → ''Interactive Python Console''.
This will display a console not unlike the IDLE that comes with Python distributions.
The window will display some useful information, read it once. The last few lines will read:

 import bpy
 import Blender
 from Blender import *

This has imported modules and methods so that you can draw, query and manipulate scene objects.

----

Let's look at some existing scripts, to do so we can change the windowtype to Text Editor and open one of the scripts in the .blender/scripts folder. Any of the scripts that appear in the scripts menu of the ''Interactive Python Console'' will start off with some standard bookkeeping like the following lines:

 #!BPY
 &quot;&quot;&quot; Registration info for Blender menus:
 Name: 'Name as it appears in the menu'
 Blender: 249b
 Group: 'Mesh'
 Tooltip: 'Change this template text tooltip, else it defaults to scriptname.py'
 &quot;&quot;&quot; 
 __author__ = &quot;FooName&quot;
 __url__ = (&quot;blender&quot;, &quot;www.j00rURL.com&quot;)
 __version__ = &quot;1.0&quot;

      <text xml:space="preserve">===2.3 Theory of the Firm (HL)===
----
'''Limited Liability'''
:*''Financial liability is limited to a fixed value, commonly a person's investment in a company/partnership established with limited liability''
:*The separation of management and ownership through limited liability 500 years ago is the key to why firms have been able to grow so rapidly and to become so large
::*In the US only 1000 companies account for 60% of the GDP, the remaining 40% is produced by 11 million businesses and other institutions
::*The large firms are 17,000 times larger on average than the small firms

:*Limited liability allows companies to raise money easily, because individuals are not so afraid of losing everything in the case of bankruptcy
:*A typical company pays out half its earnings in the form of dividends, the rest is re-invested
:*Firms finance:
::*Fixed capital (usually associated with K) by borrowing money from the bank or by selling bonds in the bond market or through retained earnings
::*Risk capital (usually associated with the entrepreneurial input) by issuing shares
::*Working capital (usually associated with the L and NR used in production) from retained earnings or by short term loans from banks

:*Firms must profit maximize in order to earn at least the Opportunity Cost Rate of Return, otherwise their share value will fall, and another firm will buy them out and force them to earn at least the Opportunity Cost Rate of Return
	
'''Multinational/Transnational companies/Multinational enterprise'''
:*''Enterprise/firm that manages production or delivers services in more than one country''
:*''A corporation which has his managerial head quarters in one country known as the HOME country and operate on several other countries known as the HOST country (ILO)''
:*Internationally there are 600 multinational companies (MNCs), more than half are involved in banking and finance, petroleum and chemicals
:*MNCs have flourished:
::*Rather than fight tariff and non-tariff barriers, MNCs just set up production in the host country
::*Tastes are different, MNCs produce locally to tailor services to the local market
::*Advances in telecom and transportation have allowed firms to globalize
::*Transfer pricing allows prices of FoP WITHIN an organization (this may reduce taxable revenue within a country)
::*Very powerful: some have budgets that are greater than entire country GDPs
	
:*Small Firms: most small companies fail for three reasons:
::*Marketing: owners do not understand how to serve the market
::*Poor financing: most do not know how to invest money so that it repays the capital as well as the carrying costs
::*Poor management: most owners do not know how to delegate tasks, organize a business in an efficient manner, or coordinate tasks

====Cost theory====
----
:*Companies must balance revenues and costs so as to maximize profits
:*Factors of production are priced at opportunity or user cost: 
::*Labour: firms pay a wage for labour service
::*Capital can be rented but is often owned, a cost must be imputed (estimated) for the capital services, where: 
:::*P refers to the cost of the capital, 
:::*r refers to the interest on the loan to buy the capital or if the company owns the capital it is the Opportunity Cost Rate of Return that could have been earned on the money tied up in the capital
:::*δ is the depreciation rate on the capital
::*Natural resources are either treated like capital if the firm owns them, or treated as an input that must be purchased
[[Image:Shortruncostcurves.jpg‎|500px|right]]
:*Firms carry inventories which act as shock absorbers so production and sales never need to stop
::*There are three types: raw materials, intermediate (semi-finished) goods, and final goods
::*Inventories must be financed by working capital and require storage space

'''Types of costs''' 
:*'''''Total cost''''' is the sum of fixed and variable costs:
::*'''''Fixed costs''''' are associated with the fixed factor, usually capital, sometimes referred to as overhead cost
:::*Costs a firm bears in the short run regardless of output
:::*A firm could produce absolutely nothing and still face fixed costs (e.g., rent, or anything that is contracted for a period of time)
::*'''''Variable costs''''' are associated with the variable factors, usually labour and raw materials
:::*Costs which depend on the level of production

:*'''''Average cost''''' is total cost divided by quantity of output or the sum of average fixed and average variable costs:
::*Total cost divided by units of output
::*If fixed costs are truly fixed, then as output increases, average fixed costs must be declining steadily

:*'''''Marginal cost''''' is incremental cost:
::*Cost of producing one extra unit of output
::*Fixed costs are fixed, there can be no incremental costs coming from K
::*Marginal cost is equal to marginal variable costs only

====Short run====
----
''Period of time in which at least one cost for FoP is fixed (quantity of at least one input is fixed)''
[[Image:Marginalproduct.jpg‎|400px|right]]
:*In the short run capital is fixed, firms do not have time to build new plant and equipment or get rid of obsolete ones
::*Only labour can be varied in the short run
:::*As more labour is added to a fixed plant, total product will increase
::*Average and marginal productivity will rise at first and then tend to fall as workers have less and less capital equipment to work with
	
:*In the long run capital can be varied, new plant and equipment can be built, old ones destroyed or sold off
::*It is a planning period to allow the building of new capital, it can actually be shorter than the short run!  
	
::*In the very long run, it is assumed that new techniques can be invented and applied which will increase productivity

'''Law of diminishing returns'''
:*''As additional variable units are added to fixed units, after a certain point- the marginal product of the variable unit declines''
:*As more and more of the variable factor is applied to a fixed amount of the other factor, eventually each additional unit of the variable factor will add less to productivity

'''Total product''': Total output produced by factors of production

'''Average product''': The output per unit of variable factor

'''Marginal product''': The extra output from employing an additional variable factor

'''Production Function'''
:*''Describes the precise physical relationship between factor inputs and output'':
::*Marginal product is the increment in output from an extra worker:
:::*MP rises at first as each worker can specialize in doing the task for which they are trained (specialization and division of labour), but eventually starts to decline at the point of diminishing marginal productivity

:*Average productivity is given by:
::*Eventually, each additional worker will add less to output than the previous worker, and AP will start to decline (diminishing average productivity)
::*The AP curve slopes up as long as MP is above the curve: if the increment is greater than the average, then it must pull up the average
::*As soon as MP falls below AP, it must start pulling it down: MP is equal to AP at the maximum point of AP
	 
'''Short Run Cost Curves'''
:*Unlike productivity curves, cost curves vary with output: greater productivity on the part of labour means more output for less labour cost
:*AC and MC tend to fall at first for the same reason that AP and MP rose: specialization and division of labour, it costs less to produce the next unit
::*AFC is constantly falling
::*At first AC (or ATC) is falling because both AFC and AVC are falling: wL↑ &lt; Q/L↑
::*Eventually, with diminishing returns, AVC must turn up because, wL↑ &gt; Q/L↓, and after a certain point this effect outweighs the constantly falling AFC and pulls up the AC curve
::*The MC curve cuts the AC curve at its minimum point
	
:*The vertical difference between AC and AVC is just the AFC, and gets narrower as AFC gets smaller
::*We never need to draw AFC again, as we know it is already on the diagram between AC and AVC
	
:*The output associated with minimum AC is called the capacity of the firm:
::*The largest output that can be produced without average costs rising
::*Firms operating below this point are referred to as having excess capacity
::*A firm can produce beyond this point, but to do so would lead to rising unit (average) costs
	
'''Input or Factor Costs'''
:*Up to now we have assumed that input prices remain constant
:*Costs rise and fall strictly because of changes in productivity not because of changes in factor costs themselves (wages per hour stay constant for labour)
:*A rise in the price of any of the inputs will lead to the whole set of curves shifting upward
::*If it is a rise in the cost of K, then AFC will shift up
::*If it is a rise in wages, then AVC and MC will shift upward
	
:*A fall in the price of inputs leads to a fall in the curves 
	
:*If there is an increase in K, then productivity will rise and the AVC, MC, and AC curves will all shift down
::*There is a different set of curves for each amount of K, that is size of plant

====Long run====
----
''Period of time when all costs for FoP are variable (quantities of all inputs are variable)''

:*The firm reaches long run equilibrium when there is no opportunity for cost reducing substitutions: the ratio of MPs to factor costs is equal
:*Firms are motivated to use less of factors that become scarcer to the economy and more of the factors that become more plentiful
:*The same will be true for regions and nations: if a country has relatively more land than labour, farming will tend to use the cheaper land more extensively while economizing on the more expensive labour
:*In China where labour is abundant and K is scarce, a much less mechanized method of production is appropriate
	
'''Long Run Average Cost'''
:*In both the long run and the short run a minimum achievable cost can be found for each possible level of output, and a curve can be constructed called the long run average cost curve (LRAC)
::*Factor prices are assumed to be fixed - if factor prices rise, the whole LRAC rises
::*Technology is assumed to be fixed
	
:*To move from one point on the LRAC to another is very different from the short run AC: it requires an adjustment in all factors, a new plant must be built
::*All the possibilities are given by a variety of SRAC curves, one for each plant
::*The LRAC is the envelope of the SRACs, it is tangent at just that output where K is optimal in the MP/P formula above
	
:*LRAC is falling at first due to '''economies of scale''' (increasing returns to scale) which arise from: 
::*Increased opportunities for specialization and division of labour due to larger plant size: a bigger company can employ specialist staff
::*Some factors of production are indivisible, so that to make full of them a large output is required: large, specialized equipment which can only be profitable if used at large volumes of output
::*Falling research and development (R&amp;D) costs
::*Certain types of marketing which are cheaper the more units made and sold
::*Economies realized through bulk buying, cheaper financing, and transportation discounts
:::*''Economies of scale'' = an increase in a firm's scale of production leads to lower average costs per unit produced
	
:*After a point, LRAC starts to rise due to ''decreasing returns to scale (diseconomies of scale)'' which arise from:
::*Difficulties of managing and controlling large enterprises
::*No more opportunities to substitute large scale machines
::*Limits to the economies associated with discounts for large scale purchases
:::*''Diseconomies of scale'' = an increase in a firm's scale of production leads to a higher average cost per units produced

:*For some industries, there is a flat section between the falling and rising parts, and this is referred to as ''constant returns to scale''
	
'''Technical Innovation'''
:*In the long run there is great potential to drop costs through technical innovation
:*Indeed, sustainable growth in the future cannot come about through greater and greater use of natural and environmental resources, it must come from technological change
	
:*Loss of technical knowledge is very rare, thus technical change always causes the LRAC curve to fall:  
::*Labour: through better health and education, productivity of labour inputs can rise dramatically
::*Natural resources: through better engineering and refining and processing techniques, better materials can be obtained from natural resources
::*New products are invented which reduce costs dramatically such as the new wall screen TVs which will be out shortly
::*Capital: 
:::*During the industrial revolution capital has been substituted for labour
:::*With the information revolution: thinking machines are replacing human intelligence
	
:*Resequencing of production has led to a new lean production system as workers learn by doing:
::*Workers are organized as teams, individuality and initiative are emphasized
::*Parts are delivered by suppliers just in time
::*A worker stops production when a fault is discovered
::*Defective parts and problems are analyzed for a pattern of causes that need to be understood
::*As the sources of problems are found and solved, work stoppages decrease
::*Design teams are non-specialized and work closely with production engineers and parts producers:
:::*As new products are developed, tool designers can start developing the tools that will be needed
	
'''Measuring Technical Change'''
:*The rate of increase in productivity provides a measure of the progress caused by technical change:
::*Q/L: We usually measure productivity as output per hour of labour
::*K/L: As the price of labour relative to capital has risen, firms have substituted K for L
::*Quality of K: Machines have grown more and more productive over time (Q/K↑ ), but this has increased dependence on energy
::*No limits to growth: The growth in knowledge and its application has expanded so rapidly that firms are now able to squeeze more out of limited resources faster than the expanding population
	
:*Technical change is often endogenous (it is in response to something going on in the production process rather than just some accidental discovery going on in a totally unrelated way)
:*Often it is the result of R&amp;D expenditures, and tends to rise as profit incentives rise
::*The US, Germany and Japan have all invested heavily in R&amp;D, and productivity growth has been excellent for them
	
'''Slowdowns in Productivity Growth'''
:*There have been slowdowns in productivity growth:
::*For industrialized countries there is less possibilities for gains in productivity
::*Rising oil prices in the 1970s contributed to a slowing down in productivity growth  
::*There has been a shift in the population from younger to older people (older people are harder to train in new techniques and less innovative)
	
:*Services: over the last 15 years there has been a massive shift over to the service sector
::*We have moved from goods industries where increases in capital per worker led to enormous increases in productivity
::*The growth in productivity does not appear to be as rapid for services as there are less opportunities to substitute machines for people
:*Pollution: there has also been increasing pollution and environmental degradation which has lowered the quality of life
:*Crowding out: government deficits have drained the savings from the private sector which would normally have been invested in K and in R&amp;D
:*The institutional climate has become very hostile to innovation (this is one of the main reasons for the emphasis on deregulation)

====Revenues====
-----
''Price of the good times the number of units sold''

:*'''Total revenue''': total amount that a firm takes in from the sale of its product
	 
:*'''Average revenue''': revenue gained from the sale of a single product
	 
:*'''Marginal revenue''': additional revenue that a firm takes when it increases output by one additional unit

====Profit====
----
''Difference between total costs and total revenues (sometimes also called net revenue)''

:*If a salary is imputed for the owner, and a cost of capital imputed for the owner's investment:
::*One would expect there to be zero profits on average,
::*If profit is greater than zero, the firm is earning supernormal or abnormal or pure or economic profits

:*'''''Return on investment (ROI)''''' (in the US it is called IRR: internal rate of return): 
::*The net revenue is divided by the total investment in the firm
::*If there is no attempt to impute a salary and cost of capital for the owner:
:*The return on investment would be expected to be equal to the Opportunity Cost Rate of Return, and firms will stay in the industry
:*If it is greater than the opportunity cost rate of return, the firm is earning a supernormal profit, this will become known and firms will attempt to enter the industry
:*If it is less than the opportunity cost rate of return, firms will leave the industry
	
'''''Profit maximization'''''
:*As profit maximizers, firms would like to increase revenues and decrease costs (thus profit maximization implies cost minimization)
:*In the long run all factors of production are variable
:*Short run cost curves show minimum cost per unit for different levels of output, given a fixed factor
:*There are an infinite number of short run curves: as a firm changes its fixed factor over time, a new short run average cost curve emerges
:*Firms substitute inputs in the long run until they achieve the most cost efficient combination

Where: 
•	PK refers to the rental price of capital (PK{r + d})
•	PL refers to the wage rate

•	If the price of K rises: 
o	 : the firm will substitute L for K: 
o	The MP of L will fall, and MP of K will rise, equality will be restored.



:*Profit maximization occurs when the marginal revenue (revenue gained from producing one extra unit of output) equates the marginal cost of producing that extra unit

:*Though a firm may have its primary goal of profit maximization - in the case of most corporations, other goals may exist e.g., sales volume maximization, the maximization of revenue, and environmental concerns)
:*For example, the Body Shop before being incorporated, proceeded to include many animal friendly measures, which prevented the firm from maximizing profit
::*However, the main goal is indeed profit maximization, rare cases exist where it is otherwise, and indeed these are valid examples, but they are a small minority in today's business world
	 

'''''Distinction between normal (zero) and supernormal (abnormal) profit'''''
:* '''''Normal (zero) profit''''' is where all costs are covered including the expected return of the entrepreneur, anything gained beyond that is considered '''''supernormal profit'''''

====Perfect Competition====
----
''Industry structure in which there are many firms, none large enough to influence the industry, producing homogeneous products = price takers''

:*'''Assumptions of the model''': Perfect competition is an industry structure which holds numerous assumptions. It is also theoretical.
::* There are numerous buyers and sellers of which none are able to influence the market.
::* Products are homogeneous
::* There are no barriers to entry and no barriers to exit the market
::* Everyone - both buyers and sellers - have perfect information about the market

::* Examples include the agricultural market and stock market


:*'''Demand curve facing the industry and the firm in perfect competition'''
 
:*'''Profit-maximizing level of output and price in the short run and long run'''
::* The profit maximizing level of output is where MC = MR.

:*'''The possibility of abnormal profits/losses in the short-run and normal profits in the long-run.'''
::* Short run- yes
::* Long run- never.

:*'''Shut down price, break-even price.'''
::* Company has to shut down (in the short-run) if variable costs are not being covered. In the long-run it's all about covering the average costs.

:*'''Definitions of allocative and productive (technical) efficiency''' 
::* Allocative efficiency occurs when output is at society's optimum level. P=MC
::* Productive efficiency is when a firm produces at the lowest possible cost per unit. AC=MC

:*'''Efficiency in perfect competition'''
::* Perfect competition is both allocatively and productively efficient. However, it is '''dynamic''' efficient, in the sense that products can't be differentiated and no new technology can be produced. In the long run, no firm will have any profit to spend on research and development.

====Monopolistic Competition====
----
''Industry structure in which there are many firms, producing slightly differentiated products - each firm has a small 'monopoly' on its own product''

:*'''Assumptions in the model'''
::*Large number of small firms.
::*(Almost) perfect knowledge.
::*Differentiated products/branding important
::*There are close substitutes for the product of any given firm - competitors have slight control over price
::*There are relatively insignificant barriers to entry or exit and success invites new competitors into the industry 
::*Examples include home builders and restaurants


:*'''Short-run and long-run equilibrium''':
::*In the short-run abnormal profits can be earned (at MC=MR)
::*In the long-run only normal profits can be earned.

:*'''Product differentiation''':
MC firms sell products that have real or perceived non-price differences. However, the differences are not so great as to eliminate goods as substitutes. Technically the cross price elasticity of demand between goods would be positive.In fact the XED would be high. MC goods are best described as close but imperfect substitutes.The goods perform the same basic functions. The differences are in &quot;qualities&quot; and circumstances such as type, style, quality, reputation, appearance, and location that tend to distinguish goods. For example, the function of motor vehilces is basically the same - to get from point A to B in reasonable comfort and safety. Yet there are many different types of motor vehicles, motor scooters, motor cycles, trucks, cars and SUVs.

:*'''Efficiency in monopolistic competition''':
::*Monopolistic competition is an inefficient market structure.
::*In the short-run/long-run neither allocative nor productive efficiency is achieved!

====Oligopoly====
----
''Industry structure in which there are a few firms producing products that range from slightly differentiated to highly differentiated''

:*'''Assumptions of the model''':
*Competition between a few firms
*many buyers, few sellers
*differentiated products
*oligopolists will try to block entry
* the oligopolist believes that if he puts his price down his competitors will follow his example
* therefore in oligopolistic competition there is non-price competition, for example supermarkets compete in terms of:
***car parks
***loyalty cards
***trollies

::*Each firm is large enough to influence this industry
::*Barriers to entry and exit are difficult, but exist
::*Examples include aircraft manufacturers, tire manufacturers, camera/electronics manufatureres, car manufacturers, supermarkets
 
:*'''Collusive and non-collusive oligopoly''': 
* Non-collusive Oligopoly: where firms compete against each other in a normal way 
* Collusive Oligopoly: where firms try to come to an agreement to reduce the amount of competition. 
***It is usually illegal
*** they will fix the output of the industry and then share the output between them - this is often called a cartel
:*'''Cartels''': 
**When firms have a formal agreement. One example: OPEC
:*'''Kinked demand curve as a model to describe interdependent behaviour''': 
**The kinked demand curve basically illustrates the downward-stickiness of prices. The kinked demand curve shows how a change in e.g. raw material costs does not bring about a change in the price of the final good, due to the concept of downward-stickiness. The fear of changing prices and then loosing numerous customers is too big to actually change prices.


:*'''Importance of non-price competition''': Oligopolistic firms avoid competing through price cuts. Such strategy could lead to a competitive downward spiral in prices (a price war) which could leave all firms worse off. Non-price competition can take several forms such as: advertising, branding, gifts, coupons, continuos product differentiation, extended guarantees, aftersales service and volume discounts. 
:*'''Theory of contestable markets''':
The contestable market theory assumes that even in a monopoly or oligopoly, the existing companies will behave competitively when there is a lack of barriers, such as government regulation and high entry costs, to prevent new companies from entering the market.

====Monopoly====
----
''Industry structure where a single firm produces a product for which there are no close substitutes - price makers''

:*'''Assumptions of the model'''
::* One single firm dominates a market for which there are no close substitutes. 
::* Barriers to entry and exit.

::*Monopolists can set price = price makers - but are constrained by market discipline
::*Barriers to entry and exit exist and in order to ensure profits, a monopoly will attempt to maintain them
::*Examples include Microsoft's (former) virtual monopoly over the global PC operating system market and historical examples of AT&amp;T and Standard Oil (US) 
::*Antitrust legislation used to break up monopolies who abuse monopoly power via price gouging and lack of responding to consumer concerns


:*'''Sources of monopoly power/barriers to entry'''
::* Government legislation.
::* Patents and copyrights.
::* Control over supplies
::* Cost advantage, such as massive economies of scale.
::* Product differentiation.
::* Use of force.

:*'''Natural monopoly'''
::* A monopoly which has gained its status because of massive economies of scale. 

:*'''Demand curve facing the monopolist'''
:*'''Profit-maximizing level of output'''
::* A monopoly maximizes profits when MC=MR.  

:*'''Advantages and disadvantages of monopoly in comparison with perfect competition.'''
Monopoly:           price - higher,Output- lower, Profit-Abnormal, Produces  where Average costs are higher(inefficient) 
*However, a monopoly may use economies of scale therefore reducing costs and increasing output


Perfect Competition: Price- Lower,  output- higher,Profit- normal, Produces Where average costs are lowest(efficient)    
                                  
                           
:*'''Efficiency in monopoly'''
::* A monopolist is neither allocatively or productively efficient. ''It may'' be dynamically efficient if it wishes to maintain its monopolistic position.

:*'''How to control a monopoly'''

* Dogmatic Approach: This is the approach in the USA. Monopoly is illegal.
**Anti-trust legislation bans monopoly
** If a firm is accused of being a monopoly, they are taken to court and if found guilty, they are broken up.

* Pragmatic Approach: Looking at monopoly with an open mind
**looking at advantages and disadvantages and coming to a conclusion
** the conclusion may be, for example, lowering prices

* State control: the government takes over the monopoly because it is assumed that the government will run the firm for the 'benefit' of the country

*A licence: you are given a licence to run a monopoly. If you run it well, it will be renewed, if not it will be cancelled.

====Price Discrimination====
----
:*Definition: 
::*Price discrimination occurs when different customer groups are charged different prices for exactly the same good.

'''First Degree'''
:*Each person buying a good or service pays as much as they are wiling to pay. Auctions are a good example of this, as are the trades at local markets and bazaars.

In the diagram below, we can see that consumer surplus has been eroded because customers willing to pay above equilibrium will be charged taking that into account. Ideally, no consumer will pay less than he or she is prepared. The darker, triangular, box represents consumer surplus, and the profits attained through first degree price discrimination.
::[[File:Price_discrimination_diagram.png|right]]

'''Second Degree'''
:*Consumers are charged differing prices determined by the quantity that they purchase.
'''Third Degree'''
:*Different market segments identified by the seller are charged at varying rates. Highly dependent on separating the market segments. Good examples are youth discounts or senior citizen rates.

:*'''Conditions for Price Discrimination:''' 
::*Price setting ability (can only occur in an imperfect market)
::*Consumers with different Price Elasticities of Demand
::*Consumers must be separated so they products cannot be resold between consumers and there must be no leakage between markets e.g. cigarettes in UK are 5 pounds and in Poland are 1 pound, but markets are kept apart
:::*Geographic separation
:::*Lack of knowledge
:::*Age

:*'''Reasons for price discrimination''' (Advantages to '''firm''')
::*To maximize profits by eroding consumer surplus
::*Creates favorable conditions for economies of scale as more products are sold
::*Drive competitors out of an elastic market by using profits from an inelastic market to subsidize the product in the elastic market. 

:*'''Effect on the consumer'''
::*Advantages
:::*Can allow poorer consumers to purchase a product that wouldn't normally be within their purchasing power
:::Lawyers often charge lower rates for poorer clients but offset the loss with higher profits from wealthier clients.
:::*Usually increases output of a product in the market, making it available to more consumers.
:::*Better economies of scale may result in overall lower costs throughout market segments.
::*Disadvantages
:::*Consumer surplus is eliminated
:::*Some consumers will have to pay more that they would have in a non-discriminant market.

==Molecular Modeling Overview==
''Molecular modeling'' refers to abstract methods and techniques for finding the molecular structures and properties by using computational chemistry and graphical visualization techniques to ‘model’ or copy the behavior of the molecule. Besides computational chemistry, they can also be used in fields such as computational biology and science that studies molecular structures. These methods or techniques can be used to figure out molecules ranging from combination of a few atoms such as CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; to large macromolecules such as polypeptides by giving possible 3-D representation of those structures. The simplest atomic structures do not necessarily need computers to figure out the molecular model, but large molecules do; Molecular modeling helps to make it easier to understand each specific parts of the complex molecule and also allow more atoms to be considered during simulation. The two most common models that are used in molecular modeling are quantum mechanics and molecular mechanics. A method of molecular modeling, [[Structural Biochemistry/Molecular Modeling/Molecular Docking|molecular docking]], can be used to discover and design new molecules.

[[Image:Horbitale.gif‎|Quantum Mechanics|right|thumb]]

==Common Models==
'''Quantum Mechanics''' are principles describing the physical reality at the atomic level of matter (molecules and atoms) and the subatomic (electrons, protons, and smaller particles), and it include the simultaneous wave-like and particle-like behavior of both matter and radiation. It is a mathematical description of reality, which is usually different than how humans see a set of bodies or how a system behave. The most complete description of a system is its wavefunction, which is a number varying between time and place. In quantum mechanics, quantum refers to a discrete unit that quantum theory assigns to certain physical quantities, such as the energy of an atom at rest. Particles are discrete packets of energy with wave-like properties which led to the branch of physics that deals with atomic and subatomic systems. This area of study is the quantum mechanics. The principle between classical and quantum mechanics is that all objects obey laws of quantum mechanics, and classical mechanics is just a quantum mechanics of large systems.Quantum mechanics are usually compared with classical physics, but they are not the same because they aren't defined at the same time by the Universe. Quantum theory also provides accurate descriptions for many previously unexplained phenomena such as black body radiation and the stability of electron orbitals. It has also given insight into the workings of many different biological systems, including smell receptors and protein structures.
*three fundamental ways Quantum mechanics differs from classical physics:
# the integration of particle and wave phenomena with the relative equivalence of mass and energy
# the quantization of both wave and particle phenomena
# the uncertainty involved in making physical measurements.
* Quantum mechanics theory was formed by a continuation of important discoveries: 1838 discovery of cathode rays by Michael Faraday, the 1859 statement of the black body radiation problem by Gustav Kirchhoff, the 1877 suggestion by Ludwig Boltzmann that the energy states of a physical system could be discrete, the 1900 quantum hypothesis by Max Planck and then the 1905 postulation of light itself consisting of individual quanta called photons, by Albert Einstein.

'''Molecular Mechanics''' refers to the use of classical mechanics (Newtonian mechanics) to describe the physical basis behind the models. Molecular models usually describe atoms as point charges with an associated mass. The interactions between neighboring atoms are described by spring-like interactions (representing chemical bonds) and van der Waals forces. Molecular mechanics can be used to study small molecules as well as large biological systems or material assemblies with many thousands to millions of atoms. Simple energy functions can be quick to solve, can deal with large molecules, accurate for systems which are close to the models used to reproduce the force field, and can be used to specify mandatory bonds in a molecule.

*''Molecular mechanics force field'': Simple equations to describe the energy cost of deviating from ideal geometry
**E = E&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; + E&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; + E&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; + E&lt;sub&gt;nb&lt;/sub&gt;
*** E&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; is the energy involved in the deformation of a bond either by stretching or compression; E&lt;sub&gt;b&lt;/sub&gt; is the energy involved in angle bending; E&lt;sub&gt;w&lt;/sub&gt; is the torsional angle energy; E&lt;sub&gt;nb&lt;/sub&gt; is the energy involved in interactions between atoms that are not directly bonded
**E&lt;sub&gt;pot&lt;/sub&gt;=∑V&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt;+∑V&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;+∑V&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;+∑V&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt;+∑V&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;
*** where E&lt;sub&gt;pot&lt;/sub&gt; is the energy of the potential function; V&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; the bond stretch potential of all bonds; V&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; is all the bond angle bending; V&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt; is torsion; V&lt;sub&gt;v&lt;/sub&gt; is van der waals of all atoms; V&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the electrostatic interactions
*''Molecular mechanics minimization'': a method of minimizing the energy by changing the structure toward optimum geometry
*Properties of molecular mechanics methods:
*# each atom is represented as a single particle
*# each particle has a radius, has polarizability, and a constant net charge
*#Bonded interactions are treated as &quot;springs&quot; with an equilibrium distance equal to the experimental or calculated bond length

==Single Molecule Biophysics==
In the past decade, new methods have helped scientists visualize microscopic molecules.  These new techniques such as atomic force microscopy, optical and magnetic tweeezers, and single-molecule fluorescence spectroscopy allow scientists to visualize molecules on a single molecule scale instead of how large gigantic systems interact and taking averages of large moles.

The single molecule method takes advantage of being able to determine distinct structural states or large biomolecules.  Though it cannot reveal as much structural information as can X-ray crystallography it can obtain nanometer-scale information on structural features.  

==Atomic Force Microscopy==

[[File:AFM - overzicht.jpg|thumb|left|An atomic force microscope (2009).]]

This tool was first developed for topographically imaging molecules on a flat atomic surface.  AFM is generally used on generating static images of biomolecules and can be performed on dry or samples in solution.  Due to these factors AFM has been useful for spectroscopy of protein structure.

IBM in Zurich, Switzerland has improved the AMF technique well enough to capture the most detailed and smallest-scale image of a pentacene molecule.
[[File:Pentacene.jpg|thumb|right|Pentacene in its solid form viewed within optical range.]]

The main idea behind atomic force microscopes is that an image can be created from a detailed force map of minute atomic scale forces. These are sensed by some sort of probing device; analogous to hands feeling an object in a completely dark room as to gain a sense of it's shape. The atomic probe is thereby creating an image of the surroundings in a see-by-feel manner.

The problem one would expect with this close-up sort of atomic measurement is the attractive force of Van Der Waals. At very close distances, this force is strong enough to potentially pull and subsequently attach the penacene directly to the surface of the probe. Luckily, a phenomena noted as the Pauli exclusion principle prevents this sort of behavior. This priciple states that quantum particles called fermions cannot occupy the same quantum state within a certain range of each-other.

The microscope uses a carbon monoxide &quot;tip&quot; to pan over a penacene molecule (or other desired molecule) which is bound to a silicon surface. The carbon monoxide molecule is bound to the probe directionally, such that the oxygen is aligned along the axis of force measurement. This relatively inactive oxygen is able to measure varying forces along the surface of the penacene molecule. This is accomplished through atomic forces created by the repulsive behaviour described by Pauli's principle. This 2D force map is used to create the corresponding image.

==Magnetic Tweezers==
This approach is often used for studying the structural properties of DNA and protein-DNA transactions.  

==Methods/ Techniques==
[[Structural Biochemistry/Molecular Modeling/Molecular Dynamics|Classical Molecular Dynamics]] is a computational method for simulating the motion of particles. It involves calculating the spatial derivatives of the energy to get the force acting on each atom according to Newton's Laws of Motion. 

[[Structural Biochemistry/Molecular Modeling/Quantum Chemistry|Ab-initio methods]] may also be used to simulate the motion of atoms by solving the Schroedinger equation to obtain results that are more accurate but much more computationally expensive.

'''Molecular Docking''' is a method which predicts the preferred orientation of one molecule that binds to another molecule. It is an important tool in structural molecular biology and computer-assisted drug design because it use computers to figure out the shape and properties of a molecule. An example of molecular docking is when a ligand binds to a protein to form a stable complex. Even when a protein and a ligand does not completely complement each other, they would adjust their conformation so there would be an overall &quot;best fit&quot; (also called induced-fit). The goal of molecular docking is to minimize the free energy of the whole system by achieving an optimized conformation for both the protein and ligand.

==Challenges In Molecular Modeling==
# ''free energies''
:* Thermodynamic free energy is the energy in a physical system that can be converted to do work:
:**First law: conservation of energy
:**Second Law: the universal principle of entropy, stating that the entropy of an isolated system which is not in equilibrium will tend to increase over time, approaching a maximum value at equilibrium.
:**Third Law: deals with entropy and how it is impossible to reach the absolute zero of the temperature.

# ''solvation'' is the process of attraction and association of molecules of a solvent with molecules or ions of a solute.
# ''simulating reactions'' is the modeling of natural systems or human systems in order to gain insight into their functioning and how reactions happens.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Doppler Effect vs Time Dilatation ?'''

Is there any conceptual difference between the Doppler experiment and the experimental pattern described under “Time Dilatation” in the ''Special Relativity'' theory? 
In both cases a ''frequency generator'' is in inertial motion in respect to an ''observer''. In both cases one computes the perception of the frequency by the distant observer… But contrary to the Doppler Effect where a ''red-shift'' or a ''blue-shift'' in frequency may be observed, Special Relativity only concludes to time ''dilatation'' in all cases. This does not look very consistent.

This immediately triggers a second question: is it legitimate for Special Relativity to invoke the ''Lorentz Transform'' in this particular context? 
If I understand correctly this transformation applies to the gaps in position and time between two events in a given inertial frame, and it delivers the corresponding gaps between ''the same events'' in ''another inertial frame''. However, Special Relativity uses the Lorentz Transform to compute gaps between two events related to the observer’s life on the basis of gaps between two events relevant to the clock’s history.  Moreover both pairs of events belong to the same &quot;frame&quot;; here I mean the same &quot;convention&quot; for representing the relative motion of the clock and the observer.[[User:Sugdub|Sugdub]] ([[User talk:Sugdub|talk]]) 21:56, 14 December 2009 (UTC)</text>

'''''Metadata''''' are structured assertions that describe some form of communication.  Metadata are usually used to assist in the organization, discovery, use, and management of these communications.

Metadata can be machine-generated, human-generated, or generated by a combination of these approaches.  Some examples of metadata:
* A [[w:Library catalog|library catalog card]], which is a stuctured expression of information that describes a book and its content
* [[w:EXIF|EXIF]] data as recorded by a digital camera or smartphone, which describe a digital photograph (see thumbnail on the right)
* [[w:ID3|ID3]] metadata, which allows a song's title, artist, album, and track number to be stored within an MP3 file.
* [[w:Categories for the Description of Works of Art|CDWA]] records for works of art in museums.

      <text xml:space="preserve">ATP: The energy derived from catabolism is transformed into adenosine triphosphate. ATP hydrolysis is exergonic and the energy released can be used to power cellular processes, including motion, active transport, and biosynthesis. Under cellular conditions, the hydrolysis of ATP shifts the equilibrium of a coupled reaction by a factor of 10^8. ATP, the universal currency of energy in biological systems, is an energy-rich molecule because it contains two phosphoanhydride bonds.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Definition==
Glycolysis and Gluconeogenesis: Glycolysis/Gluconeogenesis is the set of reactions that converts glucose into pyruvate. Glycolysis is a compilation of ten reactions (with 1 being an isomerization of 2 products into one another) of glycolysis take place in the cytoplasm. 
# One '''glucose''' molecule will go under group-transfer reaction with '''1''' '''ATP''' (Adenosine Triphosphate) - which is catalyzed by '''hexokinase''' - to become '''Glucose 6-phosphate''' (Glu 6-P) and produce '''1''' '''ADP''' (adenosine diphosphate) molecule.
# ''Glu 6-P'', under the activity of the enzyme '''phosphoglucose isomerase''', becomes another isomer, '''Fructose 6-Phosphate''' (Fru 6-P).
# Then, the group-transfer reaction between ''Fru 6-P'' and ''ATP'', catalyzed by the enzyme '''Phosphofructokinase-1''' (known as PFK-1), produces &lt;big&gt;1&lt;/big&gt; '''fructose 1,6-biphosphate''' (Fru 1,6-P) molecule and another ''ADP'' molecule.
# ''Fruc 1,6-P'' (after ring opening), after binding to the enzyme '''aldolase''', produces two new molecules known as:
## '''Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate''' (GAP)
##''' Dihydroxyacetone phosphate''' (DHAP)
## Note that ''GAP'' can isomerize to ''DHAP'' and vice versa in the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme '''Triose Phosphate Isomerase'''.
# ''GAP'', which is constantly supplemented by the isomerization of ''DHAP'', continues the process of glycolysis by reacting with &lt;big&gt;2&lt;/big&gt; '''inorganic phosphorus''' molecules and &lt;big&gt;2&lt;/big&gt; '''nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide''' (NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, oxidized form) molecules, under oxidation-reduction reactions catalyzed by the enzyme '''Glyceraldehyde Phosphate Dehydrogenase''', to produce &lt;big&gt;2&lt;/big&gt; '''1,3-bisphosphate glycerate''' molecules, &lt;big&gt;2&lt;/big&gt; ''protons'', and &lt;big&gt;2&lt;/big&gt; '''NADH''' molecules (reduced form of NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;). Note that from this stage on, reactions are carried out by 2 molecules of the previous products to produce 2 new molecules. Therefore, it is assumed in the next stages, &quot;1,3-biphosphate glycerate reacts with some compound A&quot; means 2 1,3-bisphosphate glycerate molecules react with 2 molecules of compound A to produce 2 new molecules.
# Next, ''1,3-bisphosphate glycerat''e undergoes group-transfer reaction, catalyzed by '''phosphoglycerate kinase''', with ''ADP'' to produce '''3-phosphoglycerate''' and ''ATP''.
# Then, ''3-phosphoglycerate'', catalyzed by '''phosphoglycerate mutase''', becomes '''2-phosphoglycerate'''.
# Catalyzed by the enzyme '''enolase''', ''2-phosphoglycerate'' produces '''phosphoenolpyruvate''' (PEP) and water.
# In the last step, ''PEP'' reacts with ''ADP'' in a group-transfer reaction catalyzed by '''phosphopyruvate kinase''', to produce '''pyruvate''' and ''ATP''.

In total, ''glycolysis'' consumes &lt;big&gt;1&lt;/big&gt; ''glucose'' molecule, &lt;big&gt;2&lt;/big&gt; ''ATP'' molecules, and &lt;big&gt;2&lt;/big&gt; NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; to produce &lt;big&gt;2&lt;/big&gt; ''pyruvate'' molecules, &lt;big&gt;4&lt;/big&gt; ''ATP'' molecules, and &lt;big&gt;2&lt;/big&gt; ''NADH'' molecules.

Therefore, in overall, '''&lt;big&gt;1&lt;/big&gt; Glu + &lt;big&gt;2&lt;/big&gt; NAD&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; → &lt;big&gt;2&lt;/big&gt; Pyruvate + &lt;big&gt;2&lt;/big&gt; NADH + &lt;big&gt;2&lt;/big&gt; ATP'''

After glycolysis, the products, depending on the appearance of O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, will undergo either ''aerobic reaction'' (with O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to continue the metabolic pathway into the '''nitric acid cycle''' (also known as '''Kreb's cycle'''), or ''anaerobic reaction'' (without O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to start a new process known as '''fermentation''' to produce '''lactic acid''' (mostly in human's muscular cells) or '''ethanol and carbon dioxide''' (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in microbes such as yeasts.

==Post-glycolysis processes==
After glycolysis happens, 2 pyruvate molecules are used in the following processes:
# Anaerobic Respiration (Fermentation)
# Aerobic Respiration
## Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex (PDC)
## Krebs Cycle (or Nitric Acid Cycle)
## Oxidative Phosphorylation Cycle (or known as Electron Transport Chain cycle which involves ATP synthesis)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== General information ==
[[Image:Jheme.gif‎|thumb|alt=heme group|Heme Group]]
The [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Prosthetic Group|prosthetic group]] consists of an iron atom in the center of a protoporphyrin which is composed of four pyrrole rings that are linked together by a methane bridge, four methyl groups, two vinyl groups and two propinoic acid side chains. Each pyrrole ring consists of one methyl group.  Two of the pyrrole rings have a vinyl group side chain, while the other two rings have a propionate group independently. Heme proteins have some iron-porphyrins such as heme a, heme b, heme c, heme d, heme d1, heme o, etc. They are constituted by tetrapyrrole rings but differ in substituents. For example, heme o contain methyl group while heme a contain methyl group, the rest structure are similar between two groups. The difference between hemes assigned each of them different functions. 

Heme of [[Structural Biochemistry/Protein function/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]] protein is a [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Prosthetic Group|prosthetic group]] of heterocyclic ring of porphyrin of an iron atom; the biological function of the group is for delivering oxygen to body tissues, such that bonding of ligand of gas molecules to the iron atom of the protein group changes the structure of the protein by amino acid group of histidine residue around the heme molecule. A holoenzyme is defined to be an enzyme with its [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Prosthetic Group|prosthetic group]], [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Coenzymes|coenzyme]], its [[Structural Biochemistry/Enzyme/Cofactors|cofactor]], etc. Therefore an example of a holoenzyme is [[Structural Biochemistry/Protein function/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]] with its iron-containing heme group.

[[Image:heme2.jpg|300px|cneter|thumb|]]

==Association Constant==

Association constant is the constant at which the bonding affinity between two different molecules, the substrate and the product, is at stable equilibrium. An example of such a bonding constant occurs in the hapten-antibody interaction.

==Dissociation Constant==

Dissociation constant is the quantifiable constant in which a compound, molecule, or ion dissociates. A type of dissociation constant is acid dissociation constant. This constant is used to calculate the occurrence of a weak and strong acid dissociation.

== Function == 
The Heme group gives [[Structural Biochemistry/Protein function/Heme group/Myoglobin|myoglobin]] and [[Structural Biochemistry/Protein function/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]] the ability to bind oxygen because of the presence of iron atom. It also contributes to the red color found in muscles and blood. Each heme group contains an iron atom that is able to bind to one oxygen (O2) molecule. Each [[Structural Biochemistry/Protein function/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]] protein can bind four oxygen molecules. The iron atom, usually in the ferrous oxidation state (Fe&lt;sup&gt;&lt;small&gt;2+&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/sup&gt;), lies between four pyrrole rings but slightly bends away from the plane (0.4 Angstrom from the plane). The iron ion has two extra binding sites called the fifth and sixth coordination sites on each side of the protoporphyrin plane. Usually, the fifth coordination binds with proximal histidine where the sixth coordination binds to an oxygen. When oxygen binds to iron, the iron becomes slightly smaller allowing it to move into the plane of the porphyrin ring. A distal histidine binds to oxygen to make sure reactive oxygen is not released. The distal histidine will not allow the release of oxygen when the Iron is in the 3+ state.

== Mechanistic Functionality ==
The Iron atom is too large in size to fit perfectly inside the porphyrin ring, and sits outside the ring by 0.4 Angstroms.  However, upon binding oxygen, the Iron radius shrinks, facilitating a planar alignment with the porphyrin ring. This change causes the proximal histidine bound the Fe atom to be pulled up and cause a structural change to the alpha helix attached to the histidine residue.  This alpha helix's carboxyl terminus interacts with the other alpha-beta dimer, creating a total conformational change in the overall protein.  The conformational change facilitates an increased affinity for oxygen, which is shown by a transformation from the T to R state in [[Structural Biochemistry/Protein function/Hemoglobin|hemoglobin]].

      <text xml:space="preserve">The glycolytic pathway has a dual role: it degrades glucose to generate ATP, and it provides building blocks for the synthesis of cellular components. The rate of conversion of glucose into pyruvate is regulated to meet these two major cellular needs. Under physiological conditions, the reactions of glycolysis are readily reversible except for those catalyzed by hexokinase, phosphoructokinase, and pyruvate kinase.

We will be modeling this very simple human figure. This time many details are left out to save time and space. Its assumed that enough knowledge is gained from previous tutorials for readers to understand this stage. Shortcut keys are also left out. Read first the chair modeling tutorial if this comes out too difficult to read.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Vayeshev
Genesis 37-40:23;  Amos 2:6- 3:8

The Firstborn Status
&quot;Now Israel loved Yosef more than all his sons, because he was the son of his old age; and he made him a varicolored tunic. His brothers saw that their father loved him more than all his brothers; and so they hated him and could not speak to him on friendly terms.&quot;	 Genesis  37:3-4

Joseph (Yosef) is loved by his father more than the other children.  There is something of a kindred spirit between them and Jacob sees in this son the spiritual qualities of of his heart's desire.   So Joseph is at it were his favourite son and earns the envy and hatred of his brothers.   Even at seventeen, Jacob is trusting him as the overseer of the rest of the children, because of his righteousness and his capabilities.   (37:3-8,11)

Joseph (Yosef) as the favourite son has a self-assurance in his 'chosenness' and even Jacob rebukes him for his brashness in the way he recounts his dreams of his rise to greatness.  (37:10)
It will take many years of breaking to remould the vessel and make it meet for the master's use.

Joseph's  &quot;coat of many colours&quot; is according to the Hebrew text, a tunic that reaches to the palms and soles of the feet.   The Septuagint and the Johnathan Targums both render this term &quot; a coat of many colours&quot;.
The other occasion this term is used in the scriptures is in 2 Samuel 13:18 relating to Tamar, King David's daughter,
&quot;Now she had on a robe of many colours, for the king's virgin daughters wore such apparel.&quot;

From this account and an archaeological discovery in the tombs of Ben Hassein of Egypt it is understood that &quot;in the patriachal age, Semitic chiefs wore coats of many colours as insignia of rulership.   Thus Jacob in giving Joseph this coat marked him out for chieftainship of the tribes and therefore to be his successor.

This is equivalent to the double portion blessing given to the first-born.   Jacob was therefore demarking Joseph as the one chosen as the firstborn - from his beloved Rachel, in lieu of Reuben.

From the time-frame it would seem that Reuben and Simeon had already been disqualified from the role of headship as a result of their own actions (Ch34 &amp; 49:3-4), and therefore their resentment toward Joseph was unjustified - as men of the flesh, it was a hatred born of envy at his righteousness which gained him favour where they failed to measure up to the standard.

In Joseph's time of absence as one supposedly dead, Judah had obviously been given the headship and became therefore the spokesman for his father when before Joseph in Egypt (43:3;44:18-23; 46:28), in default of Reuben and Simeon for their sins which disqualified them.

This was also according to God's plan for the birthright blessing of the double portion and the sceptre of dominion to be divided within the tribes so that eventually there would be two houses in Israel.

Created Conflict
Yoseph now emerges as the main character in Parsha Vayeshev.  We can clearly see Yahweh’s divine choosing of Yoseph as the brothers once again are set up to divide along the lines of the sons of Rachel and the sons of Leah arising from the conflict between their mothers involving strife, competition and jealousy. This is a preview of divisions to come; the Northern Kingdom from the Southern Kingdom and the Assyrian exile from the Babylonian exile. 

From the beginning, God uses conflict and contrast to accomplish His will.  Yahweh has a plan for His creation and human conflict is one of the primary motivations that fuel the activities of mankind.  Struggles are necessary in this life in order for us to stay spiritually healthy. When there are no conflicts and everything is going well, it is easy to relax and fall asleep spiritually.  Problems and battles keep us alert and force us to constantly seek Yahweh.  

Yeshua learned obedience through suffering,   &quot;though he was a Son, yet learned obedience by the things which he suffered.&quot; (Hebrews 5:8 HNV)
Suffering and problems are the pathway to learn obedience which will result in us obtaining that spiritual quality of immortal glory   -   &quot;For our light affliction, which is for the moment, works for us more and more exceedingly an eternal weight of glory.&quot;( 2 Corinthians 4:17  HNV)

In order to receive our inheritance in the coming age, one has to suffer with the Messiah. The more that we suffer now, the greater the glory we will have then,   -   &quot;The Spirit himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God; and if children, then heirs; heirs of God, and joint-heirs with Messiah; if indeed we suffer with him, that we may also be glorified with him. For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which will be revealed toward us.&quot;(Romans 8:16-18  HNV revised)

&quot;that the proof of your faith, which is more precious than gold that perishes even though it is tested by fire, may be found to result in praise, glory, and honor at the revelation of Yeshua the Messiah&quot; (1 Peter 1:7 HNV)
The end result will be worth the momentary discomfort   -  &quot;because you are partakers of Messiah's sufferings, rejoice; that at the revelation of his glory also you may rejoice with exceeding  joy.&quot; (1 Peter 4:13 HNV)

The Sovereign Hand of God
The main scene opens with the brothers seeking to kill him when he comes to seek after their welfare.   According to the Targum Johnathan, this was not long after Reuben had lost the birthright through defiling his father's bed.
Through archeological discoveries that have been made in Egypt, we know that the Semitic chiefs had colorful garments as a sign of their leadership.[J. H. Hertz, &quot;The Pentateuch and Haftorah&quot;, page 142.]    In Egyptian figures of Hebraic leaders, they had various coloured stripes around the borders of their sleeves and the hems of their skirts. The Targums refer to it as a  &quot;figured robe&quot;.  This long coat represented royalty and authority (37:23). 

Leah's and the concubines' sons rejected their step brother Yosef, because his father had given him the birthright and sought to thwart his placement of leadership over them, just as did the Jewish leaders with Yeshua. This results in Josef being sold to the Arabian traders from Midian, who eventually consign the 'slave' into Potiphar's house in Egypt. 

Even though Yosef's lack of maturity could be blamed for his attitude that might have precipitated and enhanced the rage to dispose of him, he was simply living according to the circumstances he inherited of Ya'acov's preferential treatment to him and the hand of God worked through the cruel actions of brothers and other men to accomplish His will to establish Yosef in a position to save the entire nation of Israel in years to come.

The Targum of Johnathan says  &quot; And they lifted up their eyes, and looked, and behold a band of Arabians [JERUSALEM. A band of Saracens] were coming from Gilead with their camels, carrying wax, resin, balsam and stacte, proceeding to go into Mizraim. .. .. .. .. And the Midianite men, masters of business, passed by; and they drew and brought up Yosef out of the pit, and sold Yosef to the Arabians for twenty mahin of silver; and they bought sandals of them. And they brought Yosef to Mizraim&quot;

As far as his brothers were concerned this was now the end of Yosef, his dreams and his prideful presumptuousness, but not so with Yahweh, for this was the beginning of the fulfilment of Yosef’s destiny.  Yosef was a vessel in the Master's hand being moulded into a strong leader.  True greatness is born out of weakness, which is transformed by God.   He uses the things that are weak and foolish, those that are base and despised, the things that are not, to bring to nothing the things that are, that only He will get the glory. (1 Corinthians 1:26-31)

Yahweh knows the beginning from the end. As the Creator of time, He is not limited by anything to fulfill His purposes. His created order will respond perfectly according to all that He has set in motion.

The Hand of The Potter
Despite all the adversity Yosef triumphs in faith and both Potiphar and the prison overseer visibly recognized the blessing of Yahweh upon their servant and prisoner.   &quot;Yahweh was with Yosef, so he became a successful man. And he 
was in the house of his master, the Egyptian. Now his master saw that Yahweh was with him and how Yahweh caused all that he did to prosper  in his hand. So Yosef found favor in his sight and became his personal servant; and he made him overseer over his house, and all that he owned he put in his charge.&quot;   Genesis 39:2-4

Despite his position and power, Yosef was still a slave living in an ungodly land. There were heathen influences all around him and there was no one he could turn to for help or support.  
Mitzrayim (Egypt) was the primary power of the world at that time; it was wealthy, opulent and decadent. Yosef had come a long way from living in a tent and tending sheep.  Yosef was about to have the test of his life, a test that would involve the purity and sanctity of his body.  When you feel things are going well, that is when the tests come.

Tests are from God but temptations are from the devil and when Satan temps you it is not just a one-time temptation. Potiphar's wife did not let up on Yosef and she spoke to Yosef day by day (39:7-10) trying to wear him down and Yahweh allowed it to test his character and to prove his faithfulness. 

Yosef resisted the temptations because he lived in the presence of Yahweh.  In the same way, the Messiah was tempted in everything, but without sin, as it is written in Hebrews 4:15:   &quot;For we don't have a high priest who can't be touched with the feeling of our infirmities, but one who has been in all points tempted like we are, yet without sin.&quot;(HNV revised)
&quot;I have set Yahweh always before me. Because he is at my right hand, I shall not be moved.&quot; (Psalm 16:8 HNV)

The apparent result of him exercising moral integrity was to lose all the prestige, success and power that he had gained and for everything seemingly to go against him.   Yosef served God with a pure heart and was unmoved by adversity.

The Targums say that 'Yahweh the Word' was with Yosef and in the Psalms it says that &quot;Until the time that his word came to pass, the word of Yahweh tested him&quot;   (Psalm 105:17-19)  Yosef stood on the word he was given, despite the fact that it was as if his very soul was &quot;laid in iron&quot; of affliction.  &quot;But Yahweh was with Yosef and extended kindness to him, and gave him favor in the sight of the chief jailer. The chief jailer committed to Yosef's charge all the prisoners who were in the jail; so that whatever was done there,he was responsible for it.  The chief jailer did not supervise anything under Yosef's charge because Yahweh was with him; and whatever he did, Yahweh made to prosper.  Genesis 39:21-23

Through all of his trials, it appears that Yosef maintained a positive attitude about the life circumstances he was encountering.  Yosef walked in intimate relationship with Yahweh and recognized the blessings of favor from his potential oppressors and submitted himself to live for Yahweh in it all.

Joseph as a Prophetic Type of Yeshua
Joseph was a shepherd as was Yeshua the 'Good Shepherd'   Read John 10:1-18.
Joseph foretold of his future sovereignty.  Yeshua also spoke of his future glory in his Father¹s kingdom? 	(Matthew 26:64)
Joseph was envied by his brethren. So also was Yeshua.  Read Mark 12:6-7; John 12:18-19; Matthew 27:17-18.

Joseph was sent forth by his father on a mission of love to ascertain the welfare of his brothers (37:14). Yeshua was sent by his Father to this earth for a similar mission as well (John 3:16-17; 1 John 4:10; Mt. 15:24)
Joseph's brothers rejected him. Yeshua was rejected by his brethren (John 1:11; Isa. 53:3)
Joseph was conspired against by his brothers and betrayed  (37:18) as also Yeshua  (John 13:2-11;  1:11)
Joseph was received among the Gentiles. Yeshua also was received by the Gentile nations but forgotten by His own true brothers.  
Joseph arose to have dominion and rule in righteousness and provide for his people as did Yeshua.  Acts 2:36; Philippians 2:7-11;  John 6:48-51

Just as Joseph was ‘disguised’ and made unrecognizable by his Egyptian clothing and hairstyle), so too has the Messiah been made unrecognizable—‘disguised’ by Gentile culture.  We have painted Him to look like one of us.  We have made His mouth speak in Greek and in the language of every nation, but we have forgotten that He spoke Hebrew first.  We have removed Him from His Hebraic and Torah context and made Him unrecognizable to His own brothers.  Yet ultimately, the story of Joseph ends with a reconciliation between him and his brothers, one which results in the salvation of all the sons of Israel.  
As the Apostle Paul put it, “All Israel will be saved” (Romans 11:26).

The Holy Seed
Judah had been chosen to become the forefather of the kings of Israel, including the Messiah. Therefore it was very important that his family line was pure and righteous.   Judah went through a period of spiritual decline and marries a woman with a questionable background.  Rashi quotes the Targum, which says that she was the daughter of a merchant, since the word &quot;merchant&quot; has the same root as &quot;kana'anite&quot;. Rabbi Ibn Ezra, however, says that he married a Kana'anite woman.  The Kana'anite people had been cursed by Noach, and therefore were not suitable to intermarry with.

None of the sons from this union were righteous and by their actions they disqualified themselves as forefathers of the Messiah. Judah loses two of his sons and is reluctant to give the last one to Tamar, the widow of his first son.   Knowing prophetically that she will carry the messianic line, she takes matters into her own hands and arranges to become pregnant to Judah without him knowing her identity.  She procures three items as security to identify man by whom she is pregnant - his signet, his mantel, and his staff.  The signet speaks of personality. The mantel speaks of distinction and the staff speaks of position.  Giving these three things over is very similar to what happens in a wedding,  Midrash[19] says that the signet ring prophesied of the kings that would come from this union. The mantel symbolizes the Sanhedrin, which always bore tallit and tefillin. The shepherd's staff symbolizes the Messiah who would be born of the tribe of Judah. The Torah later prophesies of a scepter in relation to Judah, see 49:10.

According to the book of Jasher, Tamar was the daughter of Elam, who was the son of Shem, Noach's son.  Since Shem was a priest and bore the title Malki-Tzedek, the judgment for the fornication that Tamar had committed was in agreement with Israel's law, as it is written in Leviticus 21:9:  &quot;The daughter of any priest, if she profanes herself by playing the prostitute, she profanes her father: she shall be burned with fire.&quot; (HNV revised)   Also Deuteronomy 25:5-6

Judah's decision was according to the standards that Yahweh gave his children.  He passed a judgment as a judge in Israel. This is an example of a commandment being practiced before the Torah was formally given at Sinai.

This introduction is historically wrong.
Cantor was not the first to use formal systems - indeed I don't think he was interested.

What about Euclid and more to the point, proofs of the parallel postulate?

      <text xml:space="preserve">A '''software design pattern''' is a general reusable solution to a problem that repeats itself in [[w:software design|software design]] within a given context. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into code, and constitutes a description or template for a problem that can be used in many different situations. Software design patterns are formalized best practices that have to be implemented in applications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/3.1.x/spring-framework-reference/html/overview.html 1.

Software design patterns reside in the domain of modules and interconnections.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Taking Keyboard Input ==
To handle the input to the game we will be taking input from the keyboard, which will then be used to move the fish around the landscape, and escape the game.

Start by creating a new method in your Game1 file called 'HandleInput', and create a new keystate variable. When this method is called, the current state of the keyboard is stored as part of the keystate variable, which then can be accessed by the gamelogic.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
//Handles input
private void HandleInput(GameTime gameTime)
{
    KeyboardState currentKeyboardState = Keyboard.GetState();
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Next add the following conditional.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
// Check for exit.
if (currentKeyboardState.IsKeyDown(Keys.Escape))
{
    Exit();
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This provides the simplest way to explain how this process works, you can construct as part of any conditional, a way to monitor the position of any key. Place a call to this method in your update code, using the 'gameTime' variable as an argument (which we will use later). With this code in place, you should be able to exit the code at any time by pushing the escape code.

Next, we will place in a similar conditional to use the arrow keys. Add the following lines in your 'HandleInput' method.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
//Move the fish with the arrow keys
float speed = 0.02f; //Dictates the speed
if (currentKeyboardState.IsKeyDown(Keys.Left))
{
    FishMen.Translation.Y -= speed * (float)gameTime.ElapsedGameTime.TotalMilliseconds;
}
if (currentKeyboardState.IsKeyDown(Keys.Right))
{
    FishMen.Translation.Y += speed * (float)gameTime.ElapsedGameTime.TotalMilliseconds;
}
if (currentKeyboardState.IsKeyDown(Keys.Up))
{
    FishMen.Translation.X += speed * (float)gameTime.ElapsedGameTime.TotalMilliseconds;
}
if (currentKeyboardState.IsKeyDown(Keys.Down))
{
    FishMen.Translation.X -= speed * (float)gameTime.ElapsedGameTime.TotalMilliseconds;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

In order to make the effect more visible change the following lines in the Update method.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
cameraPosition = cameraTarget = FishMen.Translation;
cameraPosition.Z += 20.0f;
&lt;/source&gt;

to

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
cameraPosition = cameraTarget = FishMen.Translation / 2;
cameraPosition.Z -= 20.0f;
&lt;/source&gt;

And run the code. This should produce an over the shoulder view of your fish as it moves around. The logic behind using the 'ElapsedGameTime' variable, which monitors the difference in time between calls of the update method, compensating for any changes in processing time between frames. If it wasn't for this, the faster your computer the more erratic and faster the controls would be. As it is, it should be consistent between computers. Run the code, and you should see it move around with pushes of the arrow keys.

Finally, to dictate the boundarys of your fish, create a new 'Vector2' variable called 'boundarys', which will dictate the maximum position of the fish in 2D space. Change your arrow handler code as follows.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
//Move the fish with the arrow keys
float speed = 0.02f; //Dictates the speed
Vector2 boundarys = new Vector2(14f);

if (currentKeyboardState.IsKeyDown(Keys.Left) &amp;&amp; FishMen.Translation.Y &gt; -boundarys.Y)
{
    FishMen.Translation.Y -= speed * (float)gameTime.ElapsedGameTime.TotalMilliseconds;
}
if (currentKeyboardState.IsKeyDown(Keys.Right) &amp;&amp; FishMen.Translation.Y &lt; boundarys.Y)
{
    FishMen.Translation.Y += speed * (float)gameTime.ElapsedGameTime.TotalMilliseconds;
}
if (currentKeyboardState.IsKeyDown(Keys.Up) &amp;&amp; FishMen.Translation.X &lt; boundarys.X)
{
    FishMen.Translation.X += speed * (float)gameTime.ElapsedGameTime.TotalMilliseconds;
}
if (currentKeyboardState.IsKeyDown(Keys.Down) &amp;&amp; FishMen.Translation.X &gt; -boundarys.X)
{
    FishMen.Translation.X -= speed * (float)gameTime.ElapsedGameTime.TotalMilliseconds;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This should produce a game where the fish only moves to a certain position and stops. Feel free to adjust the movement by monitoring the 'boundary' and 'speed' variable to taste.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

The technique to be discussed in this chapter is used in frequent itemset mining. There are several situations which people are interested on co-occurrence of two or more item of a set. It is important to establish which items co-occur, since based on them, association rules can be extracted between itemsets [1]. A typical example of an application is about a supermarket when one discovery customers who buy meat and beer also tend to buy coal. Thus, a frequent item set would be meat-beer-coal and an association rule would be customers, in general, who buy meat and beer, have more chances to buy coal.

Many works have dealt with the problem of frequent itemset mining. Most of them show the necessity of a min_support threshold, which is an itemset minimum frequency in the data and in general defined by the miner user. Besides, these studies have as goal to mine a complete set of frequent itemsets that satisfy min_support [2]. The application of a minimum support results in several assumptions which are rarely discussed or verified. One assumptions is items occur in the database following a, possibly unknown, but stable process and that the items occur in the database with roughly similar frequencies. Nevertheless, in the real world, transactions data have a frequency distribution highly skewed with almost items occurring in an infrequent way while just some of them occur with high frequency. In database where this phenomenon happens, interesting patterns are not found since some of the associated items are too infrequent to satisfy the user-specified minimum support [3].

Some algorithms such as TFP were developed in a way that a user do not need determine a min_support, however, he needs to inform the minimum size of itemset (min_l) and the number of itemset which he desires mining (k). Furthermore, the TFP algorithms just mine frequent closed itemset.[2]. Again, the user has a parameter (min_l) which he should specify before mining the data, what is a subtle decision. 

Therefore, this chapter presents an algorithm, which is implemented at R-package and uses a simple stochastic model (Negative Binomal model or NB-model) to estimate a minimum support utilizing knowledge of the process which generates transaction data and allows for highly skewed frequency distributions. The name of package in R program is arulesNBMiner that is the Java implementation of a depth first search algorithm to mine NB-frequent itemsets of NB-precise rules [4]. Beside the algorithm utilize the information contained in own data structure to estimate the minimum support, it uses a precision limit to estimate min_support and for each k-itemset plus 1 extension it calculates a different minimum support.

== Technique to be discussed ==

=== Algorithm ===

 '''Function NBSelect'''&lt;math&gt;\left(l,\ L,\ n,\ \tilde{k},\ \tilde{a}',\ \pi\right)&lt;/math&gt;
 1. r&lt;sub&gt;max&lt;/sub&gt; = ''max''(c.count) in L
 2. r&lt;sub&gt;rescale&lt;/sub&gt; = ''sum''(c.count) in L
 3. '''for''' each tuple [c,c.count] ∈ L '''do''' n&lt;sub&gt;obs&lt;/sub&gt; [c.count]++
 4. '''do'''
 5. &lt;math&gt;\text{precision}=\frac{(1-\vert l\vert)P[R_1\ge p\;\vert\;k=\tilde k,\;a=r_\text{rescale}\cdot\tilde a']}{\sum_{r=p}^{r_\text{max} } n_{ob} s[r]}&lt;/math&gt;
 6. '''while''' (precision ≥ π ∧ (p−−) &gt; 0)
 7. '''return''' {c| [c,c.count] ∈ L ∧ c.count &gt; p}
 '''where'''
 l = the pattern for which candidate items are selected
 L = a data structure which holds count information for items which co-occur with pattern l; 
 we use tuples c, c.count , where c represents a candidate  item and c.count the count.
 n = the total number of available items
 &lt;math&gt;\tilde{k}\text{ and }\tilde{a}'&lt;/math&gt; = estimated parameters for the data set
 π = user-specified precision threshold

=== Implementation (description of used modules and packages) ===

The first thing one has to do to use NBMiner is installing the NBMiner package. This package has three dependencies packages: arules (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/arules/index.html) which provides the infrastructure for representing, manipulating and analyzing transaction data and patterns (frequent itemsets and association rules), Matrix (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Matrix/index.html) which is classes and methods for dense and sparse matrices and operations on them using Lapack and SuiteSparse, and lettice (http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lattice/index.html) which is a framework for data visualization developed at the Bell Labs. Besides, the user has to install on computer the Sun Java(TM) Development Kit (JDK) 6, since the NBMiner uses a package called rJava which is part of JDK. This must be installed in the user operational system.

Installation of the dependencies packages can be performed within the R environment using the function &quot;install.packages(“''package name''”)&quot;. The name of NBMiner package is arulesNBMiner. 

 install.packages(“arulesNBMiner”)	

After the user installed the necessaries packages, he must load them. This can be done using the function &quot;library(''package name'')&quot;.

 library(arulesNBMiner)	

However, before we show how to use the NBMiner package, it is necessary to show how to load the data. Here, we are using a data on csv format. In this format each line is a transaction like the example below:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Employment !! Education !! Marital !! Occupation !! Sex !! Accounts
|-
|Private || College || Separated || Service || Female || USA
|-
|Private || Associate || Unmarried || Transport || Male || Jamaica
|-
|Private || HSgrad || Divorced || Clerical || Male || USA
|-
|Private || Bachelor || Civil || Repair || Male || USA
|-
|Private || College || Civil || Executive || Male || USA
|-
|Private || HSgrad || Civil || Service || Male || USA
|}

Using the function &quot;read.table()&quot; on R environment, we are able to load the data. This function creates a &quot;data.frame&quot; object. Its syntax is: 
	
 object name&lt;-read.table(“filename”, header=TRUE/FALSE,sep=”,”)
	
The argument  header  indicates the data has or does not a header while the sep indicates which character is being used to separate the elements.
Later, the user has to transform this data frame object in a transaction object. For that, he can use the function &quot;as()&quot;. Its syntax is:
	
 object name&lt;-as(data frame object,”transactions”)
	
It is important to mention the user has to load the NBMiner package before he uses the function as with parameter transaction.
Furthermore, there is another data format that some R functions can read and transform it in a transaction object. The user can utilize a binary format like the example below:
	
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|1||1||0||0||0||1||0||0||0
|-
|1||0||1||0||0||0||1||0||0
|-
|1||0||0||1||0||0||0||1||0
|-
|1||0||0||0||1||0||0||0||1
|-
|1||1||0||0||0||0||0||0||1
|-
|1||0||0||1||0||0||0||0||1
|-
|1||0||0||0||1||0||0||0||1
|}

Here, each line represents a transaction and each column represents a term of the database. The number 1 means presence of that term in that transaction, while 0 means no presence. To read this data, user can first utilize the function &quot;scan()&quot;. It creates a vector object, and its syntax is:

 object name&lt;-scan(“file name”,sep=”,”)

After that, it is necessary to transform the vector object in a matrix object. This is performed using the function &quot;dim()&quot;. Its syntax is:
	
 dim(vector object)&lt;-c(dim1,dim2) 

''Dim1'' and ''Dim2'' are the dimensions of the matrix which the user want creating. If the user wants, he can name each row and column of the matrix using the function &quot;dimnames()&quot;. Its syntax is:
	
 dimnames(matrix object)&lt;-list(pridim=c(names),segdim=c(names))
	
Where ''pridim'' is a vector with first dimension names, and ''segdim'' is a vector with second dimension names. Finally, this object can be transformed in transaction object using the function &quot;as()&quot;. Its syntax is:

 object name&lt;-as(matrix object,”ItemMatrix”)

Soon after the user loaded the package and the data, it is necessary to create the parameters object using the function of NBMiner called &quot;NBMinerParameters()&quot;. This function reads the data and extracts from them some parameters which will be used in the next step. The syntax of this function is:
	
 object name&lt;-NBMinerParameters(data object, pi=#, theta=#, maxlen=#, minlen=#, trim=#, verb=TRUE/FALSE, plot=TRUE/FALSE, rules=TRUE/FALSE)
 '''where:''' 
 # = numbers
 data object = the data as an object of class transaction
 pi = precision threshold
 theta = pruning parameter
 maxlen = maximal number of items in found itemsets (default = 5)
 minlen = minimum number of items in found itemsets (default = 1)
 trim = fraction of incidences to trim off the tail of the frequency distribution of the data
 verbose = use verbose output for the estimation procedure
 plot = plot the model
 rules = mine NB-precise rules instead of NB-frequent itemsets

After the user perform this procedure, he is able to run the algorithm to mine his data. For that, one will use the function called &quot;'''NBMiner()'''&quot;. Its syntax is:

 object name&lt;-NBMiner(data object, parameter=object parameter, control = list(verb=TRUE, debug=FALSE))

If the user uses the option rules=TRUE when he created the object parameter, the algorithm will mine the NB-precise rules. Otherwise, the same algorithm will mine the NB-frequent itemsets.
	
Finally, we summarized the necessaries commands to use the NBMiner package for mining tasks using the first data structure mentioned above, these are below:

 library(package name)
 object name&lt;-read.table(“filename”, header=TRUE/FALSE,sep=”,”)
 object name&lt;-as(data frame object,”transaction”)
 object name&lt;-NBMinerParameters(data object, pi=#, theta=#, maxlen=#, minlen=#, trim=#, verb=TRUE/FALSE, plot=TRUE/FALSE, rules=TRUE/FALSE)
 object name&lt;-NBMiner(data object, parameter=object parameter, control = list(verb=TRUE, debug=FALSE

=== Visualization ===

To visualize data information contained in a “data.frame” object just use the object name. Here, we use table as object name:

 table = read.table(&quot;data&quot;,sep=&quot;,&quot;,header=TRUE)
 table
 {| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

 |}

However, when the same principle is used in “transactions” format, we have just the number of transactions and items generated by the &quot;as()&quot; function:

 tableT = as(table,&quot;transactions&quot;)
 tableT
  transactions in sparse format with
  6 transactions (rows) and
  18 items (columns)

Use “inspect()” function to visualize the result of the conversion to the “transactions” format:

 inspect(tableT)

 {| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
 !#!!items!!transactionID
 |-
 |1||{Employment=Private,Education=College,Marital=Separated,Occupation=Service,Sex=Female,Accounts=USA}||1
 |-
 |2|| {Employment=Private,Education=Associate,Marital=Unmarried,Occupation=Transport,Sex=Male,Accounts=Jamaica}||2
 |-
 |(...)|| ||
 |}

To summarize the data information in &quot;transaction&quot; format use &quot;summary()&quot;. 

 summary(tableT)
 transactions as itemMatrix in sparse format with
 6 rows (elements/itemsets/transactions) and
 18 columns (items) and a density of 0.3333333 
 most frequent items:
 Employment=Private    Sex=Male    Accounts=USA 
         6                5            5 
 Marital=Civil    Education=College  (Other) 
         3                2            15 
 element (itemset/transaction) length distribution:

   Min.    1st Qu.  Median  Mean   3rd Qu.   Max. 
      6       6       6       6       6       6 
 includes extended item information - examples:
        labels			variables    	levels
 1  	Employment=Private 	Employment   	Private
 2 	Education=Associate  	Education 	Associate
 3  	Education=Bachelor  	Education  	Bachelor
 includes extended transaction information - examples:
 transaction		ID
 1            		1
 2             		2
 3             		3

To see labels of the items generated in the conversion to transaction format use “itemInfo()”:

 itemInfo(tableT)
 	'''labels'''  		'''variables'''		'''levels'''
 1	Employment=Private 	Employment      	Private
 2    	Education=Associate  	Education    		Associate
 3     	Education=Bachelor  	Education     		Bachelor
 4	Education=College  	Education      		College
 5	Education=HSgrad  	Education       	HSgrad
 6	Marital=Civil    	Marital        		Civil
 7	Marital=Divorced 	Marital     		Divorced
 8	Marital=Separated    	Marital    		Separated
 9	Marital=Unmarried    	Marital    		Unmarried
 10   	Occupation=Clerical 	Occupation     		Clerical
 11  	Occupation=Executive 	Occupation    		Executive
 12	Occupation=Repair 	Occupation       	Repair
 13    	Occupation=Service 	Occupation      	Service
 14	Occupation=Transport 	Occupation    		Transport
 15	Sex=Female       	Sex       		Female
 16	Sex=Male        	Sex         		Male
 17	Accounts=Jamaica   	Accounts      		Jamaica
 18	Accounts=USA   		Accounts 		USA

Use “labels()” to see only the labels of the itens and transactions:

 labels(tableT)
 $items
 [1]	&quot;Employment=Private&quot;	&quot;Education=Associate&quot;		&quot;Education=Bachelor&quot;   
 [4]	&quot;Education=College&quot;     &quot;Education=HSgrad&quot;      	&quot;Marital=Civil&quot;        
 [7]	&quot;Marital=Divorced&quot;      &quot;Marital=Separated&quot;  		&quot;Marital=Unmarried&quot;    
 [10]	&quot;Occupation=Clerical&quot;   &quot;Occupation=Executive&quot;  	&quot;Occupation=Repair&quot;    
 [13]	&quot;Occupation=Service&quot;    &quot;Occupation=Transport&quot;  	&quot;Sex=Female&quot;           
 [16]	&quot;Sex=Male&quot;              &quot;Accounts=Jamaica&quot;      	&quot;Accounts=USA&quot;
 $transactionID
 [1] &quot;1&quot; &quot;2&quot; &quot;3&quot; &quot;4&quot; &quot;5&quot; &quot;6&quot;

To see NB mined results use the same commands above mentioned to “transactions” data:

 paramA &lt;- NBMinerParameters(tableT, trim = 0.01, pi = 0.999, theta = 0.8, rules = TRUE, plot = FALSE, verbose = FALSE, minlen=3, maxlen=5)
 tableNB &lt;- NBMiner(tableT, parameter = paramA, control = list(verb = FALSE, debug=FALSE))
 inspect(head(tableNB))
 	lhs                     		rhs		                precision
 1	{Education=HSgrad, Sex=Male}       	=&gt; {Employment=Private}    	0.9991467
 2	{Sex=Male, Accounts=USA} 		=&gt; {Marital=Civil}		0.9999421
 3	{Sex=Male, Accounts=USA} 		=&gt; {Education=HSgrad}      	0.9977636
 4	{Education=College, Accounts=USA} 	=&gt; {Employment=Private}		0.9982934
 5	{Marital=Civil, Accounts=USA} 		=&gt; {Sex=Male}              	0.9999752
 6	{Employment=Private, Sex=Male}		=&gt; {Accounts=USA}		0.9999948

Where &quot;lhs&quot; is the antecedent of the rules and de &quot;rhs&quot; is the consequent of the rules.

We can also show the data distribution in the space with “image()” function:

 image(tableNB)
[[File:imageFunction.png]]
== Case study ==

=== Scenario ===

It contains artificial data created by Graham Williams (developer of Rattle) and is supplied with Rattle. To quote from the Rattle documentation: &quot;It consists of 2,000 fictional clients who have been audited, perhaps for compliance with regard to the amount of a tax refund that is being claimed. For each case an outcome is recorded (whether the taxpayer's claims had to be adjusted or not) and any amount of adjustment that resulted is also recorded.&quot; 

=== Input data ===

Available on http://cs.anu.edu.au/Student/comp3420/mining/audit.csv.

=== Execution ===

 table = read.table(&quot;audit.csv&quot;,sep=&quot;,&quot;,header=TRUE)
 trans = as(table,&quot;transactions&quot;)
 paramA = NBMinerParameters(tableT, trim = 0.01, pi = 0.999, theta = 0.8, rules = TRUE, plot = FALSE, verbose = FALSE, minlen=3, maxlen=5)
 transNB = NBMiner(tableT, parameter = paramA, control = list(verb = FALSE, debug=FALSE))

=== Output ===

 transNB
 set of 18158 rules 

 tableNB = as(trans,&quot;data.frame&quot;)
 write.table(tableNB,file=&quot;auditNB.csv&quot;,sep=&quot;,&quot;)

=== Analysis ===

 {| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
 !rules!!consequent!!precedent A!!precedent B!!precedent C!!precedent D
|-
|92||Accounts=China||Employment=PSState||Education=Master||Occupation=Professional

 |}

Based on the data above  we can note that when the Marital state is “Civil” and the &quot;Occupation&quot; is &quot;Professional&quot; we have an &quot;Chinese&quot; account.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Actually, this model is made without any background reference images but enough knowledge of human figure makes this possible. Modeling the human body or any model in that case requires knowledge of it beforehand. Even with the background image references, there are still some details (like the armpit) that is not easily visible or are difficult to comprehend with just simple orthogonal projections. It is advised to make some study on basic human figure and proportions first.

For those who likes to have a background reference image to use while modeling, use this orthogonal views of the model. You could still try and test your knowledge on the human figure later by trying to model one without image references.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=Blocking the Figure=

As with many models done in box modeling, let's start with a cube. The model is symmetrical so let's make use of it. Add a loop running vertically at the middle and delete the vertices on the left, leaving you with only half of the cube. Now add a mirror modifier.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:SimpleMan1.png|347px]]|2=Initial box}}

Now add a loop running horizontally and fashion out the torso.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:SimpleMan2.png|363px]]|2=Forming the torso}}

Add a vertical loop on the torso so that we will have more geometry to work on.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:SimpleMan3.png|240px]]|2=Adding more geometry}}

Extrude the head and the legs. Add loops around the head and the bottom of the legs and extrude out the head and feet.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:SimpleMan4.png|217px]]|2=Extrude head and legs}}

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:SimpleMan5.png|244px]]|2=The model at another view}}

Now add a loop around the torso and extrude out the arms. This is all for blocking

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:SimpleMan6.png|500px]]|2=Extruding out the arms}}

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:SimpleMan7.png|372px]]|2=From another view}}

=Detailing and Finishing=

Add a loop that goes through the torso and the arms and another at the sides. This geometry will enable us to round and shape the figure.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:SimpleMan8.png|633px]]|2=Adding more geometry and rounding the figure}}

Extrude out to form a rough hand. Add an extra loop around the hand and extrude out the thumb.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:SimpleMan9.png|766px]]|2=Extruding the hand and thumb}}

Add more loops around the arm, thumb and hand. Work out this additional geometry to shape the parts.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:SimpleMan10.png|984px]]|2=Shaping the hand}}

Add this loop to add more geometry on the legs and to the torso.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:SimpleMan11.png|294px]]|2=Adding geometry}}

And then shape.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:SimpleMan12.png|362px]]|2=Shaping}}

Add more loops on the leg and shape out the form.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:SimpleMan13.png|284px]]|2=Forming the legs}}

Now time to shape the foot add more geometry and shape out the foot.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:SimpleMan14.png|341px]]|2=Initial form of the foot}}

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:SimpleMan15.png|654px]]|2=Final form of the foot}} 

Now take a look at your model. Adjust the form until satisfied. Work finished.

{{Noframecenter|1=[[Image:SimpleMan16.png|402px]]|2=Doing finishing touches}}

      <text xml:space="preserve">Gene expression is regulated by the pathways of transcription, translation, and eventual modification of proteins that are formed.

Gene expression starts at the DNA level with the transcription of the DNA to form mRNA by creating the complement of the DNA using RNA polymerase. In order to initiate transcription, one needs transcription factors which are specific to regions of the DNA. Transcription factors can increase the binding of RNA polymerase. Transcription factors can be formed from the cell or can be made of complexes, such as a hormone and hormone receptor which will bind to a region in the DNA called the hormone response element. Once RNA polymerase binds, then the next level of regulation is translation.

In prokaryotes, translation can be affected by the feedback of transcription on translation such as in the trp operon.

In eukaryotes, translation is influenced by the post-transcriptional modifications and the presence of the necessary factors for translation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Animal behavior includes simple behavior such as taxis response, but can be complicated, such as mating, territoriality, spacing, kin selection, and naviagation.

;Natural Selection

;Kin Selection

;Navigation
:Animals uses compasses, maps, and path integration to orient themselves in space. Compasses provide a sense of direction. Maps provide orientation in space and both elements are required. Also included in navigation is taxis, which can be in reference to the earth, gravity, light, or other stimuli.

;Territoriality

;Mating Systems 
:Includes monogamy, polyandry, polygyny, and polygyandry. It is thought to be affected by the level of parental involvement possible.

;Monogamy
:One male to one female, often occurs in birds

      <text xml:space="preserve">Enzymes are responsible for speeding up the rate of a reaction, but not changing whether or not a reaction is favorable.

Enzymes act to reduce the activation energy of a reaction by
#increasing the local concentration of the reactant
#putting the reactants in the proper conformation
#straining the reactants to favor the transition state

Enzymes have an active site where the reactants bind and may have additional sites affecting their activity.

Enzymes' level of activity is affected by the presence of substrate and can eventually reach a maximum if all active sites are saturated.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The reproductive system includes the primary organs necessary for reproduction - ovaries and the testes, but there are accessory organs as well. For the female, there is the uterus, oviduct, breasts, and vagina. The male has the penis and scrotum for accessory organs.

==Female Reproductive==
The female reproductive system undergoes changes every month from the menstrual system, which is caused by a variety of hormones that fluctuate over the average of 28 days. The hormones involved include lutenizing hormone and follicle stimulating hormone from the anterior pituitary. Prolactin will also play a role in increasing the size and production of the mammary glands during and after pregnancy.

The eggs that start in a female were made when she was an embryo as primordial. From then, there will develop to become primary follicles. Secondary follicles build as the surrounding thecca tissue builds creating a granular layer. 

The journey of the egg starts from the ovary where it is released from the building of fluid pressure in the antrum. The secondary follicle will travel from the ovary to the oviduct where it is grabbed by cilia and then is moved from the oviduct's various regions - isthmus and ampulla. If fertilization is to occur, it will occur in the oviduct. From there it will enter the uterus and attach to the uterine lining formed by the endometrium's stratum basale. 

==Male Reproductive==
The male reproductive system starts with the sperm being produced at the seminiferous tubules of the testes. The seminiferous tubules are surrounded by supporting cells called Sertoli cells and Leydig cells. From the seminiferous tubules, sperm will travel to the epididymis to the vas defens. At the vas deferens, accessory glands like the bublourethral glands and the seminal vessicles will contribute additional fluids and nutrients to help maintain the life of the sperm.

The penis has two main regions - the corpora spongiosum and the corpus cavernousum. These flank the urethra. Recall that the male urethra has three regions, the prostatic, membranous, and the spongy.

At the tip of the penis is the glans, which may or may not be covered by the prepuce (also known as the foreskin).

== Congrats for the new project==
Hello, I've noticed your work on [[Children's Authors]] and realized that it doesn't seem to have a defined scope/direction at this point, that on my opinion puts it outside of [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]] instructional requirements. This can be easily fixed in several ways but since we have being discussing the future of another work covering stories for children, with valid content, but in a similar situation (regarding [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]]). I decided to  call your attention that discussion [[Wikibooks:Requests for deletion#Wikijunior:Tree of the Truth]] and possible ideas to save that content and provide a scope for your project...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:16, 11 February 2010 (UTC)


== developing content ==
This is a course project for a master's degree course in children's literature. Please don't decide that it has no defined scope/direction yet. It is intended to be a resource for teachers that will continue to develop over future semesters as well. The Tree of Truth project is not a suitable substitution.

{{tmbox|type=notice|text='''Wikibooks cannot accept [[Wikibooks:Copyrights|copyrighted]] materials.'''&lt;br /&gt;We [[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]] and appreciate your contributions. If [[:Children's Authors/Will Hobbs]] uses an acceptable copyleft license or the copyright holder(s) are willing to give [[Wikibooks:Boilerplate_request_for_permission|permission]] to use it under an acceptable copyleft license, then you need to include the licensing information with it. Please read [[Wikibooks:Media]] to learn more about the requirements. After 7 days if this is not addressed appropriately we will have to delete it [[WB:COPYVIO|per policy]]. If you have any questions you can ask me personally or ask in the [[WB:HELP|reading room]]. Thank you; Happy editing! &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 21:19, 26 April 2011 (UTC)}}</text>

      <comment>/* Prebuilt binary packages */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Prebuilt binary packages ==

As of 2013, prebuilt OpenSCAD packages are available on many recent Linux and BSD distributions, including Debian, Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, NetBSD and OpenBSD. Check your system's package manager for details. 

For Ubuntu systems you can also try chrysn's Ubuntu packages at his [https://launchpad.net/~chrysn/+archive/openscad launchpad PPA], or you can just copy/paste the following onto the command line: 
&lt;pre&gt;
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chrysn/openscad
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install openscad
&lt;/pre&gt;

His repositories for OpenSCAD and OpenCSG are [http://archive.amsuess.com/pool/contrib/o/openscad/ here] and [http://archive.amsuess.com/pool/main/o/opencsg/ here]. 

There is also a generic linux binary package at http://www.openscad.org that can be unpacked and run from within most linux systems. It is self contained and includes the required libraries.

== Building OpenSCAD yourself ==

If you wish to build OpenSCAD for yourself, start by installing git on your system using your package manager. Git is often packaged under the name 'scmgit' or 'git-core'. Then, get the OpenSCAD source code

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
 cd ~/
 git clone https://github.com/openscad/openscad.git
 cd openscad
&lt;/source&gt;


Then get the MCAD library, which is now included with OpenSCAD binary distributions

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
 git submodule init
 git submodule update
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Installing dependencies ===

Now download and install the dependency libraries and tools using your package manager. This includes Qt4, CGAL, GMP, cmake, MPFR, boost, OpenCSG, GLEW, Eigen2, GCC C++ Compiler, Bison, and Flex. OpenSCAD comes with a helper script that will try to fetch and install these automatically for you (note: you must have 'sudo' working for this script to work).

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
 ./scripts/uni-get-dependencies.sh
&lt;/source&gt;


Now check the version numbers against the openscad/README.md file to see if the version numbers are high enough and that no packages were accidentally missed. OpenSCAD comes with another helper script to assist in this process.

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
 ./scripts/check-dependencies.sh
&lt;/source&gt;

(Note that this detects a 'lower bound' on GLEW, not the actual version you have)

If your system passes all checks, continue to the 'Building OpenSCAD' section below. If you are missing libraries, try to search your package manager to see if it might have them under different names. If your package manager has the package but it is just too old, then read the next section on building your own dependencies.

=== Building the dependencies yourself ===

On systems that lack updated dependency libraries or tools, you can download and build your own. As of 2013, OpenSCAD comes with scripts that can do this automatically, without interfering with any system libraries, and without requiring root access, by putting everything under $HOME/openscad_deps. (It however will not build X11, Qt4, gcc, bash or other basics).


First, set up the environment variables (if you don't use bash, replace &quot;source&quot; with a single &quot;.&quot;)

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
 source scripts/setenv-unibuild.sh
&lt;/source&gt;


Then, download and build.

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
 ./scripts/uni-build-dependencies.sh 
&lt;/source&gt;

If you only need CGAL or OpenCSG, you can just run ' ./scripts/uni-build-dependencies.sh cgal' or opencsg and it will only build a single library. The complete download and build process can take anywhere from half an hour to several hours, depending on your network connection speed and system speed. It is recommended to have at least 1.5 Gigabyte of free disk space to do the full dependency build. Each time you log into a new shell and wish to re-compile OpenSCAD you need to re-run the 'source scripts/setenv-unibuild.sh' script


After completion, re-check (while running under the same shell, with the same environment variables set) to see if it worked. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
 ./scripts/check-dependencies.sh 
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Build the OpenSCAD binary ===

Once you have either downloaded or built the dependencies, you can build OpenSCAD. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
 qmake       # or qmake-qt4, depending on your distribution
 make
&lt;/source&gt;


You can also install OpenSCAD to /usr/local/ if you wish. The 'openscad' binary will be put under /usr/local/bin, the libraries and examples will be under something like /usr/local/share/openscad possibly depending on your system. Note that if you have previously installed a binary linux package of openscad, you should take care to delete /usr/local/lib/openscad and /usr/local/share/openscad because they are not the same paths as what the standard qmake-built 'install' target uses. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
 sudo make install
&lt;/source&gt;


&lt;blockquote&gt;
{| style=&quot;background-color:#ffffcc;&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot;
|'''Note:''' on Debian-based systems create a package and install OpenSCAD using:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
 sudo checkinstall -D make install
&lt;/source&gt;
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;


If you prefer not to install you can run &quot;&lt;code&gt;./openscad&lt;/code&gt;&quot; directly whilst still in the &lt;/code&gt;~/openscad&lt;/code&gt; directory.

== Compiling the test suite ==

OpenSCAD comes with over 740 regression tests. To build and run them, it is recommended to first build the GUI version of OpenSCAD by following the steps above, including the downloading of MCAD. Then, from the same login, run these commands:

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
 cd tests
 mkdir build &amp;&amp; cd build
 cmake .. 
 make
 ctest -C All
&lt;/source&gt;

The file 'openscad/doc/testing.txt' has more information. Full test logs are under &lt;code&gt;tests/build/Testing/Temporary&lt;/code&gt;. A pretty-printed index.html web view of the tests can be found under a machine-specific subdirectory thereof and opened with a browser.

== Troubleshooting ==

If you encounter any errors when building, please file an issue report at https://github.com/openscad/openscad/issues/ . 

=== Errors about incompatible library versions ===

This may be caused by old libraries living in /usr/local/lib like boost, CGAL, OpenCSG, etc, (often left over from previous experiments with OpenSCAD). You are advised to remove them. To remove, for example, CGAL, run rm -rf /usr/local/include/CGAL &amp;&amp; rm -rf /usr/local/lib/*CGAL*. Then erase $HOME/openscad_deps, remove your openscad source tree, and restart fresh. As of 2013 OpenSCAD's build process does not advise nor require anything to be installed in /usr/local/lib nor /usr/local/include. 

Note that CGAL depends on Boost and OpenCSG depends on GLEW - interdependencies like this can really cause issues if there are stray libraries in unusual places. 

Another source of confusion can come from running from within an 'unclean shell'. Make sure that you don't have LD_LIBRARY_PATH set to point to any old libraries in any strange places. Also don't mix a Mingw windows cross build with your linux build process - they use different environment variables and may conflict.

=== OpenCSG didn't automatically build ===

If for some reason the recommended build process above fails to work with OpenCSG, please file an issue on the OpenSCAD github. In the meantime, you can try building it yourself. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
  wget http://www.opencsg.org/OpenCSG-1.3.2.tar.gz
  sudo apt-get purge libopencsg-dev libopencsg1 # or your system's equivalent
  tar -xvf OpenCSG-1.3.2.tar.gz
  cd OpenCSG-1.3.2
  # edit the Makefile and remove 'example'
  make
  sudo cp -d lib/lib* $HOME/openscad_deps/lib/
  sudo cp include/opencsg.h $HOME/openscad_deps/include/
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
{| style=&quot;background-color:#ffffcc;&quot; cellpadding=&quot;10&quot;
|'''Note:''' on Debian-based systems (such as Ubuntu), you can add the 'install' target to the OpenCSG Makefile, and then use checkinstall to create a clean .deb package for install/removal/upgrade. Add this target to Makefile:
&lt;source lang=&quot;make&quot;&gt;
 install:
 	# !! THESE LINES PREFIXED WITH ONE TAB, NOT SPACES !!
 	cp -d lib/lib* /usr/local/lib/
 	cp include/opencsg.h /usr/local/include/
 	ldconfig
&lt;/source&gt;

Then:
&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
 sudo checkinstall -D make install
&lt;/source&gt;
.. to create and install a clean package.
|}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== CGAL didn't automatically build ===

If this happens, you can try to [[OpenSCAD User Manual/CGAL From Source|compile CGAL yourself]]. It is recommended to install to $HOME/openscad_deps and otherwise follow the build process as outlined above. 

=== Compiling is horribly slow and/or grinds the disk ===

It is recommended to have at least 1.2 Gbyte of RAM to compile OpenSCAD. There are a few workarounds in case you don't. The first is to use the experimental support for the Clang Compiler (described below) as Clang uses much less RAM than GCC. Another workaround is to edit the Makefile generated by qmake and search/replace the optimization flags (-O2) with -O1 or blank, and to remove any '-g' debug flags from the compiler line, as well as '-pipe'.  

If you have plenty of RAM and just want to speed up the build, you can try a paralell multicore build with 

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
  make -jx
&lt;/source&gt; 

Where 'x' is the number of cores you want to use. Remember you need x times the amount of RAM to avoid possible disk thrashing. 

The reason the build is slow is because OpenSCAD uses template libraries like CGAL, Boost, and Eigen, which use large amounts of RAM to compile - especially CGAL. GCC may take up 1.5 Gigabytes of RAM on some systems during the build of certain CGAL modules. There is [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3634203/why-are-templates-so-slow-to-compile more information at StackOverflow.com].

=== BSD issues ===

The build instructions above are designed to work unchanged on FreeBSD and NetBSD. However the BSDs typically require special environment variables set up to build any QT project - you can set them up automatically by running

    source ./scripts/setenv-unibuild.sh

NetBSD 5.x, requires a [[User:Dbright/patch_cgal_for_netbsd|patched version of CGAL]]. It is recommended to upgrade to NetBSD 6 instead as it has all dependencies available from pkgin. NetBSD also requires the X Sets to be installed when the system was created ([http://ghantoos.org/2009/05/12/my-first-shot-of-netbsd/ or added later]). 

On OpenBSD it may fail to build after running out of RAM. OpenSCAD requires at least 1 Gigabyte to build with GCC. You may have need to be a user with 'staff' level access or otherwise alter required system parameters. The 'dependency build' sequence has also not been ported to OpenBSD so you will have to rely on the standard OpenBSD system package tools (in other words you have to have root).

=== Test suite problems ===

'''Headless server'''

The test suite will try to automatically detect if you have an X11 DISPLAY environment variable set. If not, it will try to automatically start Xvfb or Xvnc (virtual X framebuffers) if they are available. 

If you want to run these servers manually, you can attempt the following:

 $ Xvfb :5 -screen 0 800x600x24 &amp;
 $ DISPLAY=:5 ctest

Alternatively:

 $ xvfb-run --server-args='-screen 0 800x600x24' ctest

There are some cases where Xvfb/Xvnc won't work. Some older versions of Xvfb may fail and crash without warning. Sometimes Xvfb/Xvnc have been built without GLX (OpenGL) support and OpenSCAD won't be able to generate any images. 

'''Image-based tests takes a long time, they fail, and the log says 'return -11' '''

Imagemagick may have crashed while comparing the expected images to the test-run generated (actual) images. You can try using the alternate ImageMagick comparison method by by erasing CMakeCache, and re-running cmake with   &lt;code&gt;-DCOMPARATOR=ncc&lt;/code&gt;. This will enable the Normalized Cross Comparison method which is more stable, but possibly less accurate and may give false positives or negatives.

'''Testing images fails with 'morphology not found&quot; for ImageMagick in the log'''

Your version of imagemagick is old. Upgrade imagemagick, or pass -DCOMPARATOR=old to cmake. The comparison will be of lowered reliability.

=== I moved the dependencies I built and now openscad won't run ===

It isn't advised to move them because the build is using RPATH hard coded into the openscad binary. You may try to workaround by setting the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable to place yourpath/lib first in the list of paths it searches. If all else fails, you can re-run the entire dependency build process but export the BASEDIR environment variable to your desired location, before you run the script to set environment variables.

== Tricks and tips ==

=== Reduce space of dependency build === 

After you have built the dependencies you can free up space by removing the $BASEDIR/src directory - where $BASEDIR defaults to $HOME/openscad_deps.

=== Preferences ===

OpenSCAD's config file is kept in ~/.config/OpenSCAD/OpenSCAD.conf. 

=== Setup environment to start developing OpenSCAD in Ubuntu 11.04 ===

The following paragraph describes an easy way to setup a development environment for OpenSCAD in Ubuntu 11.04. After executing the following steps QT Creator can be used to graphically start developing/debugging OpenSCAD.
* Add required PPA repositories:
&lt;source  lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
# sudo add-apt-repository ppa:chrysn/openscad
&lt;/source&gt;
* Update and install required packages:
&lt;source  lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
# sudo apt-get update
# sudo apt-get install git build-essential qtcreator libglew1.5-dev libopencsg-dev libcgal-dev libeigen2-dev bison flex
&lt;/source&gt;
* Get the OpenSCAD sources:
&lt;source  lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
# mkdir ~/src
# cd ~/src
# git clone https://github.com/openscad/openscad.git
&lt;/source&gt;
* Build OpenSCAD using the command line:
&lt;source  lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
# cd ~/src/openscad
# qmake
# make
&lt;/source&gt;
* Build OpenSCAD using QT Creator:
Just open the project file openscad.pro (CTRL+O) in QT Creator and hit the build all (CTRL+SHIFT+B) and run button (CTRL+R).

=== The Clang Compiler ===

There is experimental support for building with the Clang compiler under linux. Clang is faster, uses less RAM, and has different error messages than GCC. To use it, first of all you will need CGAL of at least version 4.0.2, as prior versions have a bug that makes clang unusable. Then, run this script before you build OpenSCAD. 

&lt;source lang=&quot;bash&quot;&gt;
 source scripts/setenv-unibuild.sh clang
&lt;/source&gt;

Clang support depends on your system's QT installation having a clang enabled qmake.conf file. For example, on Ubuntu, this is under /usr/share/qt4/mkspecs/unsupported/linux-clang/qmake.conf. BSD clang-building may require a good deal of fiddling and is untested, although eventually it is planned to move in this direction as the BSDs (not to mention OSX) are moving towards favoring clang as their main compiler.

== Binary trees ==
A binary tree can be defined recursively as
* an empty tree, containing no nodes '''or'''
* a '''node''', called the '''root''', usually containing some data, with at most 2 subtrees, each of which is itself a binary tree
==Terminology==
'''Node''' - a part of the tree holding some data&lt;br /&gt;

'''Branches''' - connections between nodes&lt;br /&gt;

'''Root''' - the node that has no parent, i.e., is at the top of the tree&lt;br /&gt;

'''Leaf''' - a node that has no subtrees, i.e., is at the bottom of the tree&lt;br /&gt;

'''Parent''' - a node that is connected to the root of a subtree&lt;br /&gt;

'''Level''' - all the nodes that are at the same depth in the tree, i.e., there are the same number of branches to get 'back to' the root, are at the same level. The root is at level 0&lt;br /&gt;

'''Child''' - the root of a subtree that is connected 'upwards' to its parent&lt;br /&gt;

'''Sibling''' - the next node at the same level

==Binary tree search==
Thinking of any particular binary tree, how many searches will it take to find a certain item?

==Efficiency==
Thinking of any particular binary tree, how many searches will it take to find a certain item (in the best and worst cases) if the tree has ''n'' nodes?&lt;br /&gt;

Does the number of searches (in both cases) differ depending on whether the item is in the tree or not?&lt;br /&gt;

Does the number of searches (in both cases) depend on the structure of the tree?&lt;br /&gt;

What '''is''' the worst case?
What '''is''' the best case?

A binary tree has ''n'' items in it, and takes ''s'' searches (in the worst case) to find an item. If another n items are added to the tree how many searches will it need to find an item (in the worst case) if the tree is perfectly balanced, i.e., each node (apart from the leaf nodes) has two subtrees.
==Balance==
A '''perfectly balanced''' binary tree is one where every node, has 0 or 2 subtrees. The leaves have 0 subtrees, and the 'internal' nodes each have 2.

==Stack, queue and list operations==

==Simple graph traversal algorithms==
(see: [http://www.aqa.org.uk/subjects/ict-and-computer-science/a-level/computing-2510/teaching-and-learning-resources AQA supplementary materials], document called: 'Unit guide: COMP3 - Graph traversals')

A graph traversal algorithm aims to 'explore' every vertex.

If the algorithm is searching for a particular vertex (eg. the exit to a maze) then it considers whether each vertex is the one it is looking for.

After evaluation, if it has not found what it was looking for, the algorithm adds every vertex adjacent to the current one onto a 'list' of vertices to visit next.


The type of structure used to store this 'list' of vertices determines how the algorithm moves through the graph.
*Queue
**FIFO (first in, first out)
**&lt;math&gt;\implies&lt;/math&gt; siblings are processed before their children
**&lt;math&gt;\implies&lt;/math&gt; 'Breadth-first traversal'
**all vertices on the same level are processed before moving to the next level
*Stack
**LIFO (last in, first out)
**&lt;math&gt;\implies&lt;/math&gt; children are processed before the siblings of the current vertex
**&lt;math&gt;\implies&lt;/math&gt; 'Depth-first traversal'


These algorithms also have to keep tack of the state of each vertex:
*Undiscovered
**The algorithm has yet to discover this vertex
*Discovered
**A vertex is discovered once the algorithm has evaluated the vertex, and added its children to the list of vertices to visit. However not all of them have been evaluated yet
*Completely explored/Processed
**All adjacent vertices have been discovered

==Simulations==


Simulates real life and imaginary life. Think about computer games. Lets you try things out that you wouldn't be able to in real life for cost / time reasons.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

The philosophy of operation of any algorithm based on decision trees is quite simple. In fact, although sometimes containing important differences in the way to do this or that step, any algorithm of this category is based on the strategy of divide and conquer. In general, this philosophy is based on the successive division of the problem into several subproblems with a smaller number of dimensions, until a solution for each of the simpler problems can be found. Based on this principle, the classifiers based on decision trees try to find ways to divide the universe into successively more subgroups (creating nodes containing the respective tests) until each addressing only one class or until one of the classes shows a clear majority do not justifying further divisions, generating in this situation a leaf containing the class majority. Obviously, the classification is only to follow the path dictated by the successive test placed along the tree until it found a leaf containing the class to assign to the new example.

[[File:TreeDT.png|thumb|center|500px|Example a classifier based on a decision tree]]

Although the basic philosophy of all the classifiers based on decision trees is identical, there are many possibilities for its construction. Among all the key points in the selection of an algorithm to build decision trees some of them should be highlighted for their importance:

:* Criteria for the choice of feature to be used in each node
:* How to calculate the partition of the set of examples
:* When you decide that a node is a leaf
:* What is the criterion to select the class to assign to each leaf

Some important advantages can be pointed to the decision trees, including:

:* Can be applied to any type of data
:* The final structure of the classifier is quite simple and can be stored and handled in a graceful manner
:* Handles very efficiently conditional information, subdividing the space into sub-spaces that are handled individually
:* Reveal normally robust and insensitive to misclassification in the training set
:* The resulting trees are usually quite understandable and can be easily used to obtain a better understanding of the phenomenon in question. This is perhaps the most important of all the advantages listed

== Algorithm ==

The basic algorithm for decision tree is the greedy algorithm that constructs decision trees in a top-down recursive divide-and-conquer manner. We usually employ greedy strategies because they are efficient and easy to implement, but they usually lead to sub-optimal models. A bottom-up approach could also be used.
The top-down decision tree algorithm is given in Algorithm 1. It is a recursive divide-and-conquer algorithm. It takes a subset of data D as input and evaluate all possible splits (Lines 4 to 11). The best split decision (Line 12), i.e. the split with the highest information gain, is chosen to partition the data in two subsets (divide-and-conquer) and the method is called recursively (Lines 14 and 15). The algorithm stops when the stop conditions are met (Line 1 to 3).

===Stopping Criteria===

A number of stopping conditions can be used to stop the recursive process. The algorithm stops when any one of the conditions is true:

:* All the samples belong to the same class, i.e. have the same label since the sample is already &quot;pure&quot;
:* Stop if most of the points are already of the same class. This is a generalization of the first approach, with some error threshold
:* There are no remaining attributes on which the samples may be further partitioned
:* There are no samples for the branch test attribute

=== Attribute Selection===

We now need an objective criteria for judging how good a split is. The information gain measure is used to select the test attribute at each node in the tree. The attribute with the highest information gain (or greatest entropy reduction) is chosen as the test attribute for the current node. This attribute minimizes the information needed to classify the samples in the resulting partitions.

Entropy, in general, measures the amount of disorder or uncertainty in a system. In the classification setting, higher entropy (i.e., more disorder) corresponds to a sample that has a mixed collection of labels. Lower entropy corresponds to a case where we have mostly pure partitions. In information theory, the entropy of a sample ''D'' is defined as follows:

::&lt;math&gt;H(D) = - \sum_{i=1}^{k} P(c_i|D) \log_{2}{P(c_i|D)} &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P(ci|D)&lt;/math&gt; is the probability of a data point in ''D'' being labeled with class &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt;, and ''k'' is the number of classes. &lt;math&gt;P(ci|D)&lt;/math&gt; can be estimated directly from the data as follows:

::&lt;math&gt;P(c_i|D) = \tfrac{|\{x_j \in D | x_j \text{ has label } y_j = c_i\}|}{|D|} &lt;/math&gt;

We can also define the weighted entropy of a decision/split as follows:

::&lt;math&gt;H(D_L,D_R) = \tfrac{|D_L|}{|D|}H(D_L) + \tfrac{|D_R|}{|D|}H(D_R)&lt;/math&gt;

where ''D'' has been partitioned into &lt;math&gt;D_L&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;D_R&lt;/math&gt; due to some split decision. Finally, we can define the information gain for a given split as:

::&lt;math&gt;Gain(D,D_L,D_R) = H(D) - H(D_L,D_R)&lt;/math&gt;

In other words, ''Gain'' is the expected reduction in entropy caused by knowing the value of an attribute.

==Rpart==

The rpart package found in the R tool can be used for classification by decision trees and can also be used to generate regression trees. Recursive partitioning is a fundamental tool
in data mining. It helps us explore the structure of a set of data, while developing easy
to visualize decision rules for predicting a categorical (classification tree) or continuous
(regression tree) outcome. The rpart programs build classification or regression models
of a very general structure using a two stage procedure; the resulting models can be
represented as binary trees. 
The tree is built by the following process: first the single variable is found which best
splits the data into two groups ('best' will be defined later). The data is separated, and
then this process is applied separately to each sub-group, and so on recursively until the
subgroups either reach a minimum size (5 for this data) or until no improvement can be
made.
The resultant model is, with certainty, too complex, and the question arises as it does
with all stepwise procedures of when to stop. The second stage of the procedure consists
of using cross-validation to trim back the full tree.

==Grow the Tree==

To grow a tree, use

     rpart (formula, data=, method=, control=)

where:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
|formula ||  is in the format: outcome ~ predictor1+predictor2+predictor3+ect.
|-
|data= || specifies the dataframe
|-
|method= || &quot;class&quot; for a classification tree &quot;anova&quot; for a regression tree
|-
|control= || optional parameters for controlling tree growth. For example, control=rpart.control(minsplit=30, cp=0.001) requires that the minimum number of observations in a node be 30 before attempting a split and that a split must decrease the overall lack of fit by a factor of 0.001 (cost complexity factor) before being attempted.

|}

==Visualization and Examples==

===printcp===

The command printcp displays the cp table for fitted rpart object. Prints a table of optimal
prunings based on a complexity parameter.

'''Usage'''

     printcp(object, digits=getOption(&quot;digits&quot;) - 2)

where object is an rpart object and digits is the number of digits of numbers to print.

Example:

     fit &lt;- rpart(Price ~ HP, car.test.frame)
     printcp(fit)

Output
     Regression tree:
     rpart(formula = Price ~ HP, data = car.test.frame)
     Variables actually used in tree construction:
     [1] HP
     Root node error: 983551497/60 = 16392525
     n= 60
     CP nsplit rel error xerror xstd
     1 0.41417 0 1.00000 1.03808 0.21528
     2 0.12304 1 0.58583 0.71817 0.15575
     3 0.01000 2 0.46279 0.62650 0.11675

===plotcp===

The command plotcp gives a visual representation of the cross-validation results in an rpart object. The set of possible cost-complexity prunings of a tree from a nested set. For the geometric means of the intervals of values of cp for which a pruning is optimal, a cross-validation has (usually) been done in the initial construction by rpart. The cptable in the fit contains the mean and standard deviation of the errors in the cross-validated prediction against each of the geometric means, and these are plotted by this function.
A good choice of cp for pruning is often the leftmost value for which the mean lies below
the horizontal line.

'''Usage'''

     plotcp(object, minline = TRUE, lty = 3, col = 1, upper = c(&quot;size&quot;, &quot;splits&quot;, &quot;none&quot;), args)

Where object is an rpart object, minline is whether a horizontal line is drawn 1SE
above the minimum of the curve, lty is the line type for this line, col is the colour for this
line upper what is plotted on the top axis: the size of the tree (the number of leaves), the
number of splits or nothing and args are the arguments to be passed to or from other
methods.

Example:

     fit &lt;- rpart(Kyphosis ~ Age + Number + Start, method=&quot;class&quot;, data=kyphosis)
     plotcp(fit)

[[File:first_plot.png|thumb|center|500px]]

where
object is an rpart object, minlength controls the abbreviation of labels, spaces is the
number of spaces to indent nodes of increasing depth, digits is the number of digits of
numbers to print, cp prune all nodes with a complexity less than cp from the printout and
args are the arguments to be passed to or from other methods.

Example:

     fit &lt;- rpart(Kyphosis ~ Age + Number + Start, method=&quot;class&quot;, data=kyphosis)
     print(fit)

     n= 81
     node), split, n, loss, yval, (yprob)

===plot (and text)===

Plots an rpart object on the current graphics device as a decision tree. The function text label the decision tree plot.

'''Usage'''

     plot(object, uniform=FALSE, branch=1, compress=FALSE, nspace, margin=0, minbranch=.3, args)

===post===

Create a PostScript presentation plot of an rpart object.

'''Usage'''

     plot(object, uniform=FALSE, branch=1, compress=FALSE, nspace, margin=0, minbranch=.3, args)

Object is an rpart object, uniform if TRUE uniform vertical spacing of the nodes is used, branch controls the shape of the branches from parent to child node, compress if FALSE, the leaf nodes will be at the horizontal plot coordinates of 1:nleaves, if TRUE, the routine attempts a more compact arrangement of the tree, nspace is the amount of extra space between a node with children and a leaf, margin is an extra percentage of white space to leave around the borders of the tree, minbranch set the minimum length for a branch to minbranch times the average branch length and args are the arguments to be passed to or from other methods.

Example:

     fit &lt;- rpart(Mileage ~ Weight, car.test.frame)
     post(fit, file = &quot;&quot;, title=&quot;Classification Tree for Wikibook&quot;)
     post(fit, file = &quot;c:/output.ps&quot;, title = &quot; Classification Tree for Wikibook&quot;)

== Case Study ==

=== Scenario and Input data ===

Consider the relational database in the table below, whose schema is composed of
attributes Play, Outlook, Temperature, Humidity and Windy. A decision tree allows
predicting the values of the attribute Play, given that we know the values for attributes
like Outlook, Humidity and Windy.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! weather !!Temperature !! Humidity !! Wind !! Golf play
|-
|fine ||  hot   || high || none || no  
|-
|fine ||  hot   || high || few || no
|
|cloud || hot || high  ||  none  || yes
|-
| rain ||  warm   || high || none  || yes
|-
|rain ||  cold   || mediam || none || yes
|-
|rain ||  cold   || mediam || few || no
|-
|cloud || cold   || mediam || few || yes
|-
|fine ||  warm   || heigh  || none || no
|-
|fine ||  cold || mediam ||  none  || yes
|-
|rain  || warm    || mediam || none   || yes
|-
|fine ||  warm || mediam ||  few  || yes
|-
|cloud  || warm    || high || few   || yes
|-
|cloud  || hot    || mediam || none   || yes
|-
|rain ||  warm || high ||  few  || no
|}

Importing data into R is simple. From a comma delimited text (CSV) file whose the first
row contains variable names we can use the command below:

     play_base &lt;- read.table(&quot;path_to_the_file/play.csv&quot;, header=TRUE, sep=&quot;,&quot;)

We can use the command ''print(play_base)'' or just ''play_base'' to see the loaded table
and the command &quot;summary(play_base)&quot; to see a detailed listing of the rpart object:

     Play    Outlook      Temperature   Humidity   Windy
     no :3   overcast:2   cool:5        high :4    false:7
     yes:7   rainy :4     hot :2        normal:6   true :3
             sunny :4     mild:3

=== Execution and Output ===

After we have loaded the data we need to build the decision tree. The &quot;Play&quot; attribute is
the outcome that will the predicted. We can use the command below:

     fit &lt;- rpart(Play ~ Outlook + Temperature + Humidity + Wind, method=&quot;class&quot;, data=play_base,
     control=rpart.control(minsplit=1))

We can use the command ''summary(fit)'' to see a detailed listing of the loaded decision
tree and the command ''print(fit)'' to see the decision tree:

     1) root 10 3 yes (0.3000000 0.7000000)
       2) Temperature= mild 3 1 no (0.6666667 0.3333333)
         4) Outlook= sunny 2 0 no (1.0000000 0.0000000) *
         5) Outlook= overcast 1 0 yes (0.0000000 1.0000000) *
       3) Temperature= cool, hot 7 1 yes (0.1428571 0.8571429)
         6) Windy= true 1 0 no (1.0000000 0.0000000) *
         7) Windy= false 6 0 yes (0.0000000 1.0000000) *

The commands below plots an rpart object on the current graphics device as a decision
tree:

     plot(fit, uniform=TRUE, main=&quot;Decision Tree - Play?&quot;)
     text(fit, use.n=TRUE, all=TRUE, cex=.8)

[[File:Play_or_not_play.png|thumb|center|500px|Play or not to play]]

=== Analysis ===

The building of a decision tree starts with a description of a problem which should specify
the variables, actions and logical sequence for a decision-making. In a decision tree,
a process leads to one or more conditions that can be brought to an action or other
conditions, until all conditions determine a particular action, once built you can have a
graphical view of decision-making.

The decision tree generated to solve the problem, the sequence of steps described
determines and the weather conditions, verify if it is a good choice to play or not to play.
For instance, in the sequence of conditions ''(temperature = mild) -&gt; (Outlook = overcast)''
''-&gt; play = yes'', whereas in the sequence ''(temperature = cold) -&gt; (Windy = true) -&gt; play''
''= no''. This shows that a decision tree is a great tool for making decisions. Thus, this
method of classification may become an excellent tool for obtaining information, which
often organizations do not know they have, and which are extremely important to the
tactical and management level.

== Formatting ==

Hi,

I noticed you were adding blank lines to a page you're working on, probably to force the text to come after the images.  A better way to do this would be to add &lt;nowiki&gt;{{clear}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to the places where you'd like to see a page break.  Hope that helps! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 13:30, 10 November 2010 (UTC)

I like your changes, why don't you register an ACCOUNT and stop being anonymous [[User:Baka SD|Baka SD]] ([[User talk:Baka SD|talk]]) 13:37, 10 November 2010 (UTC)
:There are good reasons to create an account besides getting a username.  Your privacy is actually better protected because your IP address will be hidden from the public (and your IP address gives away your geographic location).  Another reason is that vandals often do their deeds via anonymous accounts, and their changes tend to attract greater scrutiny.  Registered users' changes can be hidden in the [[Special:RecentChanges|Recent Changes]] page to make patrolling for vandalism a little easier.  But whether you choose to create an account or not, we welcome your additions.  Thanks! --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 13:48, 10 November 2010 (UTC)

=== Usage ===

&lt;nowiki&gt;{{substr|&lt;/nowiki&gt;''text''|''start''|''length''&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; = Substring of ''text'' starting at ''start'' and containing ''length'' characters. Base 0: the first character is numbered 0, and so on, e.g. &lt;nowiki&gt;{{substr|20090624130510|8|2}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; returns the 2 characters starting at the 9th, i.e. &quot;{{substr|20090624130510|8|2}}&quot;

''start'' + ''length'' must be less than 50.  Only operates on a limited character set.

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{FUN-top|both=1|alttitle2=Setting up Trainz properly for yourself}}
The '''[[w:INI file|INI file]] Trainzoptions.txt''' is used by the loader module (the [[w:EXE file|EXE file]] which any Trainz shortcuts link to and load) to initialize the Trainz run time [[w:Graphical user interface|Graphical user interface (GUI)]] modules and so provides the means to define the start up state of Trainz. This is one of the few underlying complexities the new Trainzer will not need to alter, but will want to change early in their experiences with the Trainz operating environments. (See rule of thumb note preceeding tables)
{{TOCright}}
N3V/Auran provides a reasonable starting point that appears to provide optimal performance for most users, but play it very conservatively on the default video mode, initializing Trainz with the basic 1024x768 [[w:Super video graphics array|Super-VGA (SVGA)]] mode. 

Various parts of the excellent Trainz .pdf manuals identify typical options you may use in the Trainz options settings file. The options listed below will likely not work for all versions of Trainz. In particular, many one-time options affecting performance throughput have been rendered ineffective in TRS2012-SP1.

==Examples==
:'''Note:''' ''The following display data are settings for the Native Mode of the video monitor. Trainz releases post Trainz Classics 3 will set the width and height to {{wp|Super video graphics array|SVGA common settings}} (1024 x 768), but the actual video display mode is set in the Launcher &gt; '''Options Menu''' in these N3V era later versions.
* The following is a (laptop) '''trainzoptions.txt file''' still in day-to-day use on a beloved TRS2006 installation:
 -DepthBits=24 
 -StencilBits=8	
 -fullscreen
 -width=1280
 -height=800
 -Jet=bin
 -cabinfov=75
 -driverfov=65
 -DefaultAutoMip=none
 -vsync=0 &amp;nbsp; &amp;mdash; &amp;nbsp; (now options setting after TS2009)
 -showcachebar &amp;nbsp; &amp;mdash; &amp;nbsp; (no effect after TS2009)
 -allownoctrlrightclick
 -freeintcam
 -showkuids
 -time=0.0
&amp;nbsp;
&lt;hr&gt;
* The following is a tower/desktop '''trainzoptions.txt file''' for a modern computer and graphics card (with embedded in-file comments) using a medium small display (1440 x 900) in day-to-day use on EACH OF TS2009, TS2010 and TS2012 installations: 
&lt;pre&gt;
-DepthBits=24
-StencilBits=8
-Jet=bin
/// Org settings
///-cabinfov=60
///-width=1024
///-height=768
-Intro=disable &amp;nbsp; &amp;mdash; &amp;nbsp; (no effect after TS2009, some Windows versions required for pre-TS2009 versions)
-cabinfov=74.7975
-driverfov=63.9863
-surveyorfov=65
-DefaultAutoMip=none
-DynamicVertexBufferSize=4194304
-DynamicIndexBufferSize=196608
-VBO
-framerate=200
///-showcachebar
-allownoctrlrightclick
-width=1440
-height=900
-showkuids
-freeintcam
///-fullscreen (default) &amp;nbsp; &amp;mdash; &amp;nbsp; (now options setting after TS2009)
-windowed &amp;nbsp; &amp;mdash; &amp;nbsp; (now options setting after TS2009, but telling myself here doesn't hurt)
&lt;/pre&gt;
*'''''As a rule of thumb''', if there is a setting nowadays for a parameter in the Trainz Options Menu tabs off the Launcher screen), it need not be tweaked in the Trainzoptions.txt ini file.
** New users will benefit most by installing '''-allownoctrlrightclick''' and '''-freeintcam''' options. The first allows you to check things easier when driving with a single right click hold. The second also used in [[Trainz\Driver|Driver]] enables an offset from the attachment point of one camera view inside the cab ('''INT'''ernal Camera viewpoint)&amp;mdash;the offset is set by using arrow keys to slide forward or back, left and right, so the camera view (Toggled by '[' and ']' keys) 
** Interested in modeling your own route, then '''-showkuids''' is useful in surveyor when cherry picking assets from someone else's route for your own route under construction. People that have lavished man-years on a well done route will be insulted if you don't snoop their creations. It's the best way to see an assets visual effect. Thumbnails give no scale.
** The most frequently altered parameters by power trainz users is the '''surveyorfov''' of the three FOV (Field of View) settings... for a particular temporary situation. (Low numbers allow close detailing work, larger numbers more vista to get better overall 'wide views'.

==Table notations==
Use caution when using these options as it may result in Trainz not starting at all. You should preserve a copy of a known working trainzoptions.txt file so you can revert to it in the event of a corrupted or non-working file.

* In the following table, '''Opt''' or '''Yes''' means the feature is enabled in newer Trainz releases, meaning after the TRS2006&amp;mdash;TC3 series; a Status='''Obs'''(olete) means the entry was for a much lower graphical video card environment that is relatively useless in today's Hi-Definition monitors.
{{TrainzTip|Reminder: Trainz Defaults to the [[w:SVGA|SVGA]] ''standard 1024 x 768 pixels'' unless the video is set up in the Options button from the Launcher screen menu.
}}
*&lt;div style=&quot;background:#c9c9c9;&quot;&gt;Legacy items with little or no relevance in today's Trainz releases have been given a light grey background color.&lt;/div&gt;
*&lt;div style=&quot;background:#F08080;&quot;&gt;Trainzoptions items active through Trainz Classics (TC3's tech-level improvements) Trainz Service Pack releases have been given a LightCoral&lt;!--

---&gt; background color; signifying the option has been discontinued in later newer Trainz versions, starting with the release of TRS2009.&lt;/div&gt;
*&lt;div style=&quot;background:#3CB371;&quot;&gt;Trainzoptions items active through TRS2009's Trainz Service Pack releases have been given a light medium green background color; signifying the option has been discontinued in later newer Trainz versions.&lt;/div&gt;

{{TrainzTip|The below table will seem bewildering and perhaps worrisome to new Trainz users. Historically, most Trainzers have only a small number of the below in their Trainzoptions .INI files. &lt;br&gt;
*Most common would be: {the set: -allownoctrlrightclick, -debug, -driverfov, -height, -fullscreen, -freeintcam, -ShowKuids -surveyorfov, -width }&amp;nbsp;for average computers and average users. }}

|-
| -800|| Obs||Yes
|Equivalent to specifying &quot;-width=800&quot; and &quot;-height=600&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;This is the old obsolete IBM PC early SVGA graphics card standard (ca. 1990) display resolution, which soon lost out to 1024 x 768 SVGA in the hurly-burly of the battle of graphics cards technologies.
|
|-
| -1024|| Obs|| Yes
|Equivalent to specifying &quot;-width=1024&quot; and &quot;-height=768&quot;.
- Trainz typically defaults to this resolution during setup and may 'forget' Options Settings during Service Pack upgrades.
| v1.0 up
|-
| -allownoctrlrightclick|| - ||yes
|Removes the requirement to have to hold down the CTRL key when right clicking an object in driver to see info about the object. Probably TRS2006 and later.
| TRS2006 up
|-
| -autopilotsignaldistance = XXX|| - ||???
|Modifies the autopilot signal-visibility distance, specified in meters. Default value is 200m. Smaller values are not permitted. This will affect how the autopilot reacts to the signals - how soon it will begin to slow down and how close to the signal it will attempt to stop.
|
|-
| -cabinfov|| - || Yes
| Changes the field of view in Driver inside the Locomotive CAB (Control Cabin). Large numbers are wider view and smaller numbers allow you to zoom in more. Adjusting this setting for some sessions can help one to better operate inside that CAB.
|related:&lt;br/&gt;-driverfov&lt;br/&gt;-surveyorfov
|-
| -debug|| - || Yes
|Including this option enables debug mode. The main feature of debug mode is that it allows you to accelerate the game speed by holding down the Shift key. This can be useful for content creators that might want to test their sessions more quickly. However debug mode is not an 'officially supported' feature and the behavior of Trainz in not guaranteed when using the Shift speed-up.

|Default 0 (carz enabled). If set to 1 (carz disabled, over-rides route/map ''''''carrate'''''' setting), so ensures then that Trainzcarz will not appear on roads. This may (unconfirmed officially) result in smoother framerates as offloads calculations tasks on Computer CPU and Graphics Processor. (Consider use only on huge routes generating stuttering and pauses else leave alone.)
|
|-
| -DisableEnvMap|| cur || unk
|Causes Trainz to not render Environmental (mini) maps. This may improve performance on certain minimum-spec (or lower) graphics cards.
|
|-
| -disablefog || cur || Yes?
|Causes fog to be completely disabled. This may give some relief to less capable computers and graphics cards, as particles such as fog and smoke need calculations for each display frame shown.
|
|-
| -disablerailjointsound || cur || Yes?
|Disables the rail joint &quot;clickity-click&quot; sound.
|Probably TRS2006 and later. 
|-
| -disableztest || cur ||Yes
|Turns off z-buffer testing for coronas (signal flares, headlights, sun.) This will make the flares shine *through* other objects, however will reduce'' 'graphics artifacts' ''with the ground and train clipping the flare.
|
|-
| -dualhead|| cur || Yes
|Enables support for dual-display mode. This will only work if you have two displays attached to a single video card acting as a single, large display (i.e. single frame-buffer). This won't work if there are two displays on different video cards or configured to act as independent displays. Currently dualhead support is only utilized in the Driver module. This option requires that a dualhead resolution is selected (ie. 8:3 ratio) and that Trainz is run in fullscreen mode. On some video cards this option may require you to manually switch to the appropriate resolution prior to launching Trainz.
|
|-bgcolor=&quot;#c9c9c9&quot;
| -filter=XXX|| Obs || Unk
|Specify the texture filtering mode. Default is trilinear which provides the best visual results. Other options are bilinear and none. This option is unlikely to provide performance gains, except perhaps on minimum-spec (or lower) graphics cards. [Setting nowfrom TS2009 in Options Menu Tabs]
|
|-
| -framerate=XXX|| cur* || Yes
|Requests that Trainz limit the frame rate to the specified number of fps. Now set by N3V software and initialized in the ini file on first startup. May help with maintaining a stable frame rate on faster machines. 
* Earliest versions accepting: Some reported doesn't appear to work with vsync enabled.
| 
|-
| -framestoaverage=XXX|| unk || Yes
|This option controls the 'smoothing' of frame rate timing. Increasing this option may result in less visual 'stutter', however can cause period 'surges' if rapid changes in frame rate occur. Increasing this option may be useful for high-end machines with fast graphics cards where the frame rate remains fairly constant. Default is 4, maximum is currently 16, minimum is 1 (no averaging.)

|Causes Trainz to take over the chosen display. This is the preferred mode. Some very experienced users&lt;!--Jcitron---&gt; have reported TRS2012-SP1+hot fixes runs much smoother in windowed mode. -fullscreen will be set by default when Trainz installs.
|
|-
| -heartbeat=XXX|| - || Yes
|Specify the time interval at which the physics heartbeat occurs (in seconds). Defaults to 0.03sec. Larger intervals decrease processor usage for physics at the expense of accuracy. Intervals larger than 0.05sec are not recommended. Changing this option is probably unnecessary and may have a negative impact on physics accuracy.
|
|- style=&quot;background:#F08080;&quot;
| -height=XXX|| Obs|| Opt
|Manually specify the window/screen height (in pixels). When in fullscreen mode, this must match the Width setting used. Width-to Height ratios other than 4:3 are untested. When in dualhead or surround modes, this is still the vertical height of a single display. From Trainz 2009, height and width settings in the Options Settings API over-ride the INI file.

This will only work if you have three displays attached to a single video card acting as a single, large display (ie. single frame-buffer.) This won't work if there are three displays on different video cards or configured to act as independent displays. Currently surround gaming support is only utilized in the Driver module. This option requires that a surround gaming resolution is selected (ie. 12:3 ratio) and that Trainz is run in fullscreen mode. On some video cards this option may require you to switch to the appropriate resolution prior to launching Trainz.
|
|-
| -surveyorfov=75  || Cur || 
|Changes the field of view in Surveyor. Large numbers are wider view and smaller numbers allow you to zoom in more, so get closer detailing terrain. 55 is default.
|
|-
| -vsync=XXX || Cur || 
|Activates automatic 'vertical sync'. This option may be overridden by the video card driver settings. When active, vertical sync results in smoother updates (no visual tearing) but lower frame rates. This is usually a good thing. This is equivalent to &quot;-vsync = 1&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt; Allows finer control over vsync, attempting to synch to every second frame (&quot;-vsync=2&quot;) or every third frame (&quot;-vsync=3&quot;) etc. Larger numbers lower the maximum possible frame rate further but may improve the chance of achieving a steady frame rate. Probably not useful for most people.
|
|-
| -width=XXX || Cur || Yes
|Manually specify the window/screen width (in pixels). When in fullscreen mode, this must match one of the available display resolutions, and an appropriate height must be selected. When in dualhead or surround modes this is the horizontal resolution across all displays, not across a single display.
|
|-
| -windowcentered || Cur || Opt
|Centres a Trainz window on the screen when running in windowed mode?
|
|-
| -windowed || Cur || Opt
|Causes Trainz to run in a window, so ''should not concurrently be used with '''-fullscreen''' option.'' This was found to originally (TRS2006 era) be useful for debugging, however some others thought it might result in reduced frame rate and cause visual 'stutters', especially in DirectX mode. Such conflicting interpretations may be the result of differences in graphics card capabilities in that era (2005 to 2009) and newer technology now contains as minimums what was fancy then.
- In TS12-SP1 experienced Trainzers like computer professionals Jcitron finds (and recommends) the opposite (given an advanced graphics card and 64 bit machine and OS), that for him frame rates are up and Trainz runs smoother when windowed using Directx. Also confirmed by Will Woods making systemic study of TS12 vs. TS12-SP1 behaviors in July-August 2013 for Yesterdayz Trainz user group.
|
|-
| -zfar=XXXX || Cur || Opt
|Override the default z-buffer far distance of graphics processors and video cards. Specified in meters. The default is 1500m. Decreasing the far distance will result in slightly improved z-buffer accuracy but will result in far-away objects not being visible (Note: this may not result in a speed gain if a high draw distance is specified in the ''Trainz Options' ''''tuning screens'''''' as Trainz will still consider the far-away objects as visible (so run calculations to generate far terrain and features) even if the video card is unable to render them.) Increasing the z-buffer distance probably isn't useful as Trainz doesn't allow the selection of draw distances greater than about 1300m, and the z-buffer accuracy will be decreased causing visual artifacts.
|
|-
| -znear=XXX || Cur || 
|Override the default z-buffer near distance. Specified in meters. The default is 0.1 meters. Smaller numbers allow the viewing of objects closer than 10cm but rapidly decrease the z-buffer accuracy and will cause visual artifacts on most graphics cards. Larger numbers will improve the z-buffer accuracy and may provide less artifacts, especially in 16-bit depth buffer modes, however there may be problems viewing nearby objects such as inside cabin view.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Creating Your World ==
A sky sphere is the boundary surrounding your world, projecting an image which appears to go into the horizon. Creating the sphere itself in Blender is easy. Just create a new UVSphere, with 16 segments and rings. Don't worry about the size for now, we can adjust this in XNA.

[[File:Blender_SkySphere1.png|center]]

Next up, using the same process as with the eye previously, mark the seam down the middle of the sphere, and unwrap it.

[[File:Blender_SkySphere2.png|center]]

With this, paint a simple sea texture onto the image.

[[File:Blender_SkySphere3.png|center]]

And map it onto the sphere. Finally, with all the faces selected, push space and select 'Edit'/'Normals'/'Flip'.

[[File:Blender_SkySphere4.png|center]]

What this will do is project the texture inside the sphere instead of outside as with a normal model, allowing you to see the texture if your camera is placed inside it.

Next, export it as before by selecting the object and using the FBX export script.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Clustering techniques have an important role in class identification of records on a database, therefore it’s been established as one of the main topics of research in data mining. Spatial clustering techniques are a subset of clustering techniques applied on databases whose records have attributes intrinsically related to some spatial semantics. Most of the traditional clustering techniques described in the previous chapters can be applied to spatial databases. However, when applied to tasks like class identification on a spatial context, the traditional techniques might be unable to achieve good results, e.g. elements in the same cluster might not share enough similarity or the performance may be prohibitively poor.

The class identification task assisted by spatial clustering algorithms has a wide range of applications as finding relevant information on increasingly large spatial databases have recently become a highly demanded task. Examples include geographic data from satellite images, medical x-ray image processing or pattern recognition in machine learning samples.

Although there have been proposed an extensive number of techniques for clustering space-related data, many of the traditional clustering algorithm specified by them suffer from a number of drawbacks. Firstly, techniques based on k-partitioning such as those based on k-means are restricted to clusters structured on a convex-shaped fashion. Many databases have clusters with a broad variety of shapes (Figure 1), hence the traditional k-partitioning algorithms will fail to produce satisfactory results. Secondly, most techniques require previous knowledge of the database (domain knowledge) to determine the best input parameters. For example, k-means takes as input the number of expected clusters, k, which must be previously known for whichever database it’s applied on. In many real-life databases there is not an a priori domain knowledge and therefore choosing parameters values based on guesses will probably lead to incomplete and undesirable results. Finally, most techniques are not scalable, which means they can not be used for large databases, such as those made up by hundreds of thousands of elements. Although most techniques derives algorithms belonging to a polynomial run time complexity class, the cost can become prohibitively large when they are applied on huge databases, e.g. millions or billions of elements.

The restrictions mentioned above can be overcome by using a new approach, which is based on density for deciding which clusters each element will be in. The next session will introduce this new approach, DBSCAN, which stands for density-based algorithm for discovering clusters in large spatial databases with noise.

== DBSCAN: Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise ==

The idea behind constructing clusters based on the density properties of the database is derived from a human natural clustering approach. By looking
at the two-dimensional database showed in figure 1, one can almost immediately identify three clusters along with several points of noise. The clusters
and consequently the classes are easily and readily identifiable because they have an increased density with respect to the points they possess. On the
other hand, the single points scattered around the database are outliers, which means they do not belong to any clusters as a result of being in an
area with relatively low concentration.

[[Image:Two-Dimensional Database With Three Clusters.PNG|right|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;Figure 1: A two-dimensional spatial database with three non-convex shaped clusters and several outliers.&lt;center/&gt;]]

Furthermore, as will be explained in the following sections, the DBSCAN algorithm requires at most two parameters: a density metric and the minimum
size of a cluster. As a result, estimating the number of clusters a priori is not a need, as opposed to other techniques, namely k-means. Finally, as will be demonstrated later, the DBSCAN is efficient even when applied on large databases.

=== Important Concepts ===

Prior to describing the DBSCAN algorithm, some concepts must be explained to its fully understanding. The elements of the database can be classified in two different types: the border points, the points located on the extremities of the cluster, and the core points, which are located on its inner region. A neighborhood of a point p is a set of all points that have a distance measure less than a predetermined value, called Eps. Therefore, the neighborhood size of the core points is generally bigger than that of the border points. A point p is directly density-reachable from another point q if it belongs to the neighborhood of q and q's neighborhood size is greater than a given constant MinPts. By deriving canonically the previous concept, one can define a generic density-reachability: a point p is density-reachable from q if there exists a chain of points p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,..., p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;, where p&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = q, p&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = p, and p&lt;sub&gt;i+1&lt;/sub&gt; is directly density-reachable from p&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;. The former concepts are then combined
to the definition of a cluster D:

* &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt; q,p : if q &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; D and if q is density-reachable from p and p's neighborhood is greater than the MinPts threshold, then p belongs to D.
* &lt;math&gt;\forall&lt;/math&gt; q,p : if q &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; D and p &lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt; D then there must be a point t such that q and p are directly reachable from t.

According to the above definition, there might be some points not belonging to any of the generated clusters, those points are outliers (noise).
In other words, a cluster D is formed by a set of points that respects a certain degree of concentration, which is set by the MinPts and Eps constraints. By adjusting those values, one can find clusters of varying shapes and densities.

In other words, a cluster D is formed by a set of points that respects a certain degree of concentration, which is set by the MinPts and Eps constraints. By adjusting those values, one can and clusters of varying shapes and densities.

=== Algorithm ===

The DBSCAN algorithm (Algorithm 1) starts by randomly selecting an element P from the database. If P is not a core point, i.e. P has fewer than MinPts neighbors, it will be marked as noise. Otherwise it will be marked as being in the current cluster and the ExpandCluster (Algorithm 2) function will be called. Its purpose is to find all points that are density-reachable from P and are currently being marked as unclassified or noise. Despite being a
recursive function, ExpandCluster is implemented without using recursion explicitly. The recursive behaviour is accomplished by using a set whose size varies as new density-reachable points are found. The algorithm ends when all points have been properly classified.

Finally, after identifying all clusters, one might wonder that a border point might belong to two clusters at the same time. For this matter, the currently implement algorithm will consider the ambiguous points as being part of the cluster which aggregated them firstly.

== DBSCAN on R ==

R is a programming language and software environment for statistical computing. Besides being an widely used tool for statistical analysis, R aggregates several data mining techniques as well. Therefore it has become an major tool for simple tasks aiming to discover knowledge on databases. R's source code is freely available under the GNU General Public License and has been ported for several platforms other than Unix varieties, like Windows and MacOS. Although R uses primarily a command line interface, several GUIs are available, which increases its user-friendability.
The DBSCAN technique is available on R's fpc package, by Christian Hennig, which implements clustering tasks for fixed point clusters. The DBSCAN implementation offers high-configurability, as it allows choosing several parameters and options values. Moreover, fpc's DBSCAN has a visualization interface, which make it possible to visualize the clustering process iteratively. 

=== Installation ===
The fpc package can be installed by using the following command on R's command-line:

 install.packages(&quot;fpc&quot;, dependencies = TRUE)

The above command shall recursivelly download and install all packages that fpc depend to along with fpc itself.

=== Use ===
To start using the fpc package, the following command must be invoked:

 library('fpc')

=== DBSCAN Procedure ===

The fpc package allows the user to use the following procedure for applying dbscan technique directly:

 dbscan(data, eps, MinPts, scale, method, seeds, showplot, countmode)

==== Parameters ====
The DBSCAN procedure takes the following parameters:

* data: The data that will be clustered. It can be a data matrix, a data.frame, dissimilarity matrix or dist-object.
* eps: Reachability distance (discussed before).
* MinPts: Reachability minimum number of points (discussed before).
* scale: Used for scaling the data.
* method: Confifigures memory usage by constraining performance, there are three options:
** &quot;raw&quot;: treats data as raw data and avoids calculating a distance matrix (saves memory but may be slow).
** &quot;dist&quot;: treats data as distance matrix (relatively fast but memory expensive).
** &quot;hybrid&quot;: expects also raw data, but calculates partial distance matrices (very fast with moderate memory requirements.
* seeds: Configuration regarding to the inclusion of the isseed-vector in the dbscan-object, can be TRUE or FALSE.
* showplot: Plotting configuration:
** 0: no plot
** 1: plot per iteration
** 2: plot per subiteration
* countmode: NULL or vector of point numbers for reporting progress.

The first three parameters are, by far, the most important ones: data is the input data used for clustering; eps and MinPts variables retains the same meaning as before, that is, they are the minimum distance between elements and the necessary quantity of points to form a cluster respectivelly. The parameter showplot is related to the visualization of the results. Parameter method impacts directly the efficiency of the algorithm and can be used for calibrating memory-performance tradeoff on memory-constrained environments.

=== Example ===
The example in this section will illustrate the fpc's DBSCAN usage on the database depicted in figure 1. It will also show the clustering mechanism as a iterative visualization process. Firstly, the data to be clustered must be created:

 x &lt;- matrix(scan(&quot;file.dat&quot;,1926), nrow=1926, ncol=2, byrow=TRUE); # Read 1926 points on file &quot;file.dat&quot;.
 par(bg=&quot;grey40&quot;);                                                   # Set background to gray.
 plot(x);                                                           # Plot original database.
 d &lt;- dbscan(x,10,showplot = 2);                                    # Calls DBSCAN routine (eps = 10 and MinPts is set to its default, which is 5).
 d;                                                                 # Shows DBSCAN result.
 # Notice that setting showplot to 2 will make dbscan show the result iteratively by its sub-iterations.

==== Output ====

The DBSCAN's output shows information about the clusters that were just created:

 dbscan Pts=1926 MinPts=5 eps=20
        0 1 2  3 4   5 6   7 8   9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19
 seed   0 8 8 12 8 844 8 312 8 616  8 18  8  8 10 10  8  8 12  8
 border 4 0 0  0 0   0 0   0 0   0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0  0
 total  4 8 8 12 8 844 8 312 8 616  8 18  8  8 10 10  8  8 12  8

Each cluster is represented by a single column and the rows shows how many of seed (core), border and total points it has. Notice that the tiny clusters scattered throughout the database are, in fact, formed by more than a single point. Thus, they are considered valid clusters because the MinPts parameter was not set and its default value is too low.

==== Visualization ====
Points that belong to a cluster are delimited by triangles of different colors. All points belonging to the same cluster are delimited by triangles of the same color. Points that do not belong to any cluster retain the same color as before and, as will be showed, are usually represented by black circles.
Moreover, setting showplot parameter to 2 implies that on each subiteration of the DBSCAN algorithm, the routine will show the partial clusters on the screen. Following are five of these moments:

[[Image:DBSCAN Iteration1.PNG|300px]] [[Image:DBSCAN Iteration2.PNG|300px]] [[Image:DBSCAN Iteration3.PNG|300px]] 

[[Image:DBSCAN Iteration4.PNG|300px]] [[Image:DBSCAN Iteration5.PNG|300px]]

First image shows the points before the DBSCAN routine is called (command plot(x)). The second one shows the beginning of the clustering algorithm, the first major cluster is being formed in the upper center of the database. The fifth image shows the 19 clusters which were obtained when the algorithm had ended.

== Case Study: Identifying Celestial Entities ==

The following sections will discuss a common class identification task assisted by DBSCAN and applied on spatial databases: identification of celestial entities on astronomy.

=== Scenario ===

Identifying celestial objects by capturing the radiation they emit is recurring task on astronomy. An astronomical entity might be itself the source of electromagnetic radiation (i.e. a star) or might reflect it from other sources (i.e. a planet). Typically, an entity will emit radiation on different wavelengths, which, together, will help identifying its class: it might be a planet, an star of any kind or age, or even a galaxy or other exotic entity previously unidentified. The intensity collected from each range of the eletromagnetic spectrum is stored on an individual two-dimensional grid (e.g. one for ultraviolet and other for gamma rays). Modern research groups on astronomy are capable of collecting and storing thousands of
large-dimension grids, each of them representing a different view (or image) from the sky and using up to several terabytes of storage space.

Besides capturing the electromagnetic intensity emitted from an entity at a given range of the spectrum, the sensors might capture noise caused by the sensors as well as diffuse emission from the atmosphere and the space itself. Traditionally, a method for eliminating diffuse emission and some of the noise is to constrain the relevant intensity by a known threshold. For example, the intensity will only
be considered relevant when surpassing 5&lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; rms. A greater problem arises due to the fact that electromagnetc waves at different
spectrum ranges will yield different interference when traversing a medium. This phenomenum is called Rayleigh Scattering and will ultimately cause the wave to defleect upon being captured by the sensor. Therefore, when considering several images taken from the same region of space, but from different spectrum ranges, the following steps that must done for correctly identifying the celestial entities.

=== Methodology and Execution ===

[[Image:Center of a galaxy.PNG|right|thumb|200px|&lt;center&gt;Figure 2: The original image. At a wavelength of 4,865&amp;nbsp;MHz, it shows the center
of a galaxy.]]

[[Image:Pre Processed Astronomical Image.PNG|right|thumb|200px|&lt;center&gt;Figure 3: Source emissions after pre-processing.]]

[[Image:ClusteringResults.PNG|right|thumb|200px|&lt;center&gt;Figure 4: Clustering results for MinPts = 5 and eps = 5.]]

As an example, consider figure 2, which shows an image taken from the center of a galaxy. This image consists of a pathologic example of noise on an astronomical picture. Following is the methodology for extracting the celestial objects on this image.

==== Step 1: Pre-Processing ====

Firstly, a pre-processing step must be applied to the removal of noise and diffuse emission. As stated before, this might be accomplished by using a threshold. This step it is shown at figure 3, whereas the original image can be viewed at figure 2 and represents the original image depicting the center of a galaxy. The threshold was set to 50 which means that only pixels whose intensity are less than 50 (and consequently darker) are being considered.

==== Step 2: DBSCAN Clustering ====

Secondly, the DBSCAN algorithm can be applied on individual pixels to link together a complete emission area at the images for each channel of the electromagnetic spectrum. This is done by setting the eps parameter to some value that will define the minimum area required for a source to be considered. The eps parameter will define the distance metric in terms of pixels. Each of the generated cluster will define a celestial entity. Figure 4 shows the result of this step with eps and MinPts parameter set to 5.

 x &lt;- matrix(scan(&quot;file.dat&quot;,1214), nrow=1214, ncol=2, byrow=TRUE);
 dbscan(x,5,showplot = 2);

Results:

 dbscan Pts=1214 MinPts=5 eps=5

 total  24  6  6 14  6 24 18  6 16  6 14 28 26 26 10 10  8

==== Step 3: Multi-spectral Correlation ====

After identifying all clusters, one can apply a multi-espectral correlation process in order to consider the results (generated clusters) from every electromagnetic wavelength. It will not be detailed here, but a common approach would be only considering clusters which has one or more counterparts close enough with respect to some threshold on the other channels of the electrogmagnetic spectrum.

=== Analysis ===

Figure 4 shows the results after the clustering has been performed by the DBSCAN algorithm with MinPts and eps set to 5. By looking at the results, we can see that many isolated points have not been clustered because MinPts parameter restrict the size of a cluster by a minimum value of elements. This restriction will remove clusters that are too small to be classified as a relevant emission source and consequently are classified as noise. By restricting the MinPts parameter, celestial objects whose intensity is weak (e.g. they might be too far or do not emit strong radiation.) are eliminated from the results. This is generally desirable but can become a problem when emission sources defined by smaller areas must be analysed. Therefore, MinPts value must be carefully chosen since it may drastically modify the results.

Nevertheless, 64 clusters and 224 outliers were found. Most clusters do not have a large number of points, with some exceptions, like the large cluster located at the center of the database, which represents galaxy core which is an area with strong emission. The eps parameter takes an important role as it will define the minimum radius of pixels that represents the same emission source. Being set to 5 implies that points whose euclidian distance is greater than 5 do not belong to the same emission source. Although five is relatively large for the eps parameter, some clusters like those on (300,0) were not clustered together. This is because despite being close to each other they do not represent the same celestial object according to the eps value. Therefore, setting eps plays a role similar to that of MinPts, since it will define noise objects with respect to the distance measure, the same was done by the count measure of the MinPts.

=== Conclusion ===

The need to automatize the process of class identification of celestial entities is becoming increasinly important as astronomy and astrophysics become prominent areas of research. There is a growing demand for this task as technology evolves ands yields more and larger data samples to be analysed. Otherwise impossible without computational aid, this task have become easier with the assistance of the DBSCAN technique, which allowed larger samples to be analysed along with more precise results.

== What You'll Make ==

This book will take you step by step through the creation of an online game called Pits of Doom. Pits of Doom is a typical dungeon crawling, map based game similar to the well known Doom game. It's been modified to work as an online multi-player game with its own special features and quirks thrown into the mix. The Pits of Doom game design and initial programming is provided by [http://design1online.com design1online.com, LLC].

== License ==

All of the source code is provided free under the GNU license.

== Getting Started ==

In order to run all the code provided by this game it's strongly suggested that you download and installed [http://apachefriends.org XAMPP], a free software from ApacheFriends.org. You'll need a server, PHP 5 with the GD library installed, and at least one MySQL database.

== XAMPP Basics ==

Once XAMPP is installed all you have to do is run the .exe program and navigate to where you installed it. To make sure you installed it correctly type http://localhost into your browser and hit enter. The default XAMPP page should appear. 

Go to where you installed XAMPP and locate the folder called htdocs. This is where all of your files will need to go.

Now go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin in your browser. This will open up a graphical interface you can use to interact with MySQL, the database software we'll be using.

When you're done using XAMPP just close the .exe program. You'll notice that http://localhost is now no longer available. Localhost is only available when XAMPP is turned on.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction == 

In social networks  analysis one of the major concerns is identification of cohesive subgroups os actores within a network. Friendship relation, publications citation, and many other more. Many studies and researches are focused on social network analysis, including in data mining.  It is really important to find patterns in behavior of large online social networks, so the firms behind are able to create better mechanism to handle all that information with lower cost.

Online services such as Orkut, Facebook, Twitter and so on, have millions of users using their services simultaneously and interacting with others. Even in different services, the behavior of the network is similar. 

People tend to interact in the same way as they do in real life, in a structure called “small world”, where people in a social network can reach any other person with less than seven steps. Such behavior can be studied to prevent disease propagation or to predict how fast an information can flow in society. 

Several notions were introduced to formally describe cohesive groups: cliques, n–cliques, n–clans, n–clubs,
k–plexes, k–cores, lambda sets, . . . For most of them it turns out that they are algorithmically difficult, classified as NP hard. However for cores very efficient algorithm exists.

=== The Technique ===

There are several tasks when handling with social networks. There are some of them listed above.

'''Link-based object classification''' – We can classify the object based on its links.

'''Object type prediction''' – We can predict the object type based on the objects linked to it.

'''Link type prediction''' – Here we want to predict the link type based on the objects linked by it.

'''Predicting link existence''' – Now we don't want to know nothing about the link, but it's existence. How to predict when a link exists between two objects? That's the point here.

'''Link cardinality estimation''' – There are several ways to estimate the cardinality of a link, such as counting the number of links of an object, or counting the numbers of smallest paths that pass through an object.

'''Object reconciliation''' – The task is to check whether two objects are the same, based on the links and attributes. Remove duplicate instances are useful in many applications.

'''Group detection''' – A clustering task. Here we want to know when a group of objects belong to the same group.

'''Subgraph detection''' - Subgraph identification is to find characteristic subgraphs in a network. This is a form of search in graphs.

'''Metadata mining''' – Metadata is data about data.

The technique that will be explained in this text is about group detection in social networks, based on the degree of each node in the network.

=== The Algorithm ===

K-cores in graph theory were introduced by Seidman in 1983 and by Bollobas in 1984 as a method of (destructively) simplifying graph topology to aid in analysis and visualization. They have been more recently defined as the following by Batagelj et al.: given a graph G = {V,E}&gt; with vertices set V and edges set E, the k-core is computed by pruning all the vertices (with their respective edges) with degree less than k. That means that if a vertex u has degree du, and it has n neighbors with degree less than k, then u's degree becomes du − n, and it will be also pruned if k &gt; du − n.

This operation can be useful to filter or to study some properties of the graphs. For instance, when you compute the 2-core of graph G, you are cutting all the vertices which are in a tree part of graph. (A tree is a graph with no loops).

Note that, there is a refinement (possibly empty) of the k-core of a graph G, for which there exists at least k paths between any two pairs of vertices of G. This concept is called structural cohesion in sociology[1] and vertex-connectivity in graph theory, and is equivalent via the Menger theorem to a k-component, a maximal graph that cannot be disconnected by fewer than k nodes. 

=== Cores ===

The notion of core is presented in Butts (2010) as following:

Let G = (V, E) be a graph, and let f (v, S, G) for v ∈ V, S ⊆ V be a real-valued vertex property function (in the language of Batagelj and Zaversnik). Then some set H ⊆ V is a generalized k-core for f if H is a maximal set such that f (v, H, G) ≥ k for all v ∈ H. Typically, f is chosen to be a degree measure with respect to S (e.g., the number of ties to vertices in S). In this case, the resulting k-cores have the intuitive property of being maximal sets such that every set member is tied (in the appropriate manner) to at least k others within the set.

Degree-based k-cores are a simple tool for identifying well-connected structures within large graphs. Let the core number of vertex v be the value of the highest-value core containing v. Then, intuitively, vertices with high core numbers belong to relatively well-connected sets (in the sense of sets with high minimum internal degree). It is important to note that, while a given k-core need not be connected, it is composed of subsets which are themselves well-connected; thus, the k-cores can be thought of as unions of relatively cohesive subgroups. As k-cores are nested, it is also natural to think of each k-core as representing a “slice” through a hypothetical “cohesion surface” on G. (Indeed, k-cores are often visualized in exactly this manner.)

The kcores function produces degree-based k-cores, for various degree measures (with or without edge values). The return value is the vector of core numbers for V , based on the selected degree measure. Missing (i.e., NA) edge are removed for purposes of the degree calculation.

=== Description ===

kcores calculates the k-core structure of the input network, using the centrality measure indicated in cmode.

=== Usage ===

    kcores(dat, mode = &quot;digraph&quot;, diag = FALSE, cmode = &quot;freeman&quot;, ignore.eval = FALSE)

    mode
                         logical; should self-ties be included in the degree calculations?
    diag
                         the degree centrality mode to use when constructing the cores.
    cmode
                         logical; should edge values be ignored when computing degree?
    ignore.eval

=== Value ===

A vector containing the maximum core membership for each vertex.

&lt;pre style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New', monospace&quot;&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;
function (dat, mode = &quot;digraph&quot;, diag = FALSE, cmode = &quot;freeman&quot;, 
    ignore.eval = FALSE) 
{
    dat &lt;- as.edgelist.sna(dat, as.digraph = TRUE, suppress.diag = TRUE)
    if (is.list(dat)) 
        return(lapply(dat, kcores, dat = dat, mode = mode, diag = diag, 
            cmode = cmode, ignore.eval = ignore.eval))
    if (mode == &quot;graph&quot;) 
        cmode &lt;- &quot;indegree&quot;
    n &lt;- attr(dat, &quot;n&quot;)
    m &lt;- NROW(dat)
    corevec &lt;- 1:n
    dtype &lt;- switch(cmode, indegree = 0, outdegree = 1, freeman = 2)
    if (!(cmode %in% c(&quot;indegree&quot;, &quot;outdegree&quot;, &quot;freeman&quot;))) 
        stop(&quot;Illegal cmode in kcores.\n&quot;)
    solve &lt;- .C(&quot;kcores_R&quot;, as.double(dat), as.integer(n), as.integer(m), 
        cv = as.double(corevec), as.integer(dtype), as.integer(diag), 
        as.integer(ignore.eval), NAOK = TRUE, PACKAGE = &quot;sna&quot;)
    if (is.null(attr(dat, &quot;vnames&quot;))) 
        names(solve$cv) &lt;- 1:n
    else names(solve$cv) &lt;- attr(dat, &quot;vnames&quot;)
    solve$cv
}
&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Case Study ===

To illustrate the k-cores algorithm a simple case study will be shown.

=== Scenario ===

Imagine a group of students dining. Each of them may choose another one to sit with him. Each student is a node and each possibility of sitting together is an edge. We want to group them as friends they are separately.

===Input Data===

The input data is a adjacency matrix representing the network with students and friendship.

===Execution===
To determine the maximun k-core for each vertex from the network, we have:

&lt;pre style=&quot;font-family:'Courier New', monospace&quot;&gt;
kcores(people)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Where &quot;people&quot; is the matrix.

===Output===

A vector containing the maximum core membership for each vertex.

===Analysis===
As it is a small network, the maximum k-core is for k=2, so there aren't clear group definition.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==

The aim of clustering is to minimize a set of data points into self-similar groups such that the points that belong to
the same group are more similar than the points belonging to different groups. Each group is called a cluster.

This text will appear one more of the algorithms discussed in the literature known as Fuzzy C-Means. After the presentation of the technique will be presented an R package that implements this algorithm. Finally, a case study will be made using the algorithm implemented and presented the results obtained.

== Technique/Algorithm ==

Fuzzy ''C''-means (FCM----Frequently C Methods) is a method of clustering which allows one point to belong to one or more clusters. The method was developed by Dunn in 1973 and improved by Bezdek in 1981 and it is frequently used in pattern recognition. The FCM algorithm attempts to partition a finite collection of points into a collection of ''C'' fuzzy clusters with respect to some given criteria. Thus, points on the edge of a cluster, may be in the cluster to a lesser degree than points in the center of cluster. The FCM algorithm  is based on minimization of the following objective function:

:&lt;math&gt;J(U,c_1,c_2,\dots,c_c)=\sum_{i=1}^c J_i=\sum_{i=1}^c\sum_{j=1}^n u_{ij}^m d_{ij}^2&lt;/math&gt;

=== Algorithm === 

The FCM is also known as fuzzy ''c''-means nebulous because it uses fuzzy logic [Zadeh 1965] so that each instance is not associated with only one cluster, but has a certain degree of membership for each of the existing centroids. For this, the algorithm creates a matrix '''U''' associativity, where each term ''μ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'' represents the degree of membership of sample ''i'' to cluster ''j''.
In the FCM algorithm have a variable fuzziness ''m'' such that 1.0 &lt; ''m'' &lt; &lt;math&gt;\infin&lt;/math&gt; where ''m'' and being a real number. The closer ''m'' is to infinity (&lt;math&gt;\infin&lt;/math&gt;), the greater the fuzziness of the solution and the closer to 1, the solution becomes increasingly similar to the clustering of binary ''k''-means [Bezdek 1981]. A good choice is to set ''m'' = 2.0 [Hathaway and Bezdek 2001].

You can see both the ''k''-means and FCM together in the same pseudo-code described in (Algorithm 1). In it, we have the ''k''-means or FCM only by changing the formula to calculate the terms ''μ&lt;sub&gt;ij&lt;/sub&gt;'', changing the average fuzzy [Zadeh 1965] for a binary choice, showing that FCM is indeed the K-Means cloudy.

In (Algorithm 1), the manner stating that &lt;math&gt;| A - B | ^ 2&lt;/math&gt; is the distance away Euclidean to the a to b taking as input: set of samples ''x&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' (1 &lt; ''i'' &lt; N), plain number of clusters K factor cloudiness me a factor of Tolerance, we leave on the: a cluster vector c&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; (1 &lt; i &lt; K) and a matrix U determines the associativity of each sample with each of the clusters. It should be noted that the values of the matrix U depend only on H (array that stores the distances are the examples of clusters) and the value of m. The upgrade of the clusters depend solely on the values of the iteration matrix U in iteration.

=== Implementation ===
The algorithm described above was implemented by the R package &quot;e1071&quot; released in 21/04/2010. This package has GPL-2 and can be found in the CRAN repository.

'''Install CBA Package'''
&lt;pre&gt;
install.packages(&quot;e1071&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;

''' Importing methods and algorithm'''
&lt;pre&gt;
library(&quot;e1071&quot;)
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Usage:'''
&lt;pre&gt;
cmeans(x, centers, iter.max = 100, verbose = FALSE,
       dist = &quot;euclidean&quot;, method = &quot;cmeans&quot;, m = 2,
       rate.par = NULL, weights = 1, control = list())
&lt;/pre&gt;

'''Arguments:'''
&lt;pre&gt;
• x: The data matrix where columns correspond to variables and rows to observations.
• centers: Number of clusters or initial values for cluster centers.
• iter.max: Maximum number of iterations.
• verbose: If TRUE, make some output during learning.
• dist: Must be one of the following: If &quot;euclidean&quot;, the mean square error,
if &quot;manhattan&quot;, the mean absolute error is computed. Abbreviations are also accepted.
• method:  If &quot;cmeans&quot;, then we have the c-means fuzzy clustering method, 
if &quot;ufcl&quot; we have the on-line update. Abbreviations are also accepted.
• m: A number greater than 1 giving the degree of fuzzification.
• rate.par: A number between 0 and 1 giving the parameter of the learning rate for the 
on-line variant. The default corresponds to 0:3.
• weights: a numeric vector with non-negative case weights. Recycled to the 
number of observations in x if necessary.
• control: a list of control parameters. See Details.
&lt;/pre&gt;


'''If everything goes ok, an object fclust is returned. This object has the following components:'''
&lt;pre&gt;
• centers: the final cluster centers.
• size: the number of data points in each cluster of the closest hard clustering.
• cluster: a vector of integers containing the indices of the clusters where the data points are assigned 
to for the closest hard clustering, as obtained by assigning points to the (first) class with maximal membership.
• iter: the number of iterations performed.
• membership: a matrix with the membership values of the data points to the clusters.
• withinerror: the value of the objective function.
• call: the call used to create the object.
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== View ===
There is one way to show the result from this algorithm. That way would be printing the object fclust :

&lt;pre&gt;
print(fclust)
&lt;/pre&gt;

==== Example ====

To illustrate the method implemented by the package studied, we have created two examples. The first one is created an array of two dimensions and in the second example creates an array with three dimensions. In both examples we used a normal distribution with a mean ranging and using a standard deviation of 0.3.

Example 1
&lt;pre&gt;
# a 2-dimensional example
x&lt;-rbind(matrix(rnorm(100,sd=0.3),ncol=2),
matrix(rnorm(100,mean=1,sd=0.3),ncol=2))
cl&lt;-cmeans(x,2,20,verbose=TRUE,method=&quot;cmeans&quot;,m=2)
print(cl)
&lt;/pre&gt;

Example 2
&lt;pre&gt;
# a 3-dimensional example
x&lt;-rbind(matrix(rnorm(150,sd=0.3),ncol=3),
matrix(rnorm(150,mean=1,sd=0.3),ncol=3),
matrix(rnorm(150,mean=2,sd=0.3),ncol=3))
cl&lt;-cmeans(x,6,20,verbose=TRUE,method=&quot;cmeans&quot;)
print(cl)
&lt;/pre&gt;


'''Output - Example 1'''



'''Output - Example 2'''

== Case Study ==
The topics below describe the case study to demonstrate the results obtained using the Fuzzy C-Means.

=== Scenario ===
In the proposed case study, we used the database available in packages Iris R. This database consists of 150 instances each containing features of flower petals. Each instance of a database has its classification. There are three different classifications for the instances of the database (setosa, versicolor and virginica). Each of the classes present in the database studied has 50 examples that in total, summarize the 150 instances of the base.
In addition to the definitions of classes in each of these instances, the other features are:

=== Datasets ===
The database of iris used in the experiment can be charged in the language R using the following command.

&lt;pre&gt;
data(iris)
&lt;/pre&gt;

The table below has a small sample of the data contained in the iris database.

Table 1: ''Samples of iris database''

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Instance !! Sepal.Length !! Sepal.Width !! Petal.Length !! Petal.Width !! Species
|-
| 1 || 5.1 || 3.5 || 1.4 || 0.2 || setosa
|-
| 2 || 4.9 || 3.0 || 1.4 || 0.2 || setosa
|-
| 3 || 4.7 || 3.2 || 1.3 || 0.2 || setosa
|-
| 72 || 6.1 || 2.8 || 4.0 || 1.3 || versicolor
|-
| 73 || 6.3 || 2.5 || 4.9 || 1.5 || versicolor

|-
| 115 || 5.8 || 2.8 || 5.1 || 2.4 || virginica
|}

=== Execution ===
To generate the results using the Fuzzy C-Means was run the script below.

&lt;pre&gt;
data(iris)
x&lt;-rbind(iris$Sepal.Length, iris$Sepal.Width, iris$Petal.Length)
x&lt;-t(x)
result&lt;-cmeans(x,3,50,verbose=TRUE,method=&quot;cmeans&quot;)
print(result)
s3d &lt;- scatterplot3d(result$membership, color=result$cluster, type=&quot;h&quot;, 
angle=55, scale.y=0.7, pch=16, main=&quot;Pertinence&quot;)
plot(iris, col=result$cluster)
&lt;/pre&gt;

=== Output ===
The results obtained by running the script are shown below.

=== Analysis ===
Application of Fuzzy C-Means algorithm allowed a homogeneous grouping of classes as expected. Soon, the three generated classes have a very similar amount of instances present. The algorithm presented in addition to the class that was ranked a given instance, the relevance of this instance to that class. This information allows the person responsible for analyzing the results can devote their attention to the proceedings that do not have a high degree of relevance to a particular class.

The instances of the database analyzed that do not have a high degree of relevance, this degree being defined by the user should be analyzed for Chace whether they really belong to the class informed by the algorithm. In the chart presented pertinencia realize that some instances of Class 2, marked in red do not have a high amount of relevance. This possibly indicates that the algorithm may have erred in its classification as the values of the attributes of these instances do not identify with a high degree of certainty these instances.

== Not working ==

As far as I can tell, this template isn't generating a message (nor anything else, like &lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[:Category:Template documentation]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;) on any of the subpages where it's transcluded.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 14:46, 17 December 2009 (UTC)
:Indeed.  I have seen that it's supposed to add a message and category from what I can tell of the code, but I've always had to add that category manually on documentation subpages.  It's been like that for as long as I've been categorizing templates and I was just content to have it here to keep templates imported from breaking.  -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 15:57, 17 December 2009 (UTC)
::Fixed, looks like... at least ''that'' problem.  &lt;nowiki&gt;{{SUBPAGENAME}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; in certain Wikibooks namespaces, including Template, doesn't return just the last field, so replaced it with titleparts code that does.  &lt;s&gt;There's still something dodgy about the image.&lt;/s&gt;  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|talk]]) 03:11, 18 December 2009 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Money is the underlying concept of finance which is an abstract unit form of a resource. Finance studies and addresses the ways in which individuals and organizations raise, allocate, and use monetary resources over time while taking into account risk. Since we are dealing with modern times, these monetary resources refer to money as we know it. Before getting into the principles of finance one must have an understanding of money and its origins. 

==What is Money?==
Money is anything that is generally accepted as payment for goods and services and repayment of debts. Money thus enables payments to be made for purchases and savings. It can come in various forms, such as coins, notes, cheques and credit cards.

I hate to reinvent the wheel, but for &quot;completness&quot; of a book it would be necessary to include it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Ohm's Law==
Ohm's Law states that Resistance of a closed circuit is the ratio of Voltage over Current 
:&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{V}{I}&lt;/math&gt;
From above
:&lt;math&gt;V = I R&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;I = \frac{V}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

==The Power Law==
The Power Law indicates the relationship between Voltage , Current . Power is defined as product of Voltage and Current . 
:&lt;math&gt;E = V I &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V = \frac{E}{I} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;I = \frac{E}{V} &lt;/math&gt;

== Kirchoff's Current Law (KCL) ==
''The sum of all the currents at a node is equal to zero with the following assumptions Current entering node is positive . Current leaving node is negative''

[[Image:Electronics_KCL.PNG]]

-''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + ''I''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 &amp;harr; ''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = ''I''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

[[Image:Electronics_KCL_1.PNG]]

''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - ''I''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - ''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; - ''I''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 &amp;harr; ''I''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + ''I''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + ''I''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; = ''I''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; I_1 = I_2  + I_3 + \cdots + I_n \,\! &lt;/math&gt;

==  Kirchoff's Voltage Law (KVL) ==
''The sum of all voltages at a node is equal zero . The sum of all voltage drops and rise in a closed circuit is zero ''

==Source Transformation==
Any linear time invariant network of impedances can be reduced to one equivalent impedance. In particular, any network of sources and resistors can be reduced to one ideal source and one resistor, in either the Thevenin or Norton configurations.  In this way, a complicated network attached to a load resistor can be reduced to a single voltage divider (Thevenin) or current divider (Norton).

[[Image:Thevenin Norton equivalents.png]]

Thevenin and Norton equivalents let you replace a Voltage source in series with a resistor by a current source in parallel with a resistor, or vice versa.  This is called a source transformation.

The point to be noted is that the block that is replaced with such an equivalent should be linear and time invariant, i.e. a linear change in the electrical source in that block produces a linear change in the equivalent source, and the behavior can be replicated if the initial conditions are replicated.
'''The above shown transformation figures are true only if the circuit contains at least one independent voltage or current source. If the circuit comprises only dependent sources then Thevenin equivalent consists of R&lt;sub&gt;Th&lt;/sub&gt; alone''' [http://www.eas.asu.edu/~holbert/ece201/ECE201Lect-13.ppt See This to get a clear idea] LINK DEAD

===Thevenin Equivalents===
The Thevenin equivalent circuit of a (two-terminal) network consists of a voltage source in series with a resistor.  The Thevenin equivalent will have the same output voltage and current regardless of what is attached to the terminals.

===Techniques For Finding Thevenin Equivalents===
*Network contains no sources (only resistors): The Thevenin resistance is equal to the equivalent resistance of the network.  The Thevenin voltage is zero.

*Basic: Works for any network except one with no independent sources.  Find the voltage across the terminals (with positive reference at terminal A) when they are open-circuited.  Find the current from terminal A to terminal B when they are short-circuited.  Then&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;math&gt;R_{th}=\frac{V_{oc}}{I_{sc}}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
The Thevenin voltage source value is equivalent to the open-circuit voltage.

If the network has no dependent sources, the independent sources can be zeroed, and the Thevenin resistance is equal to the equivalent resistance of the network with zeroed sources.  Then, find &lt;math&gt;V_{oc}&lt;/math&gt;.


*Only Dependent Sources:

If the network has only dependent sources, either attach a test voltage source to the terminal points and measure the current that passes from the positive terminal, or attach a test current source to the terminal points and measure the voltage difference across the terminals.  In both cases you will have values for &lt;math&gt;V_{oc}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;I_{sc}&lt;/math&gt;, allowing you to use the &lt;math&gt;R_{th}=\frac{V_{oc}}{I_{sc}}&lt;/math&gt; relation to find the Thevenin resistance.

===Norton Equivalents===

Norton equivalents can be found by performing a source transformation on the Thevenin equivalent.
The Norton Equivalent of a Thevenin Equivalent consists of a current source, &lt;math&gt;I_N= \frac {V_{th}}{R_{th}}&lt;/math&gt; in parallel with &lt;math&gt;R_{th}&lt;/math&gt;.

===Thevenin and Norton Equivalent ===

[[Image:Thevenin_Equivalent_Example.PNG|center|thumb|180px|Figure 1: Circuit for the determination of Equivalents]]

The steps for creating the Equivalent are:
:1. Remove the load circuit.
:2. Calculate the voltage, V, at the output from the original sources.
:3. Now replace voltage sources with shorts and current sources with open circuits.
:4. Replace the load circuit with an imaginary ohm meter and measure the total resistance, R, looking back into the circuit, with the sources removed.
:5. The equivalent circuit is a voltage source with voltage V in series with a resistance R in series with the load.

The Thevenin Equivalent is determined with &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt; as the load as shown in Figure 1.  The first step is to open circuit &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;.  
Then the voltage v is calculated with &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt; open circuited must be calculated. The voltage across &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;V_1&lt;/math&gt; this is because no current flows in the circuit so the voltage across &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt; must be &lt;math&gt;V_1&lt;/math&gt; by KVL.

Since this circuit does not contain any dependent sources, all that needs to be done is for all the Independent Voltage sources to be shorted and for all Independent Current Sources to be open circuited.  This results in the circuit shown in Figure 2.

[[Image:Thevenising_Circuit.PNG|center|thumb|200px|Figure 2: Circuit for the Equivalent Resistance]]

Now the Thevenin Resistance is calculated looking into the two nodes.  The Thevenin resistance is clearly &lt;math&gt;R_1 + R_3 | | R_4 &lt;/math&gt;. 
The Thevenin Equivalent is shown in Figure 3 and &lt;math&gt;R_{th}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_{th}&lt;/math&gt; have the values shown below.
:&lt;math&gt;R_{th}=R_1 + R_3 | | R_4  \,&lt;/math&gt; (1)
:&lt;math&gt;V_{th}=V_1\,&lt;/math&gt;
[[Image:Thevenised_Circuit.PNG|center|thumb|140px|Figure 3: Equivalent Thevenin Circuit]]

The Norton Equivalent is created by doing a source transformation using 
&lt;math&gt;I_{N}=\frac {V_{th}}{R_{th}} \,&lt;/math&gt;.(2)

[[Image:Norton_Equivalent_Cct.PNG|center|thumb|140px|Figure 4: Equivalent Norton Circuit]]

If &lt;math&gt;R_2=R_1=1k \Omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_3=R_4=2k \Omega&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;V_1=15 V&lt;/math&gt; then
:&lt;math&gt;R_{th}=1k + 2k | | 2k \,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;R_{th}=2k \Omega \,&lt;/math&gt;


As a final note if the voltage across &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt; is calculate by Voltage Divider Rule using the Thevenin Equivalent circuit in Figure 3.
:&lt;math&gt;V_{R2}=\frac {V_{th}R_2}{R_{th}+R_2}&lt;/math&gt; (3)
If the value of &lt;math&gt;R_{th}&lt;/math&gt; form equation 1 is substituted into equation 3.
:&lt;math&gt;V_{R2}=\frac {V_{th}R_2}{R_1 + R_3 | | R_4+R_2}&lt;/math&gt; (4)
Now look at Figure 1 and calcute &lt;math&gt;V_{R2}&lt;/math&gt; by voltage divider rule it has the same value as equation 4.  If the current through &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt; is calculated in Figure 4 by current divider rule.
:&lt;math&gt;I_{R2}=\frac {I_NR_{th}}{R_{th}+R_2}(5)&lt;/math&gt;
Substituting equation 2 into 5.
:&lt;math&gt;I_{R2}=\frac {V_{th}}{R_{th}+R_2}(4)&lt;/math&gt;
If equation 4 and Ohm's Law are used to get the voltage across &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt; equation 3 is reached.

Please note:  The &quot;||&quot;, a symbol that is used as an operator here, holds higher precedence than the &quot;+&quot; operator.  As such, it is evaluated before a sum.

See [[w:Norton's theorem|Norton's theorem]] and [[w:Thevenin's theorem|Thevenin's theorem]] for more examples.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Voltage Divider==
If two circuit elements are in series, there is a voltage drop across each element, but the current through both must be the same.  The voltage at any point in 
the chain divides according to the resistances.  A simple circuit with two (or more) resistors in series with a source is called a voltage divider.

:[[Image:PotentialDivider.png|120px]]

Figure A: Voltage Divider circuit.

==Transfer Function of Voltage Divider==
Consider the circuit in Figure A.  According to KVL the voltage &lt;math&gt;V_{in}&lt;/math&gt; is dropped across resistors &lt;math&gt;R_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R_2&lt;/math&gt;.  If a current i flows through the two series resistors then by Ohm's Law.

:&lt;math&gt;i = \frac{V_{in}}{R_1+R_2}&lt;/math&gt;.

So
:&lt;math&gt; V_{out}=iR_2 \,\!&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore
:&lt;math&gt; V_{out}=V_{in} \frac{R_2}{R_1+R_2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; V_{out} = V_{in} \frac{R_2}{R_1 + R_2}&lt;/math&gt;

==Circuit Analysis==
===Circuit Impedance===
In Polar Coordinate
:&lt;math&gt;Z = Z_R + Z_L &lt;/math&gt; = R/_0 + ω L/_90
:Z = |Z|/_θ = &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{R^2 + (\omega L)^2}&lt;/math&gt;/_Tan&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;math&gt;\omega\frac{L}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

In Rectangular Coordinate
:&lt;math&gt;Z = Z_R + Z_L = R + j \omega L&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z = R + j \omega L = R ( 1 + j \omega \frac{L}{R} )&lt;/math&gt;

===Phase Angle of Difference Between Voltage and Current===
In RL series circuit, only L is the component that depends on frequency . There is no difference between voltage and current on R . There is an angle difference between voltage and current by 90 degree . When connect R and L in series , there is a difference in angle between voltage and current from 0 to 90 degree which can be expressed as a mathematic formula below
: &lt;math&gt;Tan \theta = \omega \frac{L}{R} = 2 \pi f  \frac{L}{R} = 2 \pi \frac{1}{t}  \frac{L}{R} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\omega = Tan \theta \frac{R}{L}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{1}{2\pi} Tan \theta \frac{R}{L}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t = 2\pi \frac{1}{Tan \theta} \frac{L}{R}&lt;/math&gt;


===Natural Response===
:&lt;math&gt;L\frac{dI}{dt} + IR = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dI}{dt} = - I \frac{R}{L}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{1}{I} dI = - \int \frac{L}{R} dt&lt;/math&gt;
:ln I = &lt;math&gt;(-\frac{L}{R} + c)&lt;/math&gt;
:I = &lt;math&gt;e^(-\frac{L}{R} + c) t&lt;/math&gt; 
:I = &lt;math&gt;e^c e^(-\frac{L}{R}t)&lt;/math&gt; 
:I = &lt;math&gt;A e^(-\frac{L}{R}t)&lt;/math&gt;

===Time Constant RL===
:τ = &lt;math&gt;\frac{L}{R}&lt;/math&gt;
:I = A &lt;math&gt;e^-(\frac{L}{R}) t&lt;/math&gt;

''Current of the circuit is decreased exponentially with time . At time t = 0 I = I&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; . At time t = R/L I = 63% I&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; . At time t = 5 time time constant I = 10% I&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;''
: I = A &lt;math&gt;e^-(\frac{L}{R}) t&lt;/math&gt;

==Summary==
In summary RL series circuit has a first order differential equation of current 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} f(t) + \frac{1}{T} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
Which has one real root
:&lt;math&gt;I(t) = Ae^\frac{t}{T}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;A = e^c&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Resistor==
:[[File:Resistors.jpg|200px]]
Resistor is an electronic component made from straight wire conductor of the dimension 
:: Length l, 
:: Area A, that has a 
:: Conductivity &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; 

Resistor has Electronic Symbol shown below
: [[File:Resistor.gif|200px]]

==Characteristics==
===Resistance===
The characteristic of the Resistor is defined by its Resistance R which measures the resistance of the Resistor to the current flow
:&lt;math&gt;R = \frac{1}{\rho}\frac{A}{l}&lt;/math&gt;

===DC Characteristics===
When connect Resistor with a DC voltage source in a closed loop circuit 

Voltage
: &lt;math&gt;V = I \times R&lt;/math&gt;

Current
: &lt;math&gt;I = \frac{V}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

Resistance
: &lt;math&gt;R = \frac{V}{I}&lt;/math&gt;

Energy Supplied
: &lt;math&gt;E_V = V I&lt;/math&gt;

Energy Dissipated as heat or Energy Loss as Heat into the surrounding
: &lt;math&gt;E_R = \frac{V^2}{R} =  I^2 R&lt;/math&gt;

Energy Transfer
: &lt;math&gt;E = E_V - V_R = I ( V - IR ) = V ( I - \frac{V}{R} ) &lt;/math&gt;

The Efficiency of Energy transfer
: &lt;math&gt;n = \frac{E}{E_V} = \frac{V - IR}{V} = \frac{I - \frac{V}{R}}{I}  &lt;/math&gt;

===AC Characteristics===
When connect Resistor with a AC voltage sourse in a closed loop circuit

Voltage
: &lt;math&gt;v = i \times R&lt;/math&gt;

Current
: &lt;math&gt;i = \frac{v}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

Power
: &lt;math&gt;p = \frac{v^2}{R} = i^2 R&lt;/math&gt;

Impedance
: &lt;math&gt;Z_R = \frac{v}{i}&lt;/math&gt;

==Resistor Types==
Resistor are availble in two main types 

===Fixed Resistor=== 
Resistor of a fixed value 
:[[File:Resistors.jpg|200px]]

===Variable Resistor===  
Resistor of a  variable value

==Resistor Configurations==
===Series Configuration===
Two or more resistor can be connected in series to increase the total resistance . The Total Resistance is equal to the sum of all the resistor's resistance . The total resistance In Series connected circuit Current and voltage will be reduced
:[[Image:Resistors_in_Series.svg|200px]]
:&lt;math&gt;R_{eq}=R_1+R_2+R_3+...+R_n \,&lt;/math&gt;

When connect two reistors of the same resistance the total resistance is doubled
: R + R = 2R

===Parallel Configuration===
Two or more resistor can be connected in parallel to decrease the total resistance . 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{R} = \frac{1}{R_1} + \frac{1}{R_2} + ... + \frac{1}{R_n}&lt;/math&gt;

==Circuit Analysis==
===Circuit's Impedance===
In Polar coordinate
:&lt;math&gt;Z = Z_R + Z_C &lt;/math&gt;
:Z = R /_0 + ( 1 / ωC ) /_ - 90 
:Z = = |Z|/_θ = &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{R^2 + (\frac{1}{\omega C})^2}&lt;/math&gt; /_ Tan&lt;sup&gt;-1&lt;/sup&gt; &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\omega RC}&lt;/math&gt;

In Rectangular coordinate
:&lt;math&gt;Z = Z_R + Z_C &lt;/math&gt;
:Z = &lt;math&gt; R + \frac{1}{j\omega C} = \frac{1 + j\omega RC}{j\omega C}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Z = \frac{1}{X_C} (1 + j\omega T&lt;/math&gt;)

===Phase Angle Difference Between Voltage and Current===
''There is a difference in angle Between Voltage and Current . Current leads Voltage by an angle θ''
:&lt;math&gt;Tan\theta = \frac{1}{\omega RC} = \frac{1}{f} \frac{1}{2\pi RC} = t \frac{1}{2\pi RC}&lt;/math&gt;

''The difference in angle between Voltage and Current relates to the value of R , C and the Angular of Frequency ω which also relates to f and t . Therefore when change the value of R or C , the angle difference will be changed and so are ω , f , t  ''
:&lt;math&gt;\omega= \frac{1}{RC} \frac{1}{Tan\theta}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f = \frac{1}{2\pi} \frac{1}{RC} \frac{1}{Tan\theta}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;t = 2\pi RC Tan\theta&lt;/math&gt;

===Natural Response ===
:&lt;math&gt;C \frac{dV}{dt} + \frac{V}{R} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dV}{dt} = - \frac{1}{RC} V&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{V} dV  = - \frac{1}{RC} dt&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\int \frac{1}{V} dV  = - \int \frac{1}{RC} dt&lt;/math&gt;
:ln V =  &lt;math&gt; - \frac{1}{RC} + C&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; V  = e^- (\frac{1}{RC}) t + C&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt; V  = A e^- (\frac{1}{T}) t &lt;/math&gt; 
: &lt;math&gt;A = e^C&lt;/math&gt;
: T = RC

==Summary==
In summary, RL series circuit has a first order differential equation of voltage 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}f(t) + \frac{t}{T} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

Which has one real root
:&lt;math&gt;V(t) = Ae^\frac{-t}{T}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;A = e^c&lt;/math&gt;

==Circuit Analysis==
===Circuit's Impedance===
:&lt;math&gt; Z = Z_L + Z_C&lt;/math&gt; 
:Z = ω L /_90 + &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{\omega C}&lt;/math&gt;/_-90

* &lt;math&gt;Z_L &gt; Z_C&lt;/math&gt;
: Z = Z_L - Z_C/_90

* &lt;math&gt;Z_L &lt; Z_C&lt;/math&gt;
: Z = Z_C - Z_L/_-90

* &lt;math&gt;Z_L = Z_C&lt;/math&gt;
: Z = 0 /_ 0
===Natural Response===
:&lt;math&gt;L \frac{dI}{dt} + \frac{1}{C}\int I dt = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dI}{dt} + \frac{1}{LC}\int I dt = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2I}{dt^2} + \frac{1}{LC} = 0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;s^2 = - \frac{1}{LC}&lt;/math&gt;
:s = ± &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{-\frac{1}{LC}} t&lt;/math&gt; = ± j &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}} t = \pm j\omega t&lt;/math&gt;

The Second Ordered Equation has two imaginary roots
:&lt;math&gt;I  = e^ j \omega t + e^-j \omega t&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;I = A Sin\omega t&lt;/math&gt;

The natural response of the LC series is a Sinusoidal Wave . Therefore, LC series can be used as a Sin Wave Oscillator

===Resonance Response===
Resonance occurs in the cicuit when &lt;math&gt;Z_L - Z_C = 0  .  V_C + V_L = 0&lt;/math&gt;
* &lt;math&gt;Z_C = Z_L&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\omega L = \frac{1}{\omega C}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}}&lt;/math&gt;

* &lt;math&gt;V_L + V_C = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;V_L = - V_C &lt;/math&gt;


At Resonance, the LC series has the capability to generate Standing Wave Oscillation

==Summary==
LC series has a second order equation of current with two imaginaries roots 
:&lt;math&gt;I(t) = e^(j\omega t) + e^(-j\omega t)&lt;/math&gt;

Which generates Sin Wave Oscillation
:&lt;math&gt;I(t) = A Sin \omega t&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt{\frac{1}{T}}&lt;/math&gt;
: T = LC

At resonance, Impedance of Inductor and Capacitor cancel out 
: Z&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; = Z&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt;  
: &lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}}&lt;/math&gt;

Which generates Standing Wave Oscillation

At resonance, series RLC is capable of select a bandwidth of frequencies where voltage is stable does not change with frequencies. Therefore, can be used as Tuned - Resonance Band Pas Selected Filter

==Summary==

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[Image:Motor cycle stunt2 amk.jpg|thumb|right|A motorcycle wheelie]]
In vehicle acrobatics, a '''wheelie''' is a vehicle manoeuvre in which the front wheel or wheels come off the ground due to extreme torque being applied to the rear wheel or wheels.  Wheelies are usually associated with bicycles and motorcycles, but can be done with other vehicles, such as cars.

==Bicycle wheelie==
To perform a wheelie on a bicycle, put the bike in low gear and pedal forward while pulling hard on the handlebars. This can most easily be done from a slow roll.  While the front wheel is in the air, the wheelie can be controlled by maintaining an upright posture and leaning to control balance - do not hunch over the handlebars. For added control, pulling the rear brake can prevent falling backward.

A wheelie can be maintained indefinitely by finding a balance between amount of rear brake and pedalling force. It is possible to hold the rear brake on constantly with very small adjustments in pressure relating to how hard the rider is pedalling. This gives a more stable feeling as the balance point is more consistent. To return the front wheel to the ground, lean forward and gently squeeze the back brake if needed. Ensure the wheel is straight upon return to the ground, or control of the bike may be lost.

Once the wheelie has been conquered the manual wheelie can be attempted. This is the same as a wheelie but without pedalling. The bike is balanced by the rider's weight and sometimes use of the rear brake.

===Distance wheelies===
To travel farther on the back wheel of a bicycle, the rider must put the bike into a higher gear with the body weight leaned forward (over the handle bars if needed) and the stronger foot highest in the pedalling cycle. The rider kicks hard with the stronger foot, throw all their weight backwards and lands their backside on the seat, then straighten out the arms and put weight and tension on them. The rider keeps pedalling, and when the wheelie feels too high up, feathers the back brake slightly.

To lower the &quot;balance point&quot;,  put the saddle higher up, which will mean that the &quot;maximum height&quot; of the wheelie is brought down, and it will also be more comfortable to go for long distances on the back wheel. There is a skill to being able to stop on the back wheel, and then keep going more slowly, this can be done by striking a balance between the back brake and the pedalling.

===Corners===
It is possible to navigate corners while doing a wheelie and requires much the same inputs as cornering on two wheels. When approaching the turn it is best to look through the turn towards the exit as a bike goes where the rider looks.

Turning the bars in the direction the rider wants to go is the initial stage and only requires minimal movement, couple this with slightly shifting upper body weight (mainly head and shoulders) again in the direction of the turn and the bike should start to lean over and turn. This is not an easy maneuver because the bike now is very biased as to which side it wants to fall over on to. Concentration is needed to keeping the wheel off the ground and countering the sideways balance. Turning the bars opposite to the desired direction and shifting body weight to the outside will help keep the bike on a smooth path around the turn.

===Safety===
Leaning back too far (i.e. as a result of pedalling too hard) will cause the bike to rotate out from under the rider. Although most riders will instinctively hit the ground running, practice recovering from this event before attempting an actual wheelie.  Balancing left to right can easily be controlled in the air by moving the knees and handlebars back and forth.

Injury can be avoided by keeping speeds down and/or learning to use the rear brake.  However, higher speeds, counter-intuitively, are often necessary to master the wheelie as the effects of gyroscopic stabilization of the more quickly spinning wheels increase side to side control.  For this reason, beginners attempting wheelies on bicycles should tune up their rear brakes and aim for an 12–18&amp;nbsp;km/h (8-12&amp;nbsp;mph) wheelie for maximum safety. Although a wheelie or manual can be easily achieved without the use of the back brake it is always recommended that the lever is covered. Never have the entire fist closed around the bars because if the balance point starts to become to far back there will not be enough time to grab the brake and at that point the rider may fall off backwards. A grip is needed on the bars so only one or at the most two fingers are required to use the back brake lever. The seat height will determine the outcome of going over the back, the higher the seat the harder it is to land on the feet.

Beginners should use a low seat height until comfortable with the balance point and back brake. It is harder to maintain speed with a low seat height so wheelies may be short but once comfortable raising the seat height will make the front wheel more eager to come up and make maintaining speed a lot easier. It will also make the balance point easier to fine tune as there is more weight above the back wheel to move back and forth.

==Motorcycle wheelie==
[[Image:Wheelieatcadwell.jpg|thumb|A motorcycle wheelie on a closed track.]]
[[Image:Bikesedi-1150402469.can.ogg|thumb|left|Motorcycle popping a wheelie. Video.]]
A wheelie is also a common motorcycle trick. The principle is the same as the [[#Bicycle wheelie|bicycle wheelie]], but the throttle and rear-brakes are used to control the wheelie. On more powerful motorcycles (usually above 500 cc) the front wheel is lifted into the air by accelerating, but on smaller bikes the clutch may be used and/or &quot;bouncing&quot; the forks (using the rider's weight to compress the front suspension, so that the recoil will help lift the front wheel on accelerating).

Welcome to the '''Agriculture''' wikibook! Agriculture (a term which encompasses farming and ranching) is the process of producing food, feed, fiber, fuel, and other goods by the systematic raising of plants and animals.

&quot;Agri&quot; is from Latin ''ager'', meaning &quot;a field&quot;, and culture is from Latin ''cultura'', meaning &quot;cultivation&quot; in the strict sense of tillage of the soil. A literal reading of the English word yields: tillage of the soil of a field. In modern usage, the word agriculture covers all activities essential to food/feed/fiber production, including all techniques for raising and processing livestock. Agriculture is also short for the study of the practice of agriculture—more formally known as agricultural science.

The history of agriculture is a major element of human history; agricultural progress has been a crucial factor in worldwide social change, including the specialization of human activity: when farmers became capable of producing food beyond the needs of their own families, others in the tribe or nation or empire were freed to devote themselves to tasks other than food acquisition.

About 42% of the world's laborers are employed in agriculture, making it by far the most common occupation.

Agriculture may often cause environmental problems because it changes natural environments and produces harmful byproducts. Some of the negative effects are:

* Surplus of nitrogen and phosphorus in rivers and lakes
* Detrimental effects of herbicides, fungicides, insecticides, and other biocides
* Conversion of natural ecosystems of all types into arable land
* Consolidation of diverse biomass into a few species
* Soil erosion
* Depletion of minerals in the soil
* Particulate matter, including ammonia and ammonium off-gasing from animal waste contributing to air pollution
* Release of feral plants and animals
* Odor from agricultural waste
* Soil salination

Agriculture is cited as a significant adverse impact to biodiversity in many nations' Biodiversity Action Plans, due to reduction of forests and other habitats when new lands are converted to farming. Some critics also include agriculture as a cause of current global climate change.

According to the United Nations, the livestock sector (primarily cattle, chickens, and pigs) emerges as one of the top two or three most significant contributors to our most serious environmental problems, at every scale from local to global. It is one of the largest sources of greenhouse gases - responsible for 18% of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions as measured in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; equivalents. By comparison, all transportation emits 13.5% of the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It produces 65% of human-related nitrous oxide (which has 296 times the global warming potential of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and 37% of all human-induced methane (which is 23 times as warming as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). 

Agricultural policy focuses on the goals and methods of agricultural production. At the policy level, common goals of agriculture include:

* Food safety: Ensuring that the food supply is free of contamination
* Food security: Ensuring that the food supply meets the population's needs
* Food quality: Ensuring that the food supply is of a consistent and known quality
* Conservation
* Environmental impact
* Economic stability

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Nerve Cells==

The cells of the nervous system are generally of two types, neurons or glial cells, with each contributing different functions to the nervous system. Neurons act to receive, sustain, and transmit electrochemical signals throughout the nervous system, that is from one neuron to another. Glial cells, which outnumber neurons on a 10 to 1 bases, increase speed and efficiency of signals being sent along a neuron as well as acting as a passage from the blood to the nervous system and responding to injury and disease. These two types of nerve cells have many different variations which serve different functions in the nervous system.

&lt;big&gt;Classes of Neurons&lt;/big&gt;

There is no single appearance for neurons, with varying numbers of axons and dendrites extending from the cell body. These two types of extensions are called processes and through looking at the number processes a neuron has helps to form a way of categorising neurons. When there are more than two process extending directly from the cell body a neuron is said to be a mulitpolar neuron. These neurons may have an axon and many branches of dendrites and these make up a majority of neurons. A similar class of neuron is the multipolar interneuron which is essentially the same as a multipolar neuron except these neurons do not have axons, only many dendrites and act to concerntrate neural activity within a structure of the nervous system rather than send signals to other regions of the nervous system. Two other types of neurons include unipolar neurons which have only one process extending from its cell body of which may branch to contain both dendrite and axons, and the bipolar neuron which has two processes extending from its cell body.

&lt;big&gt;Classes of Glial Cells&lt;/big&gt;

The list of functions glial cells perform in the nervous system are differentiated between different classes of neuroglia. The first two classes of neuroglia are oligoendrocytes and schwann cells. Oligodendrocytes are the glial cells which help speed up and improve the effectiveness of axonal conduction in the central nervous system. This is done through the cell wrapping extensions of a fatty insulating substance known as myelin around the axons of some neurons. A similar function is performed for the peripheral nervous system by another type of neuroglia known as schwann cells. However these differ from oligodendrocytes in that each schwann cell is a single myelin segment along a neuron whereas oligodendrocytes can create multiple myelin along the same or many different axons of neurons; and in that only schwann cells provide axonal regeneration after damage. 

A third class of neuroglia are astrocytes which are star shaped cells which attach to both blood vessels and central nervous system neuron cell bodies offering a variety of support functions such as assistance in maintaining structure and the traversing of nutrients and chemicals from blood to the nerve cell. Microglia, a fourth class of glial cell, aiding the nervous system by responding to injured or diseased neurons through consuming cellular debris and prompting an inflammatory response. Finally, during early fetal development another class of glial cell called radial glial cells form a temporary network which aids neural migration in the developing neural tube.

== Nerve Impluses ==

&lt;big&gt;Membrane Potentials&lt;/big&gt;

There is a difference in electrical charge between the inside and the outside of the nerve cell which varies due to positively and negatively charged ions, which add up to result in the voltage of the neuron and its membrane potential. In a neuron's resting state, known as resting potential, the cells electrical charge is typically between -60 and -80 millivolts and in this state it is not transmitting signals, it is said to be polarized. Several factors can influence the neuron's electrical charge resulting in a further decrease electrical charge within the cell, or an increase of electrical charge within the cell which when large enough causes an action potential. The state of the neuron is a result of the number of positive or negatively charged ions, and the stimuli that open or close the cells ion channels.

&lt;big&gt;Ions, Ion Pumps and Ion Channels&lt;/big&gt;

Due to the nature of ions they tend to be distributed in a consistent manner within the neural tissue as they move to areas of less ionic concentration than high concentration. Electrostatic pressure also causes to spread out the positive or negative charged ions relatively evenly throughout neural tissue as the ions repel like charges in the same area and are attracted to opposing charges in different areas. The distribution of ions on the inner and outer wall of the cell membrane is not equal and potassium, sodium, and chloride ions can pass through the cell membrane of the resting neuron easily due to electrostatic pressure differences driving them either in or out. Potassium ions are continuously being driven out of the nerve cell by 20 mV of pressure and sodium ions are pushed inside the cell membrane despite resistance due to 120mV of pressure. As shifts in the levels of ions in the neuron lead it to action potential there are active processes in place within the neuron to keep levels of potassium and sodium at a balance, known as sodium potassium pumps, which pump three sodium ions inside the neuron for two potassium ions outside the neuron. Chloride ions on the other hand naturally pass inside and out of the neuron depending on the electrostatic pressure until an equilibrium is reached. Another manner in which ions pass in and out of the neuron is a type of through gated ion channels which open and close in response to a stimuli associated with that gate type. Stretch-gated ion channels are found in stretch sensing cells, ligang-gated ion channels are opened or closed in response to a certain chemical, often a neurotransmitter, and are located at the cells synapse. A third type is Voltage-gated ion channels which are usually found in axons but sometimes dendrites and open or close when the membrane potential changes. Gated ion channels are the means by which nerve cells create action potentials and therefore create communication through the nervous system.

&lt;big&gt;Axonal conduction as Signals for Action Potential&lt;/big&gt;

[[Image:Spacial and Temporal Summation.jpg|thumb|caption]]
Stimuli that affect the gated ion channels of neurons influence the membrane potential of the neuron creating one of three potentials: hyper polarization, depolarization, and action potential. In hyperpolarization the cells membrane potential is decreased in charge (from -70 to -72) and in depolarization the charge is increased (from -70 to -68), larger or more frequent stimuli produce larger polarization in the appropriate direction and it is possible for both hyperpolarized and depolarized stimuli to affect the neuron which can cancel each other out to the level of their charge, likewise multiple depolarized (or hyperpolarized) stimuli can affect a neuron, a process called summation. Finally, polarization that is caused from the firing of another neuron is called postsynaptic polarization giving depolarization the name excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) and hyperpolarization the name inhibitory postsynaptic potenial (IPSP) because they each increase and decrease the likelihood of causing an action potential, respectively.

&lt;big&gt;Action Potentials&lt;/big&gt;

Depolarization and hyperpolarization can increase or decrease the membrane potential of the neuron taking it close or further to what is called the threshold of excitation which is often -65 mV. When the membrane potential reached the particular threshold of excitation for that cell an action potential is generated resulting in a momentary shift in energy lasting only 1 millisecond, where the membrane potential is then inverted from -70 mV to around +50 mV. Action potentials are often referred to as all-or-none responses because when they occur they occur fully or not at all.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Bivariate Data ==

'''Bivariate Data''' is data of two quantitative variables.  This kind of data is analogous to what is known as ''univariate data'', which is data of one quantitative variable (which could also have been deduced from their prefixes: &quot;bi&quot; means two and &quot;uni&quot; means one).  

Bivariate data is used mainly in statistics.  It is used in studies that include measures of central tendencies (i.e. mean, median, mode, midrange), variability, and spread.  In each study, more than one variable is collected, like in medical studies.  Height and weight of individuals might want to be obtained, not just height or weight.  Bivariate data is the comparing of two quantitative variables of an individual, and can be shown graphically through histograms, scatterplots, or dotplots.  


== Example ==

Based on the data given below, do women generally marry at a younger age than men do?

In this example, we are given two variables: gender and age.  The data is given to us below:

10 men's and women's ages of when they were married

Men:

25, 26, 27, 29, 30, 31, 33, 36, 38, 40
  
Women:

19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 28, 29, 30

With this data, you can create a histogram to graphically see the results and how they relate to one another.  Then, find the mean of each separate chart.  The mean age of when men get married is:

&lt;u&gt;25 + 26 + 27 + 29 + 30 + 31 + 33 + 36 + 38 + 40&lt;/u&gt;

10

= 31.5

The mean age of when women get married is:

&lt;u&gt;19 + 20 + 21 + 22 + 23 + 25 + 26 + 28 + 29 + 30&lt;/u&gt;

10

= 24.3

Both distributions are slightly skewed to the right, meaning that more of the data values occur to the left of the mean than to the right.

So, based on our data, women do typically marry at a younger age than men do.

''RC has a stable voltage at low frequencies and increasing voltage at high frequencies.''

==Summary==
# Low-pass filters have a stable voltage at low frequencies and increasing voltage at high frequencies.
# Low-pass filters can be constructed from RC or LR.
# Low-pass filters have a general formula:
:: &lt;math&gt;\frac{V_o}{V_i} = \frac{1}{1 + j\omega T}&lt;/math&gt;  .  T = RC = &lt;math&gt;\frac{L}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

==Analysis==
* At ω = 0 , Capacitor opens circuit . Therefore, I = 0

* At Resonance Frequency , Impedance of L and C cancel out. 
: &lt;math&gt;\omega L = \frac{1}{\omega C}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, the Impedance of the circuit is R and at minimum value and Current will be at its maximum value
:Z&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; - Z&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 . 
:Z = Z&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; + Z&lt;sub&gt;L&lt;/sub&gt; + Z&lt;sub&gt;C&lt;/sub&gt; =  Z&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt; + 0 = R
:&lt;math&gt;I = \frac{V}{R}&lt;/math&gt;

* At ω = 0 , Inductor opens circuit . Therefore, I = 0

From three paired value ω and I graph of I  - ω can be plotted . From graph
:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=10%
!  ω !! I
|-
|0 || 0
|-
|&lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\frac{V}{R}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|00 || 0
|-

|-
|}

At resonance frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega = \sqrt{\frac{1}{LC}}&lt;/math&gt;, current is at its maximum value &lt;math&gt;I = \frac{V}{R}&lt;/math&gt; . If the current is reduced to half the resonance value &lt;math&gt;I = \frac{V}{2R}&lt;/math&gt; then the circuit is respond to a bandwidth of frequencies &lt;math&gt;\omega_1 - \omega_2&lt;/math&gt; . Further reduce or increase the value of the current below or above &lt;math&gt;I = \frac{V}{2R}&lt;/math&gt; the circuit will respond to a Wider or Narrower Bandwidth

In conclusion, RLC series can be used as a'' Resonance Tuned Selectede Band Width Filter'' by Tuning L or C into Resonance Frquency to have a maximum value . Increasing or Descreasing the value of R to yield a desired bandwidth

==Investments in Debt Securities==

Companies invest in all kinds of debt securities to include government securities (federal or municipal), corporate bonds, notes, and commercial paper. How a company accounts for these investment in debt is based on the managements intentions for these investments.

Based on managements intentions, debt investments can be broken down into three categories.

* Held-to-maturity - The company wants to hold the  debt to maturity.
* Trading - The debt is intend to be traded in the near term for small profit gains.
* Available-for-sale - The company intends to sell at some point in the future. It isn't intended to be held to maturity, but it also wasn't intended to be traded,

When we talk about trading, we are talking about very short-term buying and selling. If a debt was going to be bought with the intention of selling within an accounting period, a company could justify that it was intended for trading. Why the difference? Later on when we talk about income recognition the method that we account for the resulting income differs.

 
===Held-to-maturity securities===

Held-to-maturity securities are recorded at amortized cost and not at fair value.

* Effective-interest method


===Available-for-sale securities===

Available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value but changes to fair value are not included in net income until after the security is sold.


===Trading securities===

Securities that are for trading are recorded at fair value and unrealized gains or losses is reported in net income. 


==Investments in Equity Securities==

* Fair Value Method (holdings less than 20%)
* Equity Method (holdings between 20% to 50% or significant influence)
* Consolidated Statements (controlling interest)


==Investments in Derivative Instruments==

* Forward Contracts
* Option Contracts
* Fair Value Hedge
* Bifurcation of hybrid securities 
* Disclosures for derivatives

==Analysis==
Assume that the transistor is ideal.
:&lt;math&gt;V_B = V_i \frac {R_2} {R_2 + R_1}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V_E = V_B - 0.7 = V_B&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;I_E = \frac {V_E} {R_4} = \frac {V_B} {R_4}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;I_C = I_E&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V_C = I_C R_4&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;V_C = V_i (1 -  \frac {R_3} {R_4} \frac {R_2}{R_2 + R_1})&lt;/math&gt;


When &lt;math&gt;R_2 &gt;&gt; R_1&lt;/math&gt; or R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0. The equation above is reduced to
:&lt;math&gt;V_C = V_i (1 -  \frac {R_3} {R_4})&lt;/math&gt;

: R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 0 , &lt;math&gt;V_C = V_i &lt;/math&gt;
: R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = R&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; , &lt;math&gt;V_C = 0 &lt;/math&gt;
: R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = 2R&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; , &lt;math&gt;V_C = - V_i &lt;/math&gt;
: R&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; = (n+1)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; , &lt;math&gt;V_C = - n V_i &lt;/math&gt;



When &lt;math&gt;R_3 = R_4&lt;/math&gt;. The equation above is reduced to
:&lt;math&gt;V_C = V_i (1 -   \frac {R_2}{R_2 + R_1})&lt;/math&gt;

When R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0  or R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0, 
: &lt;math&gt;V_C = V_i &lt;/math&gt; . Transistor operates like a closed switch

When R&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt;&gt; R&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; 
: &lt;math&gt;V_C = 0 &lt;/math&gt; . Transistor operates like an opened switch

''With the right biased voltage at the base, the transistor can be operated like a mechanical switch.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Capacitor==
:[[File:Capacitors.JPG|300px|left]]
A capacitor is an electronic component made from two conducting plates separated by a non conducting dielectric of the dimension :
: Length l 
: Area A
: Dielectric Constant &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;

The Capacitance of the Capacitor can be calculated by the formual below
:&lt;math&gt;C = \epsilon \frac{A}{l}&lt;/math&gt;

The electronics symbol of a capacitor is shown below
: [[File:Capacitor.gif|200px]]

==DC Characteristics==
When connecting a resistor with a DC voltage source in a closed loop circuit

===Charge===
: &lt;math&gt;Q = C V &lt;/math&gt;

===Voltage===
: &lt;math&gt;V = \frac{Q}{C}&lt;/math&gt;

===Capacitance===
: &lt;math&gt;R = \frac{Q}{V}&lt;/math&gt;

==AC Characteristics==
When connecting a resistor with an AC voltage source in a closed loop circuit

===Voltage===
: &lt;math&gt;v = C \frac{dv}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

===Current===
: &lt;math&gt;i = \frac{1}{C} \int v dt&lt;/math&gt;

===Reactance===
: &lt;math&gt;X_C = \frac{1}{\omega C} \angle -90^0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;X_C = \frac{1}{j\omega C}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;X_C = \frac{1}{sC}&lt;/math&gt;

===Impedance===
: &lt;math&gt;Z_C = R_C + X_C&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;X_C = R \angle 0 + \frac{1}{\omega C} \angle -90^0&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Z_C = R + \frac{1}{j\omega C}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Z_C = R + \frac{1}{sC}&lt;/math&gt;

===Frequency Response===

|-
|}

===Phase Angle Difference===
: &lt;math&gt; Tan\theta = \frac{1}{\omega CR} = \frac{1}{2 \pi f CR} = \frac{1}{2 \pi} \frac{t}{T} &lt;/math&gt;
: T = CR

==Capacitor Types==
There are two main types of Capacitors

===Fixed Capacitor===
: Capacitor that has a fixed value
: [[File:Capacitors_box.jpg|200px]] [[File:Capacitors_dipped.jpg|200px]] [[File:Tantalum_capacitor.JPG|200px]]

===Variable Capacitor===
:[[File:Variable_capacitors.jpg|400px]]
: Capacitor that has a variable value adjusted by a dial

==Capacitor Configuarations==
===Series Connection===
Two or more capacitors can be connected in series to decrese the total capacitance
: &lt;math&gt;C_t = C_1 + C_2 + .... + C_n&lt;/math&gt;

===Parallel Connection===
: &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{C_t} = \frac{1}{C_1} + \frac{1}{C_2} + .... + \frac{1}{C_n}&lt;/math&gt;
===2 Port Connection===

==Layers==
Layers are a new feature, one good example of the incremental improvements put into the game engine between major Trainz retail versions, by the programmers as they evolve the software. Layers started in this case, in Trainz TS2009 SP4 (Service Pack 4, so build=44653, post-TRS2009, Service Pack 3=build 40040)&amp;mdash; where build 40040 was considered a stable product and all languages build paths converged to that state with SP3 installed. Initial Trainz retail releases (and build 'tracks') lag in time and feature somewhat because of the translation needs to support global languages of the user base. English is virtually always first as a de facto International, if not Universal language. Trainz 2009 SP4 is barely different than Trainz 2010's initial releases, but the installed content varies, and TS2010 continued with the never ending succession of new improvements.&lt;!-- Can't get this to behave, so leave for tonight...
{{plain link
|http://forums.auran.com/trainz/showthread.php?t=48841 Layers Quickstart Guide}}
---&gt;
There's a good introduction to the new concept of layers on Auran's forum at '''[http://forums.auran.com/trainz/showthread.php?t=48841 &lt;u&gt;Layers Quickstart Guide&lt;/u&gt;]'''. It starts out sensibly enough: {{cquote|... long time users of Trainz are aware that in the past when you saved in surveyor certain items were saved with the route file and certain other items were saved with the session file. For example the track, groundtextures, trees and other scenery objects were saved with the route as were triggers and trackmarks. Rolling stock, edit session parameters, driver commands and interactive industry settings were saved with the session file. This knowledge was often the hardest for new users to understand and grasp. }}
The trick to understanding that, is the Surveyor module serves as a world building tool plus as the session editor, for the simple reason the Session Creator needs to see where things are on the layout&amp;mdash;and sometimes add GPS-like 'Waypoints' for users and AI Drivers both called trackmarks.
&lt;!--
See also this thread on TrainzDev for a discussion of how layers in layouts and sessions interact, and where the layer information is stored http://www.trainzdev.com/index.php?option=com_fireboard&amp;Itemid=42&amp;func=view&amp;id=12665&amp;catid=3 ---&gt;

==Service Packs==

===SP1 for TS2010===
{{sect-stub}}
See the announcement on Auran's forum at &quot;[http://forums.auran.com/trainz/showthread.php?t=49580 TS2010:EE SP1]&quot;

SP1 includes a fix for ATI video boards and a fix for the auto-update routine for future service packs. However SP1 must be downloaded and installed manually.

==Native Mode and Compatibility Mode==
TS2009,SP4/TS2010 introduce a new graphical engine progression harnessing the power of more [[w:CPU|CPU processors]] in-the-box to offload calculations to the CPUs of newer generations of Graphics Cards to process and display certain 3D graphical elements more quickly and off load the tasks on the main motherboard CPU. The enhanced G-card mode added to the graphics engine is called Native Mode, for that is the way newer computer systems default into. Compatibility mode, uses less on-board G-card calculations, keeping back compatibility with computers with older G-card systems; such backward compatible capability is a company hallmark and mission, refusing to abandon it's older loyal user base so unlike all too many video games developers.

Native Mode runs faster. Compatibility Mode copes with older assets better. You can switch back and forth between the two modes as you desire, as follows: Main menu &gt; Options &gt; Graphics - there is a small tick box to select Compatibility Mode. If this box is unticked then Native Mode will be used. Close and restart TS2010 for the change to become effective. (Note to editors: these instructions are for TS2009 - is TS2010 the same?)

==Getting started in CM==
''By default very few assets are listed'' when entering the Content Manager the first time. To fix this click the gold star to switch favorites off, and also switch to compatibility mode. These two operations might be needed to make the tutorials visible.

{{sect-stub}}
===Regions in config.txt files===

These are no longer specified by two-letter codes. Use a kuid instead now (sorry, details not known).

{{sect-stub}}
===Faulty DVDs===

Some users are experiencing problems with TS2010 DVD's which prevents the program being installed. It isn't clear whether this is a manufacturing fault on some discs or a software problem which only affects some systems.

===Performance===

Try both OpenGL and DirectX modes. Users are reporting significant differences in performance between the two but with no consistency as to which is better. It might depend on whether you have an ATI or nVidia video board.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Suppose we have a very long solenoid carrying some current I.  Around the solenoid we have a ring which can pivot around the axis of the solenoid, onto which we have glued some positive charges.  At first, the ring is motionless, but suddenly, we turn the current off. From one perspective, the changing magnetic field means there is an electric field going around the solenoid (from Faraday's law), which will push on the charges on the ring, causing it to spin. On the other hand, at first, there is no angular momentum in the system (ignoring the mass of electrons -- you may want to justify this to yourself).  Afterwards, we would expect angular momentum to be conserved and so the ring will remain motionless.

The question, of course, is whether or not the ring will spin.  Understanding the answer will lead you to a surprising and important feature of electromagnetic fields.  But to do this problem, you will need to think creatively.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Image Sensors ==
There are 2 types of image sensors commonly used to digitally acquire an image, CCD and CMOS. While both have similar image quality, their core functionality and other features greatly differ.[3]

=== CCD ===
A CCD, or Charge-Coupled Device, is an older technology based on an analog system. A photoelectric surface that coats the CCD creates an electric charger when light hits it, and the charge is then transferred and stored in a capacitive bin that sits below the surface of each pixel.[2]
The CCD then functions like a shift register, and transfers the charge in the bin below each pixel one spot over by applying a voltage in a cascading motion across the surface. 
The charge that reaches the edge of the CCD is transferred to an analog to digital converter, which turns the charge into a digital value for each pixel. This process relatively slow because of the way it has to shift each pixel to the edge of the CCD to then turn it into digital information.[4]

=== CMOS ===
A CMOS image sensor is a type of Active-Pixel Sensor (APS) constructed of Complementary metal–oxide–semiconductors. CMOS sensors can be much faster at generating a digital image, and consume less power than a CCD. They can also be larger than a CCD, allowing for higher resolution images, and can be manufactured through cheaper methods than a CCD. Each pixel in a CMOS sensor contains a photodetector and an amplifier.[4] The simplest type of CMOS image sensor is the 3T model, where each pixel is made up of 3 transistors and a photodiode.
The transistor Mrst is used to clear the value of the pixel and reset it to acquire a new image. The Msf transistor buffers and amplifies the value from the photodiode until the pixel can be read and is reset. The Msel transistor is the pixel select transistor that only outputs the pixel’s value to the bus when the device is reading the row it is in. In this model the data is gathered in parallel via a shared bus, where all pixels in a column share the same bus, and then the data is sent down the bus one row at a time. This method is faster at shifting the charge value to the digital converter.
There are other variations of the CMOS sensor which help reduce image lag and noise. Image lag is created where some of the previous image remains in the current one. This is often caused by a pixel not getting fully reset, so some of the charge from the previous image still exists. Image noise is a measure of how accurately the amount of light that hits the pixel is measured.


== Color Images ==
The 2 types of image sensors do not natively measure color; they simply convert the amount of light (regardless of color) to a digital value.[1] There are several different ways to gather color data. The 2 most common are to use a color filtering array, the Foveon X3 specialized sensor and using a trichroic prism and 3 image sensors.

=== Color Filtering Array ===
The most common method is to use a color filtering array. The most common type of filter used is the Bayer filter, developed by Kodak researcher Bryce Bayer in 1976. A color filtering array filters the light coming into each pixel so that the pixel only detects one of the primary colors. The full color image can later be recreated by adding the colors from each pixel together to create a full color image.[1]
The Bayer filter uses a pattern of 50% green, 25% red and 25% blue to match the sensitivity of the human eye to the 3 primary colors. The Bayer filter repeats over 4 pixels.[1]
Because the images have to be reconstructed and you only know one of the colors in each pixel, some of the image fidelity is lost in the process of image reconstruction called demosaicing. Edges of objects in the image can often be jagged and have non uniform color along the edges. 
In addition to the Bayer filter, there are many other filter patterns that can achieve the same result.[1]
The main problem with using a filter is that it reduces the amount of light that reaches each photodetector, thus reducing each pixel’s sensitivity to light. This can cause problems in low-light situations because the photodetectors will not receive enough light to produce a charge, resulting in large amounts of noise. To help reduce this effect, there is another type of filter in use that has some pixels that are not filtered. These Panchromatic filters mimic the human eye, which has detectors of color and detectors of light and dark.
These do much better in low light, but require a much larger area to mimic the pattern than a traditional Bayer filter. This causes some loss in fidelity

== Image Transfer ==
The two most common methods for connecting cameras to a robot are USB and FireWire (IEEE 1394). When Apple developed FireWire they had in mind that it would be used to transfer audio and video. This resulted in a greater effective speed and higher sustained data transfer rates than USB, which are needed for audio and video streaming. FireWire also has the benefits of being capable of supplying more power to devices than USB can. FireWire can also function without a computer host. Devices can communicate with each other over FireWire without a computer to mediate.[5]

      <text xml:space="preserve">=='''Overview:'''==
Swarm robotics is a relatively new study in the world of autonomous robotics. Swarm optimizations however have been around for over a decade for some functions. These techniques have recently been adapted and applied to autonomous robotic applications. On the topic of swarm robotics the word swarm is defined with several variations. On first hearing the phrase “swarm robotics” many simply think of basic interactions of robots such as follow the leader or simply data relayed between robots all traveling towards a common goal. However swarm robotics has taken further advancement in complex problem solving. Robots may now be given a goal and a basic suggestion on how to meet that goal. This suggestion may not be the most efficient way to achieve the goal much less even make it to the goal. So there must be a way to improve upon or optimize that suggestion. Optimization functions are then introduced. Several techniques covered here include Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO). These optimization functions will be covered in depth in the following.

=='''Basic Swarm Robotics:'''==
As stated earlier basic swarm robotics includes simple functions such as follow the leader and robot-to-robot interactions such as tag. In these scenarios the robots do not actively improve upon their current goal. They simply interact with one another in basic principles to achieve a predefined goal. 
===Examples:===
 
*'''EU Funded: [http://www.i-swarm.org/ I-SWARM]'''
[[File:I-swarm.jpg|300px]]

Swarm robotics is seen many times on a microrobotic scale as pictured above due to a number of factors. One of the main contributing factors to size is size in itself. A robot swarm composed of large robots can be bulky, expensive, and inefficient in data gathering. Obviously size does limit onboard equipment but that is where the principle of swarm shines. All the robots combined contribute a little more detail to the situation offering a complete picture. The swarm above funded by the EU is designed to combine all electrical aspects onto a single flexible board. The swarm has no major pending goals at this time and their behaviors are modeled after biological insects.


 
*'''Rice University: [http://people.csail.mit.edu/jamesm/ James McLurkin]'''
[[File:Mclurkin.jpg |5px‎]]

James McLurkin, assistant professor at Rice University has developed his own DARPA funded swarm. His experimentation has explored physical data structures such as swarm arrangement according to ID number. Along with this he has also written a uniform dispersion algorithm. Additional swarm research includes his work on Robot Speed Ratios which is the study of message propagation versus the physical speed of the robot. This study was to uncover issues with the robots moving faster than they can physically interpret relayed messages.  

 
*'''Carnegie Mellon: Magnetic Swarms'''


Research at Carnegie Mellon has been underway with a magnetic swarm of robots. The goal of this project is to develop a swarm of robots that could magnetically shape shift without any plane limitations. This could be used on the microscopic level as a three dimensional physical modeling aid. The robots pictured above use an array of electromagnets to control interactions between adjacent robots.


* '''Free University of Brussels (&quot;L'Université libre de Bruxelles&quot;)'''

Several IRIDIA projects at ULB involve
[http://code.ulb.ac.be/iridia.research.php?id=1 Swarm Intelligence].
Some of their software and hardware designs are posted at GitHub.

=Ant Colony Optimization ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ant_colony_optimization ACO]):=
ACO is one of the simplest swarm optimization techniques proven to work reliably. This optimization technique was drawn directly from nature itself, showing that it was already a viable solution. The concept requires a brief understanding of how ants function in nature. Keep in mind, this definition has been tailored to our “perfect” example. In nature, ants wander at random. If an ant is to discover food it begins emitting pheromones and starts to wander back to its nest. At some point another ant discovers food and wanders back to the nest. This cycle happens many times. If an ant wandering back to the colony is to discover one of these pheromone trails it is more likely to travel it. If a fork is encountered biasing occurs via pheromone intensity. This means, ants are more likely to travel a trail with a stronger intensity of pheromones. Pheromones being volatile will evaporate over time. This means that the more ants traveling a trail the more pheromones are emitted. However if the same number of ants travel a long trail and a short trail over the same period of time the intensity of pheromones will be greater on the shorter trail. This means bias will always be placed on the shorter, more efficient trails thus naturally selecting the best solution.

This same process can be simulated in our electrical world. A proposed solution is established and the “ants” navigate to it. The initial solution is then modified to create the most efficient solution. Below is a basic depiction of ACO. As seen there are initially two trails established which happen to overlap in the middle. These two trails offer up four possible solutions to the optimized problem. Ants then randomly travel all four possibilities. The possibilities are narrowed down via the pheromones. All four solutions are traveled by the same number of ants but the shorter solutions have a greater intensity of pheromones biasing more ants towards the shorter trails thus eliminating all other solutions and converging on the best fit solution.

=Particle Swarm Optimization ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_swarm_optimization PSO])=
PSO steps further away from stochastic functions towards an even more intelligent solution to a problem. Much of the PSO functionality is modeled after natural associations such as a flock of birds or a school of fish. In a PSO function, a generic solution is first given. Then a swarm of “particles” are initialized. They begin to attempt to make it to their goal. As they move towards their goal, they monitor certain other particles within a user-defined range of their own location. The particles around them contribute to a local best (lbest). This is the most fit solution discovered so far. Each particle also monitors its personal best (pbest) along with the global best (gbest) so far. Keep in mind that in some simulations lbest=gbest and the particles around each other do not have a local effect on each other. The particles are then biased towards a compilation of the lbest and pbest along with gbest. Their new velocity vector also includes a random scaling factor to prevent too early of a convergence on an inefficient solution. An equation is provided below to provide basic understanding of a swarm monitoring their pbest and gbest.

 '''General PSO Equation'''
 
 '''&lt;math&gt;v[] = v[] + c1 * rand() * (pbest[] - present[]) + c2 * rand() * (gbest[] - present[]) (a)
present[] = persent[] + v[] (b)&lt;/math&gt;'''


This equation also provides learning factors which in this case are scaled to “2”. From this equation we can see that the new velocity is equal to the scaled value of the sum of the difference of pbest-present and gbest-present. As it can be seen this optimization techniques offers a highly accurate convergence on the best fit solution to the problem.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''The History of Evolutionary Theory, and the Implications of Genetics'''

Had Charles Darwin, the man who coined the mechanism of evolution as &quot;natural selection&quot; been introduced to Gregor Mendel, the geneticist who first described gene inheritance, biologists today would be decades ahead of where we are in terms of research.  For it is genetics, the phenomenon of traits being inherited by offspring from their parents, that provides the vessel for all evolutionary change.  Charles Darwin and the biologists of his day imagined that there was a mechanism for inheritance.  They thought there was a means through which the characteristics of parents can be passed on to their offspring, but they couldn't fully describe it.   Darwin, in his famous ''On the Origin of Species,'' implicated genetics as the vehicle for natural selection, and thus evolution, without even knowing the word.

&lt;blockquote&gt; ''...owing to this struggle, variations, however slight and from whatever cause proceeding, if they be in any degree profitable to the individuals of a species in their infinitely complex relations to other organic beings and to their physical conditions of life, will tend to the preservation of such individuals and will generally be inherited by the offspring.  The offspring also will thus have a better chance of surviving, for of the many individuals of any species which are periodically born, but a small number can survive I have called this principle by which each slight variation, if useful, is preserved, by the term Natural Selection in order to mark its relation to natures's power of selection...'' &lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the decades after Darwin's death, his theory of evolution began to fall by the wayside in scientific literature.  By the 1920's and 30's, many scientists thought that it was at best an interesting hypothesis, but without merit, as the mechanism for natural selection had yet to be identified and no observation had been made of a single speciation event.  Darwin spoke of natural selection as the driving force behind the emergence of new species.  In-fact, this was the very thesis of his book.  But no one had yet been able to describe the phenomenon.  The study of genetics continued to develop separately from evolutionary theory, only occasionally being referenced by biologists interested in heredity.  It wasn't until the 1940's, with the publication of British Biologist Julian Huxley's ''Evolution: The Modern Synthesis,'' that a solid connection was made between genetics and evolutionary theory.  Huxley and many other biologists were the proponents of a rebirth of Darwin's ideas; an intellectual movement known as &quot;neodarwinism.&quot; It is through their synthesis of genetics and evolutionary theory that a clearer picture of the evolution we know today emerged.

'''From Mutations to Modern Synthesis Theory -- How We See Genetics and Evolution Today'''

The ideas surrounding Populuation Genetics presented in Chapter 6 were the bridge needed between genetics and natural selection that led to what we know as evolution today.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Creating your SkySphere Renderer ==
In order to render the skysphere, we will create a new rendering class similar to the one used to render the fish, but modified to allow the model to render without an armature structure in place. First, create a new class file by right clicking on your project, selecting 'Add'/'New Item' and selecting 'Class'. Change the class and file name to 'GenericModelRenderer'.

Change the default using statements to the following.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
using System;
using Microsoft.Xna.Framework;
using Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Content;
using Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Graphics;
using Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Input;
using SkinnedModel;
&lt;/source&gt;

And ensure that the class is using the XNA namespace by affixing the class name with &lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;: Microsoft.Xna.Framework.Game&lt;/source&gt;.

Add the following class variables and constructor.
public Model currentModel;
public Vector3 Translation = new Vector3(0, 0, 0);
public Vector3 Rotation = new Vector3(0, 0, 0);
public float Scale = 1.0f;

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
public GenericModelRenderer(Model currentModelInput)
{
    currentModel = currentModelInput;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Unlike the previous code, much less initialisation is required as we do not need to initialise the animation player. You'll see a similar trend with this classes equivalent to the 'ModelDraw' method.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
public void ModelDraw(GraphicsDevice device, Vector3 cameraPosition, Vector3 cameraTarget, float farPlaneDistance)
{
    Matrix[] transforms = new Matrix[currentModel.Bones.Count];
    currentModel.CopyAbsoluteBoneTransformsTo(transforms);

    // Compute camera matrices.
    Matrix view = Matrix.CreateLookAt(cameraPosition, cameraTarget, Vector3.Right);

    //Calculate the aspect ratio
    float aspectRatio = (float)device.Viewport.Width /
                                (float)device.Viewport.Height;

    Matrix projection = Matrix.CreatePerspectiveFieldOfView(MathHelper.ToRadians(45.0f), aspectRatio,
        1.0f, farPlaneDistance);

    // Draw the model. A model can have multiple meshes, so loop.
    foreach (ModelMesh mesh in currentModel.Meshes)
    {
        // This is where the mesh orientation is set, as well as our camera and projection.
        foreach (BasicEffect effect in mesh.Effects)
        {
            effect.World = transforms[mesh.ParentBone.Index] *
                Matrix.CreateRotationX(Rotation.X) *
                Matrix.CreateRotationY(Rotation.Y) *
                Matrix.CreateRotationZ(Rotation.Z) *
                Matrix.CreateScale(Scale) *
                Matrix.CreateWorld(Translation, Vector3.Forward, Vector3.Up);

            effect.View = view;
            effect.Projection = projection;
        }
        mesh.Draw();
    }
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Notice that the draw method uses the same arguments as the other fish code, can be used in more or less the same way.

== Using Your Renderer ==
Place a new folder in your models folder called 'SkySphere', and add your model and texture. Go back into your main 'Game1' file, and add the new class variable &lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;GenericModelRenderer SkySphere; //Your SkySphere model&lt;/source&gt;.

Go into your LoadContent file, and add the following lines to initialise the class and set up the model for rendering.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
currentModel = Content.Load&lt;Model&gt;(&quot;Models\\SkySphere\\SkyModel&quot;);
SkySphere = new GenericModelRenderer(currentModel);//Add the skysphere
&lt;/source&gt;

And in the draw method, add the following line about the same place as your fish models draw method.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
SkySphere.ModelDraw(GraphicsDevice, cameraPosition, cameraTarget, farPlaneDistance);
&lt;/source&gt;

Render the code, and if you're set up is the same as mine, you should see a screen like this.

[[File:XNA Bad sky sphere.gif|thumb|centre]]

You might notice this isn't quite what we need. We can adjust the position and the scale by adjusting the public variables in the SkySphere class. In my case, I added the following changes after the classes initialisation in the LoadContent() method.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
SkySphere.Translation.X = 120.0f;
SkySphere.Translation.Z = 15.0f;
SkySphere.Scale = 30.0f;
&lt;/source&gt;

Adjust to taste, and you should see a screen similar to mine here.

      <text xml:space="preserve">It is one thing to swim physically, but it is another thing to swim mentally. Swimming mentally means that you are ready to swim. That you are mentally ready to get in the pool and swim your workout. Swimming mentally is what wins races.

==What does swimming mentally do?==
While swimming an event, lets say the 50 freestyle, the main mentality is that you want to win. In order to win an event, you have to beat your opponents. Many people give up trying when they notice that their opponent is far ahead and uncatchable. Before standing on the blocks, before going to the swimming meet, before even practice, a swimmer needs to prepare for the meet mentally.

== Metrication ==

I saw your comments in the General Reading Room.  I have been working for many years on Wikibooks trying to make sure that all Cookbook recipes use metric units and then categorise them as such.  It is a constant work in progress.  Metric recipes can be found at [[Category:Recipes_with_metric_units]] and some recipes awaiting metric units can be found at [[User:Xania/Sandbox]].  I wish Wikibooks would adopt a policy to only use metric units but it seems to be a losing battle much to the detriment of the project.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Estonia.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 22:23, 21 April 2013 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Long time ago , Newton proposed that all matter consist of particles . Then John Dalton experiment points out that all matter made up from smallest particles of matter that still has matter's property when undergo a chemical reaction called [[Atom]] . Later on , J J Thomson experiment point out that Atom can be decomposed into smaller Electric Charged Carrying Particles called [[Charged Particles]] .

==Electric Charged Particles==
Charged particles are sub atomic particles . There are three kind of Charged Particles namely [[Electron]] , [[Proton]] and [[Neutron]]. Electron has a negative charge . Proton has a positive charge and Neutron has no charge or neutral in charge . These charged particles cannot be divided further . The characteristic of these three charged particles are shown below

* Electron
: Carries Negative Charge 
: Mass, M&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;
: Symbol, e&lt;sup&gt;-&lt;/sup&gt;

* Proton
: Carries Positive Charge
: Mass, M&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;
: Symbol, p&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;

* neutron
: Carries Zero Charge
: Mass, M&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;
: Symbol, n&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Since Charged Particles are the smallest particles of a matter therefore a model of matter from charged particles can be developed . There are two model developed by Rutherford and Borh that can be used as a model of matter

==Matter's Model==
:[[File:Bohr_atom_model_notext.svg|200px]]
===Rutherford's Model===
# All matter is made up of chemical elements; atom is  the smallest element of matter that cannot be divided by chemical reaction and still has the properties of matter. 
# All atoms have a nucleus made of Protons and Neutrons locate in the center and  Electrons' orbits circulates around the Nucleus of the Atom
# The number of Electrons on all orbits must be equal to the number of Protons in the Nucleus. The Atomic Number indicates the number of Electrons in orbits or the number of Protons in Nucleus.
#  Only Electron in the outer most orbit can participate in any action .

===Bohr's Model===
# Each orbit of electrons has a quantum energy level correspond to its radius. There are four quantum energy level namely 1,2,3,4 where 1 is the smallest energy level
# The outermost electron orbit has the lowest Quantum Potential Energy E = h f and the greatest Kinetic Energy &lt;math&gt;E = \frac{1}{2} m v^2&lt;/math&gt;
# As electron moves from a low potential energy level to a high potential energy level the difference in energy is used to emit Light of Quantum Energy or Photon Light &lt;math&gt;E = E_1 - E_2 = h f = h \frac{C}{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Force==
''Force is a term used to describe a quantity that acts on an object to change object's state or to perform a task on the object''. Example Force used to push or pull a cart or force used to break a stick

==Force's Characteristics==
===Force's Pressure===
Force exerts on a cross sectional area of a surface of an object is called Pressure
:&lt;math&gt;P = \frac{F}{A}&lt;/math&gt;

===Work Done===
The ability of a Force to carry out a task on an object is defined Work done on the object . Work done by a force on an object to move object over a distance s is defined as the product of Force and Distance move
:;&lt;math&gt;W = F s = F v t = p v&lt;/math&gt;
:;&lt;math&gt;W = F \int v(t) dt&lt;/math&gt;

===Energy===
The ability of a Force to carry out a task on an object over a period of Time . 
:&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{W}{t} = F \frac{s}{t} = F v = F a t = p a&lt;/math&gt;

:;&lt;math&gt;E = \frac{F}{t} \int v(t) dt&lt;/math&gt;

==Types of Force==
===Motion Force===
Motion Force is a force used to set an object in motion . Force to make an object move is calculated by
:; &lt;math&gt;F = m a &lt;/math&gt;
:; &lt;math&gt;F = m \frac{v}{t} = \frac{p}{t}&lt;/math&gt;

For any motion of speed v(t) caused by a force
: ''&lt;math&gt;F = m \frac{dv(t)}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;''

===Gravitational Force===
Attraction's Force of the Earth to attract any object toward the Earth
: &lt;math&gt;g = G \frac{m}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;F_g = M g = G \frac{m M}{r^2}&lt;/math&gt;

===ElectroMotive Force===
ElectroMotive Force is the electric force that set stationary charge to move in a straight horizontal line
:&lt;math&gt;F_E = q E&lt;/math&gt;

===ElectroMagnetoMotive Force===
ElectroMagnetoMotive Force is the magnetic force that set the moving charge to move in perpendicular to the horizontal direction
:&lt;math&gt;F_B = \pm vB&lt;/math&gt;
===ElectroMagnetic Force===
ElectroMagnetic Force is the sum of the Electric Field Force and the Electric force
:&lt;math&gt;F_EB = F_E + F_B = q(E \pm vB)&lt;/math&gt;

==Summary==
''Force is used to to describe a quantity that acts on matter to perform a task ''
# ''To cause an object to move or to set an object in motion ''. Example to push or pull a door  
# ''To cause matter to change its state ''. Example change Solid to Liquid to Gas

      <comment>/* Sample Data */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You have many items in a set of data that have a category associated with them.  You want to create a report that sorts the items by a category.

== Method ==
We will perform the query in three steps.
# use a FLWOR statement create a sequence of the distinct categories using the distinct-values() function
# for each item in the category sequence, select all items that belong to that category.  This will be done by adding a predicate (where clause) to the end of our XPath selector.  This takes the form of data/item[x=y] where if x=y returns true the item will be added to the sequence
# for each result set in the FLWOR statement return the category name and then all the items in that category

== Sample Data ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;items&gt;
    &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;item #1&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;category&gt;red&lt;/category&gt;
    &lt;/item&gt;
 &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;item #1&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;category&gt;red&lt;/category&gt;
    &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;item #2&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;category&gt;green&lt;/category&gt;
    &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;item #3&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;category&gt;red&lt;/category&gt;
    &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;item #4&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;category&gt;blue&lt;/category&gt;
    &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;item #5&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;category&gt;red&lt;/category&gt;
    &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;item #6&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;category&gt;blue&lt;/category&gt;
    &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;item #7&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;category&gt;green&lt;/category&gt;
    &lt;/item&gt;
    &lt;item&gt;
        &lt;name&gt;item #8&lt;/name&gt;
        &lt;category&gt;red&lt;/category&gt;
    &lt;/item&gt;
&lt;/items&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Sample Query ==

The following XQuery will demonstrate this technique.  Note that the distinct values for all the categories
are stored in the '''$distinct-categories''' variable.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;
declare option exist:serialize &quot;method=xhtml media-type=text/html&quot;;

(: load the items :)
let $data := doc('/db/mdr/apps/training/labs/04-group-by/data.xml')/items

let $distinct-categories := distinct-values($data/item/category/text())

return
&lt;html&gt;
  &lt;body&gt;
     &lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
        &lt;thead&gt;
           &lt;tr&gt;
              &lt;th&gt;Category&lt;/th&gt;
              &lt;th&gt;Items&lt;/th&gt;
           &lt;/tr&gt;
        &lt;/thead&gt;
        &lt;tbody&gt;
        {
        for $category in $distinct-categories
        return
           &lt;tr&gt;
              &lt;td&gt;{$category}&lt;/td&gt;
              &lt;td&gt;{string-join($data/item[category=$category]/name/text(), ', ')}&lt;/td&gt;
           &lt;/tr&gt;
        }
        &lt;/tbody&gt;
     &lt;/table&gt;
  &lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

In the query above the statement:

   $data/item[category=$category]

reads as &quot;get all the items from the data set that have the category element equal to the current category.

The string-join() function just puts a comma and a space string between the items in the output stream for readability.

== Sample Output ==

&lt;table border=&quot;1&quot;&gt;
                &lt;tr&gt;
                    &lt;th&gt;Category&lt;/th&gt;
                    &lt;th&gt;Items&lt;/th&gt;
                &lt;/tr&gt;
                &lt;tr&gt;
                    &lt;td&gt;red&lt;/td&gt;
                    &lt;td&gt;item #1, item #3, item #5, item #8&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;/tr&gt;
                &lt;tr&gt;
                    &lt;td&gt;green&lt;/td&gt;

                    &lt;td&gt;item #2, item #7&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;/tr&gt;
                &lt;tr&gt;
                    &lt;td&gt;blue&lt;/td&gt;
                    &lt;td&gt;item #4, item #6&lt;/td&gt;
                &lt;/tr&gt;
 &lt;/table&gt;

== Discussion ==
Note that you are not restricted to having an item be in a single category.  Adding multiple categories to an item will not require any changes to the script.

You can also add new categories to this list at any time without changing the program above.  As long as there are range indexes for the category element the list of all categories will be created very quickly, even for millions of records.

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''The paragraph below is IDIOTIC'''

''&quot;The speed varies depending on atmospheric conditions; the most important factor is the temperature. The humidity has very little effect on the speed of sound, while the static sound pressure (air pressure) has none. Sound travels slower with an increased altitude (elevation if you are on solid earth), primarily as a result of temperature and humidity changes.&quot;''

Note the blatent contradictions:

'''Contradition 1:'''

''&quot;The humidity has very little effect on the speed of sound&quot;''

contradicts with

''&quot;Sound travels slower with an increased altitude.....primarily as a result of .... humidity changes.&quot;''
absolutely IDIOTIC!!!

'''Contradiction 2:'''

''&quot;the static sound pressure (air pressure) has [no effect on speed] &amp; [humidity has very little effect]&quot;''

contradicts with

''&quot;Sound travels slower with an increased altitude [[[but the main effect increased altitude is pressure change]]]primarily as a result of temperature and humidity changes.&quot;''

so the contradictions are:

humdidity has very little effect, except at high altitude in which case it has a huge effect.
pressure has no effect - except if you reduce the pressure and temperature and change the humidity in which case it has a huge effect.....

'''someone needs to fix this!!!!!'''</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Creating Other Fish ==
The simplest way to create other fish is to copy the model file and modify the local textures to it. In my case, I created a new folder in the 'Content'/'Models' folder called 'OtherFish', and modified the textures so that all of the textures are shades of orange instead of blue. Ensure the new texture files are the same name as the previous ones, and that the 'Content Processor' is set to 'SkinnedModelProcessor', and it will work.

Next up, create a new array of your usermade 'ModelRenderer' type called OtherFishes alongside your other class variables.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
ModelRenderer[] OtherFishes = new ModelRenderer[16];
&lt;/source&gt;

And initialise them by placing the following 'for' statement inside your LoadContent() method alongside the others.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
//Initialises the NPC fish
currentModel = Content.Load&lt;Model&gt;(&quot;Models\\OtherFish\\FishModel&quot;);
for (int i = 0; i &lt; OtherFishes.Length; i++)
{
    OtherFishes[i] = new ModelRenderer(currentModel);
    OtherFishes[i].Translation = new Vector3(0f);//Move it to the centre
}
&lt;/source&gt;

In the same way as the original fish we created, we need to place a call to each of these fishes draw and update methods. Place in the following statements, this in alongside the 'FishMen' Update method call;

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; OtherFishes.Length; i++)
{
    OtherFishes[i].Update(gameTime);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

And this alongside the it's Draw call.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; OtherFishes.Length; i++)
{
    OtherFishes[i].ModelDraw(GraphicsDevice, cameraPosition, cameraTarget, farPlaneDistance);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

This covers the routine aspects to displaying the fish.

== Moving the Fish ==
Create a new method called 'ResetNPCFish' as below;

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
//Resets NPC fishes
void ResetNPCFish(int input)
{
    Random random = new Random();//Allows for the creation of random numbers
    Vector2 Boundarys = new Vector2(14f);//Defines the boundarys of where the fish start

    //Rotates the fish so they rotate towards the screen
    OtherFishes[input].Rotation.Y = (float)((Math.PI / 180.0) * 180);//Put simply, this will rotate it by 180 degrees
    OtherFishes[input].Rotation.Z = (float)((Math.PI / 180.0) * 180);
    //Moves the fish into a random position defined by the 'Boundarys' variable
    OtherFishes[input].Translation.X = random.Next((int)Boundarys.X * -1, (int)Boundarys.X);
    OtherFishes[input].Translation.Y = random.Next((int)Boundarys.Y * -1, (int)Boundarys.Y);
    //Moves the fish beyond the viewing horizon
    OtherFishes[input].Translation.Z = random.Next((int)farPlaneDistance + 100);

    OtherFishes[input].PlayAnimation(&quot;Frown&quot;);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

And place a call to it inside your initialisaion routine as below.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
//Initialises the NPC fish
currentModel = Content.Load&lt;Model&gt;(&quot;Models\\OtherFish\\FishModel&quot;);
for (int i = 0; i &lt; OtherFishes.Length; i++)
{
    OtherFishes[i] = new ModelRenderer(currentModel);
    OtherFishes[i].Translation = new Vector3(0f);//Move it to the centre
    OtherFishes[i].PlayAnimation(&quot;Swim&quot;);//Play the default swimming animation
    ResetNPCFish(i);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

If you run the game as it is, you should see 16 fish initialised swim past the controllable fish, and little else.

[[File:XNA Orange Fish.gif|thumb|centre]]

To ensure that the fish swim indefinitely, add the following changes to the 'OtherFishes's update code, which will check the fishes position on the screen, and restart it if needed.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; OtherFishes.Length; i++)
{
    float speed = 0.02f;

    OtherFishes[i].Translation.Z -= speed * (float)gameTime.ElapsedGameTime.TotalMilliseconds;

    if (OtherFishes[i].Translation.Z &lt; -10f)
        ResetNPCFish(i);

    OtherFishes[i].Update(gameTime);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Run it now, and it will run indefinitely.

== Hitting the Fish ==
Next up, we will place in code which will default the fish to displaying a frown, then when it is bumped into by the player, will change the fishes frowns upside down. Add the following line at the bottom of the 'ResetNPCFish' method.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
OtherFishes[input].PlayAnimation(&quot;Frown&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

To check a collision between the player and the enemy, create the following two new methods.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
bool CheckCollision(Vector3 PlayerPosition, Vector3 NPCPosition)
{
    double DifferenceNeeded = 4;//Feel free to adjust, affects how close the NPC has to be before the expression changes

    double X = Difference(PlayerPosition.X, NPCPosition.X);
    X *= X;
    double Y = Difference(PlayerPosition.Y, NPCPosition.Y);
    Y *= Y;
    double Z = Difference(PlayerPosition.Z, NPCPosition.Z);
    Z *= Z;
    if (Math.Sqrt(X + Y + Z) &lt; DifferenceNeeded)
        return true;

    return false;
}

float Difference(float int1, float int2)
{
    if (int1 &gt; int2)
        return int1 - int2;
    else
        return int2 - int1;
}
&lt;/source&gt;

And the following alongside the other pieces of update code.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
if(CheckCollision(FishMen.Translation, OtherFishes[i].Translation))
    OtherFishes[i].PlayAnimation(&quot;Smile&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

Play it now, and you should see the fish change when you touch them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">this list is woefully incomplete.  should add at a minimum Fermat's Little Theorem, FLT, approximate # prime numbers below a threshold, and some general symbolic ones under the basic math ops like A/A=1 , A!=0, A*0=0, A+0=A,A-0=A
for prime numbers the relation is # primes &lt;N ~ N/ln(N).  FLT=a^n+b^n=c^n  only has integer solutions for n=2.  Also, sqrt(N) has as mirror sol'ns (1 &gt;0,1&lt;0).
Should have basic established formulas like area/perimeter of a ellipse, rectangle, triangle.   The eq'n to show ln(exp(x))=x.  Goldbach's that every even=prime1+prime2.  I will try to add as time permits but have limited time.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Rutgers is the third most competitive school in New Jersey in terms of undergraduate admissions, after Princeton and TCNJ. However, difficulty varies by program, with Pharmacy generally considered the hardest to get in. The application is online, and allows students to apply to up to three schools within Rutgers. An essay is recommended, but not mandatory unless applying for scholarships. Admitted students are generally in the top 20% of their class. The middle %50 have SAT scores of 520-630 for critical reading and 550-670 for math.

      <text xml:space="preserve">As Rutgers is a state university, the main priority is research. This is good in that professors are experts in their fields. For example, the philosophy department consistently ranks in the top 3 in the United States. The negative is that teaching is not valued as much. Expect introductory classes to contain 200 or more students, with the professor using a microphone and homework graded by a TA.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Why swim?==
Why would someone decide to swim? Why spend your time and effort into a sport? Swimming is a sport that requires skill, motivation, and effort. Swimming has to do with a team, but most of swimming comes individually. Being able to master swimming mentally, physically, and emotionally, you will be successful and enjoy swimming to its fullest.

      <text xml:space="preserve">New Jersey is a densely populated, highly diverse state. Expect many arguments about North Jersey vs. South Jersey vs. Central Jersey (if it exists at all). One thing everyone agrees on is their scorn of TCNJ, and to a lesser extent, Princeton.

Students are generally very socially liberal, even by NJ standards. Youtube videos of the campus's reaction to Obama's election should be evidence enough.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Bandwidth Limits==
&lt;s&gt;You cannot go over 2gb upload or 4gb download over any 7 day period, on either wireless or wired internet. If you do either of these on either connection, your internet on ''that connection only'' is blocked, but ''not necessarily for 7 days''. It is only blocked until the past 7 days are under the limit.

Keep in mind that if you use a wireless router in your dorm room, it still counts as &quot;wired&quot;. For this reason, you should put a password on your router so people don't steal bandwidth.

Unless you are using bittorrent or downloading entire movies from Netflix, bandwidth should not be a problem. Filesharing on the Rutgers DC++ servers does not add to your bandwidth total, so download as much as you want. It is also much faster than bittorrent.&lt;/s&gt;

University internet is now throttled by speed rather than by transfer.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Periodic Motion==
Periodic motion refers to any motion moving at a distance above and below the equilibrium position and this motion keeps repeat itself over a period of time. This type of motion is also called [[/Oscillation/]] .

==Examples==
# The moving up and down of a spring 
# The swinging side by side of a pendulum

==Analysis==
===The moving up and down of a spring ===
When apply a force on an object of mass m attach to a spring , the spring will move a distance y above and below the equilibrium point

The force acts on the object is
: F = m a

The Restoring Force of spring is given by Hook's law as
: F&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = - k y

When The Net Force on the system is 0 then there is no movement
: F - F&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; = 0
: m a = - k y
: y = &lt;math&gt;\frac{m a}{k}&lt;/math&gt;
: a = - &lt;math&gt;\frac{k}{m} y&lt;/math&gt;
: v t = &lt;math&gt;\frac{k}{m} y&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;t = \frac{k}{m} \frac{y}{v}&lt;/math&gt;

===The swinging side by side of a pendulum===

::The more recently &quot;Icon usage&quot; to my understanding was to remove this ambiguity, and prevent confusing opinions toward saving valid content. Transwiki includes the deletion of the content here on Wikibooks but permits its survival elsewhere, opting for simple deletion means you feel that the proposed transwiki is not beneficial or that the work has no worth and can be lost. This distinction will be important for the contributors and can help other projects (some works have came to Wikibooks on the same grounds), hope you understand the implications...&lt;br&gt;
::A solid consensus on transwiki also presses the acting administrator on doing both steps, I don't know the common practice but I expect some minority opinions for traswiki to just be ignored.   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 20:43, 23 November 2009 (UTC)
:::There may be no suitable project to Transwiki it to. I favour deleting as not suitable for Wikibooks. If there is a transwiki opinion then an impending doom can be added. An Admin here can't transwiki - that requires an Admin on the receiving project to do it and we shouldn't be hosting unsuitable content indefinitely on the hope that someone outside the project is willing to come along at some point and transwiki it.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Readying Your Sound ==
Using sound effects in XNA can be a little long winded, as an external application, the XACT tool (available in the tools folder of your XNA start menu folder) is required to process the sound files into a 'cue' file before it can be used in your project. It is possible to play a '.Wav' file directly in the code, but you lose the benefit of being able to adjust the attributes of your sounds as you will see below. Open up XACT v3, and you should see the following screen.

[[File:XNA XACT opening screen.gif|thumb|centre]]

For this project, we will be using two sound effects, an open licence sound effect file which will be played every time a fish is collided with, and a looping music file taken from the [http://www.newgrounds.com/audio/ Newgrounds Audio Portal], a good resource for indie games (the game 'Castle Crashers' available on the Xbox Arcade takes all its music from this website) and can be used freely. Both are available in the complete sample on the main page. Note that the sounds will have to be converted into a '.Wav' file before they can be used, for this I used the audio conversion utility [http://www.dbpoweramp.com/ dBpoweramp].

Each of the sounds which we will be loading will be stored inside a 'Wave Bank', containing the raw audio data which will be streamed by the program at run time. The instructions on how to play these files will then be stored inside a 'Sound Bank', which contains the 'Sounds' which contain the properties of each sound to be played, and the 'Cue', which will be referenced in the program.

Create a new project (in my case called 'FishSounds'), and right click on the 'Wave Banks' tag on the left side of the screen, and select 'New Wave Bank'. Right click on the new Wave Bank and select 'Insert Wave Files', and open the two wave files.

Next, right click on your Sound Bank, and create a new one. Right click on the new bank and create two new 'Sounds', one named 'Effect', and another called 'Music'. Drag the entries from the 'Wave Bank' to the respective 'Sound Banks'.
If you select one of the new 'Sound Banks', you can see a set of options on the left side. The only one we really have to worry about here is the 'Looping'/'Infinite' checkbox near the top, but feel free to adjust any of the others to taste. Click on your 'Music' sound and click the checkbox as below.

[[File:XNA XACT check box.gif|thumb|centre]]

Create two new cues the same way as the sounds, and same as before rename them to 'Effect' and 'Music', and drag the respective 'Sound's into them.

Now save your project, and go back into your game project. Right click on your 'Content' folder and add the newly created 'FishSounds.xap' project file.

Create the following 3 new class variables;

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
AudioEngine audioEngine;
WaveBank waveBank;
SoundBank soundBank;
&lt;/source&gt;

And the following lines to your 'LoadContent()' method.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
audioEngine = new AudioEngine(&quot;Content\\FishSounds.xgs&quot;);//The new audio project
waveBank = new WaveBank(audioEngine, &quot;Content\\Wave Bank.xwb&quot;);//The name of the Wave bank
soundBank = new SoundBank(audioEngine, &quot;Content\\Sound Bank.xsb&quot;);//The name of the Sound bank
&lt;/source&gt;

If you compile the code at this point and it bring up an error message about sound effect not being found, change the path of the '.Wav' file in the XACT.

Now, in order to play the background music, insert the following line directly after your above initialisation code.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
soundBank.PlayCue(&quot;Music&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

and change your collision detection code to the following.

&lt;source lang=&quot;csharp&quot;&gt;
if (CheckCollision(FishMen.Translation, OtherFishes[i].Translation)
&amp;&amp;
OtherFishes[i].clip == OtherFishes[i].skinningData.AnimationClips[&quot;Frown&quot;])
{
    OtherFishes[i].PlayAnimation(&quot;Smile&quot;);
    soundBank.PlayCue(&quot;Effect&quot;);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

Run your code now, and you should have a fully functioning sound system.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==

The API you are using uses digest authentication, for example the [http://www.talis.com/platform/  Talis platform] There is no direct support for this in the eXist httpclient module, but one can be written in XQuery.  

The following implementation is based on the description and examples in [[w:Digest_authentication|Digest Authentication]].

== Modules and concepts ==
* eXist httpclient :  for basic POST operation
* eXist util : for uuid generation and md5encoding


== XQuery Module ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
module namespace http =&quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/http&quot;;
declare namespace httpclient= &quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/httpclient&quot;;
&lt;/source&gt;

Two functions transform between a comma-delimited list of name=&quot;value&quot; pairs and an XML representation:

The first function takes strings in the following format:
string=&quot;value&quot;,string1=&quot;value2&quot;,string3=&quot;value3&quot;

Note that the replace function removes all double quotes from the right side of each expression.

== Supporting Functions ==

The following two functions convert key-value encoded strings of this form:

   key1=&quot;value1&quot;,key2=&quot;value2&quot;,key3=&quot;value3&quot;

into XML structures of the form:

   &lt;field name=&quot;key1&quot; value=&quot;value1&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;field name=&quot;key2&quot; value=&quot;value2&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;field name=&quot;key3&quot; value=&quot;value3&quot;/&gt;


Here are the supporting functions:
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function http:string-to-nvs($string) {
   let $nameValues := tokenize($string,&quot;, &quot;)
  return
        for $f in $nameValues
        let $nv := tokenize($f,&quot;=&quot;) 
        return &lt;field name = &quot;{$nv[1]}&quot;  value=&quot;{replace($nv[2],'&quot;','')}&quot;/&gt;
};

declare function http:nvs-to-string($nvs) {
   string-join(   
      for $field in $nvs 
      return 
          concat ($field/@name, '=&quot;',$field/@value,'&quot; ')
      , &quot;, &quot;)
};
&lt;/source&gt;

== Post With Digest Function ==
The main function handles a POST operation in two steps.  The first POST will get a 401 response (should check this).  The Digest is constructed and sent back with the second POST.  

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
declare function http:post-with-digest($host, $path, $username, $password, $doc, $header ) {
    let $uri :=  xs:anyURI(concat($host,$path))

    (: send an HTTP Request to the server - called the challenge :)
    let $request :=   httpclient:post( $uri, &quot;dummy&quot;, false(), $header ) 

    (: The server responds with the 401 response code.  In this ressponse the server provide the authentication 
       realm and a randomly-generated, single-use value called a nonce.
       We will get the realm and the nouce by finding the WWW-Authenticate value out of the response :)
    let $first-response := substring-after($request//httpclient:header[@name=&quot;WWW-Authenticate&quot;]/@value,&quot;Digest &quot;)
    
    (: now we get the nounce, realm and the optional quality of protection out of the first response :)
    let $fields := http:string-to-nvs($first-response)
    let $nounce := $fields[@name=&quot;nonce&quot;]/@value
    let $realm := $fields[@name=&quot;realm&quot;]/@value
    let $qop := $fields[@name=&quot;qop&quot;]/@value
    
    (: Create a client nounce using a Universally Unique Identifier :)
    let $cnonce := util:uuid()

    (: this is the nounce count :)
    let $nc := &quot;00000001&quot;
    let $HA1:= util:md5(concat($username,&quot;:&quot;,$realm,&quot;:&quot;,$password))

    (: TODO if the quality of protection (qos) is &quot;auth-int&quot; , then HA2 is
           MD5(method : digestURU : MD5(entityBody))
       But if qos &quot;auth&quot; or &quot;auth-int&quot; then it is the following :)
    let $HA2 :=  util:md5(concat(&quot;POST:&quot;,$path))

    let $response :=  util:md5(concat($HA1, &quot;:&quot;, $nounce,&quot;:&quot;,$nc,&quot;:&quot;, $cnonce, &quot;:&quot;, $qop, &quot;:&quot;,$HA2))
    (: note that if qop directive is unspecified, then the response should be md5(HA!:nounce:HA2) :)

    (: here are the new headers :)
    let $newfields := (
        &lt;field name=&quot;username&quot; value=&quot;{$username}&quot;/&gt;,
        &lt;field name=&quot;uri&quot; value=&quot;{$path}&quot;/&gt;,
        &lt;field name=&quot;cnonce&quot; value=&quot;{$cnonce}&quot;/&gt;,
        &lt;field name=&quot;nc&quot; value=&quot;{$nc}&quot;/&gt;,
        &lt;field name=&quot;response&quot; value=&quot;{$response}&quot;/&gt;
         )
    let $authorization := concat(&quot;Digest &quot;, http:nvs-to-string(($field,$newfields)))
    let $header2 :=
      &lt;headers&gt;
            {$header/header}
            &lt;header name=&quot;Authorization&quot; 
                  value='{$authorization}'/&gt;
      &lt;/headers&gt;
   return httpclient:post( $uri, $doc, false(), $header2 )
};
&lt;/source&gt;

Note that on under eXist 1.4 the util:md5($string) function has been deprecated.  You should now use util:hash($string, 'md5) function with the second parameter now the type of hash.

== Example ==

In this example, an RDF file is POSTed to the Talis server.

&lt;pre&gt;
declare namespace rdf = &quot;http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#&quot;;
import module namespace http = &quot;http://www.cems.uwe.ac.uk/xmlwiki/http&quot; at &quot;http.xqm&quot;;

let $rdf :=  doc(&quot;/db/RDF/dataset.rdf&quot;)/rdf:RDF
let $path :=  &quot;/store/mystore/meta&quot;
let $username := &quot;myusername&quot;
let $password := &quot;mypassword&quot;
let $host := &quot;http://api.talis.com&quot;
let $header := 
   &lt;headers&gt;
     &lt;header name=&quot;Content-Type&quot;
                  value=&quot;application/rdf+xml&quot;/&gt;
   &lt;/headers&gt;

return http:put-with-digest($host, $path, $username, $password, $rdf , $header)

&lt;/pre&gt;

Light comes from difference sources . 
* [[/Light from Celestial Bodies/]]. 
: Light from Stars (the Sun), from the Moon (reflection).
* [[/Light from Fire/]]. 
: A chemical reaction between flammable and combustible materials . Example(s): a Candle's Light, a Matches' Light.
* [[Light from Electric Discharge]]
: Light from thunder.
* [[/Light from Biolife/]]
: Bioluminesence, a chemical reaction. Example(s): Fireflies, Certain Bacteria
* [[/Electromagnetic Radiated Lights/]]
: Matter Absorbs Electric Energy until one point in time it no longer absorb Electric Energy instead it converts Electric Energy into Radiated Electromagnetic Light.
* [[/Electric Radiated Light/]] 
: Electric's Conductor when conducts current release Heat and radiate Light.

==Characteristics of Light==

      <text xml:space="preserve">There are several main methods that sociologists use to gather empirical evidence, which include [[../Questionnaires/]], [[../Interviews/]], [[../Participant Observation/]], and [[../Statistical Research/]].

The problem with all of these approaches is that they are all based on what theoretical position the researcher adopts to explain and understand the society he sees in front of him. If he is a functionalist like [[w:Émile Durkheim|Émile Durkheim]], he is likely to interpret everything in terms of large-scale social structures. If he is a symbolic interactionist, he is likely to concentrate on the way people understand one another. If he is a Marxist, or a neo-Marxist, he is likely to interpret everything through the grid of class struggle and power relations. Phenomenologists tend to think that there is only the way in which people construct their meanings of reality, and nothing else. One of the real problems is that sociologists argue that only one theoretical approach is the &quot;right&quot; one, and it is theirs. In practice, sociologists often tend to mix and match different approaches and methodologies, since each method produces particular types of data.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Sources of Sound==
In everyday life , Sounds come from many different sources

# [[Human's voice]] . Talking , screaming , shouting ...
# [[Animal's Sound]] . Dog barking , Bird Chirps ...
# [[Music Instruments]] . Music sound from guitar , drum
# [[Noise]] . Noise from collision of two things like two collides with each other

==Characteristics of Sound==
''Sound produce when two object collides with each other'' . The Loudness of the sound depend on the collision of two objects . The Tone of the sound is trebble or bass depends on material's types and material occupied space volume
* ''Sound that is audible to human's ear are in the frequencies range 2Khz - 20 Khz . Sound of frequency above 20KHz is called Ultra Sound . Sound of frequency below 2KHz is called  Infra Sound ''
* Sound does not exist in vaccum . No sound exist when placing a bell without air
* Sound needs matter's materials in order to spreading . Velocity of sound will be changed when sound travels through different medium . Fast in Solid, then Liquid and then Gas
* In air sound travel at a changing speed depend on the air's Pressure and Temperature . At standard atmosperic condition sound travel at speed v = 300 m/s
* ''Sound wave is a Longitude Wave travels with velocity changes with Temperature and Pressure of the medium it travels through'' . 
: Sound wave travels in air , Sound's Pressure creates expanding or shrinking colums of air called Rare Fractions . |  ||  |  ||
* The Reflection of sound's wave occurs when sound wave is being reflected back by a blocking object into the medium it comes from . Provided that the height of a blocking object is greater than the wave's wavelength . The total reflection occurs when the incident angle equals to the reflection angle
*When two sound waves travel toward each other, two waves interfere Constructively or Destructively to produce different Interference Effects or Sound Effects like [[Noise]] , [[Echo]] , [[Intermittent]] , [[No Sound]]

==Applications==
===Communication===
Audible sound wave is converted to electrical wave Then the electrical wave can be processed further by adding amplification and volume control ... before electrical wave is converted back to Audible Sound 
: Audible Sound Wave --&gt; Electrical Wave --&gt; | Amplyfy --&gt; Volume Control | --&gt; Audible Sound

=== Telecommunication===
Audible sound has frequency range 2KHz - 20 KHz cannot travel further than 3m . In order to carry audible sound over a long distance from the Transmitter to Receiver through Air . Sound Wave needs to be mixed with a carrier wave of high frequency MHz . This process is called modulation. There are three modulation methods are used in telecommunication namely [[../AM Modulation/]] , [[../FM Modulation/]] and [[../PM Modulation/]]

At Emitter's Station
: Audible Sound Wave + Carrier Wave --&gt; AM Wave , FM Wave or PM Wave --&gt; Amplify --&gt; Transmitter's Antenna

At Receiver's Station
: AM Wave , FM Wave or PM Wave --&gt; Receiver's Antenna --&gt; Demodulate -- &gt; Audible Sound 


''In AM Modulation sound wave is enveloped and mixed with high frequency carrier wave such that the amplitude of the carrier wave varies with sound wave's amplitude ''. In general , AM wave is easy to be interfere with other sound waves in the medium travel through therefore the quality of sound is not very good . AM sound wave cannot travel very far . AM wave is usually use to transmit sound in local area . AM's spectrum on Radio receiver KHz


''In FM Modulation sound wave is mixed with high frequency carrier wave to generate a wave of three frequencies f&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; - f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; , f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and f&lt;sub&gt;s&lt;/sub&gt; + f&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''. In general , FM wave is not easy to be interfere with other sound waves in the medium travel through therefore the quality of sound is very good . FM sound wave can travel very far . FM wave is usually use to transmit sound through a long distance . FM wave is usually use to transmit sound globally or internationally . FM's spectrum on Radio receiver MHz

===Atomic Structure and Bonding===
Fundamentally, two types of bonding exist- bonds between atoms and bonds between ions. 
Bonds between atoms of nonmetals are covalent, meaning that they share a pair of electrons in the space between them. These two atoms are bound together and cannot be separated by simple physical means. If these two atoms have similar electronegativity, neither atom has more pull on the electron pair than the other. This type of covalent bond is called '''Non Polar'''.  Examples of non polar covalent compounds are methane, carbon dioxide and graphite. In graphite, all atoms are identical and so no atom has stronger pull than any of the others. In methane, the carbon-hydrogen bonds are very slightly polar, and the polarities are cancelled because the bonds all point to the same locus.
Further there exists a weaker type of bond called hydrogen bonds important in complex molecules such as proteins. These form weak bonds that give complex molecules like Chlorophyll its specific shape and properties.
The kinds of bonds and the structure of the molecules affect the microscopic properties of substances.

==Crystal Structure==
Some of the properties of crystalline solids depends on the crystal structure of the material, the manner in which atoms, ions or molecules are spatially arranged.

==Defects==
Defects are the small gaps that develop between crystal layers where the continuation of the layer is interrupted by a boundary of a different crystal layer. Because the crystals do not perfectly align, small gaps are created in between the crystals where they meet. These gaps are called defects.  Defects of materials are subject to intense study. However there are some methods to determine the source of defects and, if occurred, the size, shape and position of defects in the materials.
There are: '''destructive testing methods''' and '''Non destructive testing methods (NDT)'''.

      <comment>/* Extrusion */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In order to produce an article for any application out of a particular material there are several steps that may be required. The first step is usually to obtain the raw materials from our environment. This may involve discovering where these raw materials are located (often achieved with knowledge of geology) and developing processes to extract them from these locations (e.g. mining the ores, drilling for oil etc.). Otherwise, it may be possible to find sources of material suitable for recycling or reprocessing. Once these raw materials have been obtained they may need to undergo some initial processing to get them into a usable form. This may be some form of extractive metallurgy, chemical synthesis or some other chemical process. It may also be necessary to mix different raw materials to achieve a certain composition (e.g. alloying in metals) that is appropriate for or optimized to an application. The application will usually require that the material be in a particular shape and a suitable shaping process or combination of process must be employed to achieve this. Often, it may be possible to produce a shape out of a material with any one of the many different shaping processes. However, there is usually one particular process that either results in particular benefits in terms of the properties of the material or the article that is produced or meets some other important criteria - such as low cost - that it is selected over the other options. Finally, it may be necessary or beneficial to process the article further, once it has been formed, in order to optimise the properties of the material.

Firstly, this chapter will present the various chemical processes that may be necessary to produce suitable materials from the raw materials in our environment. The different methods for shaping these materials will then be presented. Finally, the processes used to optimise the properties of the materials will be discussed.


====Extraction of Raw Materials====

====Chemical Synthesis of Materials====

===Shaping Processes===
====Melt Processing====
=====Casting=====

====Physical Processing====
=====Forging=====
=====Rolling=====

=====Extrusion=====
Extrusion processes are used for melt mixing polymeric materials with additives to form a homogenous mixture.  Extrusion can also be used to shape materials.

=====Powder Process=====
Powder processes are used in the production of metallic and ceramic parts. The use of metal powders is commonly referred to as Powder Metallurgy (P/M). 

There are 4 main stages to producing products with, they are: Powder Mixing, Compaction, Sintering and final finishing.

A metal or ceramic powder is prepared, then compacted into a desired shape. This part is then heated in a furnace causing the powders to weld together forming a solid part. The part is then final processed by final shaping, minor smoothing, or drilling.

Using Powders to produce parts is viable when you require a high volume of simple parts that need to be cost efficient. All though casting can also do this, P/M offers near net shape products. This means that the part that comes out of the process needs little or no finishing done to it.

Ceramics lend themselves well to powder processing as they are very hard and brittle, thus a near net shape is highly beneficial.

======Mixing======
Mixing is mainly done to add waxes for the compaction, binders to temporarily strengthen the compacts and sometimes to get the right chemistry.

As most suppliers recommend lubricant for idea compaction, mixing is a very important process, so a homogenous mixture is required.  Optimum mixing occurs with turbulent mixing and at low centrifugal forces.

Along with ensuring a homogenous mix, the mixing process also provides some milling of the powders. As we all know you can put more tennis balls in an area than beach balls, thus increasing the surface area of the balls. The same is true with powders, more surface area, the better the final product is.

======Compaction======
Compaction is the process of squishing the powders into the desired shape with enough force so as to hold its shape. This is called a green body, as it still has moisture in it and needs to be Sintered. Same basic concept as pottery, the plate or cup is considered &quot;green&quot; until it is fired

There are 2 categories of pressing: Isostatic and Axial.

======Sintering======
Sintering is simply the furnace heating of a compacted powder object, also known as a green body to form a solid part. The powders can be either metallic or ceramic. They can be in elemental form, as an alloy, or mixture of both. Most sintering processes are done in a protective atmosphere, such as nitrogen or hydrogen mixed gas, to avoid degradation of the green bodies, and at a temperature lower than the melting point, approximately 60~90% of the main elements meting point.  The specific atmosphere and temperature is dependent upon the material being processed. 

If the material being sintered is an alloy, it is possible that one or more of the constitutes has a melting point lower than the sintering temperature, thus causing a small amount of liquid to form. This is called Liquid Phase Sintering. Caution needs to be taken when choosing a temperature as too much liquid will result in the deformation of the part. This is referred to as slumping.

The mechanism of sintering is the diffusion of the atoms across the particle boundaries of compacted powders. As the atoms diffuse, all voids are filled and the material forms one solid part. As the voids between particles are no longer present, the part increases in density, and experiences shrinkage. However, due to the nature of this process, only 93%-98% theoretical density can be achieved, thus further mechanical processing is needed to obtain 100% dense material.

The resultant microscopic structure resembles the starting green compact. The starting particle boundaries eventually turn into the final grain boundaries. 

As the voids between the powder particles are filled during the sintering process, the gases need to be expelled from the compact. These gases are; air trapped between powders and gasses from additives added during the mixing and/or compaction process. These gases are expelled through capillaries formed by the particle boundaries. If the compacts are heated too fast, these capillaries can be “pinched” off and if these gasses are not expelled, the part will have defects such as warpage, porosity, or even holes.

A typical industrial sintering process is done on a traveling grate furnace with a 2 stages of heating. The green bodies are placed on a conveyor which travels into the furnace which has a positive pressure protective atmosphere blown onto the conveyor belt. The parts travel into the first temperature zone to vaporize and wax and degas. The second temperature zone is to do the actual sintering of the material. After the appropriate sinter time, the parts travel through a cooling zone to allow the parts to be handled, or to lock properties for continued processing. Degas and sinter times vary based on material.

======Finishing======

=====Machining=====

====Welding====

===Materials Optimisation===
Heat Treatment:It is defined as combination of heating and cooling cycles given to a particular material of interest to achieve desired properties.

====Surface Engineering====

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Materials Characterization==
An important aspect of materials science is the characterization of the materials that we use or study in order to learn more about them. Today, there is a vast array of scientific techniques available to the materials scientist that enables this characterization. These techniques will be introduced and explained in this section.
===Microscopy===
Microscopy is a technique that, combined with other scientific techniques and chemical processes, allows the determination of both the composition and the structure of a material.
====Optical Microscopy====
Optical microscopes are formed of lenses that magnify and focus light. This light may have been transmitted through a material or reflected from a material's surface and can be used to ascertain a great deal of information about that material under evaluation. This can include whether the material is dense or contains porosity, what color the material is, whether the material is composed of a single phase or contains multiple phases etc. A common practice performed in conjunction with optical microscopy is that of targeted and controlled chemical attack of the material using one of many chemical reagents available. For metallic materials, this technique combined with optical microscopy is know as optical metallography. The basis of this combined technique is that regions of different composition within a material as well as entirely different materials are affected differently when exposed to certain chemicals. These chemical effects are cataloged in various works and through an understanding of these effects and a systematic experimental process they can be used to determine material composition and structure.
==Materials Characterisation==
An important aspect of materials science is the characterisation of the materials that we use or study in order to learn more about them. Today, there is a vast array of scientific techniques available to the materials scientist that enables this characterisation. These techniques will be introduced and explained in this section.
===Macroscopic Observation===
The first step in any characterisation of a material or an object made of a material is often a macroscopic observation. This is simply looking at the material with the naked eye. This simple process can yield a large amount of information about the material such as the colour of the material, its lustre (does it display a metallic lustre), its shape (whether it displays a regular, crystalline form), its composition (is it made up of different phases), its structural features (does it contain porosity) etc. Often, this investigation yields clues as to what other tests could be performed to fully identify the material or to solve a problem that has been experienced in use.

===Microscopic Observation===
Microscopy is a technique that, combined with other scientific techniques and chemical processes, allows the determination of both the composition and the structure of a material. It is essentially the process of viewing the structure on a much finer scale than is possible with the naked eye and is necessary because many of the properties of materials are dependent on extremely fine features and defects that are only possible to observe using one of the following techniques in this field.
====Optical Microscopy====
Optical microscopes are formed of lenses that magnify and focus light. This light may have been transmitted through a material or reflected from a material's surface and can be used to ascertain a great deal of information about that material under evaluation. This can include whether the material is dense or contains porosity, what colour the material is.

A common practice performed in conjunction with optical microscopy is that of targeted and controlled chemical attack of the material using one of many chemical reagents available. For metallic materials, this technique combined with optical microscopy is know as optical metallography. The basis of this combined technique is that regions of different composition within a material as well as entirely different materials are affected differently when exposed to certain chemicals. These chemical effects are catalogued in various works (for example the ASM Metals Handbook or Metallographic Etching by G. Petzow) and through an understanding of these effects and a systematic experimental process they can be used to determine material composition and structure.

There are several limitations to the usefulness of optical microscopy. The first is that the maximum resolving power is limited by diffraction effects to approximately 0.2 micrometres at a magnification of around 1500X). Many of the defects and structural features important in determining material properties, and therefore of interest to materials scientists, are of atomic scale. (for , the diameter of a helium atom is approximately 100 picometers) The second major limitation in optical microscopy is limited depth of field. This limitation means that surfaces with features at different heights - such as the rough surfaces of a fractured specimen for example - cannot be seen in sharp focus at the same time. This means that flat or polished surfaces are preferred for this technique. Furthermore, the chemical techniques required for identifying different phases within a structure are destructive. Thus, if a only a small amount of a certain portion of the sample is present then this may be destroyed by the process by the etching technique.

====Hardness====
Hardness is defined as the resistance of a material to penetration by an indentor.
The Mohs scale of hardness has ten level and diamond is the material with the highest level of hardness ever known.
There are several '''methods''' used to determine material's hardness, such as: '''Brinell''', '''Rockwell''', '''Vickers''' and '''Poldy'''.

=====Hardness Brinell (HB)=====
Is the method used for raw metallic materials. It uses a spherical ball indentor in order to stamp a print in the material. An external force transmitted through the indentor over the surface of the material determines the material's penetration.

=====Hardness Rockwell (HRB/HRC)=====
Is the method used for heat treated metallic materials. It has two variants regarding the indenter shape (ball or cone).

=====Hardness Vickers (HV)=====
Is a method used for the determination of hardness of special metallic materials, such as high alloyed materials, characterized by a very high degree of hardness.

====Non destructive testing (NDT)====
Some of the NDT methods available are: '''ultrasonic method''', '''radiation penetration method'''.

====Creep====
Creep is defined as time-dependent strain under stress that is lower than the yield point.

Creep will be significant if T&gt;=Tm

There are 3 creep regimes:
#primary -creep rate decreases towards a constant value
#secondary(steady state) -creep rate keeps constant; most important for design
#tertiary -creep rate increases until rupture, appears under tensile loading only

Steady state creep rate:

rate= Aσ^n exp(-Q/kT)

A=statistical entropy factor of the system,

Q=activation energy, obtained as slope of In(rate) vs 1/T plot,

k=Boltzmann constant,

T=temperature,

σ=stress,

n=creep exponent, obtained as slope of In(rate) vs Inσ plot,

if n≈1 at low stress, low stress regime is called linear creep regime;
if 3&lt;n&lt;8 at high stress, high stress regime is called power creep law regime.

if T&gt;0.5Tm, Q≈QSD(activation energy for self-diffusion)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Ceramics==
The word ceramic is derived from the Greek word. The term covers inorganic non-metallic materials whose formation is due to the action of heat. Up until the 1950s or so, the most important of these were the traditional clays, made into pottery, bricks, tiles and are like, along with cements and glass. The traditional crafts are described in the article on pottery. A composite material of ceramic and metal is known as cermet. The word ceramic can be an adjective, and can also be used as a noun to refer to a ceramic material, or a product of ceramic manufacture. Ceramics is a singular noun referring to the art of making things out of ceramic materials.

Many ceramic materials are hard, porous and brittle. The study and development of ceramics includes methods to mitigate problems associated with these characteristics, and to accentuate the strengths of the materials as well as to investigate novel applications.

There are a number of ceramics that are semiconductors. Most of these are transition metal oxides that are II-VI semiconductors, such as zinc oxide.

While there is talk of making blue LEDs from zinc oxide, ceramicists are most interested in the electrical properties that show grain boundary effects.

One of the most widely used of these is the varistor. These are devices that exhibit the property that resistance drops sharply at a certain threshold voltage. Once the voltage across the device reaches the threshold, there is a breakdown of the electrical structure in the vicinity of the grain boundaries, which results in its electrical resistance dropping from several megohms down to a few hundred ohms. The major advantage of these is that they can dissipate a lot of energy, and they self reset — after the voltage across the device drops below the threshold, its resistance returns to being high.

This makes them ideal for surge-protection applications. As there is control over the threshold voltage and energy tolerance, they find use in all sorts of applications. The best demonstration of their ability can be found in electrical substations, where they are employed to protect the infrastructure from lightning strikes. They have rapid response, are low maintenance, and do not appreciably degrade from use, making them virtually ideal devices for this application.

Semiconducting ceramics are also employed as gas sensors. When various gases are passed over a polycrystalline ceramic, its electrical resistance changes. With tuning to the possible gas mixtures, very inexpensive devices can be produced.

Ceramic materials are usually ionic or covalently-bonded materials, and can be crystalline or amorphous. A material held together by either type of bond will tend to fracture before any plastic deformation takes place, which results in poor toughness in these materials. Additionally, because these materials tend to be porous, the pores and other microscopic imperfections act as stress concentrators, decreasing the toughness further, and reducing the tensile strength. These combine to give catastrophic failures, as opposed to the normally much more gentle failure modes of metals.

These materials do show plastic deformation. However, due to the rigid structure of the crystalline materials, there are very few available slip systems for dislocations to move, and so they deform very slowly. With the non-crystalline (glassy) materials, viscous flow is the dominant source of plastic deformation, and is also very slow. It is therefore neglected in many applications of ceramic materials.

Under some conditions, such as extremely low temperature, some ceramics exhibit superconductivity. The exact reason for this is not known, but there are two major families of superconducting ceramics.

Piezoelectricity, a link between electrical and mechanical response, is exhibited by a large number of ceramic materials, including the quartz used to measure time in watches and other electronics. Such devices use both properties of piezoelectrics, using electricity to produce a mechanical motion (powering the device) and then using this mechanical motion to produce electricity (generating a signal). The unit of time measured is the natural interval required for electricity to be converted into mechanical energy and back again.

The piezoelectric effect is generally stronger in materials that also exhibit pyroelectricity, and all pyroelectric materials are also piezoelectric. These materials can be used to inter convert between thermal, mechanical, and/or electrical energy; for instance, after synthesis in a furnace, a pyroelectric crystal allowed to cool under no applied stress generally builds up a static charge of thousands of volts. Such materials are used in motion sensors, where the tiny rise in temperature from a warm body entering the room is enough to produce a measurable voltage in the crystal.

In turn, pyroelectricity is seen most strongly in materials which also display the ferroelectric effect, in which a stable electric dipole can be oriented or reversed by applying an electrostatic field. Pyroelectricity is also a necessary consequence of ferroelectricity. This can be used to store information in ferroelectric capacitors, elements of ferroelectric RAM.

The most common such materials are lead zirconate titanate and barium titanate. Aside from the uses mentioned above, their strong piezoelectric response is exploited in the design of high-frequency loudspeakers, transducers for sonar, and actuators for atomic force and scanning tunneling microscopes.

Increases in temperature can cause grain boundaries to suddenly become insulating in some semiconducting ceramic materials, mostly mixtures of heavy metal titanates. The critical transition temperature can be adjusted over a wide range by variations in chemistry. In such materials, current will pass through the material until joule heating brings it to the transition temperature, at which point the circuit will be broken and current flow will cease. Such ceramics are used as self-controlled heating elements in, for example, the rear-window defrost circuits of automobiles.

At the transition temperature, the material's dielectric response becomes theoretically infinite. While a lack of temperature control would rule out any practical use of the material near its critical temperature, the dielectric effect remains exceptionally strong even at much higher temperatures. Titanates with critical temperatures far below room temperature have become synonymous with &quot;ceramic&quot; in the context of ceramic capacitors for just this reason.

Non-crystalline ceramics: Non-crystalline ceramics, being glasses, tend to be formed from melts. The glass is shaped when either fully molten, by casting, or when in a state of toffee-like viscosity, by methods such as blowing to a mold. If later heat-treatments cause this class to become partly crystalline, the resulting material is known as a glass-ceramic.

Crystalline ceramics: Crystalline ceramic materials are not amenable to a great range of processing. Methods for dealing with them tend to fall into one of two categories - either make the ceramic in the desired shape, by reaction in situ, or by &quot;forming&quot; powders into the desired shape, and then sintering to form a solid body. Ceramic forming techniques include shaping by hand (sometimes including a rotation process called &quot;throwing&quot;), slip casting, tape casting (used for making very thin ceramic capacitors, etc.), injection molding, dry pressing, and other variations. (See also Ceramic forming techniques. Details of these processes are described in the two books listed below.) A few methods use a hybrid between the two approaches.

In the early 1980s, Toyota researched production of an adiabatic ceramic engine which can run at a temperature of over 6000 °F (3300 °C). Ceramic engines do not require a cooling system and hence allow a major weight reduction and therefore greater fuel efficiency. Fuel efficiency of the engine is also higher at high temperature, as shown by Carnot's theorem. In a conventional metallic engine, much of the energy released from the fuel must be dissipated as waste heat in order to prevent a meltdown of the metallic parts.

Despite all of these desirable properties, such engines are not in production because the manufacturing of ceramic parts in the requisite precision and durability is difficult. Imperfection in the ceramic leads to cracks, which can lead to potentially dangerous equipment failure. Such engines are possible in laboratory settings, but mass-production is unfeasible with current technology.

Work is being done in developing ceramic parts for gas turbine engines. Currently, even blades made of advanced metal alloys used in the engines' hot section require cooling and careful limiting of operating temperatures. Turbine engines made with ceramics could operate more efficiently, giving aircraft greater range and payload for a set amount of fuel.

Ceramics are used in the manufacture of knives. The blade of the ceramic knife will stay sharp for much longer than that of a steel knife, although it is more brittle and can be snapped by dropping it on a hard surface.

Since the late 1990s, highly specialized ceramics, usually based on boron carbide, formed into plates and lined with Spectra, have been used in ballistic armored vests to repel large-caliber rifle fire. Such plates are known commonly as small-arms protective inserts (SAPI). Very similar technology is used to protect cockpits of some military airplanes, because of the low weight of the material.

Recently, there have been advances in ceramics which include bio-ceramics, such as dental implants and synthetic bones. Hydroxyapatite, the natural mineral component of bone, has been made synthetically from a number of biological and chemical sources and can be formed into ceramic materials. Orthopedic implants made from these materials bond readily to bone and other tissues in the body without rejection or inflammatory reactions. Because of this, they are of great interest for gene delivery and tissue engineering scaffolds. Most hydroxy apatite ceramics are very porous and lack mechanical strength and are used to coat metal orthopedic devices to aid in forming a bond to bone or as bone fillers. They are also used as fillers for orthopedic plastic screws to aid in reducing the inflammation and increase absorption of these plastic materials. Work is being done to make strong-fully dense nano crystalline hydroxapatite ceramic materials for orthopedic weight bearing devices, replacing foreign metal and plastic orthopedic materials with a synthetic natural bone mineral. Ultimately these ceramic materials may be used as bone replacements or with the incorporation of protein collagens, synthetic bones.

===Phase Diagrams===
Phase diagrams provide a graphical means of presenting the results of experimental studies of complex natural processes, such that at a given temperature and pressure for a specific system at equilibrium the phase or phases present can be determined.


SYSTEM - Any portion of the universe which is of interest and can be studied experimentally.

PHASE- any particular portion of a system, which is physically homogeneous, has a specific composition, and can be mechanically removed or separated from any other phase in the system.

* e.g. A system containing a mixture of ol and pl in equilibrium contains two phases - ol and pl. 

In petrology we generally deal with primary phases - any crystalline phase which can coexist with liquid, i.e. it formed/crystallized directly from the liquid.

EQUILIBRIUM - The condition of minimum energy for the system such that the state of a reaction will not change with time provided that pressure and temperature are kept constant.


In experimental petrology there are three practical criteria used to test for equilibrium.

1. Time - with time the system does not change its physical or chemical makeup.
2. Approach equilibrium from two directions, e.g., the melting point of Albite.
:* begin with a liquid of Ab composition (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O-Al&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;-6SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and cool until Ab crystallizes - T=1100°C
:* begin with the same mixture of solid Albite and heat it up until liquid forms - T=1120°C. Melting point of albite = 1110°C + 10°C.
3. Attainment of equilibrium by using different reactants and procedures. To determine the melting temperature of Albite
:* grind up a sample of pure albite
:* combine powdered oxides to give pure Ab composition 
: Use both to determine Ab melting point. 

One final term to be defined prior to examining phase diagrams.

COMPONENT - the smallest number of independent variable chemical constituents necessary to define any phase in the system.

* components may be oxides, elements or minerals, dependent on the system being examined. 

For example, experiments carried out in the H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O system, show that the phases which appear over a wide temperature and pressure range are ice, liquid water and water vapour. The composition of each phase is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and only one chemical parameter or component is required to describe the composition of each phase.
Systems which can be defined by a single component are called Unary Systems.
H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O System
In this system pressures from 0 to 15 kbars seven phases, each with the same composition - H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O have been recognized:

* Ice I
* Ice II
* Ice III
* Ice IV (actually does not exist)
* Ice V
* Water
* Steam 

SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; System
In the one component SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; system in the temperature range from 0 to 2,000°C and a pressure range from 0 to 30 kbars six phases of SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are recognized. At pressures &gt; 30 kbar a seventh phase, stishovite, exists.
The six phases of SiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are:

* coesite
* alpha quartz (Trigonal)
* beta quartz (hexagonal)
* tridymite
* cristobalite
* anhydrous melt

      <text xml:space="preserve">Metals are materials made of elements on the left hand side of the periodic tables 'stair step' border starting on the left of Boron and going down and right and finishing at polonium.  These elements can be mixed and combined with other elements (metals or non-metals) to create materials called alloys.  Alloys are just a mix of elements and materials to create a new material with favorable properties.

Metals can be generally identified by a set of few physical properties (these a very general and there are plenty of exceptions).  The main definition of a metal is an element that readily loses electrons and forms positive ions.  The general bulk properties that are used to simply identify metals is that they tend to be lustrous (shiny when not oxidised), they are malleable (so can be beaten into a shape and not break), they are ductile (they can be drawn out into a wire) and that they conduct electricity; this rises from the fact that they readily lose electrons so there is a free electron 'gas' where the electrons can move around and this means that a charge can flow when an electric field is placed across the metal.

The metal that has changed the way the whole world functions and takes up a huge majority of the industry even now after over a century of its discovery and use (in terms of its modern production and composition).  This metal is steel and is an alloy of mainly iron (Fe) and carbon (C) with many other constituent elements added depending on the type of steel wanted and the properties required.

Steel can be produced in a number of ways.  Traditional methods utilise integrated steel processes which use energy intensive blast furnaces (to produce iron) sand basic oxygen steelmaking (to convert iron to steel).  More modern methods use electric arc furnaces in which scrap steel is melted using electric currents and then formed into slabs or ingots for further processing.  When the steel slab or ingot has cooled, a variety of forming operations such as rolling or extrusion are used to form the metal into flat sheet for use in cars, fridges, filing cabinets or radiators, or into beams, and heavy plate for use in construction and ship building

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Liquid crystals ==
Liquid crystals are substances that exhibit a phase of matter that has properties between those of a conventional liquid, and those of a solid crystal. That means it can flow like an isotropic liquid but have the ordered structure like a solid. For instance, a liquid crystal (LC) may flow like a liquid, but have the molecules in the liquid arranged and/or oriented in a crystal-like way. There are many different types of LC phases, which can be distinguished based on their different optical properties (such as birefringence). When viewed under a microscope using a polarized light source, different liquid crystal phases will appear to have a distinct texture. Each &quot;patch&quot; in the texture corresponds to a domain where the LC molecules are oriented in a different direction. Within a domain, however, the molecules are well ordered. Liquid crystal materials may not always be in an LC phase (just as water is not always in the liquid phase: it may also be found in the solid or gas phase). Liquid crystals can be divided into thermotropic and lyotropic LCs. Thermotropic LCs exhibit a phase transition into the LC phase as temperature is changed, whereas lyotropic LCs exhibit phase transitions as a function of concentration of the mesogen in a solvent (typically water) as well as temperature.

Liquid crystals find wide use in liquid crystal displays, which rely on the optical properties of certain liquid crystalline molecules in the presence or absence of an electric field. In a typical device, a liquid crystal layer sits between two polarizers that are crossed (oriented at 90° to one another). The liquid crystal is chosen so that its relaxed phase is a twisted one. This twisted phase reorients light that has passed through the first polarizer, allowing it to be transmitted through the second polarizer and reflected back to the observer. The device thus appears clear. When an electric field is applied to the LC layer, all the mesogens align (and are no longer twisting). In this aligned state, the mesogens do not reorient light, so the light polarized at the first polarizer is absorbed at the second polarizer, and the entire device appears dark. In this way, the electric field can be used to make a pixel switch between clear or dark on command. Color LCD systems use the same technique, with color filters used to generate red, green, and blue pixels. Similar principles can be used to make other liquid crystal based optical devices.

Thermotropic chiral LCs whose pitch varies strongly with temperature can be used as crude thermometers, since the color of the material will change as the pitch is changed. Liquid crystal color transitions are used on many aquarium and pool thermometers. Other liquid crystal materials change color when stretched or stressed. Thus, liquid crystal sheets are often used in industry to look for hot spots, map heat flow, measure stress distribution patterns, and so on. Liquid crystal in fluid form is used to detect electrically generated hot spots for failure analysis in the semiconductor industry. Liquid crystal memory units with extensive capacity were used in Space Shuttle navigation equipment.

It is also worth noting that many common fluids are in fact liquid crystals. Soap, for instance, is a liquid crystal, and forms a variety of LC phases depending on its concentration in water.

Polymer is a group of substances that has large molecules consisting of at least five repeated chemical units bonded together with a same type of linkage, like beads on a string.Polymer usually contains more than five repeated units and some polymers contain hundreds or thousands of monomers in each of their polymer chains. Polymer materials can be natural or synthetic. Polymer material is a large group of materials whereby they can be further classified specifically into plastics, elastomers and composites!

==1. Polymer molecules - mers, chemistry, common polymers ==

=== 1a. Some Basic Terminology === 
Because polymers are so much larger than other molecules, they are often known as macromolecules.
 
A mer is a repeating unit that makes up a polymer. The term comes from the Greek word &quot;Meros&quot; meaning part. From this, the term polymer was created to mean many mers.
The term &quot;Monomer&quot; is sometimes used to refer to the component molecules a polymer is created (synthesized) from.

==2. Molecular Weight==
The formula for molecular weight of a polymer is

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Thermochromics==
Thermochromism is the ability of substance to change colour due to a change in temperature. A mood ring is an excellent example of this, but it has many other uses. Thermochromism is one of several types of chromism.

The two basic approaches are based on liquid crystals and leuco dyes. Liquid crystals are used in precision applications, as their responses can be engineered to accurate temperatures, but their color range is limited by their principle of operation. Leuco dyes allow wider range of colors to be used, but their response temperatures are more difficult to set with accuracy.

Some liquid crystals are capable of displaying different colors at different temperatures. This change is dependent on selective reflection of certain wavelengths by the crystallic structure of the material, as it changes between the low-temperature crystallic phase, through anisotropic chiral or twisted nematic phase, to the high-temperature isotropic liquid phase. Only the nematic mesophase has thermochromic properties; this restricts the effective temperature range of the material.

The twisted nematic phase has the molecules oriented in layers with regularly changing orientation, which gives them periodic spacing. The light passing the crystal undergoes Bragg diffraction on these layers, and the wavelength with the greatest constructive interference is reflected back, which is perceived as a spectral color. As the crystal undergoes changes in temperature, thermal expansion occurs, resulting in change of spacing between the layers, and therefore in the reflected wavelength. The color of the thermochromic liquid crystal can therefore continuously range from black through the spectral colors to black again, depending on the temperature.

Some such materials are cholesteryl nonanoate or cyanobiphenyls.

Liquid crystals used in dyes and inks often come microencapsulated, in the form of suspension.

Liquid crystals are used in applications where the color change has to be accurately defined. They find applications in thermometers for room, refrigerator, aquarium, and medical use, and in indicators of level of propane in tanks.

Liquid crystals are difficult to work with and require specialized printing equipment. The material itself is also typically more expensive than alternative technologies. High temperatures, ultraviolet radiation, some chemicals and/or solvents have a negative impact on their lifespan.

Thermochromic paint is a relatively recent development in the area of color-changing pigments. It involves the use of liquid crystal or leuco dye technology. After absorbing a certain amount of light or heat, the crystallic or molecular structure of the pigment reversibly changes in such a way that it absorbs and emits light at a different wavelength than at lower temperatures. Thermochromic paints are seen quite often as a coating on coffee mugs, whereby once hot coffee is poured into the mugs, the thermochromic paint absorbs the heat and becomes colored or transparent, therefore changing the appearance of the mug.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Crystallography==
Crystallography is the experimental science of determining the arrangement of atoms in solids. In older usage, it is the scientific study of crystals.

Before the development of X-ray diffraction crystallography (see below), the study of crystals was based on the geometry of the crystals. This involves measuring the angles of crystal faces relative to theoretical reference axes (crystallographic axes), and establishing the symmetry of the crystal in question. The former is carried out using a goniometer. The position in 3D space of each crystal face is plotted on a stereographic net, e.g. Wolff net or Lambert net. In fact, the pole to each face is plotted on the net. Each point is labelled with its Miller index. The final plot allows the symmetry of the crystal to be established.

Crystallographic methods now depend on the analysis of the diffraction patterns that emerge from a sample that is targeted by a beam of some type. The beam is not always electromagnetic radiation, even though X-rays are the most common choice. For some purposes electrons or neutrons are used, which is possible due to the wave properties of the particles. Crystallographers often explicitly state the type of illumination used when referring to a method, as with the terms X-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction and electron diffraction.

These three types of radiation interact with the specimen in different ways. X-rays interact with the spatial distribution of the valence electrons, while electrons are charged particles and therefore feel the total charge distribution of both the atomic nuclei and the surrounding electrons. Neutrons are scattered by the atomic nuclei through the strong nuclear forces, but in addition, the magnetic moment of neutrons is non-zero. They are therefore also scattered by magnetic fields. Because of these different forms of interaction, the three types of radiation are suitable for different crystallographic studies.

In several cases, an image of a microscopic object is generated by focusing the rays of the visible spectrum using a lens as in light microscopy. However, because the wavelength of visible light is long compared to atomic bond lengths and atoms themselves, it is necessary to use radiation with shorter wavelengths, such as X-rays. Employing shorter wavelengths implies abandoning microscopy and true imaging, however, because there exists no material from which a lens capable of focusing this type of radiation can be created. (That said, scientists have had some success focusing X-rays with microscopic Fresnel zone plates made from gold). Generally, in diffraction-based imaging, the only wavelengths used are those that are too short to be focused. This difficulty is the reason that crystals must be used.

Because of their highly ordered and repetitive structure, crystals are an ideal material for analyzing the structure of solids. To use X-ray diffraction as an example, a single X-ray photon diffracting off of one electron cloud will not generate a strong enough signal for the equipment to detect. However, many X-rays diffracting off many electron clouds in approximately the same relative position and orientation throughout the crystal will result in constructive interference and hence a detectable signal.

Crystallography is a tool that is often employed by materials scientists. In single crystals, the effects of the crystalline arrangement of atoms is often easy to see macroscopically, because the natural shapes of crystals reflect the atomic structure. In addition, physical properties are often controlled by crystalline defects. The understanding of crystal structures is an important prerequisite for understanding crystallographic defects. Mostly, materials do not occur in a syngle crystalline, but poly-crystalline form, such that the powder diffraction method plays a most important role in structural determination.

A number of other physical properties are linked to crystallography. For example, the minerals in clay form small, flat, platelike structures. Clay can be easily deformed because the platelike particles can slip along each other in the plane of the plates, yet remain strongly connected in the direction perpendicular to the plates. Such mechanisms can be studied by crystallographic texture measurements.

In another example, iron transforms from a body-centered cubic (bcc) structure to a face-centered cubic (fcc) structure called austenite when it is heated. The fcc structure is a close-packed structure, and the bcc structure is not, which explains why the volume of the iron decreases when this transformation occurs.

Crystallography is useful in phase identification: That is, when performing some kind of processing on a material, it is often desired to find out what compounds and what phases are present in the material. Each phase has a characteristic arrangement of atoms. Techniques like X-ray diffraction can be used to identify which patterns are present in the material, and thus which compounds are present (note: the determination of the &quot;phases&quot; within a material should not be confused with the more general problem of &quot;phase determination,&quot; which refers to the phase of waves as they diffract from planes within a crystal, and which is a necessary step in the interpretation of complicated diffraction patterns).

Crystallography covers the enumeration of the symmetry patterns which can be formed by atoms in a crystal and for this reason has a relation to group theory and geometry. See symmetry group.

X-ray crystallography is the primary method for determining the molecular conformations of biological macromolecules, particularly protein and nucleic acids such as DNA and RNA. In fact, the double-helical structure of DNA was deduced from crystallographic data. The first crystal structure of a macromolecule was solved in 1958 (Kendrew, J.C. et al. (1958) A three-dimensional model of the myoglobin molecule obtained by X-ray analysis (Nature 181, 662–666). The Protein Data Bank (PDB) is a freely accessible repository for the structures of proteins and other biological macromolecules. RasMol can be used to visualize biological molecular structures.

Electron crystallography has been used to determine some protein structures, most notably membrane proteins and viral capsids.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Biocompatible material==
In surgery, a biocompatible material (sometimes shortened to biomaterial) is a synthetic or natural material used to replace part of a living system or to function in intimate contact with living tissue. Biocompatible materials are intended to interface with biological systems to evaluate, treat, augment or replace any tissue, organ or function of the body. Biomaterials are usually non-viable, but may also be viable.

A biocompatible material is different from a biological material such as bone that is produced by a biological system. Artificial hips, vascular stents, artificial pacemakers, and catheters are all made from different biomaterials and comprise different medical devices.

Biomimetic materials are not made by living organisms but have compositions and properties similar to those made by living organisms. The calcium hydroxylapatite coating found on many artificial hips is used as a bone replacement that allows for easier attachment of the implant to the living bone.

Surface functionalization may provide a way to transform a bio-inert material into a biomimetic or even bio-active material by coupling of protein layers to the surface, or coating the surface with self-assembling peptide scaffolds to lend bioactivity and/or cell attachment 3-D matrix.

Different approaches to functionalization of biomaterials exist. Plasma processing has been successfully applied to chemically inert materials like polymers or silicon to graft various functional groups to the surface of the implant. Polyanhydrides are polymers successfully used as a drug delivery materials.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Rutherford backscattering ==
Rutherford backscattering (or RBS, for Rutherford Backscattering Spectrometry) is an analytical technique in materials science. It is named for Ernest Rutherford who in 1911 first explained Geiger and Marsden's experimental results for alpha particle scattering from a very thin gold foil in a backward direction by using the Coulomb electrostatic force between the positively charged nucleus and the positively charged alpha particle. Rutherford first correctly described the atom as a tiny positive nucleus surrounded by negatively charged electrons (essentially the Bohr atom) on the basis of this experiment. This contradicted J.J. Thomson's &quot;plum pudding model,&quot; the popularly accepted model of the atom at that time. Rutherford famously expressed his surprise at this experiment: &quot;It was as though one fired a bullet at a piece of paper, and it bounced back at you!&quot;

A high energy beam ( 2 to 4 MeV ) of low mass ions ( e.g. He++ ) is directed at a sample. A detector is placed such that particles which scatter from the sample at close to a 180 degree angle will be collected. The energy of these ions will depend on their incident energy and on the mass of the sample atom which they hit, because the amount of energy transferred to the sample atom in the collision depends on the ratio of masses between the ion and the sample atom. Thus, measuring the energy of scattered ions indicates the chemical composition of the sample.

Additionally, in the case that the incident ion doesn't hit any of the atoms near the surface of the sample, but instead hits an atom deeper in, the incident ion loses energy gradually as it passes through the solid, and again as it leaves the solid. This means that RBS can be used as a means to perform a depth profile of the composition of a sample. This is especially useful in analysis of thin-film materials. For example, films about half a micrometre in thickness can be profiled using a 2 MeV He beam, or films up to about 10 micrometres thick can be profiled with a 2 MeV H beam.

RBS is now a very widely used analytical technique, which has the great advantage that it is absolute, requiring no standards for quantification (since the probability of interaction - the cross-section - is given by the Coulomb potential). It is one of a family of techniques, collectively known as Ion beam analysis.

==Neutron diffraction  ==
Neutron diffraction is a crystallographic method for the determination of the atomic structure of a material. This is a form of elastic scattering where the neutrons exiting the experiment have more or less the same energy as the incident neutrons. The technique is similar to X-ray diffraction but the different type of radiation gives complementary information. A sample to be examined is placed in a beam of thermal or cold neutrons and the intensity pattern around the sample gives information of the structure of the material.

Neutrons are particles found in the atomic nucleus. In a nuclear reactor, neutrons can be set free when nuclei decay (fission, radioactivity). All quantum particles can exhibit wave phenomena we typically associate with light or sound. Diffraction is one of these phenomena; it occurs when waves encounter obstacles whose size is comparable with the wavelength. If the wavelength of a quantum particle is short enough, atoms or their nuclei can serve as diffraction obstacles. When neutrons from a reactor are slowed down and selected properly, their wavelength lies near one angstrom (0.1 nanometer), the typical separation between atoms in a solid material.

A neutron diffraction measurement requires a neutron source (e.g. a nuclear reactor or spallation source), a sample (the material to be studied), and a detector. At a research reactor other components such as crystal monochromators or filters may be needed to select the desired neutron wavelength. Some parts of the setup may also be movable. At a spallation source the time of flight technique is used to sort the energies of the incident neutrons, so no monochromator is needed, just a bunch of electronics. (Higher energy neutrons are faster - v. simple)

Neutrons interact with matter differently than x-rays. X-rays interact primarily with the electron cloud surrounding each atom. The contribution to the diffracted x-ray intensity is therefore larger for atoms with a large atomic number (Z) than it is for atoms with a small Z. On the other hand, neutrons interact directly with the nucleus of the atom, and the contribution to the diffracted intensity is different for each isotope; for example, regular hydrogen and deuterium contribute differently. It is also often the case that light (low Z) atoms contribute strongly to the diffracted intensity even in the presence of large Z atoms. Non-magnetic neutron diffraction is directly sensitive to the positions of the nuclei of the atoms. Although neutrons are uncharged, they carry a spin, and therefore interact with magnetic moments, including those arising from the electron cloud around an atom. Neutron diffraction can therefore reveal the microscopic magnetic structure of a material.

Neutron diffraction can be used to establish the structure of low atomic number materials like proteins and surfactants much more easily with lower flux than at a synchrotron radiation source. This is because some low atomic number materials have a higher cross section for neutron interaction than higher atomic weight materials.

The first neutron diffraction experiments were carried out in 1945 by Ernest O. Wollan using the Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge. He was joined shortly thereafter by Clifford Shull, and together they established the basic principles of the technique, and applied it successfully to many different materials, addressing problems like the structure of ice and the microscopic arrangements of magnetic moments in materials. For this achievement Shull was awarded one half of the 1994 Nobel Prize in Physics. Wollan had passed away in the 1990's. (The other half of the 1994 Nobel Prize for Physics went to Bert Brockhouse for development of the inelastic scattering technique at the Chalk River facility of AECL. This also involved the invention of the triple axis spectrometer). Brockhouse and Shull jointly take the somewhat dubious distinction of the longest gap between the work being done (1945) and the Nobel Prize being awarded (1994).

One unusual application of elastic neutron scattering/diffraction is that the lattice constant of metals can be very accurately measured. Together with an accurately aligned micropositioner a map of the lattice constant through the metal can be derived. This can easily be converted to the stress field experienced by the material. This has been used to analyse stresses in aerospace and automotive components to give just two examples.

==X-ray diffraction==
X-ray scattering techniques are a family of non-destructive analytical techniques which reveal information about the crystallographic structure, chemical composition, and physical properties of materials and thin films. These techniques are based on observing the scattered intensity of an x-ray beam hitting a sample as a function of incident and scattered angle, polarization, and wavelength or energy.

==Nuclear reaction analysis ==
Nuclear reaction analysis (NRA) is a nuclear method in materials science to obtain concentration vs. depth distributions for certain target chemical elements in a solid thin film.

If irradiated with select projectile nuclei at kinetic energies Ekin these target elements can undergo a nuclear reaction under resonance conditions for a sharply defined resonance energy. The reaction product is usually a nucleus in an excited state which immediately decays, emitting ionizing radiation.

To obtain depth information the initial kinetic energy of the projectile nucleus (which has to exceed the resonance energy) and its stopping power (energy loss per distance travelled) in the sample has to be known. To contribute to the nuclear reaction the projectile nuclei have to slow down in the sample to reach the resonance energy. Thus each initial kinetic energy corresponds to a depth in the sample where the reaction occurs (the higher the energy, the deeper the reaction).
==Analytical chemistry==
Analytical chemistry is the analysis of material samples to gain an understanding of their chemical composition, structure and function.

Analytical chemistry is a sub discipline of chemistry that has the broad mission of understanding the chemical nature of all matter. This differs from other sub disciplines of chemistry in that it is not intended to understand the physical basis for the observed chemistry as with physical chemistry and it is not intended to control or direct chemistry as is often the case in organic chemistry. Analytical chemistry generally does not attempt to use chemistry or understand its basis; however, these are common outgrowths of analytical chemistry research. Analytical chemistry has significant overlap with other branches of chemistry, especially those that are focused on a certain broad class of chemicals, such as organic chemistry, inorganic chemistry or biochemistry, as opposed to a particular way of understanding chemistry, such as theoretical chemistry. For example the field of bioanalytical chemistry is a growing area of analytical chemistry that addresses all analytical questions in biochemistry, (the chemistry of life). Analytical chemistry and experimental physical chemistry, however, have a unique relationship in that they are very unrelated in their mission but often share the most in common in the tools used in experiments.

Analytical chemistry is particularly concerned with the questions of &quot;what chemicals are present, what are their characteristics and in what quantities are they present?&quot; These questions are often involved in questions that are more dynamic such as what chemical reaction an enzyme catalyzes or how fast it does it, or even more dynamic such as what is the transition state of the reaction. Although analytical chemistry addresses these types of questions it stops after they are answered. The logical next steps of understanding what it means, how it fits into a larger system, how can this result be generalized into theory or how it can be used are not analytical chemistry. Since analytical chemistry is based on firm experimental evidence and limits itself to some fairly simple questions to the general public it is most closely associated with hard numbers such as how much lead is in drinking water.

Modern analytical chemistry is dominated by instrumental analysis. There are so many different types of instruments today that it can seem like a confusing array of acronyms rather than a unified field of study. Many analytical chemists focus on a single type of instrument. Academics tend to either focus on new applications and discoveries or on new methods of analysis. The discovery of a chemical present in blood that increases the risk of cancer would be a discovery that an analytical chemist might be involved in. An effort to develop a new method might involve the use of a tunable laser to increase the specificity and sensitivity of a spectrometric method. Many methods, once developed, are kept purposely static so that data can be compared over long periods of time. This is particularly true in industrial quality assurance (QA), forensic and environmental applications. Analytical chemistry plays an increasingly important role in the pharmaceutical industry where, aside from QA, it is used in discovery of new drug candidates and in clinical applications where understanding the interactions between the drug and the patient are critical.

Analytical methods rely on scrupulous attention to cleanliness, sample preparation, accuracy and precision.

Many practitioners will keep all their glassware in acid to prevent contamination, samples will be re-run many times over, and equipment will be washed in specially pure solvents.

A standard method for analysis of concentration involves the creation of a calibration curve.

If the concentration of element or compound in a sample is too high for the detection range of the technique, it can simply be diluted in a pure solvent. If the amount in the sample is below an instrument's range of measurement, the method of addition can be used. In this method a known quantity of the element or compound under study is added, and the difference between the concentration added, and the concentration observed is the amount actually in the sample.

Materials are physical substances used as inputs to production or manufacturing. Raw materials are first extracted or harvested from the earth and divided into a form that can be easily transported and stored, then processed to produce &quot;semi-finished materials&quot;. These can be input into a new cycle of production and &quot;finishing processes to create &quot;finished materials&quot;, ready for distribution and consumption.

An example of a raw material is cotton, which can be processed into thread, and then processed into cloth, a semi-finished material. Sewing and cutting the fabric turns it into a garment, which is a finished material. Steelmaking is another example—raw materials are extracted, refined and processed into steel, a semi-finished material. Steel is then used as an input in many other industries to make finished products.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Composite Materials==
Composite materials (or composites for short) are engineered materials made from two or more constituent materials with significantly different physical or chemical properties and which remain separate and distinct within the finished structure.

Composite materials (or composites for short) are engineering materials made from two or more constituent materials that remain separate and distinct on a macroscopic level while forming a single component. There are two categories of constituent materials: matrix and reinforcement. At least one portion of each type is required. The matrix material surrounds and supports the reinforcement materials by maintaining their relative positions. The reinforcements impart their special mechanical and physical properties to enhance the matrix properties. A synergism produces material properties unavailable from the individual constituent materials. Due to the wide variety of matrix and reinforcement materials available, the design potentials are incredible.

The most primitive composite materials comprised straw and mud in the form of bricks for building construction. The most advanced examples perform routinely on spacecraft in demanding environments. The most visible applications pave our roadways in the form of either steel and aggregate reinforced portland cement or asphalt concrete. Those composites closest to our personal hygiene form our shower stalls and bath tubs made of fiberglass. Solid surface, imitation granite and cultured marble sinks and countertops are widely used to enhance our living experiences.

There are the so-called natural composites like bone and wood. Both of these are constructed by the processes of nature and beyond the scope of this text. Engineered composite materials must be formed to shape. This involves strategically placing the reinforcements while manipulating the matrix properties to achieve a melding event at or near the beginning of the component life cycle. A variety of methods are used according to the end item design requirements. The principal factors impacting the methodology are the natures of the chosen matrix and reinforcement materials. Another important factor is the gross quantity of material to be produced. Large quantities can be used to justify high capital expenditures for rapid and automated manufacturing technology. Small production quantities are accommodated with lower capital expenditures but higher labor and tooling costs at a correspondingly slower rate.

Most commercially produced composites use a polymer matrix material often called a resin solution. There are many different polymers available depending upon the starting raw ingredients. There are several broad categories, each with numerous variations. The most common are known as polyester, vinyl ester, epoxy, phenolic, polyimide, polyamide, polypropylene, PEEK, and others. The reinforcement materials are often fibers but also commonly ground minerals.

The physical properties of composite materials are generally not isotropic in nature. For instance, the stiffness of a composite panel will often depend upon the directional orientation of the applied forces and/or moments. In contrast, an isotropic material has the same stiffness regardless of the directional orientation of the applied forces and/or moments. The relationship between forces/moments and strains/curvatures for an isotropic material can be described with the following material properties: Young's Modulus, the Shear Modulus and the Poisson's Ratio, in relatively simple mathematical relationships. For the anisotropic material, it requires the mathematics of a second order tensor and can require up to 21 material property constants. For the special case of orthogonal isotropy, there are three different material property constants for each of Young's Modulus, Shear Modulus and Poisson's Ratio for a total of 9 material property constants to describe the relationship between forces/moments and strains/curvatures.

Fiber Reinforced Composite Materials can be divided into two main categories normally referred to as short fiber reinforced materials and continuous fiber reinforced materials. Continuous reinforced materials will often constitute a layered or laminated structure.

Shocks, impact, loadings or repeated cyclic stresses can cause the laminate to separate at the interface between two layers, a condition known as delamination. Individual fibers can separate from the matrix e.g. fiber pull-out.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Concrete ==
Concrete is a construction material that consists of cement, commonly Portland cement, aggregate (generally gravel and sand) and water.

Concrete solidifies and hardens after mixing and placement due to a chemical process known as hydration. The water reacts with the cement, which bonds the other components together and eventually creating a stone-like material. It is used to make pavements, architectural structures, foundations, motorways/roads, overpasses, parking structures, brick/block walls and footings for gates, fences and poles.

The Assyrians and Babylonians used clay as cement in their concrete. The Egyptians used lime and gypsum cement. In the Roman Empire, concrete made from quicklime, pozzolanic ash / pozzolana and an aggregate made from pumice was very similar to modern Portland cement concrete. In 1756, the British engineer John Smeaton pioneered the use of Portland cement in concrete, using pebbles and powdered brick as aggregate. In modern times the use of recycled materials as concrete ingredients is gaining popularity because of increasingly stringent environmental legislation. The most conspicuous of these is fly ash, a by product of coal fired power plants. This has a significant impact by reducing the amount of quarrying and landfill space required.

Portland cement is the most common type of cement in general usage. It is a basic ingredient of concrete, mortar and plaster. English engineer Joseph Aspdin patented Portland cement in 1824, and it was named after the limestone cliffs on the Isle of Portland in England because its color is similar to the stone quarried there. It consists of a mixture of oxides of calcium, silicon and aluminium. Portland cement and similar materials are made by heating limestone (a source of calcium) with clay, and grinding this product (called clinker) with a source of sulfate (most commonly gypsum). When mixed with water, the resulting powder will become a hydrated solid over time.

High temperature applications, such as masonry ovens and the like, generally require the use of a refractory cement; concretes based on Portland cement can be damaged or destroyed by elevated temperatures, but refractory concretes are better able to withstand such conditions.

The water and cement paste hardens and develops strength over time. In order to ensure an economical and practical solution, both fine and coarse aggregates are utilised to make up the bulk of the concrete mixture. Sand, natural gravel and crushed stone are mainly used for this purpose. However, it is increasingly common for recycled aggregates (from construction, demolition and excavation waste) to be used as partial replacements of natural aggregates, whilst a number of manufactured aggregates, including air-cooled blast furnace slag and bottom ash are also permitted.

Decorative stones such as quartzite, small river stones or crushed glass are sometimes added to the surface of concrete for a decorative &quot;exposed aggregate&quot; finish, popular among landscape designers.

Workability (or consistence, as it is known in Europe) is the ability of a fresh (plastic) concrete mix to fill the form / mould properly with the desired work (vibration) and without reducing the concrete's quality. Workability depends on water content, chemical admixtures, aggregate (shape and size distribution), cementitious content and age (level of hydration). Raising the water content or adding chemical admixtures will increase concrete workability. Excessive water will lead to increased bleeding (surface water) and / or segregation of aggregates (when the cement and aggregates start to separate), with the resulting concrete having reduced quality. The use of an aggregate with an undesirable gradation can result in a very harsh mix design with a very low slump, which cannot be readily made more workable by addition of reasonable amounts of water.

Workability can be measured by the &quot;slump test&quot;, a simplistic measure of the plasticity of a fresh batch of concrete following the ASTM C 143 or EN 12350-2 test standards. Slump is normally measured by filling an &quot;Abrams cone&quot; with a sample from a fresh batch of concrete. The cone is placed with the wide end down onto a level, non-absorptive surface. When the cone is carefully lifted off, the enclosed material will slump a certain amount due to gravity. A relatively dry sample will slump very little, having a slump value of one or two inches (25 or 50 mm). A relatively wet concrete sample may slump as much as six or seven inches (150 to 175 mm).

Slump can be increased by adding chemical admixtures such as mid-range or high-range water reducing agents (super-plasticizers) without changing the water/cement ratio. It is bad practice to add extra water at the concrete mixer. High flow concrete, like self-consolidating concrete, is tested by other flow-measuring methods. One of these methods includes placing the cone on the narrow end and observing how the mix flows through the cone while it is gradually lifted.

Concrete has relatively high compressive strength, but significantly lower tensile strength (about 10% of the compressive strength). As a result, concrete always fails from tensile stresses — even when loaded in compression. The practical implication of this is that concrete elements subjected to tensile stresses must be reinforced. Concrete is most often constructed with the addition of steel or fiber reinforcement. The reinforcement can be by bars (rebar), mesh, or fibres, producing reinforced concrete. Concrete can also be prestressed (reducing tensile stress) using internal steel cables (tendons), allowing for beams or slabs with a longer span than is practical with reinforced concrete alone.

The ultimate strength of concrete is influenced by the water-cement ratio (w/c) [water-cementitious materials ratio (w/cm)], the design constituents, and the mixing, placement and curing methods employed. All things being equal, concrete with a lower water-cement (cementitious) ratio makes a stronger concrete than a higher ratio. The total quantity of cementitious materials (portland cement, slag cement, pozzolans) can affect strength, water demand, shrinkage, abrasion resistance and density. As concrete is a liquid which hydrates to a solid, plastic shrinkage cracks can occur soon after placement; but if the evaporation rate is high, they often can occur during finishing operations (for example in hot weather or a breezy day). Aggregate interlock and steel reinforcement in structural members often negates the effects of plastic shrinkage cracks, rendering them aesthetic in nature. Properly tooled control joints in slabs or saw cuts provide a plane of weakness so that cracks occur unseen inside the joint, making a nice aesthetic presentation. In very high strength concrete mixtures (greater than 10,000 psi), the strength of the aggregate can be a limiting factor to the ultimate compressive strength. In lean concretes (with a high water-cement ratio) the use of coarse aggregate with a round shape may reduce aggregate interlock.

Experimentation with various mix designs is generally done by specifying desired &quot;workability&quot; as defined by a given slump and a required 28 day compressive strength. The characteristics of the coarse and fine aggregates determine the water demand of the mix in order to achieve the desired workability. The 28 day compressive strength is obtained by determination of the correct amount of cementitious to achieve the required water-cement ratio. Only with very high strength concrete does the strength and shape of the coarse aggregate become critical in determining ultimate compressive strength.

The internal forces in certain shapes of structure, such as arches and vaults, are predominantly compressive forces, and therefore concrete is the preferred construction material for such structures.

Pervious concrete is sometimes specified by engineers and architects when porosity is required to allow some air movement or to facillitate the drainage and flow of water through structures. Pervious concrete is referred to as &quot;no fines&quot; concrete because it is manufactured by leaving out the sand or &quot;fine aggregate&quot;. A pervious concrete mixture contains little or no sand (fines), creating a substantial void content. Using sufficient paste to coat and bind the aggregate particles together creates a system of highly permeable, interconnected voids that drains quickly. Typically, between 15% and 25% voids are achieved in the hardened concrete, and flow rates for water through pervious concrete are typically around 480 in./hr (0.34 cm/s, which is 5 gal/ft²/ min or 200 L/m²/min), although they can be much higher. Both the low mortar content and high porosity also reduce strength compared to conventional concrete mixtures, but sufficient strength for many applications is readily achieved.

Pervious concrete pavement is a unique and effective means to address important environmental issues and support sustainable growth. By capturing rainwater and allowing it to seep into the ground, porous concrete is instrumental in recharging groundwater, reducing stormwater runoff, and meeting US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) stormwater regulations. The use of pervious concrete is among the Best Management Practices (BMPs) recommended by the EPA, and by other agencies and geotechnical engineers across the country, for the management of stormwater runoff on a regional and local basis. This pavement technology creates more efficient land use by eliminating the need for retention ponds, swales, and other stormwater management devices. In doing so, pervious concrete has the ability to lower overall project costs on a first-cost basis.

Engineers usually specify the required compressive strength of concrete, which is normally given as the 28 day compressive strength in megapascals (MPa) or pounds per square inch (psi). Twenty eight days is a long wait to determine if desired strengths are going to be obtained, so three-day and seven-day strengths can be useful to predict the ultimate 28-day compressive strength of the concrete. A 25% strength gain between 7 and 28 days is often observed with 100% OPC (ordinary Portland cement) mixtures, and up to 40% strength gain can be realized with the inclusion of pozzolans and supplementary cementitious materials (SCM's) such as fly ash and/or slag cement. As strength gain depends on the type of mixture, its constituents, the use of standard curing, proper testing and care of cylinders in transport, etc. it becomes imperative to equally rely on testing the fundamental properties of concrete in its fresh, plastic state.

Concrete is typically sampled while being placed, with testing protocols requiring that test samples be cured under laboratory conditions (standard cured). Additional samples may be field cured (non-standard) for the purpose of early 'stripping' strengths, that is, form removal, evaluation of curing, etc. but the standard cured cylinders comprise acceptance criteria. Concrete tests can measure the &quot;plastic&quot; (unhydrated) properties of concrete prior to, and during placement. As these properties affect the hardened compressive strength and durability of concrete (resistance to freeze-thaw) , the properties of slump (workability), temperature, density and age are monitored to ensure the production and placement of 'quality' concrete. Tests are performed per ASTM International or CSA (Canadian Standards Association) and European methods and practices. Technicians performing concrete tests MUST be certified. Structural design and material properties are often specified in accordance with ACI International code (www.concrete.org) under the &quot;prescription&quot; or &quot;performance&quot; purchasing options per ASTM C94 (www.astm.org).

Compressive strength tests are conducted using an instrumented hydraulic ram to compress a cylindrical or cubic sample to failure. Tensile strength tests are conducted either by three-point bending of a prismatic beam specimen or by compression along the sides of a cylindrical specimen.

When structures made of concrete are to be demolished, concrete recycling is a common method of disposing of the rubble. Concrete debris was once routinely shipped to landfills for disposal, but recycling has a number of benefits that have made it a more attractive option in this age of greater environmental awareness, more environmental laws, and the desire to keep construction costs down.

Pieces of concrete collected from demolition sites are put through a crushing machine, often along with asphalt, bricks, and rocks. Crushing facilities accept only uncontaminated concrete, which must be free of trash, wood, paper and other such materials. Metals such as rebar are accepted, since they can be removed with magnets and other sorting devices and melted down for recycling elsewhere. The remaining aggregate chunks are sorted by size. Larger chunks may go through the crusher again. Smaller pieces of concrete are used as gravel for new construction projects. Aggregate base gravel is laid down as the lowest layer in a road, with fresh concrete or asphalt placed over it. Crushed recycled concrete can sometimes be used as the dry aggregate for brand new concrete if it is free of contaminants, though the use of recycled concrete limits the strength, and is not allowed in many jurisdictions.

Recycling concrete provides environmental benefits, as recycling concrete saves landfill space and using recycled concrete as aggregate reduces the need for gravel mining.

Bacteria themselves do not have noticeable effect on concrete. However, anaerobic bacteria in eg. sewage tend to produce hydrogen sulfide, which is then oxidized by aerobic bacteria present in biofilm on the concrete surface above the water level to sulfuric acid which dissolves the carbonates in the cured cement and causes strength loss. Concrete floors laying on ground containing pyrite are also at risk. Using limestone as the aggregate makes the concrete more resistant to acids, and the sewage may be pretreated by ways increasing pH or oxidizing or precipitating the sulphides in order to inhibit the activity of sulphide utilizing bacteria.

Concrete exposed to sea water is susceptible to its corrosive effects. The effects are more pronounced above the tidal zone than where the concrete is permanently submerged. In the submerged zone, magnesium and hydrogen carbonate ions precipitate about 30 micrometers thick layer of brucite on which a slower deposition of calcium carbonate as aragonite occurs. These layers somewhat protect the concrete from other processes, which include attack by magnesium, chloride and sulfate ions and carbonation. Above the water surface, mechanical damage may occur by erosion by waves themselves or sand and gravel they carry, and by crystallization of salts from water soaking into the concrete pores and then drying up. Pozzolanic cements and cements using more than 60% of slag as aggregate are more resistant to sea water than pure portland cement.

When some aggregates containing dolomite are used, a dedolomitization reaction occurs where the magnesium carbonate compound reacts with hydroxyl ions and yields magnesium hydroxide and a carbonate ion. The resulting expansion may cause destruction of the material. Other reactions and recrystallizations, e.g. hydration of clay minerals in some aggregates, may lead to destructive expansion as well.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Semiconductors==
A semiconductor is a solid whose electrical conductivity can be controlled over a wide range, either permanently or dynamically. Semiconductors are tremendously important technologically and economically. Silicon is the most commercially important semiconductor, though dozens of others are important as well.

Semiconductor devices, electronic components made of semiconductor materials, are essential in modern electrical devices, from computers to cellular phones to digital audio players.

Semiconductors are very similar to insulators. The two categories of solids differ primarily in that insulators have larger band gaps — energies that electrons must acquire to be free to flow. In semiconductors at room temperature, just as in insulators, very few electrons gain enough thermal energy to leap the band gap, which is necessary for conduction. For this reason, pure semiconductors and insulators, in the absence of applied fields, have roughly similar electrical properties. The smaller bandgaps of semiconductors, however, allow for many other means besides temperature to control their electrical properties.

Semiconductors' intrinsic electrical properties are very often permanently modified by introducing impurities, in a process known as doping. Usually it is reasonable to approximate that each impurity atom adds one electron or one &quot;hole&quot; (a concept to be discussed later) that may flow freely. Upon the addition of a sufficiently large proportion of dopants, semiconductors conduct electricity nearly as well as metals. Depending on kind of the impurity, a region of semiconductor can have more electrons or holes, and then it is called N-type or P-type semiconductor, respectively. Junctions between regions of N- and P-type semiconductors have built-in electric fields, which cause electrons and holes to escape from them, and are critical to semiconductor device operation. Also, a density difference of impurities produces in the region small electric field which is used to accelerate non-equilibrium electrons or holes in it.

In addition to permanent modification through doping, the electrical properties of semiconductors are often dynamically modified by applying electric fields. The ability to control conductivity in small and well-defined regions of semiconductor material, both statically through doping and dynamically through the application of electric fields, has led to the development of a broad range of semiconductor devices, like transistors. Semiconductor devices with dynamically controlled conductivity are the building blocks of integrated circuits, like the microprocessor. These &quot;active&quot; semiconductor devices are combined with simpler passive components, such as semiconductor capacitors and resistors, to produce a variety of electronic devices.

In certain semiconductors, when electrons fall from the conduction band to the valence band (the energy levels above and below the band gap), they often emit light. This photoemission process underlies the light-emitting diode (LED) and the semiconductor laser, both of which are very important commercially. Conversely, semiconductor absorption of light in photodetectors excites electrons from the valence band to the conduction band, facilitating reception of fiber optic communications, and providing the basis for energy from solar cells.

Semiconductors may be elemental materials such as silicon and germanium, or compound semiconductors such as gallium arsenide and indium phosphide, or alloys such as silicon germanium or aluminium gallium arsenide.

Like other solids, the electrons in semiconductors can have energies only within certain bands between the energy of the ground state, corresponding to electrons tightly bound to the atomic nuclei of the material, and the free electron energy, which is the energy required for an electron to escape entirely from the material. The energy bands each correspond to a large number of discrete quantum states of the electrons, and most of the states with low energy are full, up to a particular band called the valence band. Semiconductors and insulators are distinguished from metals because the valence band in the former materials is very nearly full under normal conditions.

The ease with which electrons in a semiconductor can be excited from the valence band to the conduction band depends on the band gap between the bands, and it is the size of this energy bandgap that serves as an arbitrary dividing line (roughly 4 eV) between semiconductors and insulators.

The electrons must move between states to conduct electric current, and so due to the Pauli exclusion principle full bands do not contribute to the electrical conductivity. However, as the temperature of a semiconductor rises above absolute zero, the states of the electrons are increasingly randomized, or smeared out, and some electrons are likely to be found in states of the conduction band, which is the band immediately above the valence band. The current-carrying electrons in the conduction band are known as &quot;free electrons&quot;, although they are often simply called &quot;electrons&quot; if context allows this usage to be clear.

Electrons excited to the conduction band also leave behind electron holes, or unoccupied states in the valence band. Both the conduction band electrons and the valence band holes contribute to electrical conductivity. The holes themselves don't actually move, but a neighbouring electron can move to fill the hole, leaving a hole at the place it has just come from, and in this way the holes appear to move, and the holes behave as if they were actual positively charged particles.

One covalent bond between neighboring atoms in the solid is ten times stronger than the binding of the single electron to the atom, so freeing the electron does not imply to destroy the crystal structure.

The notion of holes, which was introduced for semiconductors, can also be applied to metals, where the Fermi level lies within the conduction band. With most metals the Hall effect reveals electrons to be the charge carriers, but some metals have a mostly filled conduction band, and the Hall effect reveals positive charge carriers, which are not the ion-cores, but holes. Contrast this to some conductors like solutions of salts, or plasma. In the case of a metal, only a small amount of energy is needed for the electrons to find other unoccupied states to move into, and hence for current to flow. Sometimes even in this case it may be said that a hole was left behind, to explain why the electron does not fall back to lower energies: It cannot find a hole. In the end in both materials electron-phonon scattering and defects are the dominant causes for resistance.

The energy distribution of the electrons determines which of the states are filled and which are empty. This distribution is described by Fermi-Dirac statistics. The distribution is characterized by the temperature of the electrons, and the Fermi energy or Fermi level. Under absolute zero conditions the Fermi energy can be thought of as the energy up to which available electron states are occupied. At higher temperatures, the Fermi energy is the energy at which the probability of a state being occupied has fallen to 0.5.

The dependence of the electron energy distribution on temperature also explains why the conductivity of a semiconductor has a strong temperature dependency, as a semiconductor operating at lower temperatures will have fewer available free electrons and holes able to do the work.

When ionizing radiation strikes a semiconductor, it may excite an electron out of its energy level and consequently leave a hole. This process is known as electron–hole pair generation. Electron-hole pairs are constantly generated from thermal energy as well, in the absence of any external energy source.

Electron-hole pairs are also apt to recombine. Conservation of energy demands that these recombination events, in which an electron loses an amount of energy larger than the band gap, be accompanied by the emission of thermal energy (in the form of phonons) or radiation (in the form of photons).

In the steady state, the generation and recombination of electron–hole pairs are in equipoise. The number of electron-hole pairs in the steady state at a given temperature is determined by quantum statistical mechanics. The precise quantum mechanical mechanisms of generation and recombination are governed by conservation of energy and conservation of momentum.

As probability that electrons and holes meet together is proportional to the product of their amounts, the product is in steady state nearly constant at a given temperature, providing that there is no significant electric field (which might &quot;flush&quot; carriers of both types, or move them from neighbour regions containing more of them to meet together) or externally driven pair generation. The product is a function of the temperature, as the probability of getting enough thermal energy to produce a pair increases with temperature, being approximately 1/exp(band gap / kT), where k is Boltzmann's constant and T is absolute temperature.

The probability of meeting is increased by carrier traps – impurities or dislocations which can trap an electron or hole and hold it until a pair is completed. Such carrier traps are sometimes purposely added to reduce the time needed to reach the steady state.

The property of semiconductors that makes them most useful for constructing electronic devices is that their conductivity may easily be modified by introducing impurities into their crystal lattice. The process of adding controlled impurities to a semiconductor is known as doping. The amount of impurity, or dopant, added to an intrinsic (pure) semiconductor varies its level of conductivity. Doped semiconductors are often referred to as extrinsic.

The materials chosen as suitable dopants depend on the atomic properties of both the dopant and the material to be doped. In general, dopants that produce the desired controlled changes are classified as either electron acceptors or donors. A donor atom that activates (that is, becomes incorporated into the crystal lattice) donates weakly-bound valence electrons to the material, creating excess negative charge carriers. These weakly-bound electrons can move about in the crystal lattice relatively freely and can facilitate conduction in the presence of an electric field. (The donor atoms introduce some states under, but very close to the conduction band edge. Electrons at these states can be easily excited to conduction band, becoming free electrons, at room temperature.) Conversely, an activated acceptor produces a hole. Semiconductors doped with donor impurities are called n-type, while those doped with acceptor impurities are known as p-type. The n and p type designations indicate which charge carrier acts as the material's majority carrier. The opposite carrier is called the minority carrier, which exists due to thermal excitation at a much lower concentration compared to the majority carrier.

For example, the pure semiconductor silicon has four valence electrons. In silicon, the most common dopants are IUPAC group 13 (commonly known as column III) and group 15 (commonly known as column V) elements. Group 13 elements all contain three valence electrons, causing them to function as acceptors when used to dope silicon. Group 15 elements have five valence electrons, which allows them to act as a donor. Therefore, a silicon crystal doped with boron creates a p-type semiconductor whereas one doped with phosphorus results in an n-type material.

Semiconductors with predictable, reliable electronic properties are necessary for mass production. The level of chemical purity needed is extremely high because the presence of impurities even in very small proportions can have large effects on the properties of the material. A high degree of crystalline perfection is also required, since faults in crystal structure (such as dislocations, twins, and stacking faults) interfere with the semiconducting properties of the material. Crystalline faults are a major cause of defective semiconductor devices. The larger the crystal, the more difficult it is to achieve the necessary perfection. Current mass production processes use crystal ingots between four and twelve inches (300 mm) in diameter which are grown as cylinders and sliced into wafers.

Because of the required level of chemical purity and the perfection of the crystal structure which are needed to make semiconductor devices, special methods have been developed to produce the initial semiconductor material. A technique for achieving high purity includes growing the crystal using the Czochralski process. An additional step that can be used to further increase purity is known as zone refining. In zone refining, part of a solid crystal is melted. The impurities tend to concentrate in the melted region, while the desired material recrystalizes leaving the solid material more pure and with fewer crystalline faults.

In manufacturing semiconductor devices involving heterojunctions between different semiconductor materials, the lattice constant, which is the length of the repeating element of the crystal structure, is important for determining the compatibility of materials.

Chapter 1, Performance Objective 401, Drill, Section 1, General. (A-CR-CCP-266/PT-001)

1. The History of Drill.

Military drill originally developed for moving infantry during battle. Troops might have to face to a different flank to meet a new attack; to form into a compact square to repel cavalry; or to extend into a two-man line to deliver maximum fire-power on the enemy. Troops had to perform these movements rapidly and efficiently if they wanted to stay alive. If troops practiced these movements beforehand on the parade square, they could perform them reasonably well in the stress, noise and confusion of the battlefield. This practice made the troops much more effective in the field. As a result, drill developed. In the process of teaching drill, however, it was seen that other benefits were gained. Drill was also an excellent way of developing physical coordination, teamwork, and team spirit in the soldiers.

2. The Need for Drill.

The need for drill as a part of actual warfare has long since disappeared. Drill's second value however, remains as important as ever, especially in a cadet squadron. There is no better way of developing sharpness and team spirit (esprit de corps) - both important elements of the cadet world.

3. Drill Can Be Fun.

Amazingly, drill can be FUN. At first, you may feel awkward or uncoordinated. Don't worry, these are common feelings for a cadet who is just beginning to learn drill. Gradually, as you get the hang of it, you will begin to feel a sense of satisfaction in getting it just right. As you work with the rest of your squad to accomplish something that can only be done as a team, you will begin to feel a sense of pride, in yourself and your squadron.

4.

Good drill, when it is closely supervised and when the highest precision is demanded, is an exercise in obedience and alertness. It sets the standard for the individual and the squadron, and builds a sense of confidence between the commander and the cadet.

5. Drill Movements. The various drill movements you will learn this chapter during your first year appear in this chapter.

This information is based on A-PD-201-000/PT-000, Canadian Forces Manual of Drill and Ceremonial. If drill interests you and you would like to learn more about it, there may be a copy of A-PD-201-000/PT-000 at your squadron.

6.

The information in this chapter is to be used as a reference only. Don't worry about reading it before you learn the drill in each section. If you have questions about your drill classes, be sure to ask your instructor. If you still have questions, or if you want to refresh you memory at home, you should turn to this chapter for help.

==Purpose?==

'''Who is this book for?'''  By the time a kid is able to read words like 'Rectangle' and 'Triangle', they already know what a rectangle and triangle are, so what is the point?  Meanwhile, where is the motivation for advanced terms like isosceles and scalene?  Unless you follow these up with exercises like 'spot the isosceles triangle' it's going to be forgotten almost as soon as it is first seen.  It's not like they are everyday words.


I see two ways to go with this book:
* Make this a book for '''early readers''', who already have some idea what a circle and rectangle are.  So a book with more new illustrations for it, have pages with find the rectangles, find the circles, match the word to the shape.
* '''Inspire kids around shapes''' by showing more about '''what you can do with them'''.  In other words, a more advanced book, but still wikijunior.  Show tessellations, drawn and in real life.  Show how you can fold-up flat shapes to make 3D shapes.  Show how a map is pasted onto a sphere.  Show how two shapes can be the same or different when one is a mirror reflection of the other.. and in 3D....  This takes a lot of new artwork.

:Good points, especially regarding what 2D shapes mean in terms of 3D ones. Regarding the vocab, unfortunately kids are expected to be familiar with certain words at certain stages of their development (at least in Britain). Having them hear the terms used early on should facilitate their later language acquisition. (Note that I don't know the origins of this book and have only very recently become aware of its existence.)--[[User:Trevj|Trevj]] ([[User talk:Trevj|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Trevj|contribs]]) 09:22, 27 April 2011 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">The autoconf tool is part of the GNU build system and is used to generate package configure scripts.

The autoconf tool works by performing macro expansions on its text input, replacing the macro calls with macro bodies to produce a shell script.

The autoconf tool uses the m4 general purpose macro language and can be extended using m4 macros.

East Indian Marathi is a dialect of Marathi, according to leading historians, it is very similar to Dynaneshwari. Earlier it was written in the Modi script.

      <text xml:space="preserve">[[File:Schematic_diagram_of_the_human_eye.svg|thumb|250px|Schematic diagram of the human eye.]]

The structure of the human eye owes itself completely to the task of focusing light onto the retina. All of the individual components through which light travels within the eye before reaching the retina are transparent, minimising dimming of the light. The cornea and lens help to converge light rays to focus onto the retina. This light causes chemical changes in the photosensitive cells of the retina, the products of which trigger nerve impulses which travel to the brain.

Light enters the eye from an external medium such as air or water, passes through the cornea, and into the first of two humours, the aqueous humour. Most of the light refraction occurs at the cornea which has a fixed curvature. The first humour is a clear mass which connects the cornea with the lens of the eye, helps maintain the convex shape of the cornea (necessary to the convergence of light at the lens) and provides the corneal endothelium with nutrients. The iris, between the lens and the first humour, is a coloured ring of muscle fibres. Light must first pass though the centre of the iris, the pupil. The size of the pupil is actively adjusted by the circular and radial muscles to maintain a relatively constant level of light entering the eye. Too much light being let in could damage the retina; too little light makes sight difficult. The lens, behind the iris, is a convex, springy disk which focuses light, through the second humour, onto the retina. 

[[File:Human eye cross-sectional view grayscale.png|thumb|200px|left|Diagram of a human eye. Note that not all eyes have the same anatomy as a human eye.]]

To clearly see an object far away, the circularly arranged ciliary muscles will pull on the lens, flattening it. Without muscles pulling on it, the lens will spring back into a thicker, more convex, form.
Humans gradually lose this flexibility with age, resulting in the inability to focus on nearby objects, which is known as presbyopia. There are other refraction errors arising from the shape of the cornea and lens, and from the length of the eyeball. These include myopia, hyperopia, and Astigmatism.

On the other side of the lens is the second humour, the vitreous humour, which is bounded on all sides: by the lens, ciliary body, suspensory ligaments and by the retina. It lets light through without refraction, helps maintain the shape of the eye and suspends the delicate lens.

[[File:Focus in an eye.svg|thumb|right|200px|Light from a single point of a distant object and light from a single point of a near object being brought to a focus.]]

Three layers, or tunics, form the wall of the eyeball. The outermost is the sclera which gives the eye most of its white colour. It consists of dense connective tissue filled with the protein collagen to both protect the inner components of the eye and maintain its shape. On the inner side of the sclera is the choroid, which contains blood vessels that supply the retinal cells with necessary oxygen and remove the waste products of respiration. Within the eye, only the sclera and ciliary muscles contain blood vessels. The choroid gives the inner eye a dark colour, which prevents disruptive reflections within the eye. The inner most layer of the eye is the retina, containing the photosensitive rod and cone cells, and neurons.

To maximise vision and light absorption, the retina is a relatively smooth (but curved) layer.  It does have two points at which it is different; the fovea and optic disc. The fovea is a dip in the retina directly opposite the lens, which is densely packed with cone cells. It is  largely responsible for color vision in humans, and enables high acuity, such as is necessary in reading.  The optic disc, sometimes referred to as the anatomical blind spot, is a point on the retina where the optic nerve pierces the retina to connect to the nerve cells on its inside. No photosensitive cells whatsoever exist at this point, it is thus &quot;blind&quot;.

In some animals, the retina contains a reflective layer (the tapetum lucidum) which increases the amount of light each photosensitive cell perceives, allowing the animal to see better under low light conditions.

      <text xml:space="preserve">An eye examination is a battery of tests performed by an ophthalmologist or optometrist assessing vision and ability to focus on and discern objects, as well as other tests and examinations pertaining to the eyes.
All people should have periodic and thorough eye examinations as part of routine care by the primary care physician, especially since many eye diseases are silent or asymptomatic.

Eye examinations may detect potentially treatable blinding eye diseases, ocular manifestations of systemic disease, or signs of tumours or other anomalies of the brain.

==Comprehensive eye examination==

==Setting==
Ideally, the eye examination consists of an external examination, followed by specific tests for visual acuity, pupil function, extraocular muscle motility, visual fields, intraocular pressure and ophthalmoscopy through a dilated pupil.

A minimal eye examination consists of tests for visual acuity, pupil function, and extraocular muscle motility, as well as direct ophthalmoscopy through an undilated pupil.

==Basic examination==
===External examination===
External examination of eyes consists of inspection of the eyelids, surrounding tissues and palpebral fissure.
Palpation of the orbital rim may also be desirable, depending on the presenting signs and symptoms.
The conjunctiva and sclera can be inspected by having the individual look up, and shining a light while retracting the upper or lower eyelid.
The cornea and iris may be similarly inspected.

===Visual acuity===
Visual acuity is the eye's ability to detect fine details and is the quantitative measure of the eye's ability to see an in-focus image at a certain distance.
The standard definition of normal visual acuity (20/20 or 6/6 vision) is the ability to resolve a spatial pattern separated by a visual angle of one minute of arc.
This is often measured with a Snellen chart.

===Pupil function===
An examination of pupilary function includes inspecting the pupils for equal size (1 mm or less of difference may be normal), regular shape, reactivity to light, and direct and consensual accommodation.
These steps can be easily remembered with the mnemonic ''PERRLA (D+C)'': '''P'''upils '''E'''qual and '''R'''egular; '''R'''eactive to '''L'''ight and '''A'''ccommodation ('''D'''irect and '''C'''onsensual).

A swinging-flashlight test may also be desirable if neurologic damage is suspected.
The swinging-flashlight test is the most useful clinical test available to a general physician for the assessment of optic nerve anomalies.
This test detects the afferent pupil defect, also referred to as the Marcus Gunn pupil.
In a normal reaction to the swinging-flashlight test, both pupils constrict when one is exposed to light.
As the light is being moved from one eye to another, both eyes begin to dilate, but constrict again when light has reached the other eye.

If there is an efferent defect in the left eye, the left pupil will remain dilated regardless of where the light is shining, while the right pupil will respond normally.
If there is an afferent defect in the left eye, both pupils will dilate when the light is shining on the left eye, but both will constrict when it is shining on the right eye.

If there is a unilateral small pupil with normal reactivity to light, it is unlikely that a neuropathology is present.
However, if accompanied by ptosis of the upper eyelid, this may indicate Horner's syndrome.

If there is a small, irregular pupil that constricts poorly to light, but normally to accommodation, this is an Argyll Robertson pupil, which is a sign of tertiary syphilis.

===Ocular motility===

Ocular motility should always be tested, especially when patients complain of double vision or physicians suspect neurologic disease.
First, the doctor should visually assess the eyes for deviations that could result from strabismus, extraocular muscle dysfunction, or oculomotor nerve dysfunction.
Saccades are assessed by having the patient move his or her eye quickly to a target at the far right, left, top and bottom.

Slow tracking is assessed by the 'follow my finger' test, in which the examiner's finger traces an imaginary &quot;H&quot;, which touches upon the six cardinal fields of gaze.
These test the inferior, superior, |lateral and medial rectus muscles of the eye, as well as the superior and inferior oblique muscles.

===Visual field (confrontation) testing===

Evaluation of the visual fields should never be omitted from the basic eye examination.
Testing the visual fields consists of confrontation field testing in which each eye is tested separately to assess the extent of the peripheral field.
To perform the test, the individual occludes one eye while fixated on the examiner's eye with the non-occluded eye.
The patient is then asked to count the number of fingers that are briefly flashed in each of the four quadrants.
This method is preferred to the ''wiggly finger test'' that was historically used because it represents a rapid and efficient way of answering the same question: is the peripheral visual field affected?

Common problems of the visual field include scotoma (area of reduced vision), hemianopia (half of visual field lost), homonymous quadrantanopia (involving ''both'' eyes) and bitemporal hemianopia.

===Intraocular pressure===
Intraocular pressure can be measured by any of a series of devices designed to measure the outflow (and resistance to outflow) of the aqueous humour from the eye.

===Ophthalmoscopy===
A red reflex can be seen when looking at a patient's pupil through a direct ophthalmoscope.  This part of the examination is done from a distance of about 50 cm.   The actual colour varies with the patient's complexion, but should be symmetrical between the two eyes.  An opacity may indicate a cataract.  

Ophthalmoscopy allows the physician to look directly at the retina and other tissue at the back of the eye. This is best done after the pupil has been dilated with eye drops.  A limited view can be obtained through an undilated pupil, in which case best results are obtained with the room darkened and the patient looking towards the far corner.  
 
The optic disc and retinal arteries and veins are the main focus of examination during ophthalmoscopy.  The optic disc should appear slightly oval, with a pink colour.

===Slit lamp===
Close inspection with a slit lamp is performed to detect eye diseases. A small vertical beam of light is run over the eye horizontally. It allows inspection of all the media, from cornea to vitreous, and ophthalmoscopy can also be performed through the slit lamp. The binocular slit-lamp examination provides stereoscopic magnified view of the eye structures in striking detail, enabling exact anatomical diagnoses to be made for a variety of eye conditions. Combined with special lenses like Goldmann 3-mirror lens, Gonioscopy single-mirror/ Zeiss 4-mirror lens for angle structures and +90D lens, +78D lens, +66D lens &amp; Hruby (-56D) lens, the examination of retinal structures is accomplished. 

Fluorescein staining before slit lamp examination may reveal corneal abrasions or herpes simplex infection.

===Conditions diagnosed during eye examinations===

*Amblyopia
*Diplopia
*Myopia
*Hyperopia also called Hypermetropia
*Presbyopia
*Strabismus
===Other tests that may be performed during eye examinations===
*Electrooculography
*Electroretinography

*Bates method
*Binocular vision
*Eyeglass prescription
*Orthoptics
*Stereopsis
*Vergence

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Laser surgery and incisional surgery===

Although the terms &quot;laser eye surgery&quot; and &quot;refractive surgery&quot; are commonly used as if they were interchangeable, this is not the case. Lasers may be used to treat nonrefractive conditions (e.g. to seal a retinal tear), while radial keratotomy is an example of refractive surgery without the use of a laser.

===Cataract surgery===

A cataract is an opacification or cloudiness of the eye's crystalline lens due to aging, disease, or trauma that typically prevents light from forming a clear image on the retina. If visual loss is significant, surgical removal of the lens may be warranted, with lost optical power usually replaced with a plastic intraocular lens (IOL). Due to the high prevalence of cataracts, cataract extraction is the most common eye surgery.&lt;ref&gt;Uhr, Barry W. ''History of ophthalmology at Baylor University Medical Center''. Proc (Bayl Univ Med Cent). 2003 October; 16(4): 435–438. PMID 16278761&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cataract surgery''' is the removal of the lens of the eye that has developed a cataract.  The natural lens is then replaced with an artificial intraocular lens.  It is one of the safest and most successful procedures in all of medicine.

The two main types of cataract extraction are intracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE) and extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE).

Extracapsular cataract extraction involves the removal of the lens while the elastic lens capsule is left partially intact to allow implantation of an intraocular lens&lt;ref name=&quot;ECCE&quot;/&gt;. There are two main types of extracapsular surgery: conventional ECCE and phacoemulsification. 
Conventional extracapsular cataract extraction involves manual expression of the lens through an incision made in the cornea or sclera. Although it requires a larger incision and the use of stitches, the conventional method is indicated for patients with very hard cataracts or lower counts of corneal endothelial cells. 
Phacoemulsification involves the use of a machine with an ultrasonic handpiece with a titanium or steel needle which vibrates at ultrasonic frequency under continuous irrigation to sculpt, chop and emulsify the cataract, thus making it easier to aspirate the fine particles. Irrigation-aspiration can then be performed with a bimanual system to clean out the cortical matter. Thereafter, a foldable Intraocular lens (IOL) made of Silicone or Acrylic materials of appropriate power is implanted using a holder/folder, or a proprietary insertion device provided along with the IOL. It is placed in the posterior chamber in-the-bag after cleaning out the cataract. Because a smaller incision is required, few or no stitches are needed and the patient's recovery time is usually shorter. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surgeryencyclopedia.com/Pa-St/Phacoemulsification-for-Cataracts.html Surgery Encyclopedia - Phacoemulsification for cataracts]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;ECCE&quot;/&gt;. 

Intracapsular cataract extraction (ICCE) involves the removal of the lens and the surrounding lens capsule in one piece. The lens is then replaced with an artificial plastic lens (an intraocular lens implant) of appropriate power which remains permanently in the eye. The procedure has a relatively high rate of complications due to the large incision required and pressure placed on the vitreous body, thus is rarely performed in countries where operating microscopes and high-technology equipment are readily available&lt;ref name=&quot;ECCE&quot;&gt;[http://www.surgeryencyclopedia.com/Ce-Fi/Extracapsular-Cataract-Extraction.html Surgery Encyclopedia - Extracapsular cataract extraction]&lt;/ref&gt;. Cryoextraction is a form of ICCE that freezes the lens with a cryogenic substance such as liquid nitrogen&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surgeryencyclopedia.com/Ce-Fi/Cryotherapy-for-Cataracts.html Surgery Encyclopedia - Cryotherapy for cataracts]&lt;/ref&gt;. Although it is now used primarily for the removal of subluxated lenses, it was the favored form of cataract extraction from the late 1960s to the early 1980s&lt;ref&gt;Meadow, Norman B. '' [http://www.ophthalmologytimes.com/ophthalmologytimes/article/articleDetail.jsp?id=186750 Cryotherapy: A fall from grace, but not a crash]''. Ophthalmology Times. October, 15, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;.

A capsulotomy, rarely known as cystitomy, is a procedure to open a portion of the lens capsule. An anterior capsulotomy refers to the opening of the front portion of the lens capsule, whereas a posterior capsulotomy refers to the opening of the back portion of the lens capsule. In an extracapsular surgery, the surgeon performs an anterior capsulotomy, or capsulorhexis, to create an opening through which the lens nucleus can be removed and the intraocular lens implant inserted. An opacification or clouding of the posterior lens capsule frequently occurs in those who have had an extracapsular cataract extraction procedure, therefore, a laser posterior capsulotomy, or YAG laser capsulotomy, is used to clear the back implant surface &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surgeryencyclopedia.com/La-Pa/Laser-Posterior-Capsulotomy.html Surgery Encyclopedia - Laser posterior capsulotomy]&lt;/ref&gt;. (Whereas a capsulotomy is the creation of an opening in the lens capsule, a capsulectomy is the acutal removal of lens capsule tissue.)

Cataract operations are mostly performed under a local anaesthetic and the patient will be allowed to go home the same day. Complications after cataract surgery are uncommon. Many people (up to 50%) can develop a posterior capsular opacification (PCO) after initial cataract surgery, although the incidence is rapidly falling. PCO is a thickening and clouding of the lens capsule (which was left behind when the cataract was removed) and it can be easily corrected using a Nd-Yag laser to make holes in the capsule for the person to see through. Retinal detachment is an uncommon complication of cataract surgery.

Previously, polymethylmethacrylate was used as the lens material, since it was discovered by Sir Harold Ridley in UK. He observed that the Royal Airforce pilots sustained eye injuries with splinters of glass from fighter plane windshield (made of PMMA). However, the eyes did not show any foreign body reaction. Thus the material was inert and useful for implantation in the eye. Sir Harold Ridley was the first to design and implant Intraocular lenses, which were further refined by using lathe cutting machines. Advances in technology have brought about the use of silicone and acrylic both of which are soft foldable inert material. This allows the lens to be folded and inserted into the eye through a smaller incision. Polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) and Acrylic lenses can also be used with small incisions and are a better choice in people who have a history of uveitis, have diabetic retinopathy requiring vitrectomy with replacement by silicone oil or are at high risk of retinal detachment. Acrylic is not always an ideal choice due to its added expense. Latest advances include IOLs with square-edge design, non-glare edge design and yellow dye added to the IOL. 

An important factor to be considered in modern cataract surgery is the surgically induced astigmatism (SIA). This is the amount of change induced in the corneal curvature due to the surgical procedure. Since astigmatism has a significant bearing on the final visual acuity, it needs to be evaluated and managed by every cataract surgeon. The technically difficult process of evaluating astigmatism can be made simpler by using downloadable SIA Calculators. A series of such calculators may be downloaded from [http://www.insighteyeclinic.in/SIA_calculator.php SIA Calculators]

Couching was an early form of cataract surgery in which a small probe was inserted in the eye to push the lens down into the posterior chamber.

==History==
The earliest references to cataract surgery are found in Sanskrit manuscripts dating from the 5th century BC, which show that '''Susruta''' in India developed specialised instruments and performed the earliest eye surgery. In the Western world, bronze instruments that could have been used for cataract surgery, have been found in excavations in Babylonia, Greece and Egypt. The first references to cataract and its treatment in the West are found in 29 AD in De Medicinae, the work of the Latin encyclopedist Aulus Cornelius Celsus.

In 1748, Jacques Daviel started with modern cataract surgery, in which the cataract is actually extracted from the eye. In the 1940s Harold Ridley invented the intraocular lens which made efficient and comfortable visual rehabilitation possible after cataract surgery.

According to surveys of members of the American Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery, approximately 2.85 million cataracts procedures were performed in the United States during 2004 and 2.79 million in 2005[http://www.aao.org/news/academy_express/20060405.cfm].

===Glaucoma surgery===
Glaucoma is a group of diseases affecting the optic nerve that results in vision loss and is frequently characterized by raised intraocular pressure (IOP). There are many glaucoma surgeries, and variations or combinations of those surgeries, that facilitate the escape of excess aqueous humor from the eye to lower intraocular pressure, and a few that lower IOP by decreasing the production of aqueous.

====Procedures that facilitate outflow of aqueous humor====

'''''Laser trabeculoplasty'''''

A '''trabeculoplasty''' is a modification of the trabecular meshwork. '''Laser trabeculoplasty''' (LTP) is the application of a laser beam to burn areas of the trabecular meshwork, located near the base of the iris, to increase fluid outflow. LTP is used in the treatment of various open-angle glaucomas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.med.umich.edu/1libr/aha/aha_gfollow_oph.htm University of Michigan Health System - Surgery for Glaucoma]&lt;/ref&gt; The two types of laser trabeculoplasty are '''argon laser trabeculoplasty''' (ALT) and '''selective laser trabeculoplasty''' (SLT). As its name suggests, argon laser trabeculoplasty uses an argon laser to create tiny burns on the trabecular meshwork.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eyemdlink.com/EyeProcedure.asp?EyeProcedureID=47 EyeMDLink.com - Argon Laser Trabeculoplasty (ALT)]&lt;/ref&gt; Selective laser trabeculoplasty is newer technology that uses a YAG laser to target specific cells within the trabecular meshwork and create less thermal damage than ALT.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.revoptom.com/index.asp?ArticleType=SiteSpec&amp;page=osc/105058/lesson.htm Review of Optometry - SLT: The Laser Picks Up Where Medications Leave Off]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glaucoma.org/treating/a_new_type_of_g.html Glaucoma Research Foundation - SLT: A New Type of Glaucoma Surgery]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Iridotomy'''''

An '''iridotomy''' involves making puncture-like openings through the iris without the removal of iris tissue. Performed either with standard surgical instruments or a laser, it is typically used to decrease intraocular pressure in patients with angle-closure glaucoma. A '''laser peripheral iridotomy''' (LPI) is the application of a laser beam to selectively burn a hold through the iris near its base. LPI may be performed with either an argon laser or Nd:YAG laser.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surgeryencyclopedia.com/La-Pa/Laser-Iridotomy.html Surgery Encyclopedia - Laser iridotomy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eyemdlink.com/EyeProcedure.asp?EyeProcedureID=46 EyeMDLink.com - Laser Peripheral Iridotomy (PI)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Iridectomy'''''

An '''iridectomy''', also known as a '''corectomy''' or '''surgical iridectomy''', involves the removal of a portion of iris tissue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surgeryencyclopedia.com/Fi-La/Iridectomy.html Surgery Encyclopedia - Iridectomy]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Cline&quot;&gt;Cline D; Hofstetter HW; Griffin JR. ''Dictionary of Visual Science''. 4th ed. Butterworth-Heinemann, Boston 1997. ISBN 0-7506-9895-0&lt;/ref&gt; A basal iridectomy is the removal of iris tissue from the far periphery, near the iris root; a peripheral iridectomy is the removal of iris tissue at the periphery; and a sector iridectomy is the removal of a wedge-shaped section of iris that extends from the pupil margin to the iris root, leaving a keyhole-shaped pupil.

'''''Filtering procedures: penetrating vs. non-penetrating'''''

Filtering surgeries are the mainstay of surgical treatment to control intraocular pressure.&lt;ref&gt;Jacobi PC, Dietlein TS, Krieglstein GK. &quot;Technique of goniocurettage: a potential treatment for advanced chronic open angle glaucoma.&quot; ''Br J Ophthalmol''. 1997 Apr;81(4):302-7. PMID 9215060.&lt;/ref&gt; An '''anterior sclerotomy''' or '''sclerostomy''' is used to gain access to the inner layers of the eye [http://www.merckmedicus.com/pp/us/hcp/thcp_dorlands_content.jsp?pg=/ppdocs/us/common/dorlands/dorland/dmd_s_05.htm]
[http://bjo.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/81/4/302#B5] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;list_uids=10150851&amp;dopt=Abstract] in order to create a drainage channel from the anterior chamber to the external surface of the eye under the conjunctiva, allowing aqueous to seep into a bleb from which it is slowly absorbed. Filtering procedures are typically divided into either penetrating or non-penetrating types depending upon whether an intraoperative entry into the anterior chamber occurs [http://www.thedoctorwillseeyounow.com/articles/other/glauc_32/] [http://www.jdosmp.org/glaucoma_filtering_surgeries.html].

Penetrating filtering surgeries are further subdivided into guarded filtering procedures, also known as protected, subscleral, or partial thickness filtering procedures (in which the surgeon sutures a scleral flap over the sclerostomy site [http://www.revoptom.com/index.asp?ArticleType=SiteSpec&amp;page=body/articles/10_2001/ro259.htm]), and full thickness procedures [http://adam.about.com/reports/000025_8.htm]. '''Trabeculectomy''' is a guarded filtering procedure that removes of part of the trabecular meshwork&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surgeryencyclopedia.com/St-Wr/Trabeculectomy.html Surgery Encyclopedia - Trabeculectomy]&lt;/ref&gt;[http://www.eyemdlink.com/EyeProcedure.asp?EyeProcedureID=44]. Full thickness procedures include sclerectomy, posterior lip sclerectomy (in which the surgeon completely excises the sclera on the area of the sclerostomy [http://www.revoptom.com/index.asp?ArticleType=SiteSpec&amp;page=body/articles/10_2001/ro259.htm]), trephination, thermal sclerostomy (Scheie procedure), iridenclesis, and sclerostomy (including conventional sclerostomy and enzymatic sclerostomy) [http://www.surgeryencyclopedia.com/Pa-St/Sclerostomy.html] [http://www.jdosmp.org/glaucoma_filtering_surgeries.html].

Non-penetrating filtering surgeries do not penetrate or enter the eye's anterior chamber [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=12048520&amp;dopt=Abstract] [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=11880725&amp;query_hl=2]. There are two types of non-penetrating surgeris: Bleb-forming and viscocanalostomy  [http://www.optometry.co.uk/files/331aa73495c19582cb2afe54c0a85671_Gupta19805.pdf]. Bleb forming procedures include ab externo trabeculectomy and deep sclerectomy[http://www.optometry.co.uk/files/331aa73495c19582cb2afe54c0a85671_Gupta19805.pdf]. Ab externo trabeculectomy (AET) involves cutting from outside the eye inward to reach Schlemm's canal, the trabecular meshwork, and the anterior chamber. Also known as non-penetrating trabeculectomy (NPT), it is an ab externo (from the outside), major ocular procedure in which Schlemm's canal is surgically exposed by making a large and very deep scleral flap. The inner wall of Schlemm's canal is stripped off after surgically exposing the canal [http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.html&amp;r=69&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PG01&amp;s1=penis&amp;p=2&amp;OS=toilet&amp;RS=toilet]. Deep sclerectomy, also known as nonpenetrating deep sclerectomy (PDS) or nonpenetrating trabeculectomy is a filtering surgery where the internal wall of Schlemm's canal is excised, allowing subconjunctival filtration without actually entering the anterior chamber [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=pubmed&amp;dopt=Abstract&amp;list_uids=15005582&amp;query_hl=2]; it is commonly performed with the Aquaflow® collagen wick [http://www.revophth.com/index.asp?page=1_794.htm]. '''Viscocanalostomy''' is also an ab externo, major ocular procedure in which Schlemm's canal is surgically exposed by making a large and very deep scleral flap. In the VC procedure, Schlemm's canal is cannulated and viscoelastic substance injected (which dilates Schlemm's canal and the aqueous collector channels)[http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.html&amp;r=69&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PG01&amp;s1=penis&amp;p=2&amp;OS=toilet&amp;RS=toilet].

'''''Other surgical procedures'''''

'''Goniotomy''' and '''trabeculotomy''' are similar simple and directed techniques of microsurgical dissection with mechanical disruption of the trabecular meshwork [http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.html&amp;r=69&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PG01&amp;s1=penis&amp;p=2&amp;OS=toilet&amp;RS=toilet] [http://www.emedicine.com/oph/topic138.htm] [http://www.emedicine.com/oph/topic317.htm]. Gonotomy procedures include surgical goniotomy and laser goniotomy. A surgical goniotomy involves cutting the fibers of the trabecular meshwork to allow aqueous fluid to flow more freely from the eye [http://www.emedicinehealth.com/articles/38365-6.asp][http://www.glaucoma.org/treating/surgical_treatm.html].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surgeryencyclopedia.com/Fi-La/Goniotomy.html Surgery Encyclopedia - Goniotomy]&lt;/ref&gt; Laser goniotomy is also known as goniophotoablation and laser trabecular ablation [http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.html&amp;r=69&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PG01&amp;s1=penis&amp;p=2&amp;OS=toilet&amp;RS=toilet]. In many patients suffering from congenital glaucoma, the cornea is not clear enough to visualize the anterior chamber angle. Although an endoscopic goniotomy, which employs an endoscope to view the anterior chamber angle, may be performed [http://spiedl.aip.org/getabs/servlet/GetabsServlet?prog=normal&amp;id=PSISDG002126000001000259000001&amp;idtype=cvips&amp;gifs=yes], a trabeculotomy which accesses the angle from the exterior surface of the eye, thereby eliminating the need for a clear cornea, is usually preferred in these instances.  A specially designed probe is used to tear through the trabecular meshwork to open it and allow fluid flow [http://www.emedicinehealth.com/articles/38365-6.asp].[http://webeye.ophth.uiowa.edu/eyeforum/video/Trab_03.wmv Video]

'''Tube-shunt surgery''' or '''drainage implant surgery''' involves the placement of a tube to facilitate aqueous outflow from the anterior chamber&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.surgeryencyclopedia.com/St-Wr/Tube-Shunt-Surgery.html Surgery Encyclopedia - Tube-shunt surgery]&lt;/ref&gt; [http://www.eyemdlink.com/EyeProcedure.asp?EyeProcedureID=45][http://www.emedicinehealth.com/articles/38365-6.asp].

'''Goniocurretage''' is an &quot;ab interno&quot; (from the inside) procedure that used an instrument &quot;to scrape pathologically altered trabecular meshwork off the scleral sulcus&quot; [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?cmd=Retrieve&amp;db=PubMed&amp;list_uids=9215060&amp;dopt=Abstract][http://bjo.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/81/4/302#B5] [http://appft1.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO2&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsearch-adv.html&amp;r=69&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;d=PG01&amp;s1=penis&amp;p=2&amp;OS=toilet&amp;RS=toilet]. A surgical '''cyclodialysis''' is a rarely used procedure that aims to separate the ciliary body from the sclera to form a communication between the suprachoroidal space and the anterior chamber.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cline&quot;/&gt; A '''cyclogoniotomy''' is a surgical procedure for producing a cyclodialysis, in which the ciliary body is cut from its attachment at the scleral spur under gonioscopic control.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cline&quot;/&gt;

====Procedures that decrease production of aqueous humor====
Certain cells within the eye's ciliary body produce aqueous humor. A ciliary destructive or cyclodestructive procedure is one that aims to destroy those cells in order to reduce intraocular pressure [http://www.med.umich.edu/1libr/aha/aha_gfollow_oph.htm]. '''Cyclocryotherapy''', or cyclocryopexy, uses a freezing probe [http://www.wills-glaucoma.org/cyclotherapy.htm]. Cyclophotocoagulation, also known as transscleral cyclophotocoagulation, ciliary body ablation,[http://www.emedicinehealth.com/articles/38365-6.asp], cyclophotoablation [http://www.techniques-in-ophthalmology.com/pt/re/techophth/abstract.00145756-200312000-00007.htm;jsessionid=DmVgzeMPoLTnzNMAeXm4awgZWBAbDuLph511nCc1h8wF1uy4vC1l!-85436088!-949856145!9001!-1], and cyclophototherapy [http://www.emedicine.com/oph/topic317.htm], uses a laser&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eyemdlink.com/EyeProcedure.asp?EyeProcedureID=48 EyeMDLink.com - Cyclophotocoagulation]&lt;/ref&gt;{{ref|Trabeculectomy}}. '''Cyclodiathermy''' uses heat generated from a high frequency alternating electric current passed through the tissue,&lt;ref name=&quot;Cline&quot;/&gt; while '''cycloelectrolysis''' uses the chemical action caused by a low frequency direct current.&lt;ref name=&quot;Cline&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ophthalmologists are medical doctors who have completed medical school and embark on a training schedule that generally lasts four years after medical school in most countries. Many ophthalmologists also undergo additional specialized training in one of the many subspecialities. Ophthalmology was the first branch of medicine to offer board certification, now a standard practice among all specialties.

In the United States, four years of training after medical school are required, with the first year being an internship in surgery, internal medicine, pediatrics, or a general transition year. The scope of a physician's licensure is such that he or she need not be board certified in ophthalmology to practice as an ophthalmologist. The American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) promotes the use of the phrase &quot;Eye MD&quot; to distinguish ophthalmologists from optometrists who hold the degree OD (Doctor of Optometry).  (This, however, sometimes leads to confusion among patients, since a few ophthalmologists' primary medical degree is a D.O., or Doctor of Osteopathy, rather than an M.D. In both cases, the same residency and certification requirements must be fulfilled.) Completing the requirements of continuing medical education is mandatory for continuing licensure and re-certification. Professional bodies like AAO, ASCRS organise conferences and help members through CME programs to maintain certification, in addition to congress advocacy and peer support. 

In the '''United Kingdom''', there are four Colleges that grant post graduate degree. The Royal College of Ophthalmologists grants MRCOphth and FRCOphth (postgraduate exams), Royal college of Edinburgh grants MRCSEd, Royal college of Glasgow grants FRCS and Royal college of Ireland grants FRCSI. Work experience as specialist registrar and one of these degrees is required for specialisation in eye diseases. 

In '''Australia''' and '''New Zealand''', the FRACO/FRANZCO is the equivalent postgraduate specialist qualification. They do not generally accept outsiders with equivalent qualifications and require repeat training on case by case basis, with possibility of certification for doctors with numerous international publications, desirous of joining academic institutions in Australia. 

In '''India''', after completing MBBS degree, post-graduation in the form of a Junior Residency at a Medical College, Hospital or Institution under the supervision of experienced faculty leading to degree of Doctor of Medicine (M.D.) or Master of Surgery (M.S.), or Diplomate of National Board (D.N.B.) degree, or a diploma course leading to (Diploma in Ophthalmic Medicine and Surgery (D.O.M.S.) in Ophthalmology is necessary before one can expertly deal with various problems of the eye. Further work experience in form of fellowship, registrar or senior resident refines the skills of these eye surgeons. All India Ophthalmological Society [http://www.aios.org (AIOS)] and various state level Ophthalmological Societies hold regular conferences and actively promote continuing medical education.

In '''Pakistan''', there is a residency program leading into FCPS which is composed of two parts.

In '''Canada''', an Ophthalmology residency after medical school and FRCSC is the requirement for becoming a licenced Ophthalmologist. There are about 10 seats per year in whole of Canada for Ophthalmology residency. 

Formal specialty training programs in veterinary ophthalmology now exist in some countries.

==Sub-specialities==
Ophthalmology includes sub-specialities which deal either with certain diseases or diseases of certain parts of the eye. Some of them are: 
*Anterior segment surgery
*Cataract
*Cornea, ocular surface, and external disease
*Eye trauma
*Glaucoma
*Neuro-ophthalmology
*Ocular oncology
*Oculo-plastic surgery
*Ophthalmic pathology
*Pediatric ophthalmology/Strabismus (squint) 
*Refractive surgery
*Retina and Vitreous (sometimes labelled as a posterior segment specialization)
*Uveitis/Immunology
Ophthalmic investigations

      <text xml:space="preserve">'''Ophthalmology''' is the branch of medicine which deals with the diseases of the eye and their treatment. The word ''ophthalmology'' comes from the Greek roots ''ophthalmos'' meaning ''eye'' and ''logos'' meaning ''word''; ophthalmology literally means &quot;The science of eyes.&quot; As a discipline it applies to animal eyes also, since the differences from human practice are surprisingly minor and are related mainly to differences in anatomy or prevalence, not differences in disease processes.  By convention, the term '''ophthalmologist''' is more restricted and implies a medically trained specialist. Since ophthalmologists perform operations on eyes, they are generally categorized as surgeons.

== History of ophthalmology ==
The eye, including its structure and mechanism, has fascinated scientists and the public since ancient times. The discovery of the eye went through two cycles of limiting speculation and freeing observation, which led to a dark age between Galen and Vesalius.

Arab scientists are some of the earliest to have written about and drawn the anatomy of the eye&amp;mdash;the earliest known diagram being in Hunain ibn Is-hâq's ''Book of the Ten Treatises on the Eye''. Earlier manuscripts exist which refer to diagrams which are not known to have survived. Current knowledge of the Græco-Roman understanding of the eye is limited, as many manuscripts lacked diagrams. In fact, very few Græco-Roman diagrams of the eye are still in existence. Thus, it is not clear to which structures the texts refer, and what purpose they were thought to have.

The pre-Hippocratics largely based their anatomical conceptions of the eye on speculation, rather than empiricism. They recognised the sclera and transparent cornea running flushly as the outer coating of the eye, with an inner layer with pupil, and a fluid at the centre. It was believed, by Alcamaeon and others, that this fluid was the medium of vision and flowed from the eye to the brain via a tube. Aristotle advanced such ideas with empiricism. He dissected the eyes of animals, and discovering three layers (not two), found that the fluid was of a constant consistency with the lens forming (or congealing) after death, and the surrounding layers were seen to be juxtaposed. He, and his contemporaries, further put forth the existence of three tubes leading from the eye, not one. One tube from each eye met within the skull.

Alexandrian studies extensively contributed to knowledge of the eye. Aëtius tells us that Herophilus dedicated an entire study to the eye which no longer exists. In fact, no manuscripts from the region and time are known to have survived, leading us to rely on Celsius' account;which is seen as a confused account written by a man who did not know the subject matter. From Celsius it is known that the lens had been recognised, and they no longer saw a fluid flowing to the brain through some hollow tube, but likely a continuation of layers of tissue into the brain. Celsius failed to recognise the retina's role, and did not think it was the tissue that continued into the brain.

Rufus recognised a more modern eye, with conjunctiva, extending as a fourth epithelial layer over the eye. Rufus was the first to recognise a two chambered eye - with one chamber from cornea to lens (filled with water), the other from lens to retina (filled with an egg-white-like substance). Galen remedied some mistakes including the curvature of the cornea and lens, the nature of the optic nerve, and the existence of a posterior chamber. Though this model was roughly a correct but simplistic modern model of the eye, it contained errors. Yet it was not advanced upon again until after Vesalius. A ciliary body was then discovered and the sclera, retina, choroid and cornea were seen to meet at the same point. The two chambers were seen to hold the same fluid as well as the lens being attached to the choroid. Galen continued the notion of a central canal, though he dissected the optic nerve, and saw it was solid, He mistakenly counted seven optical muscles, one too many. He also knew of the tear ducts.

After Galen a period of speculation is again noted by Arab scientists - the lens modified Galen's model to place the lens in the middle of the eye, a notion which lasted until Versalius reversed the era of speculation. He, however, was not an ophthalmologist and taught that the eye was a more primitive notion than the notion of both Galen and the Arabian scientists - the cornea was not seen as being of greater curvature and the posterior side of the lens wasn't seen to be larger.

Understanding of the eye had been so slow to develop because for a long time the lens was perceived to be the seat of vision, not a tool of vision. This mistake was corrected when Fabricius and his successors correctly placed the lens and developed the modern notion of the structure of the eye. They removed the idea of Galen's seventh muscle (the ''retractor bulbi'') and reinstated the correct curvatures of the lens and cornea, as well as stating the ciliary body as a connective structure between the lens and the choroid.

The seventeenth and eighteenth century saw the use of hand-lenses (by Malpighi), microscopes (van Leeuwenhoek), preparations for fixing the eye for study (Ruysch) and later the freezing of the eye (Petit). This allowed for detailed study of the eye and an advanced model. Some mistakes persisted such as: why the pupil changed size (seen to be vessels of the iris filling with blood), the existence of the posterior chamber, and of course the nature of the retina. In 1722 Leeuwenhoek noted the existence of rods and cones though they were not properly discovered until Treviranus in 1834 by use of a microscope.

The establishment of the first dedicated ophthalmic hospital in 1805 - now called Moorfields Eye Hospital in London, England was a transforming event in modern ophthalmology.  Clinical developments at Moorfields and the founding of the Institute of Ophthalmology by Sir Stewart Duke-Elder established the site as the largest eye hospital in the world and a nexus for ophthalmic research.

== Мае заўвагі і прапановы ==
Дзень добры Спадарэ (Спадарка?) Cortisol. Я маю некалькі заўвагаў ды прапановаў. 
Па-першае я ня ведаю чаму зьмяняеце ўсе беларускія словы, каб ня мелі яны такаго самага значэньня як расейскія? (прыкладаў ня мушу падаваць) Гэта нармальна, гэтак здараецца.

Па-другае ня ўсё што гучыць падобна з расейскім словам гэта ўплыў расейскае мовы альбо &quot;вынаходства&quot; наркамоўкі.

Па-трэце я ня буду нішто выпраўляць, я спадзяваюся, што Сп. гэта зробіце.

Па-чацьвёртае выбачце, што адразу пішу, што нешта ё дрэнна...
Я маю прапанову, каб выкінуць усе русізмы якія дададзеныя як беларускія словы. Я раней нічага зь імі не рабіў, але гадаю, што трэба.
Што тычыцца тарашкевіцы, я зазвычай яе ўжываю, але тут лепей будзе пісаць наркамоўкаю (правакаторы, апрача [[False Friends of the Slavist/Map rossijskij|такіх]] артыкулаў дзе большыя розьніцы.) 

Маю надзею, што хораша зразумееце то, што хацеў сказаць. Я толькі хачу, каб усё было добра ды бяз хлусьняў.

== Naming convention maintenance ==

I changed [[:Template:naming convention]] today to add an mbox to it so it will stand out a little better.  Darklama reworded it and made it point to the current policy (thanks dl).  Then I changed it again so that any page including it be added to a new category I created: {{bad link|Category:Pages violating the naming policy}}.  I dunno which category that category should be added to, but I assume it should be added to one somewhere.  It would be nice if we could also make this category show up as a place where people could do maintenance tasks.  It might have been easier to just move the pages instead of adding this template to them, but you know the saying - ''&quot;Build a man a fire and you keep him warm for a day.  Set a man on fire and you keep him warm for life.&quot;'' Maybe we should add some instruction to the category page (how to rename, what links here, edit pages that link to it, remove template, etc). I don't have time ATM, and I'd also like input from others. --[[User:Jomegat|Jomegat]] ([[User talk:Jomegat|talk]]) 17:52, 23 September 2009 (UTC)

:I altered the template to point to the existing category for this sort of thing, [[:Category:Naming convention change]] (also referenced by [[Template:Cleanup-NC]]) and filed the template in [[:Category:Moving (rename) templates]]. -- [[User:Adrignola|Adrignola]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Adrignola|talk]] [[Special:Contributions/Adrignola|contribs]]&lt;/sup&gt; 19:03, 23 September 2009 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Sources of Heat==
Generally, Heats come from different sources
* ''Fire'' . 
: Chemical Reaction between two flammable or combustible materials 
* ''Celestial Body's Lights ''  
: Sun light produce Heat as a Light of hot temperature. Moon Light produce Heat as a Light of Cold Temperature
* ''Electric Light ''
: Conductors when conduct current will change their body temperatures and release Heat Energy and Light

== Heat ==
''Heat is caused by friction '' . When rubbing two objects the object bodies will change in temperatures which produces Heat . 

==Temperature==
''Temperature is a measured of Heat denoted as T measured in Degree '' . There are three system of temperature measurements namely Degree C , Degree F , Degree K

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=100% align=center
! System of Measuring Temperature !! Temperature of Freezing Point|| Temperature of Boiling Point   || Room Temperature
|-
|Degree C|| 0&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; || 100&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; || 25&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|Degree F || 32&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; || 212&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; || 77&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|Degree K  || 273.16 || 373.16 || 298.16
|-
|}

==Heat and Matters==
An object when absorbs heat exhibit the followings
# Change in object's Temperature
# Change object's state or form
# Release Heat's Energy in the surrounding as Light


When an object absorbs Heat's Energy, it will change its temperature and either expand or shrink itself. 
: For example, Electric wire shrink in the winter and expand in the summer .

==Thermodynamic Law of Heat Transfer==
===First Law of Thermodynamic===
''When an object absorbs heat's energy it will expand or shrink ''

: If an object has a Mass m at the normal temperature of T&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; . When this object absorbs heat's energy it will change its body temperature to T . Therefore the change in temperature of the object is T - T&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt; . If the object has an absorption constant of C then Heat Transfer can be calculated as
:: Q = m C (T - T&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;) = m C ΔT

===Second Law of Thermodynamic===
''Heat transfer from objects that has a high temperature to object that has a low temperture''
:: E = 0 When &lt;math&gt;T_1 = T_2&lt;/math&gt;
:: E &gt; 0 When &lt;math&gt;T_1 &gt; T_2&lt;/math&gt;
:: E &lt; 0 When &lt;math&gt;T_1 &lt; T_2&lt;/math&gt;

==Summary==
''Heat comes from differenct sources namely Fire , Light , Electric or from collision of two objects '' . ''Temperature is a measured of Heat denoted as T measured in Degree '' . 

There are three system of temperature measurements namely Degree C , Degree F , Degree K

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=100% align=center
! System of Measuring Temperature !! Temperature of || Temperature of   || Room Temperature
|-
|Degree C|| 0&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; || 100&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; || 25&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt;
|-
|Degree F ||   || || 
|-
|Degree K  ||  || || 
|-
|}

The laws govern Thermaldynamic of Heat transfer are listed in the table below

:{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; width=100% align=center
! Thermodynamic Law !! Heat Transfer !! Formula
|-
| Thermodynamic First Law  || ''Heat is absorbed by matter that either make matter to shrink or to expand '' || Q = m c (T - T&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;) 
|-
| Thermodynamic Second Law  ||  ''Heat transfer from High temperature to low temperature . From Hot to Cold'' || E = Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; - Q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; khi T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br&gt;E = Q&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; - Q&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; khi T&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; T&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;

== IRC collaboration ==

On 2010-12-18, some of us met on IRC to work out how to take this project forward.

Here are the running notes from the session.

=== People we should approach ===
* Ian

      <text xml:space="preserve">BarCamp and other derivative events are a fun and rewarding experience for everyone involved. Since you're reading this, you're probably thinking about setting up your own or helping out on one which is going ahead in the near future.

This guide is meant as a introduction to the BarCamp phenomenon and bring together tips, tricks and clever use of social engineering to make the event take place and be the best it could.

Why the need for this wikibook at all? Well BarCamp.org is a great place, but it's frankly too alive and good information is scattered across the site and buried underneath the next lot of BarCamps. There was also nowhere to collaboratively come to a decision about the best way to do certain things or what things should be avoided based on the experience of other BarCamps around the world.

The format is punchy one liners of advice opposed to long length discussions (which are best served on the discussion/talk pages).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==[http://barcamp.org/TheRulesOfBarCamp The Rules of BarCamp]==

These are the official rules, they are treat less like rules and more like strong pointers. Try and stay close to them but there's no need to stick to the letter.
 
'''COMMUNITY AND INFORMATION'''

BarCamp is an ad-hoc unconference born from the desire for people to share and learn in an open environment. It is an intense event with discussions, demos and interaction from attendees. Anyone with something to contribute or with the desire to learn is welcome and invited to join. When you come, be prepared to share with barcampers. When you leave, be prepared to share it with the world.

'''NO SPECTATORS, ONLY PARTICIPANTS'''

Attendees must give a demo, a session, or help with one, or otherwise volunteer / contribute in some way to support the event. All presentations are scheduled the day they happen. Prepare in advance, but come early to get a slot on the wall. The people present at the event will select the demos or presentations they want to see. Presenters are responsible for making sure that notes/slides/audio/video of their presentations are published on the web for the benefit of all and those who can’t be present.

'''The Rules of BarCamp'''

* 1st Rule: You do talk about BarCamp.
* 2nd Rule: You do blog about BarCamp.
* 3rd Rule: If you want to present, you must write your topic and name in a presentation slot.
* 4th Rule: Only three word intros.
* 5th Rule: As many presentations at a time as facilities allow for.
* 6th Rule: No pre-scheduled presentations, no tourists.
* 7th Rule: Presentations will go on as long as they have to or until they run into another presentation slot.
* 8th Rule: If this is your first time at BarCamp, you HAVE to present. (Ok, you don't really HAVE to, but try to find someone to present with, or at least ask questions and be an interactive participant.)

by Tantek Çelik as parodied from The Rules of Fight Club.
 
'''Additional guidelines'''

* Presentations promoting specific commercial products or companies are discouraged. Hold a DemoCamp session/slot for folks to demonstrate specific commercial products etc. rather than take up whole slots with company pitches.

      <text xml:space="preserve">* Do not try to do a sponsor speech or pitch. If you are hosting, everyone knows who you are.
* Consider charging a nominal fee such as $10 at sign up. In exchange you can give away the t-shirts to attendees. Many people signed up who did not show up. - ''Against the rules of BarCamp''

      <text xml:space="preserve">* Get your network administrator involved from the beginning to properly plan for the large number of heavy network users.
* If your network engineer is not going to be accessible during the event, make sure you or someone at the event has access to the network cabinet where the routers are in case you need to reboot something.
* Working with an external company who deliver WiFi on top of a corporation's internal network is a good idea
* Consider if there WiMax or 4G connectivity in the area your in. ManchesterBarCamp2 used WiMax.
* If you're in the UK, try and speak to BT early if you think you might need a ADSL line. It takes about a month to get a phone line and another month to get it ADSL enabled.
* You may also want to try Cable if the venue is in a cabled area

== Estimating numbers ==
When dealing with venues and Internet providers, it is very easy for them to underestimate the needs of your attendees. Wireless is usually provided on the basis that most people won't use it. This is not the case for BarCamps: at a BarCamp, it is a reasonable supposition that for every person there, there will be at least 1.5x the number of devices accessing the network, if not 2x. If you are outsourcing network provision or wifi provision to a third party, make sure they are aware that the people using the wireless aren't just going to be checking their e-mail once or twice, they are likely to be using it heavily and in anger. Even though you tell them not to, they'll probably BitTorrent too!

      <text xml:space="preserve">* When calculating the cost, consider the following: Additional security, Additional air conditioning and electrical cost. Additional janitorial costs.
* If your office is carpeted, plan on steam cleaning the carpet after the event.
* Plan not to have messy foods such as jelly.
* Work early to make sure that the vendors and caterers meet the insurance requirements for your building (if any).
* Even if you have many rooms (as we had), limit the tracks to between 4 to 8 rooms so the attendance does not suffer.
* Make sure you have at least 8 rooms for the event so sessions will be smaller and more discussion (many to many conversations) take place as opposed to one to many lectures. 4 rooms is not enough.
* Make sure there is enough toilets to cater for the amount of people attending. I would say you want at the very least 2 toilets for 50 people.
* Its worth having a room which is spare to put up the schedule and have as a reception space for people who are not attending the sessions can chill in without upsetting session goers
* Try and pick a venue with either lift access or on one floor for wheelchair barcampers
* Pick venues which you can rope off, to allow barcampers freedom to move and get comfortable within the venue. Nothing worst that people wondering through the barcamp who are not involved
* Venues which are purpose built like offices are ideal but barcamps have been done in many places such as garages, barns, marquees, student unions, etc.
* Outdoor space is great for parties, adhoc sessions and for people to smoke, but bear in mind the weather don't rely on them. 
* Think about parking space or how you would get to and from the venue on public transport. Being near a train station is a massive plus for those not local to the area
* Ask yourself if the venue is close to shops and if those shops will be open during the barcamp. You might be able to strike a deal with them for sponsorship

      <text xml:space="preserve">* Even if you have many rooms as we had, limit the tracks to 4 rooms so the attendance does not suffer.
* Make sure you have at least 8 rooms for the event so sessions will be smaller and more discussion (many to many conversations) take place as opposed to one to many lectures. 4 rooms is not enough.
* Make sure there is plenty of gathering room in front of your wall, people will want to gather round.
* Don't put the wall in one of the session rooms, People will want to look at it mid-session sometimes.

== The Event Slots ==

* There are different slot sizes you can do, 25 minute slots seems to be about right
* Ensure you give at least a 5 minute break in between sessions

== The Wall ==

* 5x3 index cards on a whiteboard or physical wall works best
* We used masking tape to form an actual grid
* Put breaks and lunch in as session sized slots - and put cards in that say Lunch or Break
** Don't just write on the tape in between 2 sessions &quot;lunch&quot; people won't see it
* Post it notes tend to fall off in my experience, I prefer index cards with blutack or magnetic whiteboard pins

      <text xml:space="preserve">Most of these people don't know there contributors yet, but they helped form the wikibook.

Emma Persky for coming up with the idea of writing a book about BarCamp. Emma's thought were a lot more involved that the simple one liners of this wikibook and of course would be from her point of view. I still hope she writes BarCamp: The book and even draws upon material gathered here, if the licence works for both parties.

The Twitter Book, by Tim O'Reilly and Sarah Milstein. This book is what I'm aiming for with the wikibook, short sharp advice, take it or leave it. discussions and complex issues not deeply explored.

Cristiano Betta and Mel Seckington for being a bouncing board to this crazy idea

[[w:Second_language_acquisition|Learning]] a [[w:Second_language|second language]] is easy, all you have to do is go there. There's no better motivator than necessity. Without actually travelling, learning a [[w:Language|language]] is still accessible: but you must substitute the motivation. ''Every day'', you should practice the language - time spent seperate from study. 

You should listen even before you can understand, to [[User:Robbiemuffin/Kreyol/Appendices#Radio|radio broadcasts]] and [[User:Robbiemuffin/Kreyol/Appendices#Chat|natural speakers]]. Watch the [[User:Robbiemuffin/Kreyol/Appendices#News|news]] on television to hear the language in a slow, consistant delivery and standard accent. Watch the daily television [[User:Robbiemuffin/Kreyol/Appendices#Television|dramas]] for samples of more natural speach. Better yet, seek out native speakers! Language is a living concept, shared between its speakers. Similarly you can solidify your knowledge of the language by reading, even before you have mastered the basics: news articles and [[User:Robbiemuffin/Kreyol/Appendices#Arts|essays]] provide samples of clear, standard grammar. [[User:Robbiemuffin/Kreyol/Appendices#Blogs|Blogs]] can illuminate more natural use of written language, and [[User:Robbiemuffin/Kreyol/Appendices#Fables|fables]] and children's stories provide insight into especially the more insular, unique aspects of the language. It does not matter if you cannot read it all, just so long as you spend time trying. Whenever possible, use a [[User:Robbiemuffin/Kreyol/Appendices#Translation|translation tool]] for grammar, and a [[User:Robbiemuffin/Kreyol/Appendices#Dictionaries|dictionary]] for individual words. 

You will also have to study, [[w:Rote_learning|the old fashioned way]], to memorize the structures of the language: its [[w:Grammar|grammar]], [[w:Grammatical_conjugation|conjugations]], [[w:Pro-form|pronouns]], adjective-phrases and [[w:Phrase|phrase]] construction, and [[w:Vocabulary|vocabularly]]. Divide your study time in two parts: a short period to learn one lesson for the day, and a series of small &quot;sprints&quot; of memorization. If you are having trouble with something, work backwards from the details to the overall structure, so you can contextualize the new information: If you struggle with a [[w:Grammatical_tense|grammatical tense]], take a moment to review the [[w:Grammatical_conjugation|general schema]] of all the tenses, how they differ from English, and what specifically the tense represents. If you always use a direct object [[w:Pronoun|pronoun]] where an indirect object pronoun is needed, review the [[w:Pronoun#Types_of_pronouns|system of pronouns]], and when each is called for - create sample sentences to see it in action. Be proactive. 

[[User:Robbiemuffin/Kreyol/Appendices#Flashcard_software|Flash cards]] work just fine for the bulk of study, for at least some people. If [[User:Robbiemuffin/Kreyol/Appendices#Learning_games|practice applications]] exist online, by all means use them! Other times, [[User:Robbiemuffin/Kreyol/Appendices#Reading_Exercises|reading]] and [[User:Robbiemuffin/Kreyol/Appendices#Writing_Exercises|writing]] will unify disparate parts of what you have already learned. Chatting online will let you [[User:Robbiemuffin/Kreyol/Appendices#Practice_Dialogs|pratice dialog]], and reading, if you can find a native speaker to practice with. Be diligent, always try to do some study work.

==Presentation==

The old style of teaching a language is to project a &quot;standard&quot; version of the language, very closely tied to a written register of the language, and to teach this as the model of the language. As students explore the model, they will borrow from their native language, and also from implications in the structure of the new language, to extrapolate new uses. Those that match the model are reinforced (they got it right), those that match real registers of the actual language are also reinforced, but flagged with the register (&quot;It's common to say 'wanna' in normal speach, but it is not technically a word in (standard model) English...&quot;), while those that mismatch the language or only match habits from the native language are dissuaded (they got it wrong). There has been a shift in language teaching over the past half a century or so, to teach a standard spoken register as the standard model of the language: this gives a &quot;center&quot; of spoken accent, and replaces the emphasis from written to oral communication. This is difficult to accomplish, however, as language is always changing, resources especially for languages with small populations cannot manifestly maintain a parallel teaching corpus to the &quot;real&quot; language. The whole process of oral-based teaching does not lend itself easily to wikis. The text here will be presented with a projected standard version of the language.

==Exponents==

'''Exponents''', or '''powers''', are a way of indicating that a quantity is to be multiplied by itself some number of times.  In the the expression 2&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;, 2 is called the '''base''' and 5 is called the exponent, or power.  2&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; 
is shorthand for &quot;multiply five twos together&quot;: 2&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; = 2×2×2×2×2 = 32.  Notice that the exponent tells us how many bases to multiply, ''not'' how many multiplications to perform.  (In fact, the number of multiplications is ''one less'' than the number of bases.)  2&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; is read &quot;two raised to the fifth power&quot; or simply &quot;two to the fifth.&quot;

In general,&lt;p style=&quot;text-align:center;&quot;&gt;&lt;math&gt;x^n = \underbrace{x \cdot x \cdot x \cdot \,\,\cdots\,\, \cdot x}_{n factors}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/p&gt;where there are ''n x'''s to be multiplied.

===Squaring numbers===

A convenient way to note that a number is to be multiplied by itself (for example 5×5) is to say that the number is '''squared'''.  To help visualize this, picture a square which is 5 units long and 5 units wide.  This square will then have an area of 5×5 or 25 square units.  A nice way to write &quot;5 squared&quot; is 5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, where 5 is called the '''base''' and 2 is called the '''exponent'''.

[[Image:5x5.PNG]]

Area of five rows by five columns = 5 × 5 = 5&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 25.

===Cubing numbers===
Similarly, a convenient way to note that a number is to be multiplied by itself and then itself again (for example 5×5×5) is to say that the number is '''cubed'''.  To help visualize this, picture a cube which is 5 units long, 5 units wide, and 5 units high.  This cube will then have a volume of 5×5×5 or 125 cubic units.  A nice way to write &quot;5 cubed&quot; is 5&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, where 5 is called the base and 3 is called the exponent.

[[Image:5cube.svg]]

Volume of a cube with height, width, and length of five = 5 × 5 × 5 = 5&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; = 125.

===Higher powers===
Numbers higher than three may also be used as exponents, although there is no common term for numbers raised to a fourth power or higher.  For example, 5&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; = 5×5×5×5 = 625.

Note: 0&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; is undefined.

==Properties of Exponents==

There are several properties of exponents which are frequently used to manipulate and simplify algebraic and arithmetic expressions.

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}

x^mx^n &amp; = x^{m+n}\\

\dfrac{x^m}{x^n} &amp; = x^{m-n}\\

(xy)^n &amp; = x^ny^n\\

\left(\dfrac{x}{y}\right)^n &amp; = \dfrac{x^n}{y^n}\\

(x^m)^n &amp; = x^{mn}

\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The first, third, and fifth properties may be extended to several factors, as follows:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}

x^{m_1}x^{m_2}x^{m_3} \cdots x^{m_n} &amp; = x^{m_1+m_2+m_3+ \, \cdots \, +m_n}\\

(x_1x_2x_3 \cdots x_n)^m &amp; = x_1^mx_2^mx_3^m \cdots x_n^m\\

( \cdots (((x^{m_1})^{m_2})^{m_3}) \cdots )^{m_n} &amp; = x^{m_1m_2m_3 \cdots \, m_n}

\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Bases and exponents of one and zero===
Any number raised to an exponent of one equals itself.  So, for example, 5&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; = 5.

Any non-zero number raised to an exponent of zero equals one.  So, for example, 5&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1.

Zero raised to any positive exponent is still zero.  So, for example, 0&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.

One raised to any exponent is still one.  So, for example, 1&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; = 1.

Zero raised to an exponent of zero is not defined.

===Negative and noninteger powers===
A base may also be raised to a negative, fractional, or decimal power.  This will be covered later in the lesson.

==Roots==
'''Roots''' are the inverse operation of powers:

===Square root===
The inverse operation of squaring a number is taking the '''square root''' of that number.  So, for example, the square root of 25 is the number which must be multiplied by itself to equal 25.  In this case, the answer is 5.  There are two types of notation used here:

&lt;math&gt;\sqrt{25} = 25^{1/2} = 5&lt;/math&gt;

Note, however, that most square roots don't yield integers, and many don't even produce rational numbers.

====Manually finding a square root====
One method for manually taking square roots is to repeatedly do long division.  Let's take the square root of 10 in this example.  We would start by estimating the answer.  Since 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 9 and 4&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 16, we know the answer lies between 3 and 4.  Furthermore, since 10 is only one away from 9, but is 6 away from 16, we could estimate that the answer is one-seventh of the way between 3 and 4.  This won't give an exact answer, and a seventh is ugly to work with, so let's use a fifth, instead. This gives us 3 1/5 or 3.2 as a starting estimate. 

Now do long division to divide 10 by 3.2.  We get 3.125.  The average of 3.2 and 3.125 is (3.2 + 3.125)/2 = 6.325/2 = 3.1625, so that will be our next estimate.

Now do long division to divide 10 by 3.1625.  We get 3.162055... (we didn't really need to go more than one digit beyond the number of decimal places we started with).  The average of 3.1625 and 3.1621 is 3.1623, so that will be our next estimate.

Now do long division to divide 10 by 3.1623.  We get 3.162255... 

So, this method can be repeated to get the desired level of accuracy.  The actual square root of 10 is 3.16227766...

Note that calculators or computers are used for most square root calculations, but knowing how to manually calculate a square root can be quite useful when no calculator is available.

If you would like to try this method yourself, try finding the square root of 7.

===Cube root===
The inverse operation of cubing a number is taking the '''cube root''' of that number.  So, for example, the cube root of 125 is the number which must be multiplied by itself and then multiplied by itself again to equal 125.  In this case, the answer is 5.  There are two types of notation used here:

&lt;math&gt;\sqrt[3]{125} = 125^{1/3} = 5&lt;/math&gt;

Note, however, that most cube roots don't yield integers, and many don't even produce rational numbers.

===Higher roots===
Numbers higher than three may also be used as roots, although there is no common term for fourth roots or higher.  For example:

&lt;math&gt;\sqrt[4]{625} = 625^{1/4} = 5&lt;/math&gt;

Note, however, that most higher roots don't yield integers, and many don't even produce rational numbers.

==Combining powers and roots==
The unit fraction notation used for roots previously may have given you the idea that roots are really the same as powers, only with a unit fraction (one over some number) instead of an integer as the exponent.  Thus, the fractional notation is actually preferred in higher mathematics, although the root symbol is still used occasionally, especially for square roots.

===Fractions as exponents===
Other (non-unit) fractions may also be used as exponents.  In this case, the base number may be raised to the power of the numerator (top number in the fraction) then the denominator (bottom number) may be used to take the root.  For example:

&lt;math&gt;8^{2/3} = \sqrt[3]{8^2} = \sqrt[3]{64} = 4&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, you can take the root first and then apply the power:

&lt;math&gt;8^{2/3} = (\sqrt[3]{8})^2 = 2^2 = 4&lt;/math&gt;

===Decimal exponents===
Any fractional exponent can also be expressed as a decimal exponent.  For example, a square root may also be written as:

&lt;math&gt;25^{1/2} = 25^{0.5} = 5 \;&lt;/math&gt;

Also, decimals which can't be expressed as a fraction (irrational numbers) may be used as exponents:

&lt;math&gt;5^{3.1415926...} = 156.99...\;&lt;/math&gt;

Such problems aren't easy to solve by hand using basic math skills, but the answer can be estimated manually.  In this case, since 3.1415926 is between 3 and 4 (and considerable closer to 3), we know that the answer will be between 5^3 (or 125) and 5^4 (or 625), and considerable closer to 125.

===Negative exponents===
A negative exponent simply means you take the reciprocal (one over the number) of the base first, then apply the exponent:

&lt;math&gt;25^{-0.5} = 1/25^{0.5} = 1/5 \;&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, you can first apply the exponent (ignoring the sign), then take the reciprocal:

&lt;math&gt;25^{-0.5} = 5^{-1} = 1/5 \;&lt;/math&gt;

===Fractions as bases===
When a fraction is raised to an exponent, both the numerator and denominator are raised to that exponent:

&lt;math&gt;(5/6)^2 = 5^2/6^2 = 25/36 \;&lt;/math&gt;

Fractions may also be used for both the base and exponent:

&lt;math&gt;(25/36)^{1/2} = 25^{1/2}/36^{1/2} = 5/6 \;&lt;/math&gt;

In addition, negative fractional exponents may be used, taking the reciprocal of the base, as always, to find the solution:

&lt;math&gt;(25/36)^{-1/2} = (36/25)^{1/2} = 36^{1/2}/25^{1/2} = 6/5 \;&lt;/math&gt;

===Negative bases===
Negative bases can be handled normally for integer powers:

&lt;math&gt;(-5)^2 = (-5) \times (-5) = 25 \;&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(-5)^3 = (-5) \times (-5) \times (-5) = -125 \;&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(-5)^4 = (-5) \times (-5) \times (-5) \times (-5) = 625 \;&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(-5)^5 = (-5) \times (-5) \times (-5) \times (-5) \times (-5) = -3125 \;&lt;/math&gt;

Note that negative bases raised to even powers produce positive results, while negative bases raised to odd powers produce negative results.

Be careful with negative signs.  Since -5 = -1×5, there is a difference between &lt;math&gt; -5^2&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(-5)^2&lt;/math&gt;.  The former means the negative of 5 times 5, whereas the latter&lt;br&gt;means -5 squared.  In other words,

&lt;math&gt;-5^2 = -1\times5^2 = -1\times(5\times5) = -1\times25 = -25&lt;/math&gt;

but

&lt;math&gt;(-5)^2=(-5)\times(-5)=25&lt;/math&gt;


Roots and fractional/decimal powers are a bit trickier.  Odd roots work out fine:

&lt;math&gt;(-125)^{1/3} = -5 \;&lt;/math&gt;

Even roots, however, have no real solution:

&lt;math&gt;(-25)^{1/2} = ? \;&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;(-625)^{1/4} = ? \;&lt;/math&gt;

Note that there is no real number, when multiplied by itself, which will produce -25, because 5×5 = 25 and -5×-5 = 25.  There is actually a solution, called an '''imaginary number''', but that won't be discussed until later lessons.

===Principal root===
Note that, since both 5×5 = 25 and -5×-5 = 25, when we are asked to take the square root of 25 there are, in fact, two valid answers, 5 and -5.  Actually, any even root of a positive number will have two solutions, with one being the negative of the other. This may seem unusual, but, in higher mathematics, problems often have multiple solutions.  

However, for many problems, only the positive value seems to physically work.  For example, if we are asked to figure the length of the sides of a square yard which has an area of 25 square units, only 5 units on a side works.  If we said &quot;each side can also have a length of -5 units&quot;, that doesn't make any sense.  For this reason, the positive solution is called the '''principal root''', and, depending on the question, may be the only desired answer.  In cases where either answer is valid, it is sometimes written as ±5 (read as &quot;plus or minus five&quot;).  However, the mathematical definition of the square root of x squared is the absolute value of x. Thus, square roots equations do not have two answers but two numbers can square to equal the same rational number.

      <comment>/* Comparing haskell ASTs */ Add link to haskell-src-exts package's hackage entry</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">﻿{{Haskell minitoc|chapter=General Practices}}

The &quot;Scrap your boilerplate&quot; approach, &quot;described&quot; in [http://www.cs.vu.nl/boilerplate/], is a way to allow your data structures to be traversed by so-called &quot;generic&quot; functions: that is, functions that abstract over the specific data constructors being created or modified, while allowing for the addition of cases for specific types.


For instance if you want to serialize all the structures in your code, but you want to write only one serialization function that operates over any instance of the Data.Data.Data class (which can be derived with -XDeriveDataTypeable).


== Serialization Example ==
The goal is to convert all our data into a format below:

  data Tag = Con String | Val String


== Comparing Haskell ASTs ==
The [http://hackage.haskell.org/package/haskell-src-exts haskell-src-exts package] parses Haskell into a quite complicated syntax tree. Let's say we want to check if two source files that are nearly identical.

To start:

  import System.Environment
  import Language.Haskell.Exts

  main = do
     -- parse the filenames given by the first two command line arguments,
     -- proper error handling is left as an exercise
     ParseOk moduleA: ParseOk moduleB:_ &lt;- mapM parseFile . take 2 =&lt;&lt; getArgs
     
     putStrLn $ if moduleA == moduleB
          then &quot;Your modules are equal&quot;
          else &quot;Your modules differ&quot;

From a bit of testing, it will be apparent that identical files with different names will not be equal to (==). However, to correct the fact, without resorting to lots of boilerplate, we can use generic programming:

== TODO ==
describe using   Data.Generics.Twins.gzip*? to write a function to find where there are differences?

Or use it to write a variant of geq that ignores the specific cases that are unimportant (the SrcLoc elements) (i.e. syb doesn't allow generic extension... contrast it with other libraries?).

Or just explain this hack (which worked well enough) to run before (==), or geq::

  everyWhere (mkT $ \ _ -&gt; SrcLoc &quot;&quot; 0 0) :: Data a =&gt; a -&gt; a

Or can we develop this into writing something better than sim_mira (for hs code), found here: http://dickgrune.com/Programs/similarity_tester/

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Introduction ==

In computer science and data mining, '''Apriori''' is a classic algorithm for learning association rules. Apriori is designed to operate on databases containing transactions. As is common in association rule mining, given a set of '''itemsets''', the algorithm attempts to find subsets which are common to at least a minimum number C of the itemsets. Apriori uses a &quot;bottom up&quot; approach, where frequent subsets are extended one item at a time (a step known as candidate generation), and groups of candidates are tested against the data. The algorithm terminates when no further successful extensions are found.

Apriori uses breadth-first search and a tree structure to count candidate item sets efficiently. It generates candidate item sets of length &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; from item sets of length &lt;math&gt;k-1&lt;/math&gt;. Then it prunes the candidates which have an infrequent sub pattern. According to the downward closure lemma, the candidate set contains all frequent &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-length item sets. After that, it scans the transaction database to determine frequent item sets among the candidates.

Apriori, while historically significant, suffers from a number of inefficiencies or trade-offs, which have spawned other algorithms.  Candidate generation generates large numbers of subsets (the algorithm attempts to load up the candidate set with as many as possible before each scan).  Bottom-up subset exploration (essentially a breadth-first traversal of the subset lattice)  finds any maximal subset S only after all &lt;math&gt;2^{|S|}-1&lt;/math&gt; of its proper subsets.

The quest to mine frequent patterns appears in many domains. The prototypical application is market basket analysis, i.e., to mine the sets of items that are frequent bought together, at a supermarket by analyzing the customer shopping carts (the so-called “market baskets”). Once we mine the frequent sets, they allow us to extract association rules among the item sets, where we make some statement about how likely are two sets of items to co-occur or to conditionally occur. For example, in the weblog scenario frequent sets allow us to extract rules like, “Users who visit the sets of pages main, laptops and rebates also visit the pages shopping-cart and checkout”, indicating, perhaps, that the special rebate offer is resulting in more laptop sales. In the case of market baskets, we can find rules like, “Customers who buy Milk and Cereal also tend to buy Bananas”, which may prompt a grocery store to co-locate bananas in the cereal aisle.

== Algorithm ==

The following is a formal statement of the problem: Let τ&lt;math&gt; = \{ i_1, i_2, ...,i_m\}&lt;/math&gt; be a set of literals, called items. Let &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; be a set of transactions, where each transaction &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; is a set of items such that &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; ⊆ τ. Associated with each transaction is a unique identifier, called its &lt;math&gt;TID&lt;/math&gt;. We say that a transaction &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; contains &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, a set of some items in τ, if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; ⊆ &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt;. An association rule is an implication of the form &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; ⇒ &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; , where &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; ⊂ τ, &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; ⊂ τ, and &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; ∩ &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; = ∅. The rule &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; ⇒ &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; holds in the transaction set &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; with confidence &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;c&lt;/math&gt;% of transactions in &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; that contain &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; also contain &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; . The rule &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; ⇒ &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; has support &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; in the transaction set &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;% of transactions in &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; contain &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; ∪ &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt;. Given a set of transactions &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;, the problem of mining association rules is to generate all association rules that have support and confidence greater than the user-specified minimum support (called minsup) and minimum confidence (called minconf ) respectively.

The problem is usually decomposed into two subproblems. One is to find those itemsets whose occurrences exceed a predefined threshold in the database; those itemsets are called frequent or large itemsets. The second problem is to generate association rules from those large itemsets with the constraints of minimal confidence. Suppose one of the large itemsets is Lk, Lk = {I1, I2, … , Ik}, association rules with this itemsets are generated in the following way: the first rule is {I1, I2, … , Ik-1}⇒ {Ik}, by checking the confidence this rule can be determined as interesting or not. Then other rule are generated by deleting the last items in the antecedent and inserting it to the consequent, further the confidences of the new rules are checked to determine the interestingness of them. Those processes iterated until the antecedent becomes empty. Since the second subproblem is quite straight forward, most of the researches focus on the first subproblem. The Apriori algorithm finds the frequent sets &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; In Database &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;.

Let &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; ⊆ I be any two itemsets. Observe that if &lt;math&gt;X&lt;/math&gt; ⊆ &lt;math&gt;Y&lt;/math&gt; , then sup(X) ≥ sup(Y ), which leads to the following two corollaries:

* If X is frequent, then any subset Y ⊆ X is also frequent.

* If X is not frequent, then any superset Y ⊇ X cannot be frequent.

Based on the above observations, we can significantly improve the itemset mining algorithm by reducing the number of candidates we generate, by limiting the candidates to be only those that will potentially be frequent. First we can stop generating supersets of a candidate once we determine that it is infrequent, since no superset of an infrequent itemset can be frequent. Second, we can avoid any candidate that has an infrequent subset. These two observations can result in significant pruning of the search space.

* Find frequent set &lt;math&gt;L_{k-1}&lt;/math&gt;.
* Join Step.
**   &lt;math&gt;C_k&lt;/math&gt; is generated by joining &lt;math&gt;L_{k-1}&lt;/math&gt;with itself
* Prune Step.
** Any &lt;math&gt;(k-1)&lt;/math&gt; -itemset that is not frequent cannot be a subset of a frequent &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; -itemset, hence should be removed.

where
* (&lt;math&gt;C_k&lt;/math&gt;: Candidate itemset of size &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;)
* (&lt;math&gt;L_k&lt;/math&gt;: frequent itemset of size &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;)

=== Apriori Pseudocode ===

''Apriori'' &lt;math&gt;(T,\varepsilon)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;L_1 \gets \{ &lt;/math&gt; ''large 1-itemsets that appear in more than &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt; transactions'' &lt;math&gt; \}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;k \gets 2&lt;/math&gt;
:: ''while'' &lt;math&gt; L_{k-1} \neq \varnothing &lt;/math&gt;
::: &lt;math&gt;C_k \gets &lt;/math&gt;''Generate''&lt;math&gt;(L_{k-1})&lt;/math&gt;
::: ''for transactions'' &lt;math&gt;t \in T&lt;/math&gt;
:::: &lt;math&gt;C_t \gets &lt;/math&gt;Subset&lt;math&gt;(C_k,t)&lt;/math&gt;
:::: ''for candidates'' &lt;math&gt;c \in C_t&lt;/math&gt;
::::: &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{count}[c] \gets \mathrm{count}[c]+1&lt;/math&gt;
::: &lt;math&gt;L_k \gets \{ c \in C_k | ~ \mathrm{count}[c] \geq \varepsilon \}&lt;/math&gt;
::: &lt;math&gt;k \gets k+1 &lt;/math&gt;
: ''return'' &lt;math&gt;\bigcup_k L_k&lt;/math&gt;

=== Implementation  ===
The R package that implements association rule mining is called arules, and it can be found at http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/arules/index.html (Details how to install R can be found here http://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu). In package arules we interface free reference implementations of Apriori and Eclat by Christian Borgelt (Borgelt and Kruse, 2002; Borgelt, 2003)3. The code is called directly from R by the functions apriori() and éclat() and the data objects are directly passed from R to the C code and back without writing to external files. The implementations can mine frequent itemsets, and closed and maximal frequent itemsets. In addition, apriori() can also mine association rules.

Installation of the dependencies packages can be performed within the R environment using the function &quot;install.packages(“''package name''”)&quot;. The name of the package in question is “''arules''”. To use this package you need R environment with version 2.7.0 at least (details how to update R can be found in http://cran.r-project.org/bin/linux/ubuntu).

&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
install.packages(“arules”)
&lt;/source&gt;

After the user installed the necessaries packages, he must load them. This can be done using the function &quot;library(''package name'')&quot;.

&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
library(arules)
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Visualization ===
====Reading the data====
Transactions can be read from files in the basket format, with the command read.transactions. The parameters for read.transactions are:

'''file'''

'''format''' read.transactions can get data structured in multiple formats, one of them being basket.

'''separator(sep)'''

One example of it’s use would be:

&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
tr&lt;-read.transactions(&quot;teste&quot;,format=&quot;basket&quot;,sep=&quot;,&quot;)
&lt;/source&gt;

The object ”tr” is used to store the transactions read from the file named ”teste”, where each item is separated by a ”,”. ”teste” could be, for example:

&lt;pre&gt;
A,B,C
B,C
A,B,D
A,B,C,D
A
B
&lt;/pre&gt;

One way to visualize the data is inspect(object). For example:

&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
inspect(tr)
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
items
1 {A,
   B,
   C}
2 {B,
   C}
3 {A,
   B,
   D}
4 {A,
   B,
   C,
   D}
5 {A}
6 {B}
&lt;/pre&gt;

Additionally, you can visually inspect binary incidence matrices, or plot the frequency of items sets:

&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
image(tr)
itemFrequencyPlot(tr, support = 0.1)
&lt;/source&gt;

 

To show the number of items in transactions read from the file named ”teste” do:

&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
length(tr)
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
[1] 6
&lt;/pre&gt;

====Rules====
The function to mine frequent itemsets, association rules or association hyperedges, using the Apriori algorithm, takes 2 parameters: 

'''Data''': the object that contains the data

'''parameter''': a multi-dimensional parameter to set up support and confidence 

For example, using the dataset gathered in the previous section: 

&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
rules &lt;- apriori(tr, parameter= list(supp=0.5, conf=0.5)) 
&lt;/source&gt;

The rules can be visualized with the command inspect:

&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
inspect(rules)
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
    rhs    support confidence lift
1 {} =&gt; {C} 0.5000000 0.5000000 1.0
2 {} =&gt; {A} 0.6666667 0.6666667 1.0
3 {} =&gt; {B} 0.8333333 0.8333333 1.0
4 {C} =&gt; {B} 0.5000000 1.0000000 1.2
5 {B} =&gt; {C} 0.5000000 0.6000000 1.2
6 {A} =&gt; {B} 0.5000000 0.7500000 0.9
7 {B} =&gt; {A} 0.5000000 0.6000000 0.9
&lt;/pre&gt;

To get a summary of the rules’ characteristics, the function ”summary” can be used:

&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
summary(rules)
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;

Outher quality measures of the rules can be displaed with:

&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
interestMeasure(rules, c(&quot;support&quot;, &quot;chiSquare&quot;, &quot;confidence&quot;, &quot;conviction&quot;,
      &quot;cosine&quot;, &quot;coverage&quot;, &quot;leverage&quot;, &quot;lift&quot;, &quot;oddsRatio&quot;), tr)
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;

5  1.2       Inf
6  0.9         0
7  0.9         0
&lt;/pre&gt;

To calculate a single measure and add it to the quality slot:

&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
quality(rules) &lt;- cbind(quality(rules), hyperConfidence = interestMeasure(rules, method = &quot;hyperConfidence&quot;, Income))
inspect(head(SORT(rules, by = &quot;hyperConfidence&quot;)))
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;
  lhs    rhs   support confidence lift hyperConfidence
1 {C} =&gt; {B} 0.5000000  1.0000000  1.2             0.5
2 {B} =&gt; {C} 0.5000000  0.6000000  1.2             0.5
3 {}  =&gt; {C} 0.5000000  0.5000000  1.0             0.0
4 {}  =&gt; {A} 0.6666667  0.6666667  1.0             0.0
5 {}  =&gt; {B} 0.8333333  0.8333333  1.0             0.0
6 {A} =&gt; {B} 0.5000000  0.7500000  0.9             0.0

&lt;/pre&gt;

Finally, to send the output to a file use:

&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
sink(&quot;sink-examp.txt&quot;)
inspect(head(SORT(rules, by = &quot;hyperConfidence&quot;)))
...
&lt;/source&gt;

== Case study ==
We now present a brief case study to illustrate the use of '''apriori''' and the '''package''' arules in a real data set.


=== Scenario ===
Spam is the abuse of electronic messaging systems (including most broadcast
media, digital delivery systems) to send unsolicited bulk messages
indiscriminately. Many filters are designed to stop spam in its tracks, but
such filters are often left behind by the spammers' obfuscating techniques.
One of such filters is SpamAssassin, a well known filter that relies on machine
learning and fixed rules for filtering. SpamAssassin, however, doesn't consider
the possible relations between its rules.

====Input Data====
22406 spams were used in this case study, ranging from 1998 to 2009, collected
from the public spam corpus SpamArchive (http://untroubled.org/spam/). Each spam
was analyzed by SpamAssassin, and the rules found were analyzed, as well its
year. For example, a particular spam would be:
YEAR=1998 INVALID_DATE INVALID_TZ_EST
meaning this was a spam from 1998 in which SpamAssassin accused two rules:
INVALID_DATE and INVALID_TZ_EST.

====Implementation====
The output from each spam filtered through SpamAssassin was saved in a file
named output. The following commands were issued:

&lt;source lang=bash&gt;
library(&quot;arules&quot;); #Using the package
tr&lt;-read.transactions(&quot;output&quot;,format=&quot;basket&quot;,sep=&quot; &quot;) #Reading each spam from the output file, separated by ' ' (single spaces).
rules &lt;- apriori(tr, parameter= list(supp=0.05, conf=0.3)) #Running apriori
inspect(rules) #Visualizing the association rules found.

&lt;/source&gt;

====Output Data====
We displayed only the itemsets of size 1, for simplicity:

&lt;pre&gt;
    lhs                           rhs                     support    confidence   lift

&lt;/pre&gt;

====Analysis====
It takes a critical eye to spot the interesting information. Rules such as
YEAR=2009 =&gt; HTML_MESSAGE carry information that is not surprising, deeming it
uninteresting. However, some interesting patterns can be found:

;MISSING_DATE =&gt; MISSING_MID: Spammers who don't set up a date usually 'forget' about the message ID as well. Maybe spam assassin could score differently when they are found together.

;HELO_DYNAMIC_IPADDR   =&gt; FH_HELO_EQ_D_D_D_D: When HELO is done using a suspicious hostname, it is usually in the d-d-d-d format. This characterizes a spam more than just one of the two rules separately.

;SUBJECT_NEEDS_ENCODING =&gt; SUBJ_ILLEGAL_CHARS: Typically this means a spam is in Chinese. These rules obviously have a strong correlation (confidence= 90%).

Many more interesting patterns can be found and studied, in order to improve the
quality of the filter. Using apriori with &quot;arules&quot; is an easy and straightforward
task.

Kreyòl was predominantly an oral tradition long before there were any official recognition of the language as a whole, or a ''common'' writing system. This shows through in the orthography of the language, from the presentation of the alphabet to the more-or-less literal representation of sounds by their letters. Kreyòl is a fairly new language, and that along with its strong tendency to be &quot;written as it sounds&quot;, leads to a fairly fluid language: ie, the spelling of words can be suggestive of the authors accent and may not lead to a match in a dictionary for what is really a common word.

=Graphemes=

{| style=&quot;background-color: white; border: solid thin black&quot;
! A !! B !! C !! D !! E !! F !! G !! H !! I !! J !! K !! L !! M !! N !! O !! P !! R !! S !! T !! U !! V !! W !! Y !! Z
|-
| a || b || c || d || e || f || g || h || i || j || k || l || m || n || o || p || r || s || t || u || v || w || y || z
|}

Kreyol uses a set of latin characters to write its letters. It is important to note that the graphemes are not the alphabet of the language: there is a large number of digraphs and some of the graphemes only occur in digraphs (for example, h is never capitalized, as it only occurs in the letter Ch).

===Diacritics===

====Grave accent====

The [[w:grave accent|grave accent]] is not really a diacritic, as it differentiates completely different vowels (e and è, for example). It is included for completeness.

====Acute accent====

The [[w:acute accent|acute accent]] --probably denotes syllabic stress.

====Double dot====

The [[w:diaeresis|diaeresis]] (trema)

====Circumflex====

The [[w:Circumflex|circumflex]] is used to show a long vowel.

===Punctuation===

====Apostrophe====
Apostrophes are used between a verb and a pronoun in its short form (as a direct object): ''l'ale'', ''l'gen'' (he/she has), but not after ''l'' in ''yo wè l'' (they saw him/her).

====Hyphen====
Hyphens are used to avoid ambiguity with nouns seperated from their determiners. ''bagay-la'' (the thing), is fine but unnecessary, while ''poul-nan kakaye'' (the hen is crowing) is better than ''poul nan kakaye'' (the hens in the process of crowing).

=Alphabet=

Each letter in the alphabet tends to have a one-to-one corrospondence with its sound. Like some other langauges (eg, Hindi), the alphabet is not presented as a single line of symbols for memorization, but rather it is divided analyitcally into consonants, vowels, semivowels (vowel-consonants), and nasal vowels.

==Consonants==
The pure [[w:consonants|consonants]] (Konsòn) and [[w:semivowels|semivowels]] (Vwayèl-konsòn) taken as a whole are treated together as consonants.

- despite the fact that /un/ combines two sounds, it is counted as a single letter. There is some support for considering oun as a nasal U (close back rounded vowel) sound, /ũ/, but this appears to be a minority view.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Working with DEGseq

==Introduction==


	First we have to choose the way to organize your data. There is two ways to do that: using the MA-plot-based method with random sampling model or MA-plot-based method with technical replicates.
	
'''MA-plot-based method with random sampling model ''' 

	The MA-plot is a statistical analysis tool that having been used to detect and visualize intensity-dependent ratio of microarray data. Let C1 and C2 denote the counts of reads mapped to a specific gene obtained from two samples, with Ci ~ binomial(ni, pi), I = 1,2, where ni denotes the total number of mapped reads and pi denotes the probability of a read coming from that gene. We define M = log2C1 - log2C2, and A = (log2C1 + log2C2)/2. It can be proven that under the random sampling assumption the conditional distribution of M given that A = a (a is an observation of A), follows an approximate normal distribution. For each gene on the MA-plot, we do the hypothesis test of H0: p1 = p2 versus H1: p1 ≠ p2. Then a P-value could be assigned based on the conditional normal distribution.

'''MA-plot-based method with technical replicates'''

	Though it has been reported that sequencing platform has low background noise, technical replicates would still be informative for quality control and to estimate the variation due to different machines or platforms. MA-plot-based is a another method which estimates the noise level by comparing technical replicates in the data (if available). In this method, a sliding-window is first applied on the MA-plot of the two technical replicates along the A-axis to estimate the random variation corresponding to different expression levels. A smoothed estimate of the intensity-dependent noise level is done by loess regression, and converted to local standard deviations of M conditioned on A, under the assumption of normal distribution. The local standard deviations are then used to identify the difference of the gene expression between the two samples. 


'''Multiple testing correction'''

	For the above methods, the P-values calculated for each gene are adjusted to Q-values for multiple testing corrections. Users can set either a P-value or a false discovery rate (FDR) threshold to identify differentially expressed genes.

	Once you choose your data, you can apply the R package DEGseq. There are five different methods to run the program. They are DEGexp, DEGseq, readGeneExp, samWrapper and getGeneExp.

==Functions of Package==

===DEGseq===

'''Description'''

This function is used to identify differentially expressed genes from RNA-seq data. It takes uniquely mapped reads from RNA-seq data for the two samples with a gene annotation as input. So users should map the reads (obtained from sequencing libraries of the samples) to the corresponding genome in advance.

===getGeneExp===

'''Description'''

This function is used to count the number of reads and calculate the RPKM for each gene. It takes uniquely mapped reads from RNA-seq data for a sample with a gene annotation file as input. So users should map the reads (obtained from sequencing library of the sample) to the corresponding genome in advance.

'''Usage'''

getGeneExp( mapResultBatch, fileFormat=&quot;bed&quot;, readLength=32, strandInfo=FALSE,
refFlat, output=paste(mapResultBatch[1],&quot;.exp&quot;,sep=&quot;&quot;), min.overlapPercent= 1 )

Kreyòl has a more-or-less literal representation of sounds by their letters. This requires some retraining of your reading, to recognize the proper pronunciation does not change, by diachonic palatalization, vowel variation, or any other alteration of sound. The classic example of a diachronic, somewhat universal among indo-european languages, is with C and G. In english, C before a hard vowel (a,o,u) will tend to have a hard sound, but will sound soft, like an s, before a soft vowel (e,i): “car” sounds like /kaɹ/ not /saɹ/, “certain” sounds like /søɹtan/ not /køɹtan/. Almost all the Kreyòl sounds are similar to their french equivalents: if you are having trouble finding a sound sample for Kreyòl, review french pronunciation in conjunction with the Kreyòl text. The most common deviation from literal pronunciation has to do with the multi-grapheme letters, which instead combine into a single sound, and especially the nasals where the N character is simply not pronounced at all (except with oun /un/).

===Word stress===

Syllable clusters are like any romance language, they tend to be simple consonant-vowel pairs (eg, &quot;fri·ji·dè&quot;). A word starting with a vowel will usually have a bare vowel there (eg, &quot;e·ta·zi·ni&quot;), but sometimes it will have a vowel-consonant syllable instead (eg, &quot;en·pe&quot;). A word ending with a consonant will have a consonant-vowel-consonant syllable there (eg, &quot;an·pil&quot;). 

Word stress are generally like the french, with equal emphasis throughout the word. Some authors suggest english speakers attempt to add a little stress to the end of the word, to compensate for our natural inclination to stress to the first syllable of a word. 

As in european portuguese, there is a slight shortenening of the length of a soft vowel at the end of a word (eg, almost fail to say the trailing e in &quot;kot·e&quot;, for &quot;place&quot;). French also has a shortening/omission of certain final vowel sounds, in words like &quot;elle&quot; – but there, it is more or less completely dropped, whereas in Kreyòl, the final sound maintains longer like portuguese with words like &quot;ele&quot; or &quot;donde&quot;.

Similar to french, final hard consonants are almost dropped: in &quot;nepòt&quot; the &quot;t&quot; is still spoken, but softly. The &quot;t&quot; in &quot;depot&quot; in english/french is completely dropped, in kreyòl, our final consonant is simply not aspirated afterward.

===Phrasal stress===

Like french, each phrase of a sentence by default get's a raised pitch on the last word in the phrase. As in portuguese, there is vowel elision (skipping the last vowel in a word after a word which ends with the same vowel, joining the pronunciation of the two words). Optional phrasal stress is a little more complicated. Some phrasal stress can be applied as in english, raising the pitch of the stressed word. But haitians also use [[w:Reduplication|word doubling]] to emphasize a noun or verb. For ad-words (adjectives and adverbs modifying a verb or another adverb), they change the sentence structure in a fashion a little like how spanish changes the position of an adjective or pro-form for emphasis.

=In this chapter=

In this chapter you will find a large set of simple word memorization. Its logical divisions should facilitate passive learning of the grammar of the language and quickly build a solid foundation to begin general communication. Students are encouraged to build stacks of about 20 flash cards out of the material here. The process of thinking aobut the material and constructing the stacks should help familiarize the reader enough to proceed to the next chapters as soon as all the flashcards are finished. While continuing in your studies, process one stack every day until you &quot;ace it&quot;. Then, use a [[w:spaced repetition|spaced repetition]] schedule to revise that stack -- while continuing learning from the other stacks and your studies in this book.

In studying this chapter, much progress will be made towards the '''basic vocabulary''', '''simple present tense''', '''basic grammmar''', and '''modisms''' segments.

=Vocabulary=

The words selected for this vocabulary set are generally the most common functionally independent words. An effort has been made to ensure words from many different parts of speach are included, and the noun and descrptives have been choosen to emphasize concepts a new language learner is likely to talk about.

The vocabulary is divided up into small groups of related words.

==Pronouns==
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
!person/number
!Kreyòl
!Short form
!IPA
!French
!gloss
|-
|1/singular
|''mwen''
|''m''
|/mwɛ̃/
|''je'', ''me'', ''moi''
|&quot;I&quot;, &quot;me&quot;
|-
|2/singular
|''ou'' (*)
|''w''
|/u:/
|''tu'', ''te'', ''vous''
|&quot;you&quot; (sing.)
|-
|3/singular
|''li''
|''l''
|/li/
|''il'', ''elle'', ''on''
|&quot;he&quot;, &quot;she&quot;
|-
|1/plural
|''nou''
|''n''
|/nu/
|''nous''
|&quot;we&quot;, &quot;us&quot;
|-
|2/plural
|''nou'' or ''ou'' (**)
|&amp;nbsp;
|/nu/ or /u:/
|''vous''
|&quot;you&quot; (pl.)
|-
|3/plural
|''yo''
|''y''
|/jo/
|''ils'', ''elles''
|&quot;they&quot;, &quot;them&quot;
|}
(*) sometimes ''ou'' is written as ''w'' - in the sample phrases, ''w'' indicates ''ou''.&lt;br /&gt;
(**) depending on the situation.

The pronunciation is the same regardless of whether the word is in long or short form.

With ''mwen'', the short form can be used anywhere. With the others occuring before a word, they usually only occur before a vowel:
* ''mwen byen'' - ''m'byen''
but for others, only like
* ''nou ale'' - ''n'ale''
* ''li ale'' - ''l'ale''

===Flashcard data from this section===
*'''mwen'''/'''m''' - I/me
*'''ou'''/'''u''' - you
*'''li'''/'''l''' - he, she
*'''nou'''/'''n''' - we/us, you (plural)
*'''yo'''/'''y''' - they/them

==Articles and demonstratives==

Definite articles specify count and identity, and are like the english &quot;the&quot;. Indefinite articles specify count but not identity (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;an&quot;). Demonstratives are pro-form demterminers like &quot;this&quot;, &quot;that&quot;, etc.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ definite
! number
!Kreyòl
|-
| singular || la, a , an , nan
|-
| plural || yo
|}
The definite article comes ''after'' the noun: &quot;moun an&quot; - the man.

* After vowels use &quot;a&quot;: &quot;ri a&quot; – the street
* After any consonant except -n or -m consonant use &quot;la&quot;: &quot;lèt-la&quot; – the letter 
* After words ending in -n use &quot;an&quot;: &quot;chen an&quot; – the dog
* After words ending in -m, -nm, -nn, -gn, -ng use &quot;nan&quot;: &quot;chanm nan&quot; – the man 


{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ indefinite
! number
!Kreyòl
|-
| singular || yon/youn
|-
| plural || kèk
|}
Indefinite articles ''precede'' the noun. &quot;Youn&quot; is used only with a noun that also ends with the letter &quot;oun&quot; (remember &quot;oun&quot; is considered one letter in kreyòl, even though it is a compound sound /un/): &quot;youn moun&quot; - &quot;a man&quot;. Otherwise, &quot;yon&quot; is used for all other singular nouns.


{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|+ demonstratives
! place/number
!Kreyòl
!English
|-
| near/singular || sa a || this
|-
| near/plural || sa yo || these
|-
| far/singular || sila a || that
|-
| far/plural || sila yo || those
|}
Demonstratives come ''after'' the noun: ''vil sila a'' - that city. The singular marker &quot;a&quot; is optional, you will not always see it written.

===To be===
In many latin languages there are two forms of &quot;to be&quot;, one for permanent qualities ''(sere)'', and a second for happenstantials ''(estare)''. But this is not true in french (nor english). Kreyòl continues to simplify, having lost its copula for adjectivals almost entirely: &quot;Nou malad&quot; (translates to &quot;we are sick&quot;) is made of the words &quot;we&quot; + &quot;sick&quot; with no assigning verb. In a sense, an adjective '''is''' a verb in kreyòl, and there is no need for assignment – or if you prefer, kreyòl is a copula-drop language, where the dropping is just like in english we drop &quot;you&quot; from imperatives (&quot;Hurry!&quot;, not &quot;You hurry!&quot;). But that only goes so far. In the third person, kreyòl uses &quot;menm&quot; (an adjective for &quot;same&quot;) ''as the copula''. Thus:

* ''Nou malad.'' We are sick. (just right now, like with the flu)
* ''Mwen malad.'' I am sick.
* ''Chen mwen malad.'' My dog is sick.

For the permanent (&quot;sere&quot;) form of &quot;to be&quot;, such as &quot;I am tall&quot;, we use &quot;se&quot;. 

* ''Li se malad.'' He is sick. (always, like with cancer)
* ''Non mwen se Enrique.'' My name is Enrique.

==Nouns==

*'''sache''' - bag
*'''kreyon''' - pencil
*'''manje''' - food
*'''dlo''' - water
*'''moun''' - person
*'''jan''', '''chemen''', '''rout''' - way
*'''bagay''' - thing
*'''bò''' - side
*'''kote''' - place
*'''pwoblem''' - problem
*'''apel''' - name
*'''mo''' - word

==Time words==

*'''fwa''' - time (the number of ..)
*'''avan''', '''anvan''' - before
*'''apre''', '''dèyè''' - after
*'''kounye-a''' - now
*'''ye''' - yesterday
*'''jodia''' - today
*'''demen''' - tomorrow

==Adjectives and descriptive adverbs==

*'''lan/lant''' - slow

*'''byen''' - well/fine
*'''mal/move''' - bad
*'''bon''' - nice/good
*'''anpil''' - a lot (like “amply”, serves as “very”)


*'''malad''' - sick

28,000 students. And that's just undergrads.

==Rutgers is Impersonal==
This is a state research university. Classes are huge, professors are mainly here for research, and if you don't make an effort you'll get lost in the crowd.

==Rutgers is Disorganized==
Rutgers is sprawled across multiple towns, with the Raritan River right in the middle. There's a good reason why Rutgers has the second largest bus system in America, and the largest of '''any''' university.

==Put all that together...==
And you get what is lovingly known as the &quot;[http://www.dailytargum.com/2.8694/ru-screw-1.1525544 RU Screw]&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Diode ==
Diode is a SemiConductor Device made from joining One Positive typed Semi Conductor with One Neagative Typed Semi Conductor . 
: - o--[N P]--o +

Diode is an Unijuction device that has two distinct polarities namely Anode which is Negative and Cathode which is Positive . Diode has a circuit symbol

:[[File:Diode_symbol.svg|100px]]

==Diode's Characrteristics==
===I V Curve===
[[File:Rectifier_vi_curve.GIF|500px]]
===Break-over Voltage===
: V&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.3v for Si and 0.6v for Ge

===Operation===
:V &lt; V&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; . I = 0 . Diode does not conduct current
:V = V&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; . I = 1 mA . Current starts to flow
:V &gt; V&lt;sub&gt;d&lt;/sub&gt; . I = e&lt;sup&gt;v&lt;/sup&gt; . Diode conducts current exponentially

===Polarities &amp; Biased Voltage===
When Diode is connected with a voltage source in such that the polarities of the diode is in opposite with the poarities of the voltage source Diode is said to be Forward Biased and when voltage is greter than Forward biased voltage current will flow and increase exponentially with time in the direction of Pointing Arrow

When Diode is connected with a voltage source in such that the polarities of the diode is in the same with the poarities of the voltage source Diode is said to be Backward Biased Diode does not conduct current

When biased voltage on Diode is negative the diode's junction is punched through . Further in crease in voltage until voltage reaches Break Down Voltage level . Current remains constant does not change with increasing voltage . Further increase voltage above this point Diode will break down

==Applications==
===Voltage Regulator===
[[Image:Zener diode voltage regulator.svg|220px|right]]
Zener diodes are widely used to regulate the voltage across a circuit.  When connected in parallel with a variable voltage source so that it is reverse biased, a Zener diode conducts when the voltage reaches the diode's reverse breakdown voltage.  From that point it keeps the voltage at that value.

In the circuit shown, resistor R provides the voltage drop between U&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt; and U&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt;. The value of ''R'' must satisfy two conditions:
# ''R'' must be small enough that the current through D keeps D in reverse breakdown. The value of this current is given in the data sheet for D. For example, the common BZX79C5V6&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fairchildsemi.com/pf/BZ/BZX79C5V6.html ''BZX79C5V6 data sheet'', Fairchild Semiconductor]&lt;/ref&gt; device, a 5.6 V 0.5 W Zener diode, has a recommended reverse current of 5 mA. If insufficient current exists through D, then U&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt; will be unregulated, and less than the nominal breakdown voltage (this differs to voltage regulator tubes where the output voltage will be higher than nominal and could rise as high as U&lt;sub&gt;IN&lt;/sub&gt;). When calculating ''R'', allowance must be made for any current through the external load, not shown in this diagram, connected across U&lt;sub&gt;OUT&lt;/sub&gt;. 
# ''R'' must be large enough that the current through D does not destroy the device.  If the current through D is ''I''&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;, its breakdown voltage ''V''&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt; and its maximum power dissipation ''P''&lt;sub&gt;MAX&lt;/sub&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;I_D V_B &lt; P_{MAX}&lt;/math&gt;.

A Zener diode used in this way is known as a ''shunt voltage regulator'' (''shunt'', in this context, meaning connected in parallel, and ''voltage regulator'' being a class of circuit that produces a stable voltage across any load). In a sense, a portion of the current through the resistor is shunted through the Zener diode, and the rest is through the load. Thus the voltage that the load sees is controlled by causing some fraction of the current from the power source to bypass it&amp;mdash;hence the name, by analogy with locomotive switching points.

These devices are also encountered, typically in series with a base-emitter junction, in transistor stages where selective choice of a device centered around the avalanche/Zener point can be used to introduce compensating temperature co-efficient balancing of the  transistor PN junction. An example of this kind of use would be a DC error amplifier used in a stabilized power supply circuit feedback loop system.

Because it is almost always the ''reverse''-breakdown property of the Zener diode that is useful, in circuit schematics the Zener diode symbol (i.e., a diode arrow) typically points in the ''opposite'' direction of the circuit's positive current flow. This use is opposite that of a typical diode, which would be aligned with the current flow.

[[Image:photodiode.jpg|right|thumbnail|75px|A photodiode]]

A '''photodiode''' is a semiconductor diode that functions as a photodetector.   Photodiodes are packaged with either a window or optical fiber connection, in order to let in the light to the sensitive part of the device. They may also be used without a window to detect vacuum UV or X-rays.

A '''phototransistor''' is in essence nothing more than a bipolar transistor that is encased in a transparent case so that light can reach the ''base-collector junction''. The phototransistor works like a photodiode, but with a much higher sensitivity for light, because the electrons that are generated by photons in the base-collector junction are injected into the base, and this current is then amplified by the transistor operation. However, a phototransistor has a slower response time than a photodiode.

==Operation==
A photodiode is a p-n junction or p-i-n structure. When light of sufficient photon energy strikes the diode, it excites an electron thereby creating a mobile electron and a positively charged electron hole. If the absorption occurs in the junction's depletion region, or one diffusion length away from it, these carriers are swept from the junction by the built-in field of the depletion region, producing a photocurrent. 

Photodiodes can be used under either zero bias (photovoltaic mode) or reverse bias (photoconductive mode). In zero bias, light falling on the diode causes a current across the device, leading to forward bias which in turn induces &quot;dark current&quot; in the opposite direction to the photocurrent. This is called the photovoltaic effect, and is the basis for solar cells — in fact, a solar cell is just a large number of big photodiodes.

Reverse bias induces only little current (known as saturation or back current) along its direction. But a more important effect of reverse bias is widening of the depletion layer (Therefore expanding the reaction volume) and strengthening the photocurrent.  Circuits based on this effect are more sensitive to light than ones based on the photovoltaic effect.

'''Avalanche photodiodes''' have a similar structure, but they are operated with much higher reverse bias. This allows each ''photo-generated'' carrier to be multiplied by avalanche breakdown, resulting in internal gain within the photodiode, which increases the effective ''responsivity'' of the device.
 
==Materials==
The material used to make a photodiode is critical to defining its properties, because only photons with sufficient energy to excite an electron across the material's bandgap will produce significant photocurrents.

Materials commonly used to produce photodiodes:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Material !! Wavelength range (nm)
|- 
| Silicon || 190–1100 
|-
| Germanium || 400–1700 
|- 
| Indium gallium arsenide  || 800–2600
|- 
| Lead sulfide || &lt;1000-3500
|}

Because of their greater bandgap, silicon-based photodiodes generate less noise than germanium-based photodiodes, but germanium photodiodes must be used for wavelengths longer than approximately 1 µm.

Since transistors and ICs are made of semiconductors, and contain P-N junctions, almost every active component is potentially a photodiode.  Many components, especially those sensitive to small currents, will not work correctly if illuminated, due to the induced photocurrents.  In most components this is not desired, so they are placed in an opaque housing.  Since housings are not completely opaque to X-rays or other high energy radiation, these can still cause many ICs to malfunction due to induced photo-currents.

==Features==
Critical performance parameters of a photodiode include:

;responsivity: The ratio of generated photocurrent to incident light power, typically expressed in A/W when used in photoconductive mode. The responsivity may also be expressed as a ''quantum efficiency'', or the ratio of the number of photogenerated carriers to incident photons and thus a unitless quantity.

;dark current: The current through the photodiode in the absence of any input optical signal, when it is operated in photoconductive mode. The dark current includes photocurrent generated by background radiation and the saturation current of the semiconductor junction. Dark current must be accounted for by calibration if a photodiode is used to make an accurate optical power measurement, and it is also a source of noise when a photodiode is used in an optical communication system.

;noise-equivalent power: (NEP) The minimum input optical power to generate photocurrent, equal to the rms noise current in a 1 hertz bandwidth. The related characteristic ''detectivity'' (D) is the inverse of NEP, 1/NEP; and the ''specific detectivity'' (&lt;math&gt;D^\star&lt;/math&gt;) is the detectivity normalized to the area (A) of the photodetector, &lt;math&gt;D^\star=D\sqrt{A}&lt;/math&gt;. The NEP is roughly the minimum detectable input power of a photodiode.

When a photodiode is used in an optical communication system, these parameters contribute to the ''sensitivity'' of the optical receiver, which is the minimum input power required for the receiver to achieve a specified ''bit error ratio''.

==Applications==
[[Image:Photodiode symbol.svg|right|250px|thumb|Photodiode schematic symbol]]

P-N photodiodes are used in similar applications to other photodetectors, such as photoconductors, charge-coupled devices, and photomultiplier tubes. 

Photodiodes are used in consumer electronics devices such as compact disc players,  smoke detectors, and the receivers for remote controls in VCRs and televisions.

In other consumer items such as camera light meters, clock radios (the ones that dim the display when it's dark) and street lights, photoconductors are often used rather than photodiodes, although in principle either could be used.

Photodiodes are often used for accurate measurement of light intensity in science and industry. They generally have a better, more linear response than photoconductors.

They are also widely used in various medical applications, such as detectors for Computed tomography (coupled with scintillators) or instruments to analyze samples (immunoassay). They are also used in Blood gas monitors.

PIN diodes are much faster and more sensitive than ordinary p-n junction diodes, and hence are often used for optical communications and in lighting regulation.

P-N photodiodes are not used to measure extremely low light intensities. Instead, if high sensitivity is needed, avalanche photodiodes, intensified charge-coupled devices or photomultiplier tubes are used for applications such as astronomy, spectroscopy, night-vision equipment and laser range finding.

:&lt;font size=3&gt;The first Denmark meters appeared in 1925. All stamps have “DANMARK” in the frank except some of the Postage Due stamps. The stamps have a letter prefix which in most cases identifies the meter manufacturer. A few anomalies exist where the letter prefix of one manufacturer is found on stamps that appear to be from a different manufacturer’s machine.
:Stamps with slogan showing the name of the manufacturer, “SERVICE MASKINE” and a number are from meters loaned to mailers while their machines are out of service for repair. 
:Denmark has one native meter manufacturer: Portos.
:Danish frank designs are standardized by the government. So far there have been four main designs plus additional distinctive designs used for various Post Office services.
:: '''A''' - Frank with simulated-perforation borders
:: '''B''' - Frank with single, straight-line border
:: '''C''' - Horizontal frank with straight-line borders at right and bottom, open at top and left
:: '''D''' - Open design without outer frame lines, “POST” in oval at top
:: '''PO''' - Special stamps for Post Office window/counter use
:: '''PD''' - Special stamps for Postage Due&lt;/font&gt;

== WCI conference 2011 : Would like to discuss a few things ==

Hello!

I will be delivering a Talk at the Wikimedia Conference India 2011 on the topic of &quot;Accelerating Wikibooks&quot;.

Over the next few days, I aim to make the proposal more and more wholesome and relevant. I'd like to discuss with you about the proposal and hope you can recommend me a few names on Wikibooks with whom I can discuss this.

I'd be very happy if you could discuss the proposal at [[User:Thewinster/Accelerating_Wikibooks]]

--[[User:Thewinster|Thewinster]] ([[User talk:Thewinster|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Thewinster|contribs]]) 08:18, 26 September 2011 (UTC)
=== Summary of the proposal ===

This is not a summary of the final talk, only a tentative guideline.

* Create Roadmaps for a book
* Define Learning Outcomes
* Annotate and Discuss new content available from around the web.
* Minor tweaks and fixes which concentrate on crowdsourcing.
* Identifying Small Contribution that advance a book and designing good UIs and triggers according to B.J. Fogg's Behavior Change Model, 8 Step Design Process. The paper can be found here at [http://www.bjfogg.com/design_files/page8_1.pdf Persuasive Design : Eight Step Process by B. J. Fogg]</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Miketz Genesis 41-4

Mi Ketz, means &quot;from the end&quot; or &quot;completion&quot;. It was the end of two full years, from the time the butler and baker were released from prison till Pharoah dreamed and the wine bearer remembered his promise to Yosef (Joseph).
His experience in prison must have been akin to what we feel when we have the call of God on our lives and have to wait, sometimes years, to carry it out.   He demonstrates for us the best way to spend our time, serving our Master  diligently as the scripture says &quot;whatever your hand finds t o do, do it with all your might&quot;   Eccl. 9:10
By doing this, Yosef's endured the situation in patient service to Yahweh and his character was strengthened and prepared for the calling on his life.

Although it took many years, Yosef went from slave to prisoner to head of Pharaoh’s kingdom. The transitions were overnight. It looked to him as though it would never come but when it finally came, it seemed instantaneous.
As a result of his faithfulness, he was in due time advanced to leadership in the kingdom.  When the time was right and the vessel was prepared, the situation changed.

Promotion Comes From Yahweh
In the courts of Egypt and Mesopotamia, they had men who professionally interpreted dreams  (International Bible Encyclopedia Vol.1 p.992) and so their inability to interpret Pharaoh's dream was significant and was divinely used to fulfill Yahweh's purposes to bring Yosef to his ordained role in life.

The cupbearer had forgotten Yosef but Yahweh had not, and although Yosef's faith was tested, Yahweh was faithful to His Word, and the gift which He had given him of interpreting dreams, made way for him.   Under the circumstance, the Chamberlain of the Cup Bearers decided that his own self-interest dictated that he remember Yosef and tell Pharaoh about him. The chamberlain began his declaration by making a point of his great devotion to the king: &quot;Even though I will have to recall my sins to make this revelation, I will do it for the sake of your majesty -- to tell you of my personal knowledge of an interpreter&quot;  On his recommendation, Pharaoh has Yosef immediately released and brought to him.  The scripture reads, &quot;And they rushed him.&quot;  Sometimes divine salvation comes hastily and unexpectedly.   We need to remember that in our timetable Yahweh may appear to be slow or late but in his timetable, He is never late and His timing is perfect.

When Yosef was summoned before Pharaoh, his initial words were a bold disclaimer of personal ability and a confession of faith in the only true and living God.  &quot;That is beyond me; it is Elohim Who will respond with Pharaoh's welfare&quot; or &quot;It is not in me; Elohim will give Pharaoh a favorable answer.&quot; (41:16)  Daniel, too, ascribed his powers solely to God.  Daniel 2:30 &quot;But as for me, this mystery has not been revealed to me for any wisdom residing in me more than in any other living man, but for the purpose of making the interpretation known to the king, and that you may understand the thoughts of your mind.&quot; Yahweh says in 1 Samuel 2:30,  &quot;Those who honor me I will honor.&quot;  Humbly, Yosef and Daniel gave credit to the One to Whom credit was due, refusing to accept the implication that they had any supernatural powers.   Their integrity would not permit them to accept credit themselves, despite the real danger that these might be executed if there was nothing extraordinary about them and their message. 

Just as the chief cupbearer forgot about Yosef for two years, so Yeshua has been ignored by the majority of both the Jewish people and the population of the world for two thousand years. When brought to the forefront Yosef did not seek to establish his own integrity or honour, but gives glory to Yahweh as the &quot;interpreter of dreams&quot;.  (41:16)
The interpretation of the dream is &quot;Behold, there come seven years of great plenty throughout all the land of Mitzrayim. There will arise after them seven years of famine, and all the plenty will be forgotten in the land of Mitzrayim. The famine will consume the land&quot; (41:29-30 HNV)

Pharaoh chooses Yosef to oversee the implementation of adequate measures to respond to the prophetic warning.  He discerns the quality of Yosef's character,  his integrity,  and his executive and administrative ability to devise a plan which will apply the prophetic content of the dream into practical action for the benefit of the kingdom. Yosef is not self-seeking and Pharaoh judges him as a man he could trust to implement the necessary procedures to do what was necessary in this situation.  Not only does Yosef impress Pharaoh, but also all of his servants. (41:37)

This speaks highly of Yosef's personal image.   Pharaoh does not question his past because he sees a man who manifests a sound and wholesome attitude standing before him.   Yosef has not been embittered or belittled by his circumstances to indulge in self-pity - he stands in the strength of the One whom he represents. His training in administrative abilities has been developed both in Potiphar's house and also in the prison and now having learnt to serve, he is elevated to rule.  Promotion comes from Yahweh.   Psalm 75:6,7

Yosef may be likened unto Yeshua, who is exalted from a low estate to a high estate, Pharaoh may be likened unto God, who so exalted Yeshua. Pharaoh gives Yosef his signet ring. A signet ring (like Judah’s seal in the previous portion) represents the authority of the name it bears.  By giving Yosef his signet ring, Pharaoh gives Yosef the authority of his own name.  In a similar way God exalted Yeshua “and bestowed on Him the name which is above every name” (Philippians 2:9); that is, His own sacred name.  As Yosef goes forth, criers run before his chariot, saying, “Bow the knee!” (Genesis 41:43) 

God exalts Yeshua “so that at the name of Yeshua every knee will bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth.” (Philippians 2:10)
Pharaoh gives Yosef authority over his own household, saying, “You shall be over my house.” (Genesis 41:40)
 
In a similar manner, Yeshua is over the house of God. Pharaoh gives Yosef authority over everything in Egypt.  So too regarding Messiah. God has put all things in subjection under Him.  (1 Corinthians 15:27)  

Whoever did not bow before Yosef, was not in submission to Pharaoh, who had given the command. It is the same way with anyone who will not bow before Yeshua and acknowledge him as Lord; that person is not obedient to the Father, who commanded it,  &quot;that all may honor the Son, even as they honor the Father. He who doesn't honor the Son doesn't honor the Father who sent him.&quot;(John 5:23 HNV)
								
Yosef is given a new name which according to Rashi and Flavius Josefus, the name Tzafnat-Paneach means, &quot;he who reveals secrets&quot;. &quot;Tzafnat&quot; could come from the root &quot;tzafan&quot;, which means &quot;hide&quot;, &quot;keep secret&quot;. The Septuagint and the Coptic version translate the name as &quot;savior of the world&quot;. Yosef as the vice-king plays out two critically important roles of leadership; he actively deals with matters of state along with matters of economics (ibid. 42:6). On the one hand, Yosef is personally living out his own dreams of Parshat Vayeshev 37:7-9 - that of a being a provider linked with that of being a ruler.  Yosef remembers the dreams and recognizes their long-range significance.

Watch your step!
&quot;And Pharaoh said to Yosef, `Behold ­ I have placed you over all Egypt.'&quot; (41:41)
Commentators say that Pharaoh was cautioning Yosef, as if to say &quot;See and consider well. Make sure that you conduct your affairs so that they reach their proper conclusion.  For I have placed a great matter in your hands.&quot;
Why was it necessary for Pharaoh to caution Yosef in this manner?  Pharaoh had already recognized that Yosef was a man of God, unparalleled in wisdom and perception.  Surely, such a person can be relied upon to do everything necessary to avoid disaster and rescue the world from hunger.  And yet,  Pharaoh did caution him.  Could it be that even Yosef, a man of Elohim who was fully aware that even the slightest error may bring disaster ­ even such a man must check his every action with Yahweh, his God and Father, to avoid a false move that could be out of his will and thus devastating to those Yahweh is trying to bless?

The example of Yosef is summed up in the words of Paul written to believing Jews and Gentiles in first century Rome: &quot;Furthermore, we know that God causes everything to work together for the good of those who love God and are called in accordance with his purpose; ... What, then, are we to say to these things? If God is for us, who can be against us? &quot; Rom. 8:28, 31 Surely these words by Paul must be significant in the days we face ahead and our future ability to trust in Yahweh and endure to the end.  Let us not forget these essential words of encouragement.  And may the words of John ring in our ears &quot;He who is in you is greater than he who is in the world.&quot;   1 John  4:4

Yosef has been raised by Yahweh from the pit from which he was sold into slavery to be second only to Pharaoh in a period of 13 years. Yahweh has prepared him for this great responsibility which begins at age 30.   This is a significant age in the Israelite society for it is the time when a man is sufficiently mature to undertake his life's work. Yeshua began his ministry at age 30.

The Unfolding Drama
The brothers come to Egypt for food and bow before him (42:6).  This was part of Yosef's dream which was fulfilled when all the family came down and bowed before him.  He begins to implement a plan to test his brothers and assess the situation, and determine how he is to work toward the fulfilment of the prophetic dream.

He enquires as to the welfare of his father and tries to determine if Benjamin is still with the family.  He makes accusations against them which requires them to bring Benjamin down next time they come for food. Their reaction was,  &quot;'We are most assuredly guilty concerning our brother, in that we saw the distress of his soul, when he begged us, and we wouldn't listen. Therefore this distress has come on us.'&quot;(42:21 HNV) 

Their conscience was being activated.  Now they were in a similar situation again, and had the chance to make restitution by not abandoning Rachel's other child Benjamin or deceiving their father this time. Then he returns their money into their sacks unknown to them at the time, and they return home.

In ancient times, every country would put its own insignia on its currency and the value was based on the weight of the gold and the silver. From many lands people came to Egypt to purchase food. The Egyptians would weigh the currency and sell to them accordingly. The brothers related that when they opened their sacks, they found money, &quot;Bemishkalo&quot; - which weighed exactly the same as the money they had given for their purchase. However, the emblems engraved on the coins were not the same because, &quot;We brought other coins with different emblems when we came to buy food. Therefore, we are puzzled and do not know who put silver of the same weight as our money in our sacks.&quot;   This would have had deep significance as it meant that someone had exchanged the money to the same value they had brought.

An ingenious plan unfolds as Yosef controls the situation to have Benjamin come down to Egypt and then uses him for the ultimate test on his brothers.  Yosef invites them as guests for lunch sitting them in order of birth and so begins the penetration of their consciences for the final act.   The major problem between the brothers and Yosef was jealousy.  Due to their jealousy of his aspirations to rise above them, they went as far as selling him as a slave. When the brothers were invited to a meal in Yosef's house, Yosef put them to a test to see if they had overcome this negative trait.  He gave Binyamin five times as many presents and food as he gave them, and waited to see how they would react.  

In Benjamin’s sack he has placed his own personal silver goblet.  They depart for Canaan but are stopped and searched.  The brothers are bewildered when the goblet is found in Benjamin’s sack.  They are escorted back to Yosef, who orders the guilty one, Benjamin, to be kept as a slave while the rest are to be set free.  The brothers would be put to the test so Yosef could see if they had changed since they turned on him and sold him into slavery (44:8-17).  
  
Yosef is overcome with emotion during these encounters with his brothers and evidences deep feelings for them.  These insights into the heart of Yosef are indications of his deep love for the Creator as well as the passion he has for his family.  In all his dealings with them, it is obvious that his heart is toward Yahweh to fulfill His purposes.

The Final Scene
Yehudah offers to be a guarantor for Benjamin to his father.   He uses two legal terms  to indicate what he was willing to be for Benjamin to his father if something happens to him.   The first term 'surety' is saying that he offers to repay the loan should the borrower default, and secondly the term 'require'  is to be held responsible for,  or accountable for.
So Yehudah is putting himself in a position to be held accountable for whatever happens to Benjamin,  promising to restore whatever loss to his father will be involved in taking him.   Genesis 43
Obviously Ya'acov must have deep trust in Yehudah to finally allow him to take Benjamin back with him.

Judah (Yehudah) and the brothers, including Binyamin, return to Egypt where they are received by the &quot;junior&quot; Pharaoh, Yosef.  After inquiring about his father's welfare, Yosef treats the brothers lavishly as honored guests.  He sets places at the dining table for them in the order of their birth and feeds them from his table, giving Binyamin five times as much as the others to see if the brothers become jealous over this preferential treatment of him.  The brothers are amazed by these actions but they do not react negatively.
However, when Yosef finally sees his youngest brother, Binyamin, he can barely control his emotions.  He rushes out of the room and weeps.   After selling more grain to the family, Yosef secretly instructs his servants to again replace the money in the sacks of each man, and in addition, to put his goblet inside Binyamin's sack.  

When the goblet is discovered and the family is returned to his presence, Yosef accuses them of being thieves and demands that Binyamin become his slave as a punishment.  So, like a good serial drama, the Parsha ends on a cliffhanger note. Yosef is setting a stage to see how will the brothers will react with of another of his mother's sons being taken from the family.

      <text xml:space="preserve">A covenant is a legally binding agreement between the two parties used in the Bible as a metaphor to describe the relationship between God and His people. It was practiced in the most ancient cultures which indicates that the concept of covenants began in Genesis 3 after the fall of man with the promise of a Redeemer.

In the form it was made in ancient cultures between men, it was a binding and solemn agreement between two or more parties. There were different kinds of covenants in the biblical world, and one of those types of covenants, the &quot;royal grant&quot;, was similar to the Biblical covenants where God, the superior party binds Himself to be the beneficiary as an inferior party with no set conditions imposed upon him. In this type of &quot;royal grant&quot; covenant, a king or other person in authority rewards a loyal subject by granting him an office, land, exemption from taxes, or similar. 

Such covenants are also referred to as covenants of promise or unconditional covenants. The covenants God made with Noah (Genesis 9:8 - 17), Abraham (Genesis 15:18), and David (2 Samuel 7; 23:5) fit this pattern. In each of these cases, it is God alone who binds himself by a solemn oath to keep the covenant.

The Mosaic covenant (Ex. 19 - 24; Deuteronomy; Joshua 24) is like another type of ancient covenant, the &quot;political treaty&quot; between a powerful king and his weaker vassal. Following the standard form of such treaties, God, the suzerain, reminds Israel, the vassal, how God has saved it, and Israel in response accepts the covenant stipulations. Israel is promised a blessing for obedience and a curse for breaking the covenant.

These two different conceptions of covenant, one stressing promise, the other obligation, eventually modified one another. 

The Covenant which Yeshua instituted with Israel is a culmination and inclusion of all the other covenants in a renewed form in which all the promises are made available in the Messiah through the power of God and man is the recipient of these benefits.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==  Local gauge symmetry. Gauge theories. Non-Abelian gauge theories. ==

== Spontaneous symmetry breaking. Goldstone theorem. Higgs mechanism. ==

The '''Higgs mechanism''' is a theoretical framework which concerns the origin mass of elementary particles; technically it yields the only consistent explanation, how the masses of the W and Z bosons arise through spontaneous electroweak symmetry breaking. More generally, the Higgs mechanism is the way that the [[gauge bosons]] in any [[gauge theory]] get a nonzero mass.

Also for other particles, e.g. for fermions, a Higgs mechanism can explain the masses, again in a gauge invariant way.

The simplest realization of the Higgs mechanism in the standard model requires an extra Higgs field which interacts with the gauge fields, and which has a nonzero value in its lowest energy state, a vacuum expectation value. This means that all of space is filled with the background Higgs field, the so-called Higgs condensate. Interaction with this background field changes the low-energy spectrum of the gauge fields and the gauge bosons become massive.

The Higgs field has a non-trivial self-interaction, like the Mexican hat potential, which leads to spontaneous symmetry breaking: in the lowest energy state the symmetry of the potential (which includes the gauge symmetry) is broken by the condensate. Analysis of small fluctuations of the fields near the minimum reveals that the gauge bosons and other particles become massive.  In the standard model, the Higgs field is an SU(2) doublet, a complex spinor with four real components, which is charged under the standard model U(1).  After symmetry breaking, three of the four degrees of freedom in the Higgs field mix with the W and Z bosons, while the one remaining degree of freedom becomes the Higgs boson – a new scalar particle.

=== Goldstone Bosons ===

The problem with spontaneous symmetry breaking models in particle physics is that, according to Goldstone's theorem, they come with massless scalar particles. If a symmetry is broken by a condensate, acting with a symmetry generator on the condensate gives a second state with the same energy. So certain oscillations do not have any energy, and the particles associated with these oscillations have zero mass.

In the standard model, at temperatures high enough so that the symmetry is unbroken, all elementary particles except the scalar Higgs boson are massless. At a critical temperature, the Higgs field spontaneously slides from the point of maximum energy in a randomly chosen direction. Once the symmetry is broken, the gauge boson particles, such as the W bosons and Z boson, acquire masses. The mass can be interpreted as the result of the interactions of the particles with the &quot;Higgs ocean&quot;.

Fermions, such as the leptons and quarks in the Standard Model, acquire mass as a result of their interaction with the Higgs field, but not in the same way as the gauge bosons.

=== Superconductivity ===

The Higgs mechanism can be considered as the superconductivity in the vacuum. It occurs when all of space is filled with a sea of particles which are charged, or in field language, when a charged field has a nonzero vacuum expectation value. Interaction with the quantum fluid filling the space prevents certain forces from propagating over long distances.

A superconductor expels all magnetic fields from its interior, a phenomenon known as the Meissner effect. This was mysterious for a long time, because it implies that electromagnetic forces somehow become short-range inside the superconductor. Contrast this with the behavior of an ordinary metal. In a metal, the conductivity shields electric fields by rearranging charges on the surface until the total field cancels in the interior. But magnetic fields can penetrate to any distance, and if a magnetic monopole (an isolated magnetic pole) is surrounded by a metal the field can escape without collimating into a string. In a superconductor, however, electric charges move with no dissipation, and this allows for permanent surface currents, not just surface charges. When magnetic fields are introduced at the boundary of a superconductor, they produce surface currents which exactly neutralize them.  The Meissner effect is due to currents in a thin surface layer, whose thickness, the London penetration depth, can be calculated from a simple model.

This simple model, due to Lev Landau and Vitaly Ginzburg, treats superconductivity as a charged Bose–Einstein condensate. Suppose that a superconductor contains bosons with charge &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt;. The wavefunction of the bosons can be described by introducing a quantum field, &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt;, which obeys the Schrödinger equation as a field equation (in units where &lt;math&gt;\hbar&lt;/math&gt;, the Planck quantum divided by &lt;math&gt;2\pi&lt;/math&gt;, is replaced by 1):
:&lt;math&gt;
i{\partial \over \partial t} \psi = {(\nabla - iqA)^2 \over 2m} \psi
\,&lt;/math&gt;

The operator &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt; annihilates a boson at the point &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, while its adjoint &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \psi^\dagger&lt;/math&gt; creates a new boson at the same point. The wavefunction of the Bose–Einstein condensate is then the expectation value &lt;math&gt;\Psi&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\psi(x)&lt;/math&gt;, which is a classical function that obeys the same equation. The interpretation of the expectation value is that it is the phase that one should give to a newly created boson so that it will coherently superpose with all the other bosons already in the condensate.

When there is a charged condensate, the electromagnetic interactions are screened. To see this, consider the effect of a gauge transformation on the field. A gauge transformation rotates the phase of the condensate by an amount which changes from point to point, and shifts the vector potential by a gradient.

:&lt;math&gt;
\psi \rightarrow e^{iq\phi(x)} \psi
\,&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;
A \rightarrow A + \nabla \phi
\,&lt;/math&gt;

When there is no condensate, this transformation only changes the definition of the phase of &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; at every point. But when there is a condensate, the phase of the condensate defines a preferred choice of phase.

The condensate wavefunction can be written as
:&lt;math&gt;
\psi(x) = \rho(x)\, e^{i\theta(x)},
\,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is real amplitude, which determines the local density of the condensate. If the condensate were neutral, the flow would be along the gradients of &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;, the direction in which the phase of the Schrödinger field changes. If the phase &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; changes slowly, the flow is slow and has very little energy. But now &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; can be made equal to zero just by making a gauge transformation to rotate the phase of the field.

The energy of slow changes of phase can be calculated from the Schrödinger kinetic energy,

:&lt;math&gt;
H= {1\over 2m} |{(qA+\nabla )\psi|^2},
\,&lt;/math&gt;

and taking the density of the condensate &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; to be constant,

:&lt;math&gt;
H\approx {\rho^2 \over 2m} (qA+ \nabla \theta)^2.
\,&lt;/math&gt;

Fixing the choice of gauge so that the condensate has the same phase everywhere, the electromagnetic field energy has an extra term,

:&lt;math&gt;
{q^2 \rho^2 \over 2m} A^2.
\,&lt;/math&gt;

When this term is present, electromagnetic interactions become short-ranged. Every field mode, no matter how long the wavelength, oscillates with a nonzero frequency. The lowest frequency can be read off from the energy of a long wavelength A mode,

:&lt;math&gt;
E\approx {{\dot A}^2\over 2} + {q^2 \rho^2 \over 2m} A^2.
\,&lt;/math&gt;

This is a harmonic oscillator with frequency &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \sqrt{q^2 \rho^2/m}&lt;/math&gt;. The quantity &lt;math&gt;|\psi|^2&lt;/math&gt; (=&lt;math&gt;\rho^2&lt;/math&gt;) is the density of the condensate of superconducting particles.

In an actual superconductor, the charged particles are electrons, which are fermions not bosons. So in order to have superconductivity, the electrons need to somehow bind into Cooper pairs. The charge of the condensate &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; is therefore twice the electron charge &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;. The pairing in a normal superconductor is due to lattice vibrations, and is in fact very weak; this means that the pairs are very loosely bound. The description of a Bose–Einstein condensate of loosely bound pairs is actually more difficult than the description of a condensate of elementary particles, and was only worked out in 1957 by Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer in the famous BCS theory.

=== Abelian Higgs model ===

In a relativistic gauge theory, the vector bosons are natively massless, like the photon, leading to long-range forces. This is fine for electromagnetism, where the force is actually long-range, but it means that the description of short-range weak forces by a gauge theory requires a modification.

Gauge invariance means that certain transformations of the gauge field do not change the energy at all. If an arbitrary gradient is added to A, the energy of the field is exactly the same. This makes it difficult to add a mass term, because a mass term tends to push the field toward the value zero. But the zero value of the vector potential is not a gauge invariant idea. What is zero in one gauge is nonzero in another.

So in order to give mass to a gauge theory, the gauge invariance must be broken by a condensate. The condensate will then define a preferred phase, and the phase of the condensate will define the zero value of the field in a gauge invariant way. The gauge invariant definition is that a gauge field is zero when the phase change along any path from parallel transport is equal to the phase difference in the condensate wavefunction.

The condensate value is described by a quantum field with an expectation value, just as in the Landau–Ginzburg model. To make sure that the condensate value of the field does not pick out a preferred direction in space-time, it must be a scalar field. In order for the phase of the condensate to define a gauge, the field must be charged.

In order for a scalar field &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; to be charged, it must be complex. Equivalently, it should contain two fields with a symmetry which rotates them into each other, the real and imaginary parts. The vector potential changes the phase of the quanta produced by the field when they move from point to point. In terms of fields, it defines how much to rotate the real and imaginary parts of the fields into each other when comparing field values at nearby points.

The only renormalizable model where a complex scalar field Φ acquires a nonzero value is the Mexican-hat model, where the field energy has a minimum away from zero.
:&lt;math&gt;
S(\phi ) = \int {1\over 2} |\partial \phi|^2 - \lambda\cdot (|\phi|^2 - \Phi^2)^2 
&lt;/math&gt;

This defines the following Hamiltonian:
:&lt;math&gt;
H(\phi ) = {1\over 2} |\dot\phi|^2 + |\nabla \phi|^2 + V(|\phi|)
&lt;/math&gt;

The first term is the kinetic energy of the field. The second term is the extra potential energy when the field varies from point to point. The third term is the potential energy when the field has any given magnitude.

This potential energy &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle V(z,\Phi)= \lambda\cdot ( |z|^2 - \Phi^2)^2\,&lt;/math&gt; has a graph which looks like a Mexican hat, which gives the model its name. In particular, the minimum energy value is not at ''z=0'', but on the circle of points where the magnitude of ''z'' is &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:Mecanismo de Higgs PH.png|thumb|Higgs potential V. For a fixed value of &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; the potential is presented against the real and imaginary parts of &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;. The ''Mexican-hat'' or ''champagne-bottle profile'' at the ground should be noted.]]

When the field &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;(x) is not coupled to electromagnetism, the Mexican-hat potential has flat directions. Starting in any one of the circle of vacua and changing the phase of the field from point to point costs very little energy. Mathematically, if
:&lt;math&gt;
\phi(x) = \Phi e^{i\theta(x)}
\,,&lt;/math&gt;
with a constant prefactor, then the action for the field &lt;math&gt;\theta (x)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., the &quot;phase&quot; of the Higgs field Φ(x), has only derivative terms. This is not a surprise. Adding a constant to &lt;math&gt;\theta (x)&lt;/math&gt; is a symmetry of the original theory, so different values of &lt;math&gt;\theta (x)&lt;/math&gt; cannot have different energies. This is an example of Goldstone's theorem: spontaneously broken continuous symmetries lead to massless particles. 

The Abelian Higgs model is the Mexican-hat model coupled to electromagnetism:

:&lt;math&gt;
S(\phi ,A) = \int {1\over 4} F^{\mu\nu} F_{\mu\nu} + |(\partial - i q A)\phi|^2 + \lambda\cdot (|\phi|^2 - \Phi^2)^2.
&lt;/math&gt;

The classical vacuum is again at the minimum of the potential, where the magnitude of the complex field &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is equal to &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt;. But now the phase of the field is arbitrary, because gauge transformations change it. This means that the field &lt;math&gt;\theta (x)&lt;/math&gt; can be set to zero by a gauge transformation, and does not represent any degrees of freedom at all.

Furthermore, choosing a gauge where the phase of the condensate is fixed, the potential energy for fluctuations of the vector field is nonzero, just as it is in the Landau–Ginzburg model. So in the abelian Higgs model, the gauge field acquires a mass. To calculate the magnitude of the mass, consider a constant value of the vector potential A in the x direction in the gauge where the condensate has constant phase. This is the same as a sinusoidally varying condensate in the gauge where the vector potential is zero. In the gauge where A is zero, the potential energy density in the condensate is the scalar gradient energy:
:&lt;math&gt;
E = {1\over 2}|\partial (\Phi e^{iqAx})|^2 = {1\over 2} q^2\Phi^2 A^2
&lt;/math&gt;

And this energy is the same as a mass term &lt;math&gt; m^2 A^2/2&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;m=q\Phi&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Nonabelian Higgs mechanism ===

The Nonabelian Higgs model has the following action:
:&lt;math&gt;
S(\phi ,\mathbf A) = \int {1\over 4g^2} \mathop{\textrm{tr}}(F^{\mu\nu}F_{\mu\nu}) + |D\phi|^2 + V(|\phi|)\,,
&lt;/math&gt;

where now the nonabelian field &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A&lt;/math&gt; is contained in ''D'' and in the tensor components &lt;math&gt;F^{\mu \nu}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;F_{\mu \nu}&lt;/math&gt; (the relation between &lt;math&gt;\mathbf A&lt;/math&gt; and those components is well-known from the Yang–Mills theory).

It is exactly analogous to the Abelian Higgs model. Now the field &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is in a representation of the gauge group, and the gauge covariant derivative is defined by the rate of change of the field minus the rate of change from parallel transport using the gauge field A as a connection.

:&lt;math&gt;
D\phi = \partial \phi - i A^k t_k \phi
\,&lt;/math&gt;

Again, the expectation value of Φ defines a preferred gauge where the condensate is constant, and fixing this gauge, fluctuations in the gauge field A come with a nonzero energy cost.

Depending on the representation of the scalar field, not every gauge field acquires a mass. A simple example is in the renormalizable version of an early electroweak model due to Julian Schwinger. In this model, the gauge group is SO(3) (or SU(2)--- there are no spinor representations in the model), and the gauge invariance is broken down to U(1) or SO(2) at long distances. To make a consistent renormalizable version using the Higgs mechanism, introduce a scalar field &lt;math&gt;\phi^a&lt;/math&gt; which transforms as a vector (a triplet) of SO(3). If this field has a vacuum expectation value, it points in some direction in field space. Without loss of generality, one can choose the z-axis in field space to be the direction that &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is pointing, and then the vacuum expectation value of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;(0,0,A)&lt;/math&gt;, where A is a constant with dimensions of mass (&lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle c=\hbar=1&lt;/math&gt;).

Rotations around the z axis form a U(1) subgroup of SO(3) which preserves the vacuum expectation value of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, and this is the unbroken gauge group. Rotations around the x and y axis do not preserve the vacuum, and the components of the SO(3) gauge field which generate these rotations become massive vector mesons. There are two massive W mesons in the Schwinger model, with a mass set by the mass scale A, and one massless U(1) gauge boson, similar to the photon.

The Schwinger model predicts magnetic monopoles at the electroweak unification scale, and does not predict the Z meson. It doesn't break electroweak symmetry properly as in nature. But historically, a model similar to this (but not using the Higgs mechanism) was the first in which the weak force and the electromagnetic force were unified.

=== Standard model Higgs mechanism ===

The gauge group of the electroweak part of the standard model is &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{SU}(2)\times \mathrm{U}(1)&lt;/math&gt;. The Higgs mechanism is by a scalar field which is a weak SU(2) doublet with weak hypercharge −1, it has four real components or two complex components, and it transforms as a spinor under SU(2) and gets multiplied by a phase under U(1) rotations. Note that this is not the same as two complex spinors which mix under U(1), which would have eight real components, rather this is the spinor representation of the group U(2)--- multiplying by a phase mixes the real and imaginary part of the complex spinor into each other.

The group SU(2) is all unitary matrices, all the orthonormal changes of coordinates in a complex two dimensional vector space. Rotating the coordinates so that the first basis vector in the direction of &lt;math&gt; H &lt;/math&gt; makes the vacuum expection value of H the spinor &lt;math&gt;(A,0)&lt;/math&gt;. The generators for rotations about the x,y,z axes are by half the Pauli matrices &lt;math&gt;\sigma_x,\sigma_y,\sigma_z&lt;/math&gt;, so that a rotation of angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; about the z axis takes the vacuum to:

::&lt;math&gt; (A e^{i\theta/2},0)\,&lt;/math&gt;

While the X and Y generators mix up the top and bottom components, the Z rotations only multiply by a phase. This phase can be undone by a U(1) rotation of angle &lt;math&gt;\theta/2&lt;/math&gt;, which multiplies by the opposite phase, since the Higgs has charge −1. Under both an SU(2) z-rotation and a U(1) rotation by an amount &lt;math&gt;\theta/2&lt;/math&gt;, the vacuum is invariant. This combination of generators:

::&lt;math&gt; Q = W_z + {Y/2} \,&lt;/math&gt;

defines the unbroken gauge group, where &lt;math&gt;W_z&lt;/math&gt; is the generator of rotations around the z-axis in the SU(2) and Y is the generator of the U(1). This combination of generators--- perform a z rotation in the SU(2) and simultaneously perform a U(1) rotation by half the angle--- preserves the vacuum, and defines the unbroken gauge group in the standard model. The part of the gauge field in this direction stays massless, and this gauge field is the actual photon.

The phase that a field acquires under this combination of generators is its electric charge, and this is the formula for the electric charge in the standard model. In this convention, all the Y charges in the standard model are multiples of &lt;math&gt;1/3&lt;/math&gt;. To make all the Y-charges in the standard model integers, you can rescale the Y part of the formula by tripling all the Y-charges if you like, and rewrite the charge formula as &lt;math&gt;Q = W_z + Y/6&lt;/math&gt;, but the normalization with Y/2 is the universal standard.

=== Affine Higgs mechanism ===

Ernst Stueckelberg discovered a version of the Higgs mechanism by analyzing the theory of quantum electrodynamics with a massive photon. Stueckelberg's model is a limit of the regular Mexican hat Abelian Higgs model, where the vacuum expectation value H goes to infinity and the charge of the Higgs field goes to zero in such a way that their product stays fixed. The mass of the Higgs boson is proportional to ''H'', so the Higgs boson becomes infinitely massive and disappears. The vector meson mass is equal to the product &lt;math&gt;eH&lt;/math&gt;, and stays finite.

The interpretation is that when a U(1) gauge field does not require quantized charges, it is possible to keep only the angular part of the Higgs oscillations, and discard the radial part. The angular part of the Higgs field &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; has the following gauge transformation law:

::&lt;math&gt; \theta + e\alpha\,&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; A \rightarrow A + \alpha \,&lt;/math&gt;

The gauge covariant derivative for the angle (which is actually gauge invariant) is:

::&lt;math&gt; D\theta = \partial \theta - e A\,&lt;/math&gt;

In order to keep &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; fluctuations finite and nonzero in this limit, &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; should be rescaled by H, so that its kinetic term in the action stays normalized. The action for the theta field is read off from the Mexican hat action by substituting &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \phi = He^{i\theta/H}&lt;/math&gt;.

::&lt;math&gt; S = \int {1\over 4}F^2 + {1\over 2}(D\theta)^2 = \int {1\over 4}F^2 + {1\over 2}(\partial \theta - He A)^2 = \int {1\over 4}F^2 + {1\over 2}(\partial \theta - m A)^2 &lt;/math&gt;
since &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle eH&lt;/math&gt; is the gauge boson mass. By making a gauge transformation to set &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \theta=0&lt;/math&gt;, the gauge freedom in the action is eliminated, and the action becomes that of a massive vector field:

::&lt;math&gt; S= \int {1\over 4} F^2 + {m^2\over 2} A^2\,&lt;/math&gt;

To have arbitrarily small charges requires that the U(1) is not the circle of unit complex numbers under multiplication, but the real numbers R under addition, which is only different in the global topology. Such a U(1) group is ''non-compact''. The field &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt; transforms as an affine representation of the gauge group. Among the allowed gauge groups, only non-compact U(1) admits affine representations, and the U(1) of electromagnetism is experimentally known to be compact, since charge quantization holds to extremely high accuracy.

The Higgs condensate in this model has infinitesimal charge, so interactions with the Higgs boson do not violate charge conservation. The theory of quantum electrodynamics with a massive photon is still a renormalizable theory, one in which electric charge is still conserved, but magnetic monopoles are not allowed. For nonabelian gauge theory, there is no affine limit, and the Higgs oscillations cannot be too much more massive than the vectors.

===Further consequences, e.g. for fermions===
In spite of the introduction of spontaneous symmetry-breaking, also for fermions the mass terms  oppose the gauge invariance. Therefore, also for these fields the mass terms should be replaced by a  gauge-invariant &quot;Higgs&quot; mechanism. An obvious possibility is some kind of &quot;Yukawa coupling&quot; (see below) between the fermion field ''&amp;psi;'' and the Higgs field ''&amp;Phi;'', with unknown  couplings ''&lt;math&gt;G_{\psi}&lt;/math&gt;'', which after symmetry-breaking (more precisely: after expansion of the Lagrange density around a suitable ground state) again results in the original mass terms, which are now, however (i.e. by introduction of the Higgs field)  written in a gauge-invariant way. The  Lagrange density for the &quot;Yukawa&quot;-interaction  of  a fermion field &amp;psi;'' and the Higgs field &amp;Phi;'' is
:&lt;math&gt; \mathcal{L}_{\mathrm{Fermion}}(\phi , A, \psi ) = \overline{\psi} \gamma^{\mu} D_{\mu} \psi + G_{\psi} \overline{\psi} \phi \psi \,,&lt;/math&gt;
where again the gauge field ''A'' only enters &lt;math&gt;D_\mu&lt;/matH&gt; (i.e., it is only indirectly visible). The quantities ''&lt;math&gt;\gamma^{\mu}&lt;/math&gt;'' are the Dirac matrices, and &lt;math&gt;G_{\psi}&lt;/math&gt; is the already-mentioned &quot;Yukawa&quot;-coupling parameter. Already now the mass-generation follows the same principle as above, namely from the existence of a finite expectation value &lt;math&gt;|\langle\phi\rangle |&lt;/math&gt;, as descibed above. Again, this is crucial for the existence of the property &quot;mass&quot;.

=== Real and complex scalar fields. Klein-Gordon equation. Plane-wave (normal mode) solutions. Generation and anihilation operators. Hamiltonian. Commutation relations. ===

=== Real and complex scalar fields. ===

The equations of motion for a real scalar field &lt;math&gt; \phi &lt;/math&gt; can be obtained from the following lagrangian densities

&lt;math&gt; \begin{matrix} \mathcal{L}&amp; = &amp; \frac{1}{2}\partial_{\mu} \phi \partial^{\mu}\phi - \frac{1}{2} M^2 \phi^2\\ &amp; = &amp; -\frac{1}{2} \phi \left( \partial_{\mu} \partial^{\mu} + M^2  \right)\phi \end{matrix}  &lt;/math&gt;

and the result is
&lt;math&gt;\left( \Box+M^2 \right)\phi(x)=0 &lt;/math&gt;.

The complex scalar field &lt;math&gt; \phi &lt;/math&gt; can be considered as a sum of two scalar fields: &lt;math&gt; \phi_1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \phi_2 &lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt; \phi=\left(\phi_1+i\phi_2\right)/ \sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;

The Langrangian density of a complex scalar field is

&lt;math&gt;  \mathcal{L} =  (\partial_{\mu} \phi)^+ \partial^{\mu}\phi  - M^2 \phi^+ \phi   &lt;/math&gt;

=== Klein-Gordon equation ===
Klein-Gordon equation is precisely the equation of motion for the spin-0 particle as derived above:
&lt;math&gt;\left( \Box+M^2 \right)\phi(x)=0 &lt;/math&gt;

== Spin 1/2 field ==

=== Dirac equation ===
The Dirac equation is given by:

&lt;math&gt;\left(i\gamma^\mu\partial_\mu - m\right)\psi\left(x\right) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\psi&lt;/math&gt; is a four-dimensional Dirac spinor.  The &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; matrices obey the following anticommutation relation (known as the Dirac algebra):

&lt;math&gt;\left\{\gamma^\mu,\gamma^\nu\right\}\equiv\gamma^\mu\gamma^\nu+\gamma^\nu\gamma^\mu = 2g^{\mu\nu}\times 1_{n\times n}&lt;/math&gt;

Notice that the Dirac algebra does not define a priori how many dimensions the matrices should be.  For a four-dimensional Minkowski space, however, it turns out that the matrices have to be at least &lt;math&gt;4\times 4&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Special relativity ==
Special relativity was proposed by Albert Einstein in the beginning of the 20th century. The Special Theory of Relativity is a sucessor of Classical Mechanics, which is based on Newtonian mechanics, which was developed by Isaac Newton (as the name suggests). Classical mechanics is valid to a good accuracy in day-to-day phenomena involving speeds much less than the speed of light. However, at speeds comparable to the speed of light, classical mechanics breaks down. 
Classical mechanics is mainly based on invariance under Galilean transformations. This tells us how a phenomenon oberseved in one reference frame &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; would appear in another reference frame &lt;math&gt;S^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt; which has a different velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; relative to the original reference frame &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;. According to the Galilean transformation, the coordinates transform as follows:

&lt;math&gt;
x^{\prime}=x-vt
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
t^{\prime}=t
&lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, the special theory of relativity is based on invariance under the Lorentz transformation,

&lt;math&gt;
x^{\prime}=\gamma(x-vt)
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
t^{\prime}=\gamma(t-vx/c^{2})
&lt;/math&gt; 
where &lt;math&gt;\gamma=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^{2}}{c^{2}}}}&lt;/math&gt;
Here, it is assumed that the reference frame &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; had a velocity with respect to &lt;math&gt;S^{\prime}&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; direction.

Note that under the Lorentz transformation, the interval &lt;math&gt;ds^{2}=dt^{2}-dx^{2}-dy^{2}-dz^{2}&lt;/math&gt; remains unchanged. Or, in other words, the interval transforms like a scalar under the Lorentz transformation. The time and space coordinates together form a four vector &lt;math&gt;x^{\mu}=(t,\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;. Any quantity which transforms like the space-time coordinates under Lorentz transformation is defined as a four-vector. An example of a four-vector other than &lt;math&gt;x^{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; itself is the energy-momentum or the momentum four vector &lt;math&gt;p^{\mu}=(E,\mathbf{p})&lt;/math&gt;. The dual of a fourvector &lt;math&gt;x^{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; is denoted by &lt;math&gt;x_{\mu}&lt;/math&gt;. The dual vector &lt;math&gt;x_{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; is related to &lt;math&gt;x^{\mu}&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;x_{\mu}=(t,-\mathbf{x})&lt;/math&gt;. A product of a vector with a dual vector transforms like a scalar. Such a product is called as the inner product.

== Variational principle ==

=== Action and Lagrangian ===
In classical mechanics, the action &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; and the Lagrangian &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; are related as follows:

&lt;math&gt;S = \int L \, d t&lt;/math&gt;

These two quantities are defined similarly in quantum field theory.  However, in quantum field theory it is often convenient to introduce a Lagrangian density &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt;.  Hence the action can also be defined as:

&lt;math&gt;S = \int\mathcal{L}\, d^4 x&lt;/math&gt;

=== Variational principle ===
One of the most important principles
in physics which is also often called &quot;Stationary Action Principle&quot; or
&quot;Least Action Principle&quot;. Can be formulated in several ways:

&lt;ol&gt;

&lt;li&gt; Of all possible fields with a given boundary condition the one
that provides an extremum (often minimum, cf. Least
Action) of the action is The Solution.

&lt;li&gt; The field for which the variation of the action vanishes is The
Solution.

&lt;/ol&gt;

In other words if &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is The Solution and we add an arbitrary small
variation &lt;math&gt;\delta\phi&lt;/math&gt; to it then the (linear part of the) variation of
the action &lt;math&gt;\delta S(\phi)\equiv S(\phi+\delta\phi)-S(\phi)&lt;/math&gt; vanishes,
&lt;math&gt;\delta S(\phi)=0&lt;/math&gt;.

Note that the variation &lt;math&gt;\delta\phi&lt;/math&gt; must not change the boundary
condition of &lt;math&gt;\phi+\delta\phi&lt;/math&gt; and must therefore vanish at the boundary.

Note also that the action must be real (just to talk about minima) and
must be a 4-scalar (Lorentz invariant).

=== Euler-Lagrange equation ===
In classical mechanics, the Lagrangian &lt;math&gt;L&lt;/math&gt; is a function of the canonical coordinates &lt;math&gt;q&lt;/math&gt; and the canonical momenta &lt;math&gt;\dot{q}&lt;/math&gt;.  The Euler-Lagrange Equation is as follows:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\frac{\partial L}{\partial\dot{q}}-\frac{\partial L}{\partial q} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

In quantum field theory, however, the two variables of the Lagrangian are the fields and the corresponding derivatives &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\partial_{\mu}\phi&lt;/math&gt;.  Furthermore, quantum field theory treats time and spatial derivatives at equal footing.  Thus, the Euler-Lagrange Equation reads:

&lt;math&gt;\partial_{\mu}\left(\frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\left(\partial_{\mu}\phi\right)}\right) - \frac{\partial\mathcal{L}}{\partial\phi} = 0&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; is the Lagrangian density.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Information is a communication term used to describe any of the following entities
* Audible Sound in the frequency range of 2kHz - 20 kHz . Example human animal sound
* Audible Voice in the frequency range of 3kHz - 30 MHz . Example human speech conversation
* Video in the frequency range of 30Hz - 30 GHz . Example Tivi motion picture
* Data in the frequency range of 2kHz - 20 kHz . Example Computer data

==Information Processing==
Information exists in many wave forms generate from different sources. Before information can be processed by electronic devices information needs to be converted to electronic waves forming a signal. Then signals can be processed by electronic devices to amplify the signal, with the volume controlled by adjusting the amplitude of the signal.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Waves==
Waves are disturbances travelling in a medium . Wave is a periodic oscillation travels through medium at Speed v and carries an energy E
: &lt;math&gt;v = \lambda f&lt;/math&gt;

Waves are divided in two types of waves . Waves that have the direction of oscillation the same as the direction of travel are called [[/Transverse Waves/]].  Waves that have the direction of oscillation perpendicular to the direction of the travel are called [[/Longitudinal Waves/]].

==Wave Characteristics==
: [[Image:Wave_characteristics.svg|350px|]]

* Wavelength
: Wavelength is defined as distance between two peaks of the wave 
: λ = 2π  

* Speed
: &lt;math&gt;v = \frac{2 \pi}{t} = \lambda f&lt;/math&gt; 

* Angular of Speed
: &lt;math&gt;\omega = 2 \pi f &lt;/math&gt; 

* Frequency of Time
: &lt;math&gt;f = \frac{1}{t}&lt;/math&gt; 

* Amplitude
: &lt;math&gt;F(t,\theta) = 0&lt;/math&gt;  at &lt;math&gt;\theta = n \pi&lt;/math&gt; . Amplitude of the wave equals to zero at angle of nπ 
: &lt;math&gt;F(t,\theta) = R&lt;/math&gt;  at &lt;math&gt;\theta = (2n+1) \frac{\pi}{2}&lt;/math&gt;. Amplitude of the wave equals to the peak value at angle of (2n+1)π/2

* Wave's Function
: &lt;math&gt;A(t,\theta) = A Sin (\omega t + \theta) &lt;/math&gt;

==Wave's Equation==
Every wave can be expressed by a derivative equation . The simplest form of a wave's oscillation travels in direction x in time t
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{v^2}\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial t^2}=\frac{\partial^2 y}{\partial x^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

''v'' is the speed of wave travelling . Root of the wave's equation is solved by Jean le Rond d'Alembert :

:&lt;math&gt;y(x,t)= F(x-vt)+ E(x+vt)&lt;/math&gt; 

Can be described as the sum of periodic waves
:&lt;math&gt;y(x,t)=A(x,t) \cos (\omega t - kx + \varphi),\,&lt;/math&gt;

::''A''(''x'', ''t'') is the amplitude of the wave, 
:: &amp;omega; Angular Velocity 
::''k'' Wave's Number
:: &amp;phi; Angle . 

If Amplitude does not depend on time is called Standing Wave
:&lt;math&gt;A(x,t) = A(x)&lt;/math&gt;


==Wave's Examples==

==Summary==
&lt;!--

[[Image:Wave characteristics.svg]]
--&gt;

''Wave is used to describe a motion of an oscillation through space '' . There are two types of waves . 
# [[Transverse Wave]] has the oscillation's direction the same direction of oscillation . For instance, Electric Wave. 
#[[Longitudianl Wave]] has the oscillation's direction perpendicular to the direction of oscillation . For example, Sound Wave 

''Every Wave has a Wave's Equation in the form
: &lt;math&gt;F(t,\theta) =  A Sin (\omega t + \theta)&lt;/math&gt;

Wave could carry Energy , Infomation . Wave's speed can be changed by [[Reflection]] , [[Refraction]], [[Diffraction]] even undergo [[Frequency change]] by Energy [[Absorption]] or [[Radiation]] ''

      <comment>/* The discount rate */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">

=Present and Future Values=

==Mathematical Formulas==

=Discounting=

=Net Present Value=

'''Net present value''' ('''NPV''') or '''net present worth''' ('''NPW''')&lt;ref name=netpresworth&gt;{{Cite book | author=Lin, Grier C. I.; Nagalingam, Sev V. | authorlink= | coauthors= | title=CIM justification and optimisation | year=2000 | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | location=London  | isbn=0-7484-0858-4 | pages=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; is defined as the total present value (PV) of a time series of cash flows.  It is a standard method for using the time value of money to appraise long-term projects. Used for capital budgeting, and widely throughout economics, it measures the excess or shortfall of cash flows, in present value terms, once financing charges are met.

See discounted cash flow

==Formula==
Each cash inflow/outflow is discounted back to its present value (PV). Then they are summed. Therefore NPV is the sum of all terms
&lt;math&gt;\frac{R_t}{(1+i)^{t}}&lt;/math&gt;, where
:''t'' - the time of the cash flow
:''i'' - the discount rate (the rate of return that could be earned on an investment in the financial markets with similar risk.)
:&lt;math&gt;R_t&lt;/math&gt; - the net cash flow (the amount of cash, inflow minus outflow) at time ''t'' (for educational purposes, &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; is commonly placed to the left of the sum to emphasize its role as (minus the) investment.

==The discount rate==
The rate used to discount future cash flows to their present values is a key variable of this process.
A firm's weighted average cost of capital (after tax) is often used, but many people believe that it is appropriate to use higher discount rates to adjust for risk for riskier projects or other factors.  A variable discount rate with higher rates applied to cash flows occurring further along the time span might be used to reflect the yield curve premium for long-term debt.

Another approach to choosing the discount rate factor is to decide the rate which the capital needed for the project could return if invested in an alternative venture. If, for example, the capital required for Project A can earn five percent elsewhere, use this discount rate in the NPV calculation to allow a direct comparison to be made between Project A and the alternative. Related to this concept is to use the firm's Reinvestment Rate. Reinvestment rate can be defined as the rate of return for the firm's investments on average. When analyzing projects in a capital constrained environment, it may be appropriate to use the reinvestment rate rather than the firm's weighted average cost of capital (WACC) as the discount factor. It reflects opportunity cost of investment, rather than the possibly lower cost of capital.

A NPV amount obtained using variable discount rates (if they are known for the duration of the investment) better reflects the real situation than that calculated from a constant discount rate for the entire investment duration.  Refer to the tutorial article written by Samuel Baker&lt;ref name=&quot;slbaker&quot;&gt;{{cite web | last = Baker | first = Samuel L. | coauthors = | title = Perils of the Internal Rate of Return | publisher = | year= 2000 | url = http://hspm.sph.sc.edu/COURSES/ECON/invest/invest.html | accessdate = January 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; for more detailed relationship between the NPV value and the discount rate.

For some professional investors, their investment funds are committed to target a specified rate of return.  In such cases, that rate of  should be selected as the discount rate for the NPV calculation. In this way, a direct comparison can be made between the profitability of the project and the desired rate of return.

To some extent, the selection of the discount rate is dependent on the use to which it will be put. If the intent is simply to determine whether a project will add value to the company, using the firm's weighted average cost of capital may be appropriate. If trying to decide between alternative investments in order to maximize the value of the firm, the corporate reinvestment rate would probably be a better choice.

Using variable rates over time, or discounting &quot;guaranteed&quot; cash flows differently from &quot;at risk&quot; cash flows may be a superior methodology, but is seldom used in practice. Using the discount rate to adjust for risk is often  difficult to do in practice (especially internationally), and is really difficult to do well. An alternative to using discount factor to adjust for risk is to explicitly correct the cash flows for the risk elements using NPV or a similar method, then discount at the firm's rate.

== What NPV Means ==
NPV is an indicator of how much value an investment or project adds to the firm. With a particular project, if &lt;math&gt;R_t&lt;/math&gt; is a positive value, the project is in the status of discounted cash inflow in the time of ''t''.  If &lt;math&gt;R_t&lt;/math&gt; is a negative value, the project is in the status of discounted cash outflow in the time of ''t''.  Appropriately risked projects with a positive NPV could be accepted. This does not necessarily mean that they should be undertaken since NPV at the cost of capital may not account for opportunity cost, ''i.e.'' comparison with other available investments.  In financial theory, if there is a choice between two mutually exclusive alternatives, the one yielding the higher NPV should be selected.  The following sums up the NPVs in various situations.

==Example==
&lt;!-- People like to mess with this example.  Please be 100% sure you are correct before you make a change to it!--&gt;
A corporation must decide whether to introduce a new product line. The new product will have startup costs, operational costs, and incoming cash flows over six years. 
This project will have an immediate (t=0) cash outflow of $100,000 (which might include machinery, and employee training costs).  Other cash outflows for years 1-6 are expected to be $5,000 per year. Cash inflows are expected to be $30,000 each for years 1-6.  All cash flows are after-tax, and there are no cash flows expected after year 6.  The required rate of return is 10%.
The present value (PV) can be calculated for each year:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; align=&quot;center&quot; font-size=&quot;120%&quot; border:&quot;2px solid black;&quot;
!Year!!Cashflow!!Present Value
|-
|T=0||&lt;math&gt;\frac{-100,000}{(1+0.10)^0}&lt;/math&gt;||-$100,000
|-
|T=1||&lt;math&gt;\frac{30,000 - 5,000}{(1+0.10)^1}&lt;/math&gt;||$22,727
|-
|T=2||&lt;math&gt;\frac{30,000 - 5,000}{(1+0.10)^2}&lt;/math&gt;||$20,661
|-
|T=3||&lt;math&gt;\frac{30,000 - 5,000}{(1+0.10)^3}&lt;/math&gt;||$18,783
|-
|T=4||&lt;math&gt;\frac{30,000 - 5,000}{(1+0.10)^4}&lt;/math&gt;||$17,075
|-
|T=5||&lt;math&gt;\frac{30,000 - 5,000}{(1+0.10)^5}&lt;/math&gt;||$15,523
|-
|T=6||&lt;math&gt;\frac{30,000 - 5,000}{(1+0.10)^6}&lt;/math&gt;||$14,112
|}
The sum of all these present values is the net present value, which equals $8,881.52.  Since the NPV is greater than zero, it would be better to invest in the project than to do nothing, and the corporation should invest in this project if there is no alternative with a higher NPV.


More realistic problems would need to consider other factors, generally including the calculation of taxes, uneven cash flows, and salvage values as well as the availability of alternate investment opportunities.

== Common pitfalls ==
*If for example the &lt;math&gt;R_t&lt;/math&gt; are generally negative late in the project (''e.g.'', an industrial or mining project might have clean-up and restoration costs), then at that stage the company owes money, so a high  discount rate is not cautious but too optimistic. Some people see this as a problem with NPV. A way to avoid this problem is to include explicit provision for financing any losses after the initial investment, that is, explicitly calculate the cost of financing such losses.

*Another common pitfall is to adjust for risk by adding a premium to the discount rate. Whilst a bank might charge a higher rate of interest for a risky project, that does not mean that this is a valid approach to adjusting a net present value for risk, although it can be a reasonable approximation in some specific cases. One reason such an approach may not work well can be seen from the foregoing: if some risk is incurred resulting in some losses, then a discount rate in the NPV will reduce the impact of such losses below their true financial cost. A rigorous approach to risk requires identifying and valuing risks explicitly, ''e.g.'' by actuarial or [[Monte Carlo method|Monte Carlo]] techniques, and explicitly calculating the cost of financing any losses incurred.

*Yet another issue can result from the compounding of the risk premium. R is a composite of the risk free rate and the risk premium. As a result, future cash flows are discounted by both the risk-free rate as well as the risk premium and this effect is compounded by each subsequent cash flow. This compounding results in a much lower NPV than might be otherwise calculated. The certainty equivalent model can be used to account for the risk premium without compounding its effect on present value.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

*If NPV is less than 0, which is to say, negative, the project should not be immediately rejected. Sometimes companies have to execute an NPV-negative project if not executing it creates even more value destruction.

*Another issue with relying on NPV is that it does not provide an overall picture of the gain or loss of executing a certain project. To see a percentage gain relative to the investments for the project, usually, Internal rate of return is used complimented to the NPV method.

==Alternative capital budgeting methods==
* Payback period: which measures the time required for the cash inflows to equal the original outlay. It measures risk, not return.
* Cost-benefit analysis: which includes issues other than cash, such as time savings.
* Real option method: which attempts to value managerial flexibility that is assumed away in NPV.
* Internal rate of return: which calculates the rate of return of a project while disregarding the absolute amount of money to be gained.
* Modified Internal Rate of Return|Modified internal rate of return (MIRR): similar to IRR, but it makes explicit assumptions about the reinvestment of the cash flows. Sometimes it is called Growth Rate of Return.
* Accounting rate of return (ARR): a ratio similar to IRR and MIRR

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Laplace Transform ==

Whilst the [[Signals_and_Systems/Fourier Series|Fourier Series]] and the [[Signals_and_Systems/Aperiodic_Signals#Fourier_Transform|Fourier Transform]] are well suited for analysing the frequency content of a signal, be it periodic or aperiodic,
the Laplace transform is the tool of choice for analysing and developing circuits such as filters.

The Fourier Transform can be considered as an extension of the Fourier Series for aperiodic signals.
The Laplace Transform can be considered as an extension of the Fourier Transform to the complex plane.

=== Unilateral Laplace Transform ===

The ''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laplace_transform Laplace Transform]'' of a function ''f''(''t''), defined for all real numbers ''t'' ≥ 0, is the function ''F''(''s''), defined by:

: &lt;math&gt;F(s) = \mathcal{L} \left\{f(t)\right\}=\int_0^{\infty} e^{-st} f(t) \,dt. &lt;/math&gt;

The parameter ''s'' is the complex number:

: &lt;math&gt;s = \sigma + j \omega, \, &lt;/math&gt; with a real part σ and an imaginary part ω.

=== Bilateral Laplace Transform ===

The ''Bilateral Laplace Transform'' is defined as follows:

: &lt;math&gt;F(s)  = \mathcal{L}\left\{f(t)\right\}  =\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} e^{-st} f(t)\,dt.&lt;/math&gt;

Comparing this definition to the one of the [[Signals_and_Systems/Aperiodic_Signals#Fourier_Transform|Fourier Transform]], one sees that the latter is a special case of the Laplace Transform for &lt;math&gt;s = j \omega&lt;/math&gt;.

In the field of electrical engineering, the Bilateral Laplace Transform is simply referred as the Laplace Transform.

=== Inverse Laplace Transform ===

The ''Inverse Laplace Transform'' allows to find the original time function on which a Laplace Transform has been made.:

: &lt;math&gt;f(t) = \mathcal{L}^{-1} \{F(s)\} = \frac{1}{2 \pi i} \lim_{T\to\infty}\int_{ \gamma - i T}^{ \gamma + i T} e^{st} F(s)\,ds,&lt;/math&gt;

== Differential Equations ==

=== Integral and Derivative ===

The [[Signals_and_Systems/Table_of_Laplace_Transforms#Laplace_Transform_Properties|properties of the Laplace transform]] show that:
* the transform of a derivative corresponds to a multiplcation with &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;
* the transform of an integral corresponds to a division with &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;

This is summarized in the following table:
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot; style=&quot;text-align:center; margin: 1em auto 1em auto&quot;
!width=50%|Time Domain
!width=50%|Laplace Domain
|-
!&lt;math&gt;x(t) &lt;/math&gt;
!&lt;math&gt;X(s) = \mathcal{L} \left\{ x(t) \right\}&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt; \dot{x}(t) &lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt; s \cdot X(s) &lt;/math&gt;
|-
| &lt;math&gt; \int x(t)dt &lt;/math&gt;
| &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{s} \cdot X(s) &lt;/math&gt;
|}

With this, a set of differential equations is transformed into a set of linear equations which can be solved with the usual techniques of linear algebra.

=== Lumped Element Circuits ===

Lumped elements circuits typically show this kind of integral or differential relations between current and voltage:
:: &lt;math&gt; U_C = \frac{1}{sC} \cdot I_C &lt;/math&gt;

::&lt;math&gt; U_L = sL \cdot I_L &lt;/math&gt;

This is why the analysis of a lumped elements circuit is usually done with the help of the Laplace transform.

== Example ==

=== Sallen-Key Lowpass Filter ===

&lt;div style=&quot;background: #CCEEFF; border: 1px solid #aaaaaa; padding: 6pt; margin: 12pt 0.5em; width: -0.5em&quot;&gt;
[[Image:Evolution-tasks.png|40px|left|Example]] The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sallen_Key_filter Sallen-Key] circuit is widely used for the implementation of analog second order sections.

[[Image:Sallen-Key Lowpass General.svg|frame|right|Sallen&amp;ndash;Key unity-gain lowpass filter]]
The image on the side shows the circuit for an all-pole second order function.

Writing &lt;math&gt;v_1&lt;/math&gt; the potential between both resistances and &lt;math&gt;v_2&lt;/math&gt; the input of the op-amp follower circuit, gives the following relations:
: &lt;math&gt; \begin{cases}
R_1 I_{R1} = V_{in} - V_1 \\
R_2 I_{R2} = V_1 - V_2 \\
I_{C2} = s C_2 V_2 \\
I_{C1} = s C_1 (V_1 - V_{out}) \\
I_{R1} = I_{R2} + I_{C1} \\
I_{R2} = I_{C2} \\
V_2 = V_{out}
 \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

Rewriting the current node relations gives:
: &lt;math&gt; \begin{cases}
R_1 R_2 I_{R1} = R_1 R_2 I_{R2} +R_1 R_2 I_{C1} \\
R_2 I_{R2} = R_2 I_{C2}
 \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{cases}
R_2 (V_{in} - V_1) = R_1 (V_1 - V_{out}) + R_1 R_2 s C_1 (V_1 - V_{out}) \\
V_1 - V_{out} = R_2 s C_2 V_{out}
 \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \begin{cases}
R_2 V_{in} = (R_1 + R_2 + R_1 R_2 s C_1) V_1 - (R_1  + R_1 R_2 s C_1) V_{out} \\
V_1 = (1 + s R_2 C_2) V_{out}
 \end{cases} &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; R_2 V_{in} = \begin{bmatrix} (1 + s R_2 C_2) (R_1 + R_2 + R_1 R_2 s C_1) - R_1  - R_1 R_2 s C_1 \end{bmatrix} V_{out} &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; V_{in} = \begin{bmatrix} (1 + s R_2 C_2) (R_1/R_2 + 1 + s R_1 C_1 - R_1/R_2  - s R_1 C_1 \end{bmatrix} V_{out} &lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{V_{in}}{ V_{out}} = R_1/R_2 + 1 + s R_1 C_1 + s R_1 C_2 + s R_2 C_2 + s^2 R_1 R_2 C_1 C_2 - R_1/R_2  - s R_1 C_1 &lt;/math&gt;

and finally:
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{V_{out}}{ V_{in}} = \frac{1}{1 + s (R_1 + R_2) C_2 + s^2 R_1 R_2 C_1 C_2} &lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the transfer function is:
: &lt;math&gt; H(s) = \frac{\frac{1}{R_1 R_2 C_1 C_2}}{s^2 + \frac{R_1 + R_2}{R_1 R_2} \frac{1}{C_1} s +  \frac{1}{R_1 R_2 C_1 C_2}} &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;
