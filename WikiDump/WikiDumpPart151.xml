      <text xml:space="preserve">Virtual Enterprise (VE) is active‐learning pedagogy where groups of students assume the roles of members of an enterprise and operate that business in teams. The business processes employed in the classroom are real and the products and services are drawn from current industry direction. Yet, the business is indeed &quot;virtual&quot; with products only being sold through the simulated economy comprised of the international network of students and VE businesses. The backbone of this economy is our proprietary technology platform, the VE MarketMaker, with banking, credit, e‐commerce, and stock functionality. Nearly all human activity has an economic context and it is this system that allows the student work done in the classroom to register. The global network also facilitates collaborative events for showcasing product development, applying for funding, and making sales. It puts acquired interdisciplinary knowledge and skills into practical use, building the mental connection between what they’ve learned and how the “real world” makes use of it. Students are obliged to actively participate in their own learning through projects, group work, and discussion. (Troudt, 2009)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello, your username and the content you are creating appears to be in violation of the Wikibooks policies. The promotion of thrid parties and the hosting of their material is not permitted here. If you are not a representative of [[http://www.ive.cuny.edu/index.php The CUNY Institute for Virtual Enterprise] and not trying to advertise that organisation I'd be interested to here what you are doing. If the material created is spam then I'm afraid it'll be deleted. Thanks &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 16:09, 26 March 2012 (UTC)


I work for the City University of New York and the CUNY IVE, and I am creating a teaching handbook so teachers all over the country can learn how to use virtual enterprise in their classes.    I do not see how this is a problem with wikibooks policies.  We own the content and we want to make Virtual enterprise open to everyone.

:Okay, thanks. A couple of things you should do then. First off, please familiarise yourself with the normal structures for creating material here (take a look at [[Wikibooks:What is Wikibooks]] and [[Using Wikibooks]] in particular). The structure is different to, for example, Wikipedia. Secondly, if you are copying material where the copyright is owned by someone you must provide evidence that they have agreed to license it under the [[Wikibooks:Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License|CC-BY-SA 3.0 License]] and the [[Wikibooks:GNU Free Documentation License|GFDL]]. It's not enough to say you work for the CUNY IVE - you need to get someone who is authorised to license the material to send an email to info@wikibooks.org formally releasing it. Finally, once you've added material here under the licenses then you no longer &quot;own&quot; it - anyone can modify or change it. Regards, &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 16:23, 26 March 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">You probably want to include some discussion here about how to include photos.  Print outlets will want high quality versions, and web outlets usually won't go wider than about 700.  The more work you make the editor do to get your photo, the less chance they run the story.  Always tell how you want the photo attributed, and make sure you have permission to grant the publication the right to use the photo.
:Great idea, thank you for the suggestion.  I've been working on a few practical issues in that field anyway so I'll look into doing that.  It's especially important now that many smaller publications have become online-heavy.

Łukasz and Beata are friends who meet on the street and exchange a few quick words.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
!  
! Polish
! English
|-
! Beata
| Cześć Łukasz. Jak się masz?	
| Hi Łukasz. How are you?
|-
! Łukasz
| Dobrze. A ty?
| Well. And you?
|-
! Beata
| Nieźle.
| Not bad.
|-

| Nice to see you but I must return home. We will talk later.
|-
! Beata
| Dobrze. Cześć.
| Okay. Bye.
|}

Dialogue Notes
* The word ''cześć'' means both '''hi''' and '''bye''', similar to '''ciao''' in Italian.
* The word ''dobrze'' is an adverb and can mean '''fine''', '''well''', or '''okay'''.
* ''Cię'', meaning '''you''', is capitalized out of respect. Oftentimes, when writing to someone, the pronoun '''you''' and '''your''' will be capitalized. 
* The verb ''porozmawiamy'' is not preceded by the pronoun '''we'''. Pronouns in Polish are implicit in the verb form and may be dropped just like in Spanish.

==Grammar I: Greetings and Farewells==
Different greeting and farewells are used depending on the time of day:
* ''dzień dobry''
** greeting used for '''good morning''', '''good afternoon''', and '''good day'''
* ''dobry wieczór''
** greeting used for ''' good evening'''
* ''dobranoc''
** farewell used for '''good night'''
The words ''dobry'' and ''dobra'' mean '''good''' and are used for masculine and feminine nouns, respectively. Notice that while ''dzień dobry'' and ''dobry wieczór'' are written separately, ''dobranoc'' is written together.


Other farewells include:
* ''cześć''
** means both '''hi''' and '''bye'''
** very informal; used between friends
* ''do widzenia''
** standard way to say ''goodbye''
** ''lit.'' means '''until seeing'''
* ''do zobaczenia''
** slightly more cordial and warm than ''do widzenia''

==Grammar II: Introduction to Nouns==
Polish nouns can generally be classified into three genders:
* masculine (m) - ''męski''
* feminine (f) - ''żeński''
* neuter (n) - ''nijaki''


The gender of a noun can be usually determined by its ending.


If the noun ends in '''-a''', it is usually feminine.
* ''ulica'' - street
Notable exceptions include the word for man and male occupations
* ''mężczyzna'' (m) – man
* ''okulista'' (m) – eye doctor
* ''poeta'' (m) – poet
* ''kierowca'' (m) – driver


If the noun ends in '''-o''', '''-e''', '''-ę''', and '''-um''' (of Latin origin), it is usually neuter.
* ''okno'' - window
* ''pole'' - field
* ''imię'' - name
* ''muzeum'' - museum


If the noun ends in a consonant, it is usually masculine.
* ''kot'' - cat
Notable exceptions include Latin-derived words ending in '''-um''' which are neuter, words ending in '''-ść''' which are feminine, and a few others.
* ''akwarium'' (n) - aquarium
* ''miłość'' (f) – love
* ''krew'' (f) - blood
* ''noc'' (f) - night

      <text xml:space="preserve">Polish nouns are classified as '''singular''' (name for one thing) or '''plural''' (name for more than one thing)


To make singular feminine nouns plural, look at the penultimate letter to decide what to change the '''-a''' to:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Singular 
! Plural
! Example 
|-
| -ka, -ga
| -ki, -gi	
| ''noga'' – ''nogi'' (leg – legs)
|-
| -ca, -ea, -ia, -ja, -la, -ża (-rza)
| -ce, -ee, -ie, -je, -le, -że (-rze)
| ''róża'' – ''róże'' (rose – roses)
|-
| -[everything else] + a
| -[everything else] + y
| ''torba – torby'' (bag – bags)
|}

Remember that '''rz''' also sounds like '''ż'''
* ''burza'' – ''burze'' (storm – storms)     	


To make neuter nouns plural, change the '''-o''', '''-e''', or '''-um''' to '''-a'''
* ''okno'' – ''okna''
* ''muzeum'' – ''muzea''
The plurals of nouns ending in '''-ę''' are irregular and will not be covered at this time.


To make masculine nouns plural, look at the last letter. They follow similar rules to feminine nouns.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
! Singular 
! Plural
! Example 
|-
| -k, -g
| -ki, -gi	
| ''bok'' – ''boki'' (side – sides)
|-
| -c, -j, -l, -ż (-rz)
| -ce, -je, -le, -że (-rze)
| ''garaż'' – ''garaże'' (garage – garages)
|-
| -ć, -ń, -ś, -ź
| -cie, -nie, -sie, -zie	
| ''koń'' – ''konie'' (horse – horse)
|-
| -[everything else]
| -[everything else] + y
| ''las – lasy'' (forest – forests)
|}

===Caldwall Castle===
[[File:Geograph-2058729-by-Richard-Rogerson cropped.jpg|thumb|right]]
Caldwell Tower stands on a mound, and is a small, free-standing tower of probable 16th century origin. Square on plan, of good coursed rubble, it contains three stories beneath the parapet. This is carried on two courses of individual corbels. The crenellations seem to have been renewed.

The door at ground floor level is in the west wall and admits to a vaulted basement, which does not communicate with the upper stories. The first floor, also vaulted, is reached via a modern forestair. The flooring above has been altered. The windows are small, and there are signs of built-up gun-loops in the walling. The fabric throughout is in fair condition. This tower is thought to have been part of the courtyard-type Caldwell Castle. Rubble, possibly from demolished ancillary buildings has been noted at the site.

Ainslie's map of 1775 indicates a 'pigeon house' or 'doocot' at the position of the tower, indicating a later use of this castle remnant. Some indications of the tower being a focal point of the pleasure gardens, linked to a belvedere have been suggested. The 1832 map of Renfrewshire by John Thomson shows the tower clearly and marks it as 'Bacon H.' suggesting that it was then in use as a pigsty or such-like.

===Hartlebury Castle===
[[File:Hartlebury Castle - geograph.org.uk - 419175.jpg|thumb|left]]
Hartlebury Castle was built in the mid-13th century as a fortified manor house on  land given to  the Bishop of Worcester by  King Burgred of Mercia. From the early 13th century until 2007,  Hartlebury Castle was the residence of the bishop of Worcester.

Bishop Walter de Cantilupe, a supporter of Simon de Montfort, began to fortify the Castle, which was embattled and finished by his successor, Godfrey Giffard, 1268. The gate-house was added in the reign of Henry VI by Bishop Carpenter.

In 1646 during the Civil War Hartlebury Castle was strongly fortified and held for King Charles I by Captain Sandys and Lord Windsor, with 120 foot soldiers and 20 horse, and had provisions for twelve months. When summoned by Colonel Morgan for the Parliament, it surrendered in two days without firing a shot. The Castle was slighted and the Parliamentary Commissioners seized the Castle and manor, and sold them to Thomas Westrowe for £3133 6s. 8d.  At the Restoration they  were given back to the Bishop of Worcester.

===Holt Castle===
[[File:Holt castle 850843 62546082.jpg|thumb|right]]
Work began on Holt Castle in the 13th century during the Welsh Wars. The castle was sited on the Welsh-English border by the banks of the River Dee.

In the medieval period, the five-towered fortress was actually known as ''Castrum Leonis'' or ''Castle Lyons'' because it had a Lion motif carved into the stonework above its main gate. In the 17th century, almost all the stonework was removed from the site; only the base of the sandstone foundation remain.

The castle was built from local sandstone on top of a 12m high promontory. It was shaped like a pentagon with towers at each corner. The castle had a stepped ramp up to a main gateway, barbican, inner ward, postern and curtain walls. There was also a water-filled moat that was fed from the River Dee. The design of the castle featured towers that were built against the face of the rock outside the curtain wall, similar to the inner wards at Ruthin Castle and at Conwy Castle.

Holt castle was started by Edward I on a sandstone base next to the River Dee soon after the invasion of North Wales in 1277. In 1282 Edward I presented the Welsh lands in which Holt was situated to loyal lord  John de Warrene, who was also given the task of completing the castle. By 1311 the castle had been finished and a planned town laid out next to it for the use by English settlers.

A century later, Welsh forces burned down the town in 1400 during the uprising of Owain Glyndŵr; although the castle was not taken. By the 16th century Holt Castle had fallen disuse and ruin. 

In 1643, during the English Civil War Holt was garrisoned by Royalists troops. Three years later, after holding out for a year during a second siege, Holt became the last castle to be captured by Parliamentarian forces in north-east Wales. Holt Castle was slighted in 1650 to stop it being used as a fortification by any royalist supporters.

===Worcester Castle===
[[File:The Edgar Tower, Worcester - geograph.org.uk - 503034.jpg|thumb|left]]

Worcester Castle was a Norman fortification built between 1068 and 1069 in Worcester, England by Urse d'Abetot on behalf of William the Conqueror. The castle had a motte-and-bailey design and was located on the south side of the old Anglo-Saxon city, cutting into the grounds of Worcester Cathedral. Royal castles were owned by the king and maintained on his behalf by an appointed constable. At Worcester that role was passed down through the local Beauchamp family on a hereditary basis, giving them permanent control of the castle and considerable power within the city. The castle played an important part in the wars of the 12th and early 13th century, including the Anarchy and the First Barons' War.

In 1217, Henry III's government decided to break the power of the Beauchamps and reduce the ongoing military threat posed by the castle by returning much of the castle's bailey to the cathedral. Without an intact bailey the castle was no longer valuable militarily, although it played a small part in the Second Barons' War in the 1260s. A gaol had been built in the castle by the early 13th century and the castle continued to be used as Worcestershire's county gaol until the 19th century, when a new prison was built on the north side of Worcester and the old site completely redeveloped. Today nothing remains of Worcester Castle with the exception of Edgar's Tower, a cathedral gatehouse built on the former entrance to the castle.

[[File:Dudley Castle -England-8.jpg|thumb|right|Dudley Castle]]
Dudley Castle is a ruined castle in the town of Dudley. The castle stands on an outcrop of Wenlock Group limestone. Local legend states that a wooden castle was constructed on the site in the 8th century by a Saxon lord called Dud or Dado. However this legend is not taken seriously by historians, who usually date the castle from soon after the Norman Conquest of 1066. It is thought one of the Conqueror's followers, Ansculf de Picquigny, built the first castle in 1070 and that his son, William Fitz-Ansculf, was in possession of the castle when it was recorded at the time of the Domesday Book of 1086. Some of the earthworks from this castle, notably the 'motte', the vast mound on which the present castle keep now sits, still remain. 

After Fitz-Ansculf, the castle came into the possession of the Paganel family, who built the first stone castle on the site. This castle was strong enough to withstand a siege in 1153 by the forces of King Stephen. However, after Gervase Paganel joined a failed rebellion against King Henry II in 1173 the castle was demolished by order of the king. The Somery's were the next dynasty to own the site and set about building the castle in stone starting in the second half of the 13th century and continuing on into the 14th. The keep (the most obvious part of the castle when viewed from the town) and the main gate dates from this re-building. A chapel and great hall were also constructed.

Starting around 1540, a range of new buildings were erected within the older castle walls. The architect was William Sharington and the buildings are thus usually referred to as Sharrington Range. 

The castle became a Royalist stronghold during the English Civil War, and was besieged twice before its surrender to Cromwell's forces in 1646. The first siege in 1644 was lifted after the Royalists sent a relief force which drove away the Parliamentarians. In 1646 Sir William Brereton commanded the Parliamentarians in the second siege against the Royalists led by Colonel Leveson. The castle was surrendered on 13th May 1646. Parliament subsequently ordered that the castle be partly demolished and the present ruined appearance of the keep result from this decision. 

A stable block was constructed on the site at some point before 1700. This was the final building to be constructed in the castle. The bulk of the remaining habitable parts of the castle was destroyed by fire in 1750.

==Farnham Castle==
&lt;!--adapted from http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Farnham_Castle&amp;oldid=481860470 --&gt;
[[File:The Great Keep, Farnham Castle - geograph.org.uk - 384015.jpg|thumb|right|Farnham Castle]]

Farnham Castle was built in 1138 by Henri de Blois, grandson of William the Conqueror,. The castle was to become the home of the Bishops of Winchester for over 800 years. The original building was demolished by Henry II in 1155 after the Anarchy and then rebuilt in the late 12th and early 13th centuries.  The castle was slighted again after the Civil War in 1648. Since then more buildings have been constructed in the castle's grounds, the most impressive being those built by Bishop George Morley in the 17th century.

The architecture reflects changing styles through the ages, making it one of the most important historical buildings in the south of England. It is an impressive stone motte and bailey fortress, which has been in continuous occupation since the 12th century. The large motte was formed around the massive foundations of a Norman tower and then totally enclosed by a shell-keep, with buttress turrets and a shallow gatehouse. Attached to the motte is a triangular inner bailey, with a fine range of domestic buildings and a fifteenth century brick entrance tower. The formidable outer bailey curtain wall has square flanking towers, a 13th century gatehouse and a large ditch.

==Guildford Castle==

[[File:Guildford castle 1.jpg|thumb|left|Guildford Castle]]

Guildford Castle in Surrey is thought to have been built shortly after the Norman Conquest. There is no record of it in the Domesday Book so construction probably started after 1086.

First to be built at the Castle would have been the motte around which was a ditch and a bailey protected by a wooden palisade. If it followed a typical Norman design the bailey would have been divided with a palisade and have been divided into an inner and outer bailey. The inner baily would have encompassed the motte on which a wooden keep would have been built as a look-out post for the soldiers stationed there.

In the late 11th or early 12th century, a wall made of Bargate stone was built around the top of the motte creating a shell keep, and then around the 1130s a keep was added, again made of Bargate stone bonded with hard and durable mortar. The keep may have been built over part of the shell keep an its foundations went down to the chalk bedrock. The general form was quadrangular, its exterior dimensions being 47ft by 45.5ft. The walls are about 10ft thick at the base and taper towards the top.

The keep's entrance was located on the first floor to aid in defence. The ground floor was windowless. On the first floor there was a Great Chamber, a chapel, and wardrobe with latrine. A second floor was added shortly afterwards containing a two-seater latrine. The addition of the second floor made the keep over 70ft high. The roof of the building was made of lead and the inner walls were covered in plaster and then whitewashed.

===Colchester Castle===
&lt;!--Adapted from https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Colchester_Castle&amp;oldid=549045006 --&gt;
[[File:Colchester-castle.jpg|200px|right|Colchester Castle in Essex]]
Colchester Castle's keep at 152 x 112 ft is the largest ever built in Britain and the largest surviving example in Europe. There has always been debate as to the original height of the castle. It has been suggested that the keep was at one time four storeys high, though for a number of reasons, including the peaceful region of the castle and the lack of local stone, it is now thought that it had only two or three. The castle is built on the foundations (or the podium) of the earlier Roman temple of Claudius (built between AD 54–60). These foundations, with their massive vaults, have since been uncovered and can be viewed today on a castle tour.

The castle was ordered by William the Conqueror and designed by Gundulf, Bishop of Rochester. Building began between 1069 and 1076 under the supervision of Eudo Dapifer, who became the castle's steward on its completion.  Building stopped in 1080 because of a threat of Viking invasion, but the castle was completed by around 1100. Many materials, such as Roman brick and clay taken from the Roman town, were used in the building and these can easily be seen. Scaffolding pole holes and garderobes can still be seen in the structure.

===Cromwell's Castle===
&lt;!--adapted from http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cromwell%27s_Castle&amp;oldid=481272497 --&gt;
[[File:Cromwell's Castle - Scilly - geograph.org.uk - 15726.jpg|thumb|right|Cromwell's Castle]]
Cromwell's Castle is a coastal gun tower built by Oliver Cromwell on the island of Tresco. It was constructed in 1651 - 1652 as a replacement for King Charles's Castle. The guns were mounted on the roof above the garrison's living quarters and magazines. The tower was originally entered at first floor level by an external stair on the south side. The present entrance dates from the construction of the lower gun platform added in the 1740s by Abraham Tovey, Master Gunner.

===King Charles's Castle===
&lt;!--adapted from http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=King_Charles%27s_Castle&amp;oldid=432384294 --&gt;
[[File:King Charles' Castle - geograph.org.uk - 815062.jpg|thumb|left|King Charles's Castle]]
King Charles's Castle is a coastal artillery fort near the northern extremity of the island of Tresco. It is now in ruins. It was a semi-hexagonal gun tower designed to provide a wide field of fire and two-storeyed to give at least two tiers of guns. The domestic quarters for the garrison were at the rear.

Despite its name, the castle was built 1550-1554 during the reign of Edward VI.  During the English Civil War low earthwork defences were thrown up beyond the castle to protect it from landward attack. After the war it was replaced by Cromwell's Castle.

===Star Castle===
[[File:Star Castle - geograph.org.uk - 615094.jpg|thumb|right|Star Castle]]
Star Castle is a fortress on St Mary's, Isles of Scilly, built in 1593 by Francis Godolphin in the shape of an eight-pointed star. Little altered it is an almost complete example of an Elizabethan fort.

===Flamborough Castle===

===Paull Holme Tower===
&lt;!--Adapted from http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Paull_Holme_Tower&amp;oldid=478719738 --&gt;
[[File:Paull Holme Tower - geograph.org.uk - 52138.jpg|thumb|left|Paull Holme Tower]]
Paull Holme Tower is a late-medieval period fortified tower. It is part of a rectangular, moated enclosure near the village of Paull dating from the beginning of the 15th century. The tower is three storeys high, each floor having a single chamber, the whole protected by a portcullis. There has been debate as to the purpose of the site - in part the fortification resembles the more northern pele towers, although alternatively the tower may have been built to give luxury accommodation overlooking the River Humber that runs nearby, similar to some properties built near King's Lynn.

===Skipsea Castle===
&lt;!--adapted from http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Skipsea_Castle&amp;oldid=473357791 --&gt;
[[File:Skipsea Castle - geograph.org.uk - 79788.jpg|thumb|right|Skipsea Castle]]

Skipsea Castle is a Norman Motte and Bailey castle located south of Bridlington. All that remains visible today are the earthworks, having been destroyed by the order of Henry III. The castle was built around 1086, in the years following the Norman Conquest by Drogo de la Bouerer, the First Earl of Holderness, in order to defend against Viking raids.

In the 13th century, William de Froz II, Lord of Holderness rebelled against the king.  As a result, in 1221 William de Froz II was excommunicated and Skipsea Castle was destroyed.  Eventually, William de Froz II reconciled with King Henry III in 1227. Skipsea Castle was returned to William de Froz II, but without any defences.

===Wressle Castle===
[[File:Wressle Castle.jpg|thumb|left|Wressle Castle]]
Wressle Castle is a quadrangular castle located in Wressle. The castle was built c.1380 - 1390 by Sir Thomas Percy. The castle was garrisoned by Parliament during the English Civil War and was largely demolished by an act of Parliament in 1650 as a precaution against future use in any further conflict. A fire gutted the remaining south range of the castle in 1796.

===Tower of London===
[[File:Tower of London, April 2006.jpg|thumb|right|The Tower of London standing upon Tower Hill in central London]]
&lt;!--Adapted from http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Tower_of_London&amp;oldid=484836163 --&gt;
The Tower of London, or more properly, Her Majesty's Royal Palace and Fortress, stands on the north bank of the River Thames in central London. Construction began in 1066 shortly after the Norman invasion. The castle's common name comes from the White Tower which was built in 1078 and was seen at the time as a symbol of oppression. As a whole, the Tower is a complex of several buildings set within two concentric rings of defensive walls and a moat. There were several phases of expansion, mainly under Kings Richard the Lionheart, Henry III and Edward I in the 12th and 13th centuries. The general layout established by the late 13th century remains despite later activity on the site.

The Tower of London was besieged several times and controlling it has been important to controlling the country. By the time of the Tudors the Tower became used less as a royal residence, and despite attempts to refortify and repair the castle its defences lagged behind developments to deal with artillery.

The Tower was oriented with its strongest and most impressive defences overlooking London and visually dominating the surrounding area. The castle is made up of three wards or enclosures. The innermost ward contains the White Tower and is the earliest phase of the castle. Encircling it to the north, east, and west is the inner ward, built during the reign of Richard the Lionheart. Finally, there is the outer ward which encompasses the castle and was built under Edward I. Although there were several phases of expansion after William the Conqueror founded the Tower of London, the general layout has remained the same since Edward I completed his rebuild in 1285. The castle encloses an area of almost 12 acres with a further six acres around the Tower of London constituting the Tower Liberties – land under the direct influence of the castle and cleared for military reasons.

===Carisbrooke Castle===
[[File:Carisbrooke Castle gate 2.jpg|thumb|right|The gatehouse of Carisbrooke Castle]]

&lt;!--adapted from http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Carisbrooke_Castle&amp;oldid=479548869 --&gt;

Carisbrooke Castle is a historic motte-and-bailey castle located in the village of Carisbrooke near Newport. The site may have been occupied in pre-Roman times. The existence of a ruined wall suggests that there was a building there in late Roman times. The Jutes may have taken over the fort by the late 7th century. An Anglo-Saxon stronghold occupied the site during the 8th century. Around 1000, a wall was built around the hill as a defence against Viking raids.

From 1100 The castle remained in the possession of Richard de Redvers' family, and over the next two hundred years his descendants improved the castle with stone walls, towers and a keep. This was until 1293, when Countess Isabella de Fortibus, the last Redvers resident sold it to Edward I, after which the government was entrusted to wardens as representatives of the crown. In the reign of Richard II it was unsuccessfully attacked by the French. The keep was added to the castle in the reign of Henry I, and in the reign of Elizabeth I; when the Spanish Armada was expected, it was surrounded by an elaborate pentagonal fortification by Sir George Carey.
[[File:Carisbrooke Castle 14th century.jpg|thumb|left|A model of Carisbooke Castle as it appeared during the 14th century]]

Carisbrooke was the strongest castle on the Island; though it is visible from some distance, it does not dominate the countryside like many other castles.

There are traces of a Roman fort underneath the later buildings. Seventy-one steps lead up to the keep; the reward is a fine view. In the centre of the castle enclosure are the domestic buildings; these are mostly of the 13th century, with upper parts of the 16th century. Some are in ruins, but the main rooms were used as the official residence of the Governor of the Isle of Wight until the 1940s, and they remain in good repair.

The Great Hall, Great Chamber and several smaller rooms are open to the public, and an upper room houses the Isle of Wight Museum. Most rooms are partly furnished, but on the whole it is the fireplaces and other features of the rooms themselves which generate the most interest. The gateway tower was erected by Lord Scales who was lord of the castle at the time in 1464.

The chapel is located next to the main gate. Within the walls is a well 200 feet deep and another in the centre of the keep is reputed to have been still deeper. Near the domestic buildings is the well-house with a donkey wheel. 

Surrounding the whole castle are large earthworks, designed by the Italian Federigo Gianibelli, and begun in the year before the Spanish Armada. They were finished in the 1590s. The outer gate has the date 1598 and the arms of Queen Elizabeth I.

===Norris Castle===

[[File:Norris Castle - East Cowes - geograph.org.uk - 545339.jpg|thumb|right|Norris Castle]]
Norris Castle stands on the northeast point of East Cowes. The castle was designed by James Wyatt for Lord Henry Seymour. It has a galleted facade with crenellations, but all of this is for show as the castle has no defensive fortifications. The building's original function was entertaining. Despite its size, it has only four bedrooms. The illusion of size is created by the fact that most of the building is occupied by only one room.

===Yarmouth Castle===

&lt;!--http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Yarmouth_Castle&amp;oldid=476406310--&gt;
Yarmouth Castle is a small off-square blockhouse built by Henry VIII in 1547, to guard Yarmouth harbour. It was built as part of Henry's programme to fortify the English coast with a chain of coastal defences known as Device Forts or Henrician Castles. These were built to guard against the threat of foreign invasion. As it is a later fortification it did not have the earlier rounded or concentric shape but a square keep with angular bastions.

===West Cowes Castle===
&lt;!--adapted from http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Cowes&amp;oldid=478916538 --&gt;
[[File:Cowes iw esplanade cropped.jpg|thumb|right|West Cowes Castle]]
The Isle of Wight was a target of attempted French invasions, and there were notable incursions. Henrician Castles were built in both settlements in the sixteenth century. The west fort in Cowes still survives to this day, albeit without the original Tudor towers, as West Cowes Castle. The fort built in East Cowes is believed to have been similar but was abandoned c1546 and since destroyed.

===Brimstage Hall===
[[File:Brimstage Hall - geograph.org.uk - 405620.jpg|thumb|right|Brimstage Hall]]

Brimstage Hall is believed to have been built between the 12th century and 14th century. Originally the site was enclosed by a moat and high embankment. The building's first known occupants were Sir Hugh Hulse and his wife, who were granted the right to construct a chapel in 1398.
{{clr}}
===Leasowe Castle===
[[File:Leasowe Castle.jpg|thumb|left|Leasowe Castle]]

Leasowe Castle was built by Ferdinando Stanley, 5th Earl of Derby in 1593. Originally the castle consisted only of an octagonal tower. This had become disused by 1700, and it became known as &quot;Mockbeggar Hall&quot;, a term often used for an ornate but derelict building. In 1821 ownership passed to the Cust family, who refurbished and extended the building, using panelling from the demolished Star Chamber at the Palace of Westminster as well as oak from the submerged forest along the coast.

===Buckden Towers===
[[Image:Buckden Towers.jpg|225px|thumb|left|Entrance to Buckden Towers]]

Buckden Towers is a 12th century fortified manor house in Buckden, Cambridgeshire. It was built in the late 12th century, when records show it as being used to house the Bishops of Lincoln. The tall brick tower was added in 1475, protected by walls and a moat, and surrounded by an outer bailey. It was used by the bishops until 1842.

Little now remains of the bishops' moated palace except the great tower, the inner gatehouse, part of the battlemented wall, which used to surround the inner court within the moat, and the outer gate and wall.

Elton Hall is a baronial hall in Elton, Cambridgeshire.  It has been the ancestral home of the Proby family since 1660.  

The hall lies in an 3800 acre estate through which the River Nene runs.  The building incorporates 15th, 17th, 18th and 19th century parts.

===Kimbolton Castle===
[[File:Kimbolton Castle 01.jpg|225px|thumb|left|Kimbolton Castle]]
Kimbolton Castle in Kimbolton, Cambridgeshire is best known as the final home of King Henry VIII's first queen, Catherine of Aragon.  Originally a medieval castle but converted into a stately palace, it was the family seat of the Dukes of Manchester from 1615 until 1950. It now houses Kimbolton School.

A wooden motte and bailey castle was built in Kimbolton, on a different site, in Norman times. Later, King John granted Geoffrey Fitz Peter, Earl of Essex permission to hold a fair and market in Kimbolton, as a consequence of which a market place was created, with the existing church at one end and a new castle at the other.  No remains of this castle remain, although it was built on the site of the present castle.

The castle went through various phases of ownership until, by the 1520s, it belonged to the Wingfield family.  The medieval castle was rebuilt as a Tudor manor house, parts of which survive. Catherine of Aragon was sent here in April 1534 for refusing to give up her status or deny the validity of her marriage. 

The castle was bought by Sir Henry Montagu, later 1st Earl of Manchester, in 1615.  His descendants owned the castle for 335 years until it was sold in 1951.

===Kirtling Tower===
[[Image:A view of Kirtling Tower - geograph.org.uk - 525588.jpg|225px|thumb|right|The remaining Tudor gatehouse of Kirtling Tower]]
Kirtling Tower was a medieval castle and Tudor country house in Cambridgeshire of which the gatehouse still remains. The first documentary records for Kirtling Tower date from 1219, and the 13th century Kirtling Castle was described as having a moat, a ditch and a palisade. In 1424 there was a substantial rebuilding of the castle by Richard de Beauchamp, the Earl of Warwick, with a hundred oak trees used to create a complex with a parlour, a solar and chambers.

Edward North, a successful lawyer, rebuilt the castle in the 1540s and between 1556 to 1558 using the architect Francis Adams, renaming it Kirtling Hall. The earthworks around the castle were considerably altered to provide for a raised platform for the new house, which included contemporary Tudor features such as a gatehouse, gallery, lodgings, a banqueting house and a garden, complete with grand water features and ponds. Queen Elizabeth I stayed at the castle in 1578 during her state procession across Cambridgeshire. The castle continued to develop, and by the 1660s was the largest country house in Cambridgeshire, centred on a symmetrical two-storey south-facing range, with east and west wings providing additional accommodation and facilities.

The castle went into decline after 1691 and by 1735 the Victoria County History of the castle describes the property as being &quot;in disorder&quot;. Much of the castle was pulled down in 1748 in order to make the remainder habitable for Lord Elibank, but the property went into decline again after his death in 1762. By the 1770s it was uninhabitable and most of the castle pulled down in 1801. In the 1830s the gatehouse was turned into a residential property and was renamed Kirtling Tower; an extension was built in 1872 and the house remained in use under a sequence of tenants.

The main feature of the castle today is the three-storey Tudor gatehouse, which closely resembles the gatehouse at Leez Priory, built by North's friend and fellow lawyer Richard Rich. Built of brick, it has octagonal turrets and an oriel window of Italian design. It is a scheduled monument and a Grade I listed building.

===Longthorpe Tower===
[[Image:Longthorpe_Tower1.jpg|thumb|left|Longthorpe Tower]]
Longthorpe Tower is a fourteenth century, three-storey tower in the village of Longthorpe which is part of Peterborough about two miles to the west of the city centre. 

It was added in 1310 to a fortified manor house. The interior contains the best-surviving example of English medieval wall paintings in northern Europe, which survived under a layer of whitewash.

===Northborough Castle===
[[File:The gatehouse, Northborough Hall - geograph.org.uk - 672519.jpg|225px|thumb|right|The gatehouse to Northborough Castle]]
Northborough Castle, also known as Northborough Hall, is a medieval fortified manor house in Cambridgeshire. It was built between 1333 and 1336 by Roger Northburgh, the Bishop of Lichfield; of the original manor, only the gatehouse and the hall still survive. The gatehouse is dominated by a huge gateway, which, whilst it did not have a drawbridge or portcullis, provided considerable protection to the manor behind it. The hall typified the 14th century fashion for improved lighting, with bay windows placed regularly along the line of the hall, and was decorated with wall paintings. Some 16th and 17th-century extensions to the castle were made.

===Woodcroft Castle===
[[Image:WoodcroftCastle.jpg|225px|thumb|left|Woodcroft Castle]]
Woodcroft Castle is a converted medieval castle in the parish of Etton, Cambridgeshire. It was built at the end of the 13th century and named after the Woodcroft family who owned it at around this time. The medieval remains of the castle today include a front, a circular tower and a gatehouse. There is debate as to whether the original castle followed a normal Edwardian quadrilateral design, of which most has since been lost, or if it was simply never fully completed. A later Tudor conversion retained these medieval elements into the current design.

Woodcroft Castle was held by the Royalists during the Civil War and was successfully attacked and taken by Parliamentary forces in 1648.

Have you seen [[Talk:Structured Query Language#Extensions|my message]] to you? [[User:Ftiercel|Ftiercel]] ([[User talk:Ftiercel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ftiercel|contribs]]) 12:45, 29 March 2012 (UTC)

Hi Ftiercel. I have seen your message and I'm happy that people look at my work. When you check the history of my sandbox, you will see that I use to commit my work in relative short periods (e.g.: 7 commit within 1 day for [[User:Kelti/sandbox/About_the_Book]]). I will integrate this work into the regular pages as far as I have the feeling that a consistent state is reached. (For greater changes I possibly will inform people via the discussion page about upcoming contributions so that everyone can comment before pages will be activated.) --[[User:Kelti|Kelti]] ([[User talk:Kelti|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelti|contribs]]) 07:09, 30 March 2012 (UTC)

::I want to loose everything before the initial release. The old versions are only working copys and not for public view. Therefore I use my sandbox and copy&amp;paste. In a few days I will clean up my sandbox. --[[User:Kelti|Kelti]] ([[User talk:Kelti|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelti|contribs]]) 19:26, 22 May 2012 (UTC)

== Conservation of know how ==

I thought the [[Structured Query Language/SQL: The Standard ISO IEC 9075 and various Implementations#Benefit of Standardization|last paragraph]] weird. Is it really worth to say that? Almost all the computing technologies will have this aspect. Is it a comparison with ancestor tools that didn't have this aspect? [[User:Ftiercel|Ftiercel]] ([[User talk:Ftiercel|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Ftiercel|contribs]]) 20:08, 6 June 2012 (UTC)
: You may be right. This information is not very significant as it applies to other standards and industrie-standards as well. If you think the paragraph should be removed you can do so. --[[User:Kelti|Kelti]] ([[User talk:Kelti|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Kelti|contribs]]) 18:42, 7 June 2012 (UTC)</text>

== Biographical Information ==
On July 30th, 1960, in Bern, Switzerland Marcus Pfister[http://www.marcuspfister.ch/] was born. Pfister has become a world renowned children's author, but he started as a graphic designer. He attended the Art School of Bern and completed an apprenticeship as a graphic designer. After this, Marcus took off for six months traveling through the continent of North America and upon his return he began work as an independent graphic designer. From this work, Pfister began creating sketches for his first book that was published in 1986 and titled ''''The Sleepy Owl''. This work did not sky rocket Marcus onto the children's author scene, in fact it wasn't until 1992 that he became a well known author. In 1992 Marcus Pfister published ''Rainbow Fish''. He is currently living in Bern with his family, and since 1992, he has published 49 books. His book tours have taken him all over the world, and his books have been translated into more than 50 languages.

== Illustrating Styles ==
Marcus Pfister has been known for creating vibrant illustrations. The majority of his illustrations are done with watercolors. Like most illustrators, Marcus creates his rough sketches before he begins the illustrations on the final paper. When preparing for a piece, he stretches a paper over a wooden board so the paper does not shrink up when finished. From there, Marcus draws the illustrations in pencil from the rough sketches. He then begins the painting process. When it is finished and dried, the picture is cut off of the board. 
Another technique Marcus Pfister is known for is using foil stamping. Several of his books feature this technique, specifically the ''Rainbow Fish'' series. The foil stamping is completed as the final step of an illustration. Marcus leaves one part of the picture traced with a black marker and covered with a transparent film. This part of the picture is then stamped with the holographic foil after the pages are printed and before they are bound together.

''The Rainbow Fish''[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rainbow_Fish] was the first book by Marcus Pfister that gained him recognition in the realm of children's authors. First published in 1992, ''The Rainbow Fish'' [http://www.marcuspfister.ch/evolution.htm]is a great example of a multimodal piece of literature. The illustrations of this book expand the meaning of the text. The pictures provide the reader with more information that is necessary to the story, creating a very enjoyable reading experience. Since being published, ''The Rainbow Fish'' has remained on bestseller lists throughout the United States and has been translated into over 50 different languages. 

''Rainbow Fish to the Rescue'' is the sequel to the national bestseller, ''The Rainbow Fish''. In this book, Marcus Pfister continues his excellence in illustrations with the same water color and foil stamping techniques. Again, his illustrations speak as loud as the words and offer more insight to the stories. The pictures could stand alone and the reader would still know the plot of the story. The words however do offer a multimodal aspect of literature. Marcus Pfister uses typesetting to have some words in the story express more meaning. By doing this, it excites the reader and keeps them entertained and engaged as they finish reading the story. 

''Rainbow Fish and the Big Blue Whale'' comes third in the ''Rainbow FIsh'' series. This story has similar features to the first two books in the series that make it a good book. The pictures offer insight to the story and are very visually appealing. Another feature this story offers that is also similar to the first two is musical language. The water colors and foil stamps of the illustrations bring the readers in, and so does the musical language that the story starts with. It establishes a pattern on the first page. While the pattern does not continue throughout the entire book, it starts with this musical language to engage the reader. 

''Hopper'' is the first of it's series. In this book, the illustrations are very similar to those in the ''Rainbow Fish'' series. This book has the same color tones as the pages of the ''Rainbow Fish'' books and also uses watercolors. The big difference in the pictures is the lack of foil stamping in ''Hopper''. Hidden on one of the pages is an owl that is painted the same way as the owl in his first book, ''The Sleepy Owl''. That is a nice touch that connects the reader to the author's other works. Having this in the book rouses the reader to look into other collections by Marcus Pfister. 

''Holey Moley'' is a wonderful story about two brothers that couldn't be more opposite. One mole brother wants to live the traditional mole life, while the other would prefer to build a hill instead of dig a hole. This story has the same great water color illustrations as most of Pfister's books do. It also has very engaging dialogue. During a fight between the two brothers, they both use dialogue that is trying to hurt the other ones feelings, and the reader is able to tell they do not mean it. This shows their feelings for each other even during a fight. 

''Rainbow Fish Discovers the Deep Sea'' brings back all the characters you have grown to love from the ''Rainbow Fish'' series. In this story, Rainbow Fish sets off on another adventure, this time to the depths of the ocean. The illustrations alone are enough to pull in a reader. They add so much more to the story and they could stand alone and the reader would still know what is going on. However, the words of the story start out using musical language that draws in the reader even more. The language used repeated tones and provided a cadence for the reader to get into the story. This book was a great addition to the acclaimed ''Rainbow Fish'' series.

:Write an introduction to the author that includes biographical information. What is the relationship between the author’s life experiences and his/her books?  Gather biographical information about the author or illustrator that you feel will be of interest to children.  Use at least three sources, one of which must be an article in an educational journal.

== Books of Interest ==

:Select and briefly critically annotate 6 books you feel are representative of his/her work. This will consist of 3-5 sentences that highlight the books’ qualities that meet the criteria of excellence discussed in class, and 1-2 sentences describing how you think the book will invigorate and engage readers.  (Be sure that your annotations primarily refer to the way the book is written and/or illustrated– its literary and artistic merits – and not just to what the book is about.) 

:Compare and contrast the books you have selected.  Describe the author’s style, any recurrent themes and other distinguishing characteristics of the author’s work.  What generalizations would you like students to be able to make about the books?

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Biography ==
Laura Resau writes books set in Latin America or among Latin American immigrants to the United States.  She has lived and traveled in Mexico.  She was born in Baltimore City.  She went to Saint Mary's College in Southern Maryland.  She got a B.A. in Anthropology and French and then decided to teach English in Oaxaca, Mexico.  While there she was able to learn Spanish and some of Mixteco, the indigenous language.  She was also able to participate in some indigenous cultural traditions.  Because of this experience she is able to translate the world of the indigenous people of Mexico for her readers.  She does this best in her book ''What the Moon Saw''.  Her other books include ''Red Glass'', ''Queen of the Water'', ''Star in the Forest'' and the trilogy; ''The Indigo Notebook'', ''The Ruby Notebook'' and ''The Jade Notebook''.  Resau lives in Fort Collins, Colorado with her husband, Ian, and her son.  It is from there she has written most of her books. Laura won the IRA award, which honors promising writers of young adult literature, for her book Red Glass.

== Books of Interest ==

''What the Moon Saw'' (Delacorte 2006)
This book is a beautifully written book set in rural Mexico.  It is a great example of Magical Realism.  Resau does a wonderful job of handling issues like immigration, identity and loss while immersing us in the indigenous culture of Southern Mexico.  Young Adult readers will be drawn in by the well developed characters, the intriguing setting and the romance mixed with mysticism. 

''Red Glass'' (Delacorte 2007)

In this story about the meaning of family, Resau weaves a coming of age story about a girl, a boy found in the desert and teenager looking for his roots.  There is death, romance, adventure and plenty of memorable characters. The language is rich and full of imagery. Resau takes a current issue,illegal immigration and puts a human face on it.  A young boy is the only survivor of a family that tries to cross the desert into the United States from Mexico.  Each chapter begins with a quote from ''The Little Prince'' by Antoine de Saint-Exupery.  These quotes mirror Sophie's, the narrator's, thoughts and the little boy found in the desert.  When Sophie goes on a trip to take him back to Mexico romance develops between her and a fellow traveler, who is going back to Guatemala to find his mom.  Red Glass has won many awards.

''Star in the Forest'' (Delacorte 2010)

Written for 8-10 year olds, Resau tells the story of how current immigration laws in the United States effect families through the eyes of a young girl.  The story includes a bit of mysticism as Zitlally befriends a stray dog that seems to have a connection to her father.  Zitlally's father was deported when he was pulled over for speeding.  The book is sensitive and mystical and is a beautifully told story of friendship that I think would appeal to this age group
 
''Queen of Water'' (Delacorte 2011)

This book is written in collaboration with Maria Virginia Farinango.  It tells her story as an indigenous child who goes to work as a maid at the age of eight.  It is very sensitively written, even though the story involves exploitation, sexual abuse, and alcoholism.  It is a true story about the mestizo and the indigenous people of Ecuador.  Even though it is a true story, the descriptions are rich and transport you to the Ecuadoran Andes and the market place of Otavalo.  Because of the subject matter, it is probably best for ages 14 and up.  It is also a complex story of divided loyalties and difficult situations intended for a more mature audience.

''The Indigo Notebook'' (Delacorte 2009)

The first book in Resau's trilogy is about a mother with wanderlust and a daughter who yearns for stability.  Resau explores the culture of Ecuador in this novel about a mother who moves to a new country every year.  It is a nice depiction of role reversal, that many children experience if the have mothers with mental illness or addictions.  Even though this mother has neither, the role reversal as her daughter takes on the responsible role is believable and will hit home for some readers.  There is also a romance, which is appealing to young adult readers.

The Ruby Notebook'' (Delacorte, 2009), 

The second book, in the notebook trilogy follows the same characters as the first book, but now they are in France, with a bit of mystery and possible new love interests.  This book will appeal to young adult girls in particular, who are trying to sort out the conflicting feeling they have towards possible love interest. The story is beautifully written, with wonderful descriptions of France and well developed characters.  This book has mystery and magic.  It also contains deep insights on life as well. 

''The Jade Notebook'' (Delacorte. 2012.)

The third book in the trilogy, ''The Jade Notebook'' is set in Mexico.  It is a satisfying conclusion to Zeeta's story.  As with her other books, there is mystery, mysticism romance and life lessons.  The story delights on so many levels. Resau's incredible descriptions show her off as not just a fabulous story teller, but a skilled writer.  She uses metaphors effortlessly and her descriptions are fresh and original.  She also knows how to draw the young adult crowd in with a finely unwoven mystery and a compelling romance.

== Laura Resau Work ==

Although Laura Resau has a wide range of settings, characters and story her books all carry a common theme probably best illustrated by the fact that she donates a portion of her proceeds to indigenous rights groups.  All of her books treat indigenous people with respect.  She honors the indigenous beliefs and her books decry the poor treatment they receive.  She shows in all of her books the difficult decisions many indigenous people make because of their social status.  Another thing that is common throughout her books, is her familiarity with her subject.  In ''What the Moon Saw'' she draws on her journals kept doing her teaching in Mexico.  In ''A Star in the Forest'' and ''The Red Glass'' her stories comes from her experience with immigrants while teaching ESL in the United States.  The ''Queen of the Water'' came about through her friendship with an Indigenous woman from Ecuador, who wanted to tell her story.  All of her books are set in places she has lived in or visited.  Another common theme throughout her works of fiction is her use of magical Realism.  



=== Reviews ===

''The Jade Note Book'': &quot;...tackles familial and romantic relationships, corruption, and ecological issues with veracity and complexity. Secondary characters are well formed and intrinsic to the plot development. The lush descriptions, intermittent action sequences, and sprinkling of fantasy all come together to form an engaging reading experience that will delight teens looking for a more mature story.&quot;  Nicole Politi, The Ocean County Library, Toms River, NJ

''The Queen of Water'': &quot;Rooted in Farinango’s true story, the honest,first-person, present-tense narrative is occasionally detailed and repetitive, but it dramatizes the classic search for home with rare complexity and no sentimentality or easy resolutions&quot; Rochman, Hazel. Booklist, 2/15/2011, Vol. 107 Issue 12, p68, 1p

''What the Moon Saw'': &quot;Beautifully written, this is filled with evocative language that is rich in imagery and nuance and speaks to the connections that bind us all. Add a thrilling adventure and all the makings of an entrancing read are here.&quot;   Kirkus Reviews, 9/1/2006, Vol. 74 Issue 17, p912-912, 1/5p

      <text xml:space="preserve">When you think of France, you think of a country in Europe, right? Well, France is more than just that part! Two parts of France are located in North America: Guadeloupe and Martinique, both islands in the Caribbean sea (France also has territories in North America - see [[Wikijunior:North America/Saint Martin|Saint Martin]], [[Wikijunior:North America/Saint Barthélemy|Saint Barthélemy]], [[Wikijunior:North America/Clipperton Island|Clipperton Island]], and [[Wikijunior:North America/Saint Pierre and Miquelon|Saint Pierre and Miquelon]]).

Guadeloupe and Martinique are in the Caribbean, and so are tropical. They were very important to France for their sugar plantations.

==NEO Ore Types==

An ore is a raw material whose composition is of economic value.  On Earth, we generally class as ores those source rocks which are particularly high in one component.  In space, the current cost of almost everything is thousands of times higher than on Earth, so almost any kind of mass has economic value.  Raw unprocessed rock can be used for radiation shielding, so even that has considerable value.  So we consider all NEOs to be ores, but they still have differing compositions which makes them suited for different uses.  As noted on Page 1, we don't yet have very good data on the bulk composition and distribution of materials for most Near Earth Objects, but we can make a list of general categories based on observations of the larger main belt asteroids, meteorites, and the small fraction of NEOs with observed spectra.  The main categories in the widely used Tholen '''[[w:Asteroid_spectral_types|Asteroid Spectral Types]]''' are further subdivided into distinct subtypes.  The main types are:

====C-group====

These represent 75% of asteroids in general, and an undetermined but probably similar fraction of NEOs.  These have a similar composition to the Sun and the original Solar nebula from which the Solar System formed, minus Hydrogen, Helium, and some volatile compounds.  The missing components are gases at the temperature and pressure of NEOs, and so have evaporated away.  Unlike the Gas Giant planets, NEOs have no gravity well to speak of to trap these light components.  The spectra of these objects are similar to the '''[[w:Carbonaceous_chondrite|Carbonaceous Chondrite]]''' type meteorites, which are assumed to come from the same source bodies.  Specific types within the C-group are enriched or depleted of specific components. Typically they consist of a physical mix of grains of different composition, including a significant Iron-Nickel component (3-20% depending on subtype), mineral silicates and oxides, sulfides, water (up to 22%), and organic (Carbon) compounds from which the group gets it's name.  C-group objects are very dark, with an '''albedo''' (reflectivity in sunlight) of 0.03 to 0.10, so they are hard to spot initially. Initial size estimates tend to underestimate their size, since those are based on average albedos, which are assumed to be 0.10.

====S-type====

This represents about 17% of asteroids in general, and get their name after their '''Stony''' makeup.  They contain mostly iron and magnesium silicates, but without the carbon in the C type.  They originate from the inner Main Belt asteroids, where they are dominant at &lt;2.2 AU, common at &lt;3 AU, and rare farther out.

====X-Group====

These include the high metallic fraction asteroids, ranging from 50 to 100% metals, with the remainder as stony inclusions.  Some of them are nickel-iron alloy, thought to come from the metallic core of larger asteroids which were later destroyed.  The remainder are thought to have crystallized without separating in bulk from smaller asteroid bodies or being exposed to high temperatures.  Therefore the metallic parts have different compositions.

====Other Types====

There are a number of other groups, the A, D, T, Q, R, and V-types, which are present in small numbers, but do not form a coherent large group by composition.


==Example Mining Missions==

There are approximately 600,000 known minor planets of all types throughout the Solar System. '''[[w:Near-Earth object|Near Earth Objects]]''' (NEOs) are the subset of about 9,300 known minor planets which approach within 1.3 times the Earth's distance from the Sun (1.3 AU).  This is substantially closer than Mars' orbit (1.52 AU) and the Main Belt asteroids (mostly 2.1-3.3 AU), and therefore easier to reach from Earth.

Newly discovered minor planets get identified by year and a serial number within the year, such as '''[[w:2011_AG5|2011 AG5]]'''.  When their orbits are better determined, they get a permanent serial number and possibly a name, such as '''(1) Ceres''' or '''(4) Vesta'''.  A 2011 study by Landau and Strange at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory ([http://www.kiss.caltech.edu/workshops/space-challenge2011/references/asteroids-classification-and-study/Near%20Earth%20Asteroid%20Accessible%20to%20Human%20Exploration_Landau_Strange.pdf '''Near Earth Asteroids Accessible to Human Exploration'''] AAS 11-446) tabulates a number of such with particularly easy to reach orbits. Their estimated masses range from 50 tons to 6 billion tons (for (175706) 1996 FG3) so in most cases bringing back the the entire object is not practical for an early mining mission.  Instead, we will look at several mining mission types with different difficulties and time frames when you would consider doing them:

:* Mining the Earth's Debris Belt
:* Return an entire small (~500 ton) NEO, 
:* Gather 1000 tons of unprocessed regolith from the surface of a larger object, 
:* Extracting fuel onsite and pushing the entire object towards Earth, and 
:* Extracting finished materials and only returning those to Earth.  


==Debris Belt Mining==

This would both be a demonstration of mining techniques, such as capturing a non-cooperating target, and also be useful by removing hazards from Earth orbit.  The '''Debris Belt''' is the accumulated defunct spacecraft and pieces of spacecraft from accidental explosions and collisions.  By combining atmosphere mining for fuel, and electric propulsion, sufficient velocity capacity would be available to rendezvous with the scattered objects and either return them to an Assembly Platform for recycling, or to a low enough orbit where drag will quickly cause them to re-enter.  For efficiency, multiple objects in similar orbits would be collected on a single trip, and several collector ships of different sizes would be used.  It would not be efficient to send a large ship after a small object.  The debris belt is currently about ten times the hazard of natural meteoroids, so cleaning up this trash would greatly reduce the hazards to functioning spacecraft, for which the operators (or their insurance companies) should be willing to pay.

Some non-functional spacecraft only have a single failed part, or ran out of fuel, and could be made to operate again.  In that case they can repaired and placed back in service.  Others could be salvaged for parts, or their materials recycled.  Anything not useable would be disposed of by re-entry.  Such a salvage and repair business could pay for itself.

==Small NEO Return Mission==

'''Purpose''' - Return an entire small asteroid to near Earth as a demonstration, for scientific examination, and for prototyping processing methods.

'''Description''' - The Keck Institute for Space Studies performed a study in 2011-2012 in some detail of returning an entire small NEO about 7 meters in diameter and 250-1300 tons in mass (see '''[http://www.nss.org/settlement/asteroids/Asteroid_Retrieval_Feasibility_Study_2012.pdf Asteroid Retrieval Feasibility Study]''' or '''[http://kiss.caltech.edu/study/asteroid/asteroid_final_report.pdf Alternate Source]''').  The NEO would be bagged in it's entirety by an inflatable structure that is then cinched down for transport. Due to the low gravity of such a small object, this method will prevent loss of any dust and rocks from its surface. Small objects are hard to characterize from the Earth, which accounts for the large range in mass estimate.  If a small flyby or orbiter mission is sent ahead of time, the mass and other characteristics can be better determined. This will likely be required before doing detailed design of the mining tug.

'''Assumptions''' - As for any technical study, the assumptions made affect the results. Major assumptions include:

* The starting point is Low Earth Orbit and the destination is high Lunar orbit for the returned NEO, after which it would be examined scientifically and processed for materials. Lunar gravity assist is used in both directions in the mission. This mission requires a total velocity of 9.56 km/s for a particular NEO selected to model the design around.
* It is performed as a complete mission with a single launch on an Atlas V 551-class launcher and a single spacecraft.  This limits the total spacecraft mass at launch, including having all the propellant pre-loaded. It also limits the solar array size to what can be deployed automatically from a single payload volume.
* The propulsion system uses 40 kW net at end of life (plus 1.2 kW for other electrical needs), and has an estimated mass not counting propellant tanks of 1,370 kg, thus a power/mass ratio of 33.25 kg/kW. The power system is 60% efficient, and assumes the solar arrays lose 20% of their original efficiency traveling outward from the Earth's radiation belts. It uses 5 x 10 kW ion thrusters with an exhaust velocity of 30 km/s. The Xenon propellant has a tank mass fraction of 4.25% above the propellant mass.

'''Results''' - Overall spacecraft start mass is estimated at 14.7 to 18.8 tons for returning 250 to 1300 tons, thus providing a 17 to 69 NEO return mass/spacecraft mass ratio. Fuel consumed is from to 8.8 to 12.9 tons, giving an NEO mass/fuel mass ratio of 28 to 101. This mission was designed as a single return mission, but if sufficient propellant can be extracted from an NEO, ranging from 1-4% of its mass, future missions can be self-sustaining on fuel.  With 40 kW power for propulsion, the total mission time ranges from 4.0 to 10.2 years depending on asteroid mass.  The NEO mass return rate is then 62.5 to 127.5 tons per year.  If higher return rates are needed, larger solar panels and higher power thrusters would be needed, scaling approximately linearly with mass return rate.  At some power level solar panels will get unreasonably large and you would need multiple spacecraft.  Current Space Station array size, if replaced with modern cells, would be around 300 kW, and a practical limit might be 2 MW for a truss with multiple arrays and thrusters. Large arrays would break the single launch with no orbital assembly assumption. For higher power levels than what is practical for solar, a nuclear reactor would be the likely power source.


==Bulk Regolith Return Mission==

'''Purpose''' - Return a maximum of 1000 tons of bulk NEO surface material (regolith) per trip to feed a processing plant in High Earth Orbit (HEO).

'''Description''' -   HEO is from 10 Earth radii (above the radiation belts) to the limits of the Earth-Moon system.  Because gravity decreases as the inverse square of distance, all HEO locations have similar velocity requirements and are near Earth escape.  An HEO location minimizes the total round-trip velocity for each asteroid mission.  The Mining Tug is assumed to make repeat trips using part of the extracted propellant from the previous trip to refuel with.  Asteroid orbits close to the Earth's are low energy, but also low difference in orbit period.  Therefore they come close to the Earth at long intervals, and are not good candidates for successive trips.  Thus different destination asteroids are chosen for each trip based on orbital opportunities.  Major parts of the Mining Tug, like the solar arrays and thrusters,  are repaired or replaced as needed at the processing plant to keep the Tug functioning.  The tug is therefore designed for orbital assembly and refueling, both to reduce initial component launch masses from Earth and to enable maintenance/upgrades. 

'''Assumptions'''

* A radiation-hardened solar array is used to transit through the Van Allen radiation belts to High Earth Orbit.  The radiation protection uses cover glass over the solar cells, which absorbs the radiation before it can damage the active layers in the cells.  The cover glass adds mass and slightly lowers efficiency by absorbing and reflecting some of the sunlight. Lower mass and more efficient arrays are used for transit from the processing plant to the NEO's and back.  The high efficiency arrays are folded and protected by radiation shielding during delivery to HEO. Unprotected arrays can lose 20% of their efficiency passing through the radiation belt under their own power, so using a hardened array for that job makes a significant difference.
* The Small NEO Return Mission captured an entire small NEO with minimal disturbance to preserve science.  This mission assumes gathering 1000 tons of surface rocks and dust from a larger NEO for easier processing once returned.  Larger NEOs are easier to detect and determine properties from Earth, thus giving more mission candidates.  This will lower the mission velocities slightly by having more to choose from, and allow a better schedule for later missions.
* Higher exhaust velocity is used to save propellant, and higher power is used for faster transit times. For a production mining operation efficiency and annual mass delivered are important.  Propellant is assumed to be Oxygen since that can be extracted in large quantities in all but metallic type NEOs. This makes the mining operation self-sustaining on fuel. We assume the Ad Astra VASIMR plasma thruster and solar arrays have a combined mass of 10 kg/kW, exhaust velocity of 50 km/s, and Oxygen propellant tank mass fraction of 10%. (source: Ad Astra Rocket Company '''[http://www.adastrarocket.com/VASIMR_for_flexible_space_exploration.pdf A Survey of Missions using VASIMR for Flexible Space Exploration]''', 2010).
* The first trip may fetch a smaller load, such as 200 tons, to reduce the original fuel mass required from Earth, and make the second trip sooner to bootstrap fuel production.  As much as half this mass is Oxygen of varying extraction difficulty, which is more than enough to fuel full loads on later trips.

'''Calculations'''

:'''''Trajectory:''''' 

For mission planning in general, we work backwards from the destination to find out what we need to start with. We assume you can use Lunar Gravity Assist in both directions to help depart and return to Earth orbit.  This mission does not need to return to Low Earth Orbit (LEO), but some final products will. Aerobrake passes through the upper atmosphere can be used for smaller cargo returns to LEO and save fuel. There are several detailed trajectory simulation programs to calculate exact trajectories to a known destination and back. For now, we don't know which NEO we are going to or when. In fact, it may not even be discovered yet.  For now propulsion will be calculated based on generic propulsive velocity required of 4 km/s outbound and 1 km/s inbound.

About 1% of known NEOs have an ideal velocity to reach from LEO of 4.5 km/s or less (see previous page).  It is assumed that future discoveries will maintain the proportion of low velocity candidates. Of those candidates, a subset will have suitable size, composition, and orbit timing.  Starting from HEO ( &gt; 64,000 km radius ), velocity to reach Lunar flyby will be about 1.2 km/s, and Solar orbit change to reach the NEO will be about 2.8 km/s.  We choose an NEO which will make a close pass to the Earth at the time we want to return from it. That way we can make a relatively small velocity change to set up an Earth or Moon gravity assist to help with the return trip.  Since the mass will be much larger on the return leg, optimizing for this part reduces total propellant required.  The return velocity is then estimated at 1 km/s.

:'''''Propellant:'''''

A 200 kW plasma thruster is in development, so if we have 5 of them plus a 1 MW solar array, the estimated hardware mass is 10 tons.  The plasma thruster has an exhaust velocity of 50 km/s, so from the rocket equation we can calculate the mass ratio is 1.02 to produce 1 km/s velocity change on the return trip.  Mass values will be given for both 200 and 1000 tons returned respectively in parentheses as (200,1000) tons. Given an end mass of (210,1010) tons (vehicle hardware plus returned regolith), the fuel for this part of the mission is (4.24,20.4) tons.  On the outgoing leg of the mission we assume 4 km/s is required.  The mass ratio is thus 1.083 against an empty vehicle mass of 10 tons, plus (4.24,20.4) tons fuel for the return trip, so (1.19,2.5) tons of fuel are needed for this part.  Thus total fuel needed is (5.43, 22.9) tons. 

The overall return ratio is 200 or 1000 tons regolith vs 5.43 or 22.9 tons fuel, or 37 to 43:1.  This is a very attractive ratio as long as we can extract a reasonable fraction of the regolith mass as useful products.  In particular, if we can extract at least 23 tons of Oxygen, or 11.5% of the first trip's returned mass, the later full mining missions become self-sustaining on fuel, and the return ratio over the life of the mining vehicle goes up dramatically.  If the vehicle can make 5-10 trips before major hardware replacement, the net mass returned after fuel used will be 4100 to 9000 tons against a launch mass of 15.5 tons, for an overall return ratio of 264 to 580.

The particular numbers above will change according to which NEO you select, and which start and end dates are used for a mission. At present the known collection of NEOs is growing by 10% a year, and this is expected to accelerate as larger telescopes come on line, so there are more to choose from over time.  NEOs are always moving in their respective orbits, so their distance from Earth constantly changes, and thus so does the mission path.  Each thruster uses 9.85 kg of fuel per day.  With 5 thrusters that becomes 49.25 kg/day at full power. From the total amount of fuel used we can calculate the engine run times as 110 and 465 days, and the total trip will be that plus whatever coasting time is needed due to orbit positions, and time at the NEO to do the mining.  Very roughly we allow 200 days coast time and 100 days mining time, and thus a total trip time of 1.125 to 2.1 years.  

The original assumption of 1000 tons returned is not a fixed requirement.  Within reason that can be larger or smaller, as long as the main components of the mining ship scale linearly.  Plasma thrusters are not as efficient at lower power levels, so below about 80 kW it will make sense to use ion thrusters.  For reliability, one or two spare engines should be added above the number needed for propulsion.  Large solar arrays by their nature have enough duplicated parts to be reliable.


==Large NEO Return Mission==

'''Purpose'' - Return a whole larger NEO to Earth Orbit for later mining.  This would be second-generation mining with substantial markets and infrastructure required.

'''Description''' - We will use the example of '''[[w:2011_AG5|2011 AG5]]''', an NEO expected to pass within 300,000 km of the Earth in 2040.  The objective is to shift it's orbit enough to do a gravity flyby in 2040, to set up for capture into the Earth-Moon system later.  Once captured, it is then mined for materials.  Given an estimated mass of 4 million tons, electric thrusters using solar arrays do not seem feasible.  Several approaches are possible:

* Use a powerful nuclear reactor or solar concentrating thermal-electric generator to supply power to larger plasma thrusters.  The fuel comes from the asteroid itself, which requires an extraction plant on-site. Such a large operation might require setting up a habitat and crew on the asteroid to operate and control it.  For a 500 m/s propulsive change, 40,000 tons of fuel would be required.  If we allow 5 years to make the velocity change, then 8,000 tons a year are needed.

* Put a container around the NEO so material is not lost, add or build a pusher plate/shock absorber unit made from asteroid material, and use one or more small nuclear devices to make the velocity change.  The energy to change the asteroid velocity by 500 m/s is 125 kJ/kg, thus the total energy needed is 500 TeraJoules.  This is equivalent to 120 kiloTons of TNT in energy, plus an efficiency factor.  If the pusher plate is 25% efficient in capturing the explosive energy, then 500 kT of devices are needed, divided into however many units are needed to match the shock absorber and container strength.  Use of nuclear devices presents obvious hazards, as does any asteroid material return when the impact energy from objects approaching Earth is 15 times their mass in TNT.  


==Product Return Mission==

'''Purpose''' - Set up a processing plant on the NEO, and only return finished items rather than bulk regolith.

'''Description''' - The farther from Earth the final user is, the more it makes sense to process the NEO material from a nearby asteroid, rather than returning to Earth orbit first, and then send out again to the final location.  For multiple destinations, this would imply multiple processing plants, so they would need to be smaller and more efficient to operate than a centralized plant somewhere near Earth/


==Mining Tug Design==

(this section is preliminary)

Small asteroids are typically rotating.  So the mining concept is to enter synchronous orbit around the body, and using some method like sending down a scoop on a cable to haul materials up to the tug.  This avoids the issues of trying to land on a moving target, and the relatively low thrust-to-mass of a loaded tug, which might have difficulty getting off even a small asteroid.  Another reason to avoid landing is losing power from being on the night side of the asteroid.  In theory landing at a pole of the asteroid simplifies the moving target problem, but that restricts your choice of mining locations.

Sufficiently small objects would not have much rotation velocity, but have the problem of staying attached if you land.  We do not know enough about surface cohesion yet to design anchor systems.  It may be necessary to run cables entirely around the object in order to stay anchored.

My real name is Allen. I enjoy writing and proofreading, and am native English speaker. For historical perspective, I joined on 14 Jan 2012, during the [[w:Wikipedia:SOPA_initiative|SOPA discussion]], but really started editing on 18 Mar 2012. Because I enjoy writing and copyediting, and frequently indulge in Wikipedia reading sessions (which occasionally get out of hand), becoming a Wikipedian and Wikibookian was a natural step. As of 2014, I'm a high school student.

Interests: [[w:computer programming|programming]], [[w:cryptography|cryptography]], [[w:languages|languages]].

Wikipedia articles I've worked on:
:[[w:French dip sandwich|French dip sandwich]]

I've worked on:
:[[Chinese (Mandarin)]]
:[[TI-Basic Z80 Programming]]
:[[Wikijunior:Languages]]
:[[Cookbook:Anzac Biscuits]]
:[[Transportation Economics]], in preparation for when it might be featured ([[Wikibooks:FBN#Transportation_Economics|see discussion]]).
As you can see from the wikiboxes, I haven't yet deeply mastered a particular programming language. After going around wikibooks for a while, I've made one observation: ''There's a wikibook for everything, it's just unfinished.'' Time to ready your keyboards.

Some of my favorite activities are converting lists to wikitables ([[Chinese (Mandarin)/Radicals|Chinese (Mandarin)/Radicals]]); fixing spelling, grammar, and sentence structure; making things shorter and easier to read (my favorite); laying out the table of contents of a wikibook ([http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Transportation_Economics&amp;oldid=2358215 Transportation Economics], [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=Movie_Making_Manual&amp;oldid=2361629 Movie Making Manual]); and putting {{tl|clear}} in the right place ([https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Wikipedia:Department_of_Fun&amp;diff=prev&amp;oldid=496987021 Department of Fun]). My most epic series of edits occurred on [[Chinese (Mandarin)/Slang|Chinese (Mandarin)/Slang]].

My editing habits: I'm a frequent reader, and am constantly making small edits. I'll occasionally go through phases where I contribute more, depending on my free time and if I happen to find an interesting topic. I also enjoy reading user pages (which I find mainly through article histories and talk page discussions, though I'll occasionally browse from a category).

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

Uses [[MediaWiki:Common.css/top.css|CSS]] and [[MediaWiki:Common.js/top.js|JavaScript]] to position chapter navigations at both the top and bottom of a page. Use template only once per page. The template adds:

# '''Top of page''': Navigation for the previous and next pages of the book.
# '''Bottom of page''': Navigation for previous page, table of contents, and next page of the book.
# Book category or optionally another category (e.g. a chapter) in its place, and sorts by chapter name.

=== Usage ===
: {{tlx|chapter navigation|optional previous page name|optional next page name|optional category (if not book category)}}, or
: {{tlx|chapnav|optional previous page name|optional next page name|optional category (if not book category)}} as shortcut

For first and last chapter of a book, leave first or second field blank respectively:

: {{tlx|chapter navigation||next subpage name}} first chapter
: {{tlx|chapter navigation|previous subpage name}} last chapter

Pages are added to the book category unless another category is specified as the third parameter.

This can also be expanded to list the chapters of a book. See {{tl|Learning Theories/Navigation}} and {{tl|Chess/Navigation}} for examples.

=== Example ===
See [[Rhetoric and Composition/Narration]] for an example. The code &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{chapter navigation|Description|Exposition}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; is used at the bottom of the page.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

=== Usage ===
This template takes six optional variables.

{| style=&quot;width:100%&quot;
 ! style=&quot;width: 50%&quot; | MediaWiki syntax !! Displays as
 |-
 | &lt;pre style=&quot;border:0px&quot;&gt;{{Navigate
 | Book = Geometry for Elementary School
 | Curr = Introduction
 | Next = Our tools: Ruler and compass}}&lt;/pre&gt;
 | {{Navigate|Book=Geometry for Elementary School|Curr=Introduction||Next=Our tools: Ruler and compass|example=yes}}
 |-
 | &lt;pre  style=&quot;border:0px&quot;&gt;{{Navigate
 | Book = Geometry for Elementary School
 | Curr = Copying a triangle
 | Prev = Copying a line segment
 | Next = Copying an angle}}&lt;/pre&gt;
 | {{Navigate|Book=Geometry for Elementary School|Curr=Copying a triangle|Prev=Copying a line segment|Next=Copying an angle|example=yes}}
 |-
 | &lt;pre  style=&quot;border:0px&quot;&gt;{{Navigate
 | Book = Geometry for Elementary School
 | Curr = Copying a triangle
 | Prev = Copying a line segment
 | Next = Copying an angle}}
 | PrevText = Prev: Copying a line segment
 | NextText = Next: Copying an angle}}&lt;/pre&gt;
 | {{Navigate|Book=Geometry for Elementary School|Curr=Copying a triangle|Prev=Copying a line segment|PrevText=Prev: Copying a line segment|Next=Copying an angle|NextText=Next: Copying an angle|example=yes}}
 |-
 | &lt;pre  style=&quot;border:0px&quot;&gt;{{Navigate
 | Book = Geometry for Elementary School
 | Curr = Angles
 | Prev = Lines}}&lt;/pre&gt;
 | {{Navigate|Book=Geometry for Elementary School|Curr=Angles|Prev=Lines|example=yes}}
 |}

Note that the &lt;code&gt;Book&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Curr&lt;/code&gt; variables default to the book and current sub-page names, respectively. Most cases should not require setting these.

Note that the &lt;code&gt;PrevText&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;NextText&lt;/code&gt; variables override the default display of the target so an alternative text may be substituted.

==Wikipedia links==
I have noticed that quite a lot of [[w:Wikibooks|Wikibooks]] use links to [[Wikipedia]] regularly. At the same time however, they link to other [[m:Wikibooks|Wikibooks]] and other chapters of the same book. It is, of course, impossible to tell wether the link is internal, to another book, or to [[commons:category:Wikipedia|Wikipedia]] without clicking on it or hovering over it. This can be extremely bothersome to a reader, who may want to read a Wikibook or chapter on the subject, but not a Wikipedia article. The reader can not tell until he or she has clicked on it where it is going. An example from [[C++ Programming]]:

{{quote|[[w:Bjarne Stroustrup|Bjarne Stroustrup]], a Computer Scientist from [[w:Bell Labs|Bell Labs]], was the designer and original implementer of '''C++''' (originally named &quot;C with Classes&quot;) during the 1980s as an enhancement to the [[Subject:C programming language|C programming language]]. Enhancements started with the addition [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/Paradigms#Object-oriented_programming|object-oriented]] concepts like [[C++ Programming/Classes|classes]], followed by, among many features, [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/Paradigms/Polymorphism|virtual functions]], [[C++ Programming/Operators/Operator Overloading|operator overloading]], [[C++ Programming/Programming Languages/Paradigms/Inheritance|multiple inheritance]], [[C++ Programming/Templates|templates]], and [[C++ Programming/Exception Handling|exception handling]]. These and other features are covered in detail along this book.}}

The first two links link to Wikipedia pages, the second links to a Wikibooks subject page, and the rest link to other chapters of the same book. Wikipedia links are useful, of course, because they can link to related pages that the Wikibook does not deal with. For example, a Wikibook about the French language may say that French is also spoken in Monaco, but a reader might like to know where Monaco is and the book does not want to waste time explaining it, as it is not directly relevant. A link to Wikipedia becomes very useful in cases like this. But Wikibooks should try not to rely on Wikipedia too much, and so a link to it should appear different than one to a chapter within the Wikibook or another Wikibook. After all, books should be encased within themselves and not need to rely on the explanation of an encyclopedia or another book. Can you imagine how annoying it would be to have a math text book that makes you go look up what a quadratic function is? 

So my proposal here is to use the project-wide CSS page to make ''all links to other projects look different'' than inter-chapter and inter-book links. This could be done with a slightly different color or font, or something similar to (but different than) the way external links appear (with the arrow thing like this - [http://www.wikibooks.org external link]). 

This would really facilitate the reading experience, and make this project less dependent on Wikipedia. After all, Wikibooks [[WB:NOTWP|is not an encylopedia]], and so does not have to conform to the formatting standards of Wikipedia.</text>

This template takes six optional variables.

Note that the &lt;code&gt;Book&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Curr&lt;/code&gt; variables default to the book and current sub-page names, respectively. Most cases should not require setting these.&lt;br /&gt;
Note that the &lt;code&gt;PrevText&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;NextText&lt;/code&gt; variables override the default display of the target so an alternative text may be substituted.

{{Tl|B3D:N2P/NAV}} is a navigation template for the ''[[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro]]'' book.  It generates a navigation bar that looks like this:

{{B3D:N2P/NAV
|next=The Next Page
|previous=The Previous Page
|noCat=1
}}

It also adds the page to [[:Category:Blender 3D: Noob to Pro|the book's category]] or a subcategory thereof, obviating any need for {{Tl|BookCat}}.

===Usage===

Normal usage is to insert the following wiki markup at the top and bottom of each page:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{B3D:N2P/NAV
|next=The Next Page
|previous=The Previous Page
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

replacing &lt;code&gt;The Next Module&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;The Previous Page&lt;/code&gt; with the names of the appropriate modules.

When specifying modules for &lt;code&gt;next=&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;previous=&lt;/code&gt;, omit the &quot;Blender 3D: Noob to Pro/&quot; prefix, which is supplied by the template.  To prevent the template from adding a prefix, use the optional &lt;code&gt;nextFull=&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;previousFull=&lt;/code&gt; parameters in place of &lt;code&gt;next=&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;previous=&lt;/code&gt;.

To avoid adding the page to any categories, specify &lt;code&gt;noCat=1&lt;/code&gt;.

{{Tl|Trig/NAV}} is a navigation template for the ''[[Trigonometry]]'' book - though it can be used in any book.  It generates a navigation bar that looks like this:

{{Trig/NAV
|next=The Next Page
|previous=The Previous Page
|noCat=1
}}

It also adds the page to [[:Category:Trigonometry|the project category]], obviating any need for {{Tl|BookCat}}.

Thanks to the people behind the [[Blender 3D: Noob to Pro]] book for the [[Template:B3D:N2P/NAV|original version]] of this template, which we then modified.

===Usage===

Normal usage is to insert the following wiki markup at the bottom of each page:

&lt;pre&gt;
{{Trig/NAV
|next=The Next Page
|previous=The Previous Page
}}
&lt;/pre&gt;

replacing &lt;code&gt;The Next Page&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;The Previous Page&lt;/code&gt; with the names of the appropriate pages.

When specifying pages for &lt;code&gt;next=&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;previous=&lt;/code&gt;, omit the &quot;Trigonometry/&quot; prefix, which is supplied by the template.  To prevent the template from adding a prefix, use the optional &lt;code&gt;nextFull=&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;previousFull=&lt;/code&gt; parameters in place of &lt;code&gt;next=&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;previous=&lt;/code&gt;.

To avoid adding the page to [[:Category:Trigonometry|the project category]], specify &lt;code&gt;noCat=1&lt;/code&gt;.

===Seed depth and seed spacing===
''Seed depth'' is how deep from the surface of the soil that you dig the hole to put the seed into. You can use a ruler or, some ''[[../Additional items|transplanters]]'' have inches carved into them.

''Seed spacing'' is how far apart you plant the seeds, so that when the plants fully grow their roots have enough space to grow, and so that their stems and leaves can capture enough sunlight to grow.

[[Image:Hobos.jpg|thumb|Two hobos walking along [[railroad tracks]]]]

This wiki book is dedicated to Carl Sandburg, the great American poet who putatively rode the rails and drew upon the true grit of experience to create his masterful collection of poems in which the salt of the earth sprung to life on his pages. This book can be added to, edited, reworded or pictorialized by anyone with access to a computer and the web. It is intended to honor those who choose the cool breeze of freedom as they see the country (US) with the pursuit of life, liberty and personal happiness as the superior option to the routinized mechanisms of ordinary bourgious society. It is intended as a humorous but sincere tribute to the freebooters who challenge the system imposed upon workers rather than an actual &quot;how-to&quot;.

Important disclaimer: This wikibook uses the freedom of speech provisions of the US Constitution however despite what any edits may contend neither wikimedia, its subsidiaries nor any editors actually encourage any unlawful activity. Train hopping is not only illegal it is a highly dangerous activity. However, free flow of information, to the extent it may in any way be implemented, may and should reduce the incidence of injury sustained by any persons who actually may engage in such activity in real life. Also, law enforcement and railroad personnel may utilize these pages to better prevent accidental injuries, which is presumptively the first mandate of the &quot;railroad bulls&quot; who have a legendary affection for the very rascals whom they occasionally arrest. But do not try this stuff at home, it is intended for armchair vagabonds and not for implementation. It is primarily a literary tribute...

'''Chapter One: Introduction'''

'''Freighthopping''' or '''train hopping''' is the act of surreptitiously [[wikt:hitch|hitching]] a [[wikt:ride|ride]] on a [[Rail transport|railroad]] freight [[Railroad car|car]]. In the [[United States]], this became a common means of [[transportation]] following the [[American Civil War]] as the railroads began pushing westward, especially among [[migrant worker]]s who became known as &quot;[[hobo]]s.&quot; It continued to be widely used by those unable to afford other transportation, especially during times of widespread economic dislocation such as the [[Great Depression]]. Today, the practice is forbidden by [[Trespass|statute]] in all states in the U.S., though it is still practiced. In modern day usage, hopping a freight train is also known as &quot;catching out&quot; or &quot;hopping out.&quot;

Many railroads take a strict view of people hopping freight trains, and employ [[railroad police]], also known as &quot;bulls,&quot; in an attempt to prevent the practice. Among other duties, railroad police are charged with preventing [[trespassing]] on railroad property, which includes freighthopping. Railroad police officers typically patrol in utility trucks, [[Sport utility vehicle|SUVs]] (&quot;bullmobiles&quot;), or even standard [[police car]]s. 

==Decline of freighthopping==
In recent decades, the traditional role of hobos as itinerant workers has fallen off. Most itinerant workers in modern times have automobiles and drive between jobs, alternatively they may use [[public transportation]], and live in many types of temporary housing.  As seasonal agricultural work became the province of immigrant workers, and other seasonal work became increasingly lucrative, freighthopping became mainly used by the homeless population and thrill-seekers.

On many freight trains the traditional boxcar has given way to more secure [[plug door]] cars{{clarify|reason=No mention of railroad plug door cars in page linked|date=October 2011}} or [[Intermodal freight transport|intermodals]]. [[Containerization]] makes freight trains far less accessible than in the past. Even flatcars are becoming increasingly open; these bottomless cars are known as &quot;suicide rides&quot; or &quot;suicide cars&quot; by freighthoppers. Bottomless &quot;grainers,&quot; &quot;48s,&quot; &quot;piggy backs,&quot; and other such cars can still be ridden, but as the name implies they are not to be underestimated and can easily lead to the riders' death or dismemberment if they are not careful.  This shift in freight train production has been successful in making life harder for freighthoppers, but it has not destroyed the hobo lifestyle entirely.

==Safety concerns==
[[Image:%28Cropped%29_Flickr_-_%E2%80%A6trialsanderrors_-_Jack_Delano%2C_The_end_of_the_trip%2C_1943.jpg|thumb|Freight train operations on the Chicago and Northwestern Railroad between Chicago and Clinton, Iowa, January 1943. The conductor standing on the caboose platform is ready to hop off as the train passes the yard office at the end of the trip.]]

Hopping a freight train today can be dangerous and even life-threatening. Freight trains are much faster and more secure than in the heyday of hoboing. Freighthoppers may face adverse weather conditions and develop dangerous symptoms such as [[frostbite]] and [[hypothermia]]. Additional hazards include being jostled off the train, arrested, or attacked by another hobo. According to author and journalist [[Ted Conover]], a large percentage of modern-day hobos are ex-cons, and violence is not uncommon among the transient population.



== Inteview with a pro==

Geof: So how do you like the wikibook so far, is the title cool? Everything properly respectful?

Javier: Yeah, it sounds good all of the stuff is correct. 

Geof: Maybe you can give us the lay of the land, so to speak.

Javier: The train police is the bull. Boxcars [are called] sucidecars. You also can get in the pusher.

Geof: Whoa. Wait a minute. That's jargon. Like when two doctors or lawyers talk. Can we break this down into English. What is a pusher?

Javier:  A normal train has 4 engines, 3 in the front one in the back. the back one is called the pusher andyou can get in side of it to keep warm but you can not touch any bottons execpt for the heater 

Geof: So a guy can actually fire up the heater even though no railroad personnel are using it?

Javier: Yes.

Geof: Wow. So what kind of heater? How do you light it? Do you need a lighter or what?

(Inteview in progress...)

Cough hygiene is essential for prevention of the transmission of airborne infectious disease. The world has suffered greatly from various epidemics. The flu epidemic of 1918, coming at the end of WWI, actually killed more people than the war itself, according to NY Times science reporter Gina Kolata in her book on the topic.

===Historic pandemics===

A [[pandemic]] (or global epidemic) is a disease that affects people over an extensive geographical area.
* [[Plague of Justinian]], from 541 to 750, killed between 50% and 60% of Europe's population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eee.uci.edu/clients/bjbecker/PlaguesandPeople/lecture3.html Infectious and Epidemic Disease in History]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Black Death]] of 1347 to 1352 killed 25 million in Europe over 5 years (estimated to be between 25 and 50% of the populations of Europe, Asia, and Africa - the world population at the time was 500 million).
* The introduction of [[smallpox]], measles, and [[typhus]] to the areas of Central and South America by European explorers during the 15th and 16th centuries caused pandemics among the native inhabitants. Between 1518 and 1568 disease pandemics are said to have caused the population of [[Mexico]] to fall from 20 million to 3 million.&lt;ref name= Dobson&gt;Dobson, Andrew P. and E. Robin Carter (1996) [http://www.erin.utoronto.ca/~w3gwynne/BIO418/Dobson1996.pdf Infectious Diseases and Human Population History '''(full-text pdf)'''] Bioscience;46 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first European [[influenza]] epidemic occurred between 1556 and 1560, with an estimated mortality rate of 20%.&lt;ref name= Dobson/&gt;
* [[Smallpox]] killed an estimated 60 million Europeans during the 18th century&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/nchist-twoworlds/1696 Smallpox]. ''North Carolina Digital History.''&lt;/ref&gt; (approximately 400,000 per year).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=vacc.chapter.3 Smallpox and Vaccinia]. ''National Center for Biotechnology Information.''&lt;/ref&gt; Up to 30% of those infected, including 80% of the children under 5 years of age, died from the disease, and one-third of the survivors went blind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/127/8_Part_1/635 Smallpox: The Triumph over the Most Terrible of the Ministers of Death]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the 19th century, [[tuberculosis]] killed an estimated one-quarter of the adult population of Europe;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdc.gov/TB/pubs/mdrtb/default.htm Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis]. ''Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.''&lt;/ref&gt; by 1918 one in six deaths in France were still caused by TB.
* The Influenza Pandemic of 1918 (or the [[Spanish Flu]]) killed 25-50 million people (about 2% of world population of 1.7 billion).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/library/online/influenza_main.htm Influenza of 1918 (Spanish Flu) and the US Navy]&lt;/ref&gt; Today [[Influenza]] kills about 250,000 to 500,000 worldwide each year.

Space Elevators have been a theoretical transportation method since 1895.  The original idea is impractical to build.  This step adds a much more practical design as a transport hub for getting from one orbit to another quickly and efficiently.  Initial construction can use materials from Earth, but in larger sizes or locations beyond Earth orbit using local materials is assumed.

{{TOC right}}

===Skyhook Concept===

The popular concept of a space elevator is based on the original design proposed by Tsiolkovsky in the late 19th century. It involves a single tower/cable extending all the way past Geosynchronous (24 hour) Earth Orbit (GEO).  If the center of mass is at GEO and matches the Earth's daily rotation it will appear to hang motionless relative to the ground.  Getting to space in theory then becomes an elevator ride.  There are several problems with this simplistic design:

* The depth of the Earth's gravity well (6378 g-km) exceeds the scale length of the best available materials (350 km for carbon fiber) by 18 times, which then requires a structure-to-payload mass ratio of 65 million to 1.  This would require more carbon fiber than the world makes to lift a reasonable cargo mass, and would never be economical because it would take too long to transport sufficient payload to justify the massive cost of that much structure.

* It is of no use for delivering cargo to low orbits.  Release points somewhat below GEO result in elliptical orbits with a low perigee, but lower circular orbits cannot be reached.  It also is of no use transporting cargo from the ground when partially built.

* Even with a magnetically levitated elevator car running at 300 km/hr, it will still take 5 days to deliver one payload to GEO, and you can only deliver one payload at a time.

* A single cable catastrophically fails when hit by natural or man-made debris.  A cable over 35,000 km long has a lot of area exposed to such hits.

The '''Skyhook''' concept addresses all these problems.  Instead of a static cable that stays over a fixed location, it can be either a rotating cable in a moving orbit, much like two spokes of an imaginary wheel rolling around the Equator, or a non-rotating cable in a moving orbit that maintains a vertical orientation relative to the parent body.  For more information on this subject go to the '''Skyhook (structure)''' article.

* The non-rotating orbiting Skyhook is a much shorter version of the planetary surface to geostationary orbit Space Elevator that does not reach down to the surface of the parent body, is much lighter in mass, can be affordably built with existing materials and technology, and in its mature form, is cost competitive with what is thought to be realistically achievable using a Space Elevator. It works by starting from a relatively low altitude orbit and hanging a cable down to just above the Earth's atmosphere. Since the lower end of the cable is moving at less than orbital velocity for its altitude, a launch vehicle flying to the bottom of the Skyhook can carry a larger payload then it could carry on its own. When the cable is long enough, Single Stage to Skyhook flight with a reusable launch vehicle becomes possible at a price that is affordable to just about anyone.

* A full orbit velocity rotating Skyhook reduces the structural requirement to about 2868 g-km, because only the tip sees the full Earth's gravity.  The center is in orbit and thus has zero acceleration load.  This immediately reduces the theoretical mass ratio from 65 million to 3,620:1.  There is still an exponential relation of mass to tip velocity.  Since conventional rockets also have an exponential relation of mass to velocity, it makes sense to split the job between both, because the sum of two exponents, for example e^2 + e^2 = 14.8 is less than a single exponent of the combined powers, i.e e^4 = 54.6.  The optimum division of work between the Skyhook and vehicle coming from Earth will depend on technical details and costs, but a simple division of half to each results in a theoretical Skyhook mass ratio of 60:1.  A real design will be heavier, but 60:1 is a feasible starting point, where 65 million is not.  Reaching half of orbit velocity for a single stage rocket with a life of many flights is quite feasible.

* Assuming the tip is at 1 gravity, a rotating Skyhook with a tip velocity of 30-50% of orbit velocity has a radius of 500-1400 km.  The center point needs to be that altitude plus enough that the tip does not dip into thick atmosphere and create drag (100-200 km).  Releasing from the center of the Skyhook at 600-1600 km altitude allows access to low Earth orbits.

* A partially built Skyhook can still function because the remainder of the velocity is provided by the Earth vehicle.  During construction the velocity split is more towards the Earth vehicle.  This reduces payload mass, but it can still deliver some.  In particular, if part of your payload is more Skyhook structure, that payload pays for itself in increased payload on later trips.  This is a literal version of &quot;lifting yourself by your bootstraps&quot;.

* The same fast elevator car at 300 km/hr can reach the center in 2 to 5.3 hours.  If your destination is high orbit or Earth escape, you do not have to ride the elevator at all.  You wait half a rotation of the Skyhook and let go, at which point you are going at orbit velocity plus tip velocity.  To imagine this, think of the top point of a bicycle wheel.  It moves faster than the center relative to the ground.  A half rotation takes only 10 to 20 minutes.

* Space debris cannot be eliminated. Even if all the man-made junk in Earth orbit is eliminated, the natural flux of meteors will continue.  Therefore the Skyhook design has to take that into account.  The most practical way to do that is to use multiple redundant cables to distribute the load such that cutting one or two is not catastrophic.  The cables should be spaced far enough apart that any single object will only hit one or two strands.  The strands should also be cross-connected periodically to distribute the load around a break.  Repairing a break then becomes replacing a short segment of one strand.  Since you have the ability to install segments during original construction, you are able to replace segments as a maintenance job.

===Skyhook Applications===

The Moon and Mars have smaller gravity wells than the Earth, by ratio of 22 and 5 respectively, so Skyhooks with the same materials can do more of the transportation job relative to Earth.  But in this step-by-step combined system example, getting off the Earth comes first.  We will discuss the other locations here, but the actual construction will be delayed until easy transport to those locations is needed.

====Lunar Skyhooks====

There are two systems that are feasible because of the small gravity well of the Moon.  The first is a catapult system to launch bulk materials off the Moon.  The catapult uses a rotating cable driven by an electric motor to throw payloads directly into Lunar orbit, where they are picked up by a collector system.  The second is an orbiting Skyhook which can deposit and pick up cargoes at zero velocity close to the surface.

'''Catapults''' - [[w:Basalt_fiber|Basalt fibers]] are similar to fiberglass in that they are an extruded mineral.  They have a strength of 4800 MPa, or 80% of carbon fiber, and a density of 2.7 g/cc, or 50% higher than than carbon. Thus the scale length of Basalt fiber is 178 km, or about half that of carbon fiber. The dark areas (Maria or seas) of the Moon are covered in basalt lava &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geokem.com/lunar.html Gunn, Dr. B.M.'''Lunar Basalts and Anorthosites''']&lt;/ref&gt;, so there is an a very large supply of raw materials.  If a Lunar catapult delivers basalt to an orbital processing factory, or spools of fiber already spun on the Moon, it would be possible to build a Lunar Skyhook out of local materials.  The choice of Lunar basalt for a Skyhook would have to be compared to the higher performance carbon fiber brought from Earth or made from NEO carbon.  Certainly for Lunar surface construction it would have the advantage of being very local.

Catapults could also be built on the Earth or Mars, but for Earth it would need to be placed above the atmosphere on a tall tower to get significant velocity.  It is probably not the best method when compared to the alternatives.  Mars is much smaller, has less atmosphere, and very tall volcanoes that a catapult can be placed on.  So it is worth considering placing a catapult there to deliver materials to orbit.  Any catapult (Lunar or other) will need a significant power supply for the motor.  In order to not waste the rotation energy when stopping to load the next cargo, it makes sense to consider two catapults, and use one as a generator to supply power to the other.  Motor-generator efficiencies can be above 90%, so most of the energy could be recycled.

'''Skyhook''' - The Moon's gravity well is equal to 287 km at 1.0 Earth gravity.  Thus even for the lower strength basalt fibers, the gravity well is only 1.6 times the scale length of 178 km.  For the higher strength carbon fibers with 361 km scale length the ratio is 0.80. Note that scale length is based on breaking strength, actual designs will use lower loads and have overhead above a bare cable.  For Earth the theoretical gravity well to carbon fiber scale length ratio is 18, so it is much easier to build a Lunar Skyhook on a relative basis. Another way to say this is the Lunar orbit velocity of 1680 m/s is less than the 2400 m/s tip velocity assumed below for the Earth Skyhook. That provides all of the velocity between the Lunar surface and orbit, while the Earth orbit version only provides 1/3.  Since escape velocity is 1.414 times circular orbit velocity, and a full Lunar Skyhook is capable of releasing cargo at 2.0 times orbital velocity, it can handle cargo well beyond escape velocity.  By climbing to a chosen radius from the center, and timing when you let go, you can get a wide variety of orbits.  

Besides using it as transport to and from the Moon, there is also an opportunity for work crews to use the Skyhook at 1.0 gravity as a rest location, because we don't know the long term effects of 0.16 gravity on the human body.  A lunar surface alternative is to use centrifuges to get 1.0 gravity or whatever level is needed.  A full Lunar Skyhook would have a radius of 283 km and a rotation period of 17 min 40 sec at 1.0 gravity.  Since Lunar orbit period is 108 minutes or longer depending on altitude, the Skyhook will make 6 or more rotations per orbit.  If the orbit is equatorial, that allows it to service multiple locations around the Lunar equator, and transport cargo between those points at orbital speed at no cost.  

It is an open question if an equatorial orbit is best.  A polar orbit would let the Skyhook reach any point on the Lunar surface, but generally only twice a month.  The Moon rotates very slowly, so the benefit of the rotation towards the orbit velocity is only 4.6 m/s, 1% of the Earth's contribution.  A polar orbit can be arranged as a '''Sun-synchronous orbit''', where the orbit plane always is in sunlight, while an equatorial orbit is in shadow about 40% of the time.  Thus the solar arrays that power the Skyhook are more effective in the polar orbit.  You can have both Skyhooks in orbit around the Moon, as long as you arrange their orbits to never intersect, such as by using different altitudes.  In that case you might want to make the g-forces at the tips higher so the radius is smaller, and move humans quickly up the cable to a more comfortable g-level.  

In any Lunar Skyhook, a lander vehicle will need some propulsion because the Moon is not a perfect sphere.  So the tips need to stay high enough to miss any high points of the terrain, and some maneuvering is needed for an accurate landing.  If you have two Skyhooks at different altitudes, the vehicle will need more fuel to land and take off.

====Asteroid Skyhooks====

The largest asteroid, 1 Ceres, is 487 km in radius at the equator, with a day length (rotation period) of 9.074 hours.  Therefore the equator is moving at 94 m/s.  Orbit velocity is estimated at 360 m/s.  The exact number will be found when the Dawn spacecraft arrives at Ceres in 2015 (it is in orbit around the 2nd largest asteroid, Vesta, as of 2012).  A Skyhook thus needs only the difference of 266 m/s in order to land and pick up cargo and then toss them at more than escape velocity. The radius in this case at 1 g works out to 7.25 km.  This is small enough that it could be built near the Earth, and then transported whole to Ceres.  Setting it up in orbit would allow mining of the largest asteroid with easy access. A synchronous space elevator would be longer and not provide a 1 gravity environment, but could be used to launch cargo into transfer orbits away from Ceres or capture incoming cargo.

For small asteroids, a Skyhook isn’t necessary for surface access.  Even low efficiency chemical rockets do not use much fuel to land, and you can just mechanically throw stuff into orbit or escape.

====Mars Skyhooks====

Pavonis Mons is one of the large mountains on Mars.  Since it is located on the Equator, it is an ideal location for some kind of transport system.  Candidates include a centrifuge launcher like with the Moon, or a linear accelerator.  The higher mass of Mars makes it more difficult than for the Moon, but a ground-based transport system can still do most or all of the job of reaching orbit velocity.  Similarly, Mars orbit velocity of 3.6 km/s is within reach of a Skyhook, and there are two convenient former asteroids (Phobos and Deimos) as a source of building materials.  A Martian Skyhook would likely be placed in low Mars orbit, with the ability to transfer down to the surface and up to Phobos, Deimos, or escape orbits.

====Split Systems====

A catapult can be used in combination with a Skyhook to enable higher velocity missions with lower total mass ratios.  Bodies as small as the Moon do not require very large mass ratios o reach orbit, so doing a split system will not gain much at the cost of the extra complexity.  Conversely the Earth has a fairly dense atmosphere, so a high velocity centrifuge would see a lot of drag unless placed on a very tall structure.  The best location for a split system turns out to be Mars, particularly with its tall mountains that are in near vacuum at their peaks.  By dividing the velocity between two systems, it becomes 1.8 km/s each, which can be reached with existing materials and conservative mass ratios.


===Design Parameters===

The Earth orbit Skyhook does not have a fixed design as noted above, but rather grows over time.  We also do not as yet know what an optimum size will be for given circumstances.  A concrete example, however, lets us examine the feasibility and understand what is needed for the various parts.  We will assume a tip velocity of 2400 m/s for this example, or roughly 1/3 of orbit velocity, and derive the other characteristics.

====Design Inputs====

'''Tip Velocity''' = 2400 m/s 

'''Tip Acceleration''' = 10 m/s^2 - Earth surface gravity is 9.80665 m/s^2.  We use 10 for simplicity.  That provides normal gravity for any humans on the Skyhook.

====Derived Values====

'''Skyhook Radius''' = 576 km - This is found by solving the centrifugal acceleration formula ( a = v^2/r ) for the radius.

'''Rotation Period''' = 25 minutes - We know the circumference of a circle by 2 x pi x r, or 3619 km in this case.  Dividing by tip velocity gives the time.  For convenience to reach the Skyhook from a launch site, the numbers can be adjusted so the period is an even fraction of the orbit time, i.e. 100 minute orbit with 25 minute rotation time.  That way the landing platform will be in the same place each time relative to the launch site.

'''Orbit Altitude''' = 750 km - If the tips of the Skyhook reach deeply into the Earth's atmosphere, that will cause drag and heating, and eventually cause the Skyhook to fall down.  By placing the tips at least 175 km altitude, then the center must be that plus the radius high.  The exact height will be a trade off between less drag, and ease to reach from the ground.

'''Orbit Velocity''' = 7474 m/s - Found from the formula below where G is the Gravitational constant, M is the mass of the Earth, and r is the orbit radius, which is the Earth's radius plus the orbit altitude:

&lt;math&gt;v_o \approx \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Launch Vehicle Payload''' = 13% - A good chemical rocket would have an exhaust velocity of 4.5 km/s and empty weight of 10%.  Without a Skyhook, the total velocity required is about 9 km/s, which results in a payload fraction of 3.5%.  Subtracting the 2.4 km/s provided by the Skyhook results in a payload of 13%, or 3.7 times higher.  The exact numbers will vary depending on the launch vehicle design, but that gives an idea of the payload improvement the Skyhook can provide, and thus part of the reason to build it. The greatest advantage of a Skyhook is not from the increased payload it provides, but using some of the increase to increase the fatigue life of the vehicle, which is highly non-linear - typically ten times higher for a 10% addition in structure.  Airplanes and rockets cost about the same per kg to build.  This is not surprising since both are built by aerospace companies out of the same materials.  The vast difference in transport cost is due to airplanes flying about 20,000 times during their service life, and rockets usually only flying once.  By taking some of the payload increase from a Skyhook and applying it to giving the launch vehicle a long operating life, the operating cost will be vastly reduced.

'''Payback Time''' = 1 to 76 launches (average of 43) - If we remove the last 100 m/s of tip velocity, the launch vehicle payload falls to 12.56% from 13.07%.  So the incremental benefit of the last 100 m/s is 0.51% of the vehicle mass.  Assume we use [http://www.toraycfa.com/pdfs/T1000GDataSheet.pdf Torayca T1000G] carbon fiber as our main cable material.  It has a tensile strength of 6370 MPa and a density of 1.8 g/cc.  We allow 40% overhead mass above the bare fiber for a finished cable system, and a 2.0 factor of safety.  Thus the working strength is reduced to 2275 MPa, and at a tip acceleration of 10 m/s, the working length becomes 126.4 km.

The 2400 m/s Skyhook has a radius of 576 km, and the acceleration varies from 0 at the center to 10 m/s at the tip, so effective length is half, or 288 km.  The cable mass ratio is then e ^ (288/126.4) = 9.762:1.  Subtracting the payload mass gives a theoretical cable mass of 8.762.  Since this calculation is only for one arm of the Skyhook, we double it to 17.524.  The payload of the Skyhook is the launch vehicle payload + the empty vehicle structure without fuel (10% of launch weight), for a total of 23.07% of launch weight.  The Skyhook cable mass is then 404.3% of the launch vehicle weight.  Doing the same calculations for the 2300 m/s Skyhook, we have a radius of 529 km, effective length of 264.5 km, mass ratio of 8.106, and cable mass of 16.211 times the vehicle arrival mass of 22.56% = 365.7%.  The incremental cable mass is then 404.3 - 365.7 = 38.6%.  Since we gain 0.51% in payload from this incremental addition to the Skyhook, it pays for itself in payload mass in 76 launches if we use the launch vehicle to deliver the added cable.  If we get the extra cable from another source, such as our hypervelocity gun, or from NEO carbon, the payback could be much faster.

Doing the same type of calculation over the whole Skyhook, we have a gain in payload from 3.5 to 13%, or 9.5% of liftoff mass.  The Skyhook cable mass is 404.3% of liftoff mass, so the payback time in increased payload is 43 launches.  The first 300 m/s increment of the Skyhook increases payload from 3.53% to 4.46%, a gain of 0.93% of liftoff mass. It would have a radius of 9 km, and a cable mass of 7.25% times arrival mass, or 0.98% of launch mass.  Thus the payback time is 1 launch, and the cable fits in roughly 1/4 of a payload on it's delivery flight.  So the first part of the Skyhook has an immediate payback and is very desirable.  Note that a Skyhook massing less than the arrival mass would not have enough orbital energy to give the vehicle on arrival.  It would need to be attached to a larger &quot;ballast&quot; mass such as an assembly platform, bulk mined materials, or collected space debris. 

Mass payback is not the same as cost payback, but if we assume they are for now, at a relatively low rate of one launch/month, payback takes about 3.6 years, which is reasonable from an economic standpoint.  Since the cable mass grows exponentially with tip velocity, the earlier parts will pay back faster, and growth beyond this point will take longer at a fixed launch rate.  A real payback analysis will have to take into account real cost instead of mass ratios, and actual launch rates. If less expensive launch systems from Earth are developed, then the cost benefit of a Skyhook goes down, even if the payload mass increase stays the same.  On the other hand, if traffic rates go up, do does the cost benefit.  No matter what numbers are used, the exponential growth of the Skyhook mass with tip velocity will eventually limit it's size for economic reasons. That is when the incremental cost of making the Skyhook larger becomes more than the incremental payload increase is worth.  We emphasize that limit can change over time, however, as new materials become available, different methods of cable delivery are used, and traffic rates change. The Skyhook/launch vehicle interaction is a good example of why combined systems have to be looked at in their entirety, and not as single technologies or methods.

===Design Components===

====Structure====

The main structural component of the Skyhook will be the tension strands.  In addition there will be secondary structure holding the strands in position, and for the landing platform, propulsion system, habitats, and other items attached to the structure.  Cables are not a stable structure unless they are in tension, so for the central portion of the Skyhook before it is set rotating, we assume a core rigid truss structure.  The initial total radius is 2500 m, counting core plus cables.  This allows 1.0 gravity acceleration at the tips with a rotation period of 100 seconds.  The latter number is chosen so that humans are not dis-oriented by rapid rotation.  Initial habitats would be placed at the 2500 m radius.  Strands are installed both lengthwise and in parallel to expand the Skyhook.

'''Damage Tolerant Design''' - Man-made satellites and orbital debris are the largest impact hazard for the structure.  For now we assume no cleanup of Earth orbit, though that is desirable.  Doing so would reduce the risks by about ten times. If we assume there is a 0.5 mm protective sheath around the strand core, then objects smaller than half that thickness will merely make a crater and not penetrate the core.  If we assume a large Skyhook supports 1000 tons of payload at 1.0 gravity, with an 8:1 mass ratio, we have a total load of 10 MN.  Given the 2275 MPa working strength, that requires a total area of 44 cm^2 of cable.  Assume each strand is 2 cm in diameter.  Then we need 14 load carrying strands, and some number of extra strands for damage tolerance, which we will use 7 for now, giving 21 total strands.

Any debris object larger than 1/3 the strand diameter will likely cause enough damage that it fails.  Based on a 1995 orbital debris assessment &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=4765 National Academies Press '''Orbital Debris: A Technical Assessment, 1995]&lt;/ref&gt; there were about 1 million objects that size and larger. That produces an impact flux of about 10 ^ -4 per square meter per year.  If we want a 1% chance of strand failure per year, then we are allowed 100 square meters of area.  Since the diameter is assumed to be 2 cm, then the allowed length is 5000 meters.  We place cross-connecting rings at that interval to distribute load around a failed strand.  At each ring, there are 7 points where 3 strands each fan out.  Since by design two are required to handle the load, the failure of the third by debris impact does not cause any reduction in the Skyhook's total load carrying ability.  

We do not want a single object to impact too many strands at one time.  In the worst case, the largest object in orbit besides the Skyhook, currently the Space Station, should not hit more than our reserve of 7 extra strands.  In reality, 99% of damaging debris is smaller than 30 cm, and the Space Station is under active control, so it should not ever hit the Skyhook, but we are looking at a worst case.  Since the Station is about 120m wide, if the strands are arranged in a circle, and there are 21 total, a 120m object should not intersect more than 120 degrees of the perimeter.  Doing a little geometry yields 120m = 50% of the radius, thus the diameter of the circle is about 480 meters, and the 7 attachment points are spaced about 200 meters apart. A truss spans between each attach point, making a 7-sided ring.  If a given strand is damaged, then it is simply replaced by the same construction method the Skyhook was built in the first place.  As long as strands can be replaced at least as fast as they are damaged, the Skyhook can be maintained indefinitely.  

The above calculations are an example.  For a real design, you would find the optimum strand diameter and count, rather than just assume 2 cm and 21.  The real debris population is not all in orbits that could intersect the Skyhook.  For example, the Space Station is about 400 km altitude, and could only intersect with the bottom 225 km of the Skyhook when it is in the vertical position.  Some efforts may be made to clean up orbital debris.  But even if not, we can make a reasonable design that can withstand worst case damage and reduce expected damage to a 1% per year maintenance job.

'''Landing Platform''' - This functions somewhat like the deck of an aircraft carrier, in that it is a mobile platform which vehicles land and take off from.  We assumed above that the Skyhook structure supports 1000 tons of load.  This includes everything besides the main structure, including the landing platform.  Arriving vehicles would have a smaller mass that is added to the load temporarily.  Unlike zero-g docking, which is done slowly, the landing platform is rotating at 1 gravity, so landings will be similar speed to landing on Earth.  The size of the platform will be governed by the accuracy of the vehicle navigation.  The design can be a horizontal platform, or something like a latching hook or arresting cable, such as used on aircraft carriers.  In that case the Skyhook name becomes a literal description. An alternate method is have a vertical capture net.  It's as wide and tall as needed to make a good target.  The vehicle has redundant capture latches deployed ahead of it, and arrives slightly faster so it runs into the net, and snags multiple cables.  

It is assumed the landing will be automated for uncrewed cargo delivery, with radar, lidar, and other aids to getting within the landing target area. The landing platform is made a multiple of the navigation accuracy in size to have a high probability of hitting the target. The best design is an open question, but since landing at 1 gravity has been solved multiple times on Earth, it should be solvable for this task.

After delivering it's payload, the vehicle just needs to let go or be pushed off the platform at the right time.  At it's low point, the platform is sub-orbital, so the vehicle will automatically re-enter. The vehicle will be moving at 4,600 m/s relative to the Equator, compared to 7,400 m/s for a rocket without a Skyhook trying to re-enter.  Therefore the vehicle has to dissipate 39% as much kinetic energy, which makes the heat shield design much easier.

'''Low Gravity Platforms''' - Low- or Zero-gravity is desirable for some tasks in Space.  You can place platforms or pressurized habitats at chosen distances from the Skyhook center and get any value between 0 and 1 gravity.  For true zero-g, you would need to de-spin the structure so it does not rotate along with the rest of the Skyhook.  Likely this will be a structure extending along the axis of rotation like the axle of a wheel, where the Skyhook cables would be spokes of the wheel.

====Electric Propulsion====

Due to fundamental conservation of energy, transporting more payloads up than down causes the Skyhook to lose orbital energy and eventually re-enter if not corrected.  We use the highly efficient electric thrusters developed in an earlier step to maintain orbit.  In effect, the electric thrusters substitute for the lower efficiency chemical rocket engines on the launch vehicle.  Electric type engines have too low a thrust to reach orbit by themselves, but by attaching them to a Skyhook, we can add orbital energy gradually, and then give that to the payload in a short time.  The Skyhook becomes a very efficient battery for storing orbital energy, about 25 times the energy/mass of Lithium batteries on Earth.

'''Power Rquirements''' - For each kg of payload we are placing in orbit, we are changing the velocity from 5074 to 7474 m/s. This requires adding 15 MJ of energy.  Since there are 31.5 million seconds in a year, then that means for each kg/year of payload, we need 0.477 watts of delivered orbital energy.  In Earth orbit we are not in sunlight 100% of the time, so solar panels would need to be larger to average this power level, and electric thrusters are not 100% efficient, either.  Using reasonable numbers of 60% sunlight time and 65% thruster efficiency, we get our solar panels need a peak output of 1.22 Watts/kg/year.  If we want to deliver 1000 tons/year, then the power supply needs to be 1.22 MW.  Nuclear power is excluded from consideration for political and safety reasons so close to Earth.  Existing solar cells, allowing for 100% overhead, have a mass of 1.68 kg/m^2&lt;ref&gt;[http://emcore.com/solar_photovoltaics/space_solar_cells Emcore Space Solar Cell Products]&lt;/ref&gt;, and an efficiency of 29.5% vs a Solar constant of 1360 W/m^2.  Therefore they produce 238 W/kg of output and their mass is 5.1 tons.

'''Thruster Type''' - For low Earth orbit, there are three types available with near-term technology: Ion, Plasma, or Electrodynamic.  Electrodynamic uses less &quot;fuel&quot;, but is not as well developed. Ion is well developed, but does not scale up to the high power levels as well. We will assume Plasma thrusters, but development of Electrodynamic should be pursued, and all three types considered as candidates.  Current plasma thrusters in development are designed for 200 kW continuous power, so 6 units plus some number of spares would be needed for the Skyhook design.  The estimated mass of the thrusters is 3 tons.

'''Fuel Requirement''' - With 1000 tons/year of cargo delivery to which 2.4 km/s of velocity is added, we need to expel 48 tons/year of thruster propellant at 50 km/s to maintain the Skyhook orbit.  This can either come along with the cargo, serving as 4.8% overhead, or if materials are being extracted from nearby asteroids can come from them.  The latter is preferred since it's more efficent for the launch vehicle.

&lt;!-- PLEASE ADD CATEGORIES AND INTERWIKIS AT THE BOTTOM OF THIS PAGE --&gt;

=== Usage ===
This template allows linking within a book to another chapter of the book easier. Using only one unnamed paramater in this template will create a link in the form &lt;nowiki&gt;[[{{ROOTBOOKNAME}}/{{{1}}}|{{{1}}}]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, so &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{Chapter link|Introduction}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; will link to the &quot;Introduction&quot; chapter of the current book, which manually would have to be done as &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;[[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Book name''/Introduction{{!}}Introduction&lt;nowiki&gt;]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt;.
==== Other parameters ====
'''name''' - allows a different name for the link, so &lt;code&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;{{chapter link|doc|name=Introduction}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/code&gt; becomes, if it is in Wikijunior:Biology, [[Wikijunior:Biology/Introduction|Introduction]]. This is especially useful for books and subpages with long names. The second unnamed parameter can be used instead of '''name'''

'''section''' -  allows a link to a specific section. By default the link will appear as the name of the section, unless the &quot;name&quot; parameter is set, in which case it will become whatever the name parameter is set to ''unless'' it is set to &quot;default&quot;, in which case it will display the subpage name (parameter 1).

'''prefix''' - By default this template uses {{tl|ROOTBOOKNAME}} as the base book name. This will keep [[WB:NS|namespaces]] like &quot;Wikijunior&quot; and &quot;Cookbook&quot; in the book name but will remove ones like &quot;Template&quot; and &quot;Category&quot;. Sometimes you may want to link to a book-specific template or category from the book itself, and this can be done by setting &lt;code&gt;prefix&lt;/code&gt; to the desired prefix (namespace).

'''bookname'''/'''book''' - Either of these parameters allow a different book than the current one to be linked to. These parameters can also be used to switch between different means of determining the book name. Setting &lt;code&gt;bookname&lt;/code&gt; to &quot;root&quot;, &quot;full&quot;, or &quot;basic&quot; will trigger the use of {{tl|ROOTBOOKNAME}}, {{tl|FULLBOOKNAME}}, and {{tl|BOOKNAME}} respectively.

==Principles of Biomechanics==

Biomechanics is a science of movement of a human body including our muscles, bones, tendons and ligaments work together to produce movement. There are six principles.


1.The lower the center of gravity the larger the base of support - stability
2.maxium effort- production of maxium force requires the use of joints in order to perform largest to smallest
3.Linear motion- the greater the applied impulse the greater the increase in velocity
4. movement usually occurs in the direction opposite to that of the implied force
5. angular motion- is produced by the application of force acting at some distance from a axis
6. angular momentum is constant when a person or object is free in the air

==Fractures==

A fracture is a broken bone, often with a nearby soft tissue, blood vessel, and nerve damage, and is most commonly casued by injury to the bone. Some of the problems associated with bone fractures includes blood loss, injury to organs, tissues, or surrounding strcutures, and possibly stunted growth in children. Fracture types include:
#closed fractures
#open fractures
#comminuted fractures

===fall prevention===
Falls are a cause of fractures and associated mortality in aged clients. Interventions to target fall prevention should manage multiple risk factors &lt;ref&gt;&quot;Interventions for preventing falls in older people in nursing care facilities and hospitals&quot;     Ian D Cameron,I.D. et al in cochrane database 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===treatment===
Treatment is to set a broken bone. Fixation depends on the location and the severity of the injury. Partial or slight fractures are often treated conservatively. Bones such as the collarbone or toes, are immobilized with a sling or splint until healed.

First Aid for fractures is all about immobilizing the injury. Splints can be purpose-made or makeshift but will be effective if the injury is immobilized above and below the break to stop movement. Any external bleeding should be controlled. Complicated breaks where a limb is very deformed may need to be realigned. This manipulation may be performed under general anaesthesia or intravenous sedation. Nursing priorities include pain management, management of immobility (eg. strict bed rest including all toiletting and hygiene needs). Gentle activity may resume to maintain fitness of unaffected body parts after the swelling subsides. Nurses are responsible for neurovascular observations.

===neurovascular observation===
[[File:WEARING ORTHOPAEDIC PLASTER.jpg|thumb|right| Dude needing plaster care]]
Limbs on both sides may be examined for comparison. A window is sometimes made beyond any plaster or dressings where the neurovascular status can be assessed. Nurses may use aparatus such as hand held doppler ultrasound to locate weak pulses. Nurses monitor specifically for
*'''Pulse''' - radial or cubital in the arm, dorsalis pedis in the feet. Nurses often consent clients to mark the pulse points with biro to expidite rapid pulse location.
*'''Warmth''' - cold extremity, with a circling vulture, is not an encouraging sign.
*'''Colour''' - usually pink. Dusky grey or cyanotic blue are abnormal colours which indicate deterioration of blood supply.
*'''Movement''' - client should be able to operate the muscles that wiggle toes and fingers
*'''Sensation''' - Nerves ending threshold may fall during times of hypoxia. Rising pain despite analgesia may be a ''late'' sign of compartment or crush syndrome.
*'''Capillary refill''' - By gently pressing the nail bed, the nurse empites capillary beds, when released, the toe-nail or finger-nail bed should refill with pink oxygentated blood in less than or equivalent to two seconds.

===plastering &amp; splinting===

===crush syndrome (compartment syndrome)===
Typically occurs after a traumatic injury. Crush syndrome is a consistant pressure on limbs causing ischemia (restriction within the blood) resulting in muscle necrosis or death. Releasing pressure restores circulation allowing blood to enter and filter through the renal system. Surgical treatment may include fasciotomy (cutting the muscle to release pressure). Compartment sydrome can occur in isolated areas such as the carpal tunnel or within the perimycium membrane containing a single muscle.  Death can occur from acute renal failure. Nursing vigilance in neuro-vascular observation of the affected limb will prevent occurence.

Crush Syndrome injuries can result in permanent disability or death due to muscle damage. Early recognition and thorough treatment are necessary to improve the outcomes. The assessment of this syndrome consists of:

*1) Test it by assessing the pressure within the muscle compartment. Distinct features consist of swelling, numbness, tingling and bruising.
*2) If pressure is high with in the muscle compartment a fasciotomy surgery is required to allow the pressure to return to normal.
*3) If left untreated it may lead to severe conditions including: rhabdomyolysis and kidney failure which can lead to death.

==Muscles and that==
[[File:Mobility-aids-rifton-pacer-gait-trainer.jpg|right|thumb| Mobility aid]]
Muscles keep us upright and give us strength, which allows us to bend and sretch. Muscle consists of ligaments, tendons and cartliage. There are three main types of muscle within the body, cardiac heart, smooth (internal organs) and skeletal (movement).

The musculoskeletal system consists of different structures that combine together to produce movement, provide support and protection for organs. The body is combined of 600 voluntary or skeletal muscles which form the flesh of the body. Skeletal muscle is attached to bone and classified by the kind of movement it performs; for example flexors allow joints to bend or flex, while abductors permit shortening so that joints are straightened or abducted. Muscle tissue is capable of contraction and relaxation after being stimulated by a motor nerve.

The musculoskeletal system 
*maintains posture
*produces movement
*stabilizes joints
*generates heat
*stores minerals
*forms blood cells

==Eye care==
Eye care can replace the clients own reflex to blink and weep.
Eye care aims to keep the exposed conjunctiva moist, preventing tissue damage. 
*Observe hand hygiene procedure.
*Explain your intentions to client, regardless of their perceptual ability to give them adequate warning.
*Use a kidney dish or absorbent material over clients cheek to catch drips.
*Use a fresh wipe for each stroke, use sterile isotonic irrigation fluid.
*Always wipe from medial (inner) to lateral (outer) eye, mimic the natural flow of tears to cleanse eye.
Lubricants or artifical tears are commonly instilled to prevent dehydration of the conjunctiva, some preparations may require authorization by nurse practitioner or other prescriber. Common medications are anti-biotics, anti-inflamatory, anti-glaucoma drugs. Each client should have  their own container where possible. Nurses should consider removing contact lenses from clients unable to perform their own eye care over a period of days to prevent conjunctivitis.
In unconscious or anaesthetized clients, it is usual to nurse clients with eyes closed or taped shut.
Document care on completion, including adverse findings &amp; discard materials correctly.

==Ear Care==
Permanent hearing loss occurs from long exposure to excessive noise. Ear plugs or occlusive headphones are advised for any client in a noisy activityt, such as power tools or drum kit.
Some clients may experience an accumulation of cerum in the external canal. Nurses should advise clients that a cerum softener may be advantageous in dislodging the 'potato'. clients may be advised to us a gentle stream of warm water, such as titling their own head in the shower to loosen the ear wax. It is highly dangerous to insert anything into the auditory meatus and if these measures are not succesful, then a referral is required (eg. for ear syringe treatment by a suitably trained and insured practitioner). Most clients with hearing aids, or their relatives, will be able to replace the aids after nursing hygiene measures.
==Neurological observations==
Consist of vital signs with Glascow coma scale (0=deceased - 15=alert), pupil and motor strength determination. &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;br/&gt;
There is reliable evidence that
*The Glasgow Coma Scale can be used as an effective tool to assess neurological status and has a higher inter-rater compatibility with experienced staff.
*It is important not to take any aspect of the neurological assessment in isolation.
Joanna Briggs Institute publication JBI2150 'Neurological assessment'
==Care of unconscious client==
Use a Waterlow Scale to help assess for pressure sore risk. 
Jane Johnson (1994) British Journal of Nursing October 13, 1994 page 926

== Installation ==
Make sure that the following Jar files have been added to your $EXIST_HOME/lib/extensions:

* expath-ft-client.jar
* jsch-0.1.44.jar
The first jar file is the Java Archive file that contains the XQuery module interfaces.
The second jar file is the module that provides the Secure Shell protocol support.  See [http://www.jcraft.com/jsch http://www.jcraft.com/jsch]for further details.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;module uri=&quot;http://exist-db.org/xquery/httpclient&quot; class=&quot;org.exist.xquery.modules.httpclient.HTTPClientModule&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

The following is a temporary link to the File Transfer client interface specification:

http://extxsltforms.sourceforge.net/specs/expath-ft-client/expath-ft-client.html

== Getting remote XML files ==

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
(: this is a safe version of get remote XML file and parse :)
declare function local:get-remote-file-safe($connection as xs:long, $path as xs:string) as node() {
let $binary-file := ft-client:retrieve-resource($connection, $path)
let $string-of-file := util:binary-to-string($binary-file)
return
try {util:parse($string-of-file)}
        catch exerr:EXXQDY0002 {&lt;error&gt;The input file is not well formed.&lt;/error&gt;}
        catch * {&lt;error&gt;Unknown parse error on input file.  The input could not be parsed.&lt;/error&gt;}
};
&lt;/source&gt;

linked list

A very simple implementation of a singly linked list in python is below
&lt;pre&gt;
class node():
	def __init__(self, value, next = None):
		self.value = value
		self.next = next

if __name__=='__main__':
	mylist = node('a', node('b',node('c',node('d'))))
	print 'mylist =', mylist
	print 'mylist.next', mylist.next
	print 'mylist.next.value', mylist.next.value
	print 'mylist.next.next.value', mylist.next.next.value
	nextnode = mylist
	print 
	print 'Traversing the list' 
	while nextnode != None:
		print nextnode.value
		nextnode = nextnode.next
&lt;/pre&gt;	
We can extend it to a list with a container class and add the append method
&lt;pre&gt;
class node():
	def __init__(self, value, next = None):
		self.value = value
		self.next = next
	def __str__(self):
		return str(self.value)

class linkedList():
	def __init__(self):
		self.first = None
		self.last = None
	
	def append(self, insertedNode):
		if self.first == None:
			self.first = node(insertedNode)
			self.last = self.first
			print &quot;inserted &quot;, insertedNode
		elif self.first == self.last: 
			self.last = node(insertedNode)
			self.first.next = self.last
			print &quot;inserted &quot;, insertedNode
		else:
			current =  node(insertedNode)
			self.last.next = current
			self.last = current
			print &quot;inserted &quot;, insertedNode
			
	def __str__(self):
		strout = str(self.first)
		rest = self.first.next
		while rest != None:
			strout += ', '+ str(rest)
			rest = rest.next
		return strout	
	
	
if __name__=='__main__':
	mylist = linkedList()
	mylist.append(2)
	mylist.append(4)
	mylist.append(10)
	mylist.append(12)
	print 'mylist =', mylist
	
&lt;/pre&gt;

Sorting Algorithms

Merging two sorted lists
&lt;pre&gt;
#merging two sorted lists

def merge(array1, array2):
	pointer1 = 0
	pointer2 = 0
	output = []
	while True:
		if array1[pointer1]&lt;array2[pointer2]:
			output.append(array1[pointer1])
			pointer1 +=1
			if pointer1 &gt;=len(array1):
				output += array2[pointer2:]
				break
		else:
			output.append(array2[pointer2])
			pointer2 +=1
			if pointer2 &gt;=len(array2):
				output +=array1[pointer1:]
				break
	return output

print merge([1,2,4],[3,4,5,6])
Quick Sort

# Quick sort in python
def QuickSort(myarray = []):
	if len(myarray) &lt;= 1:
		return myarray
	else:
		pivot = myarray[0]
		smaller = []
		larger = []
		for i in myarray[1:]:
			if i&lt;=pivot:
				smaller.append(i)
			else:
				larger.append(i)
		return QuickSort(smaller) + [pivot] + QuickSort(larger)
			

import random
a =  [random.randint(1,100) for i in range(20)]
print 'Original Data'
print a
print 
results = QuickSort(a)
print 
print 
print results
&lt;/pre&gt;
===Merge Sort===
&lt;pre&gt;
#Merge Sort in Python

def merge(array1, array2):
	pointer1 = 0
	pointer2 = 0
	output = []
	while True:
		if array1[pointer1]&lt;array2[pointer2]:
			output.append(array1[pointer1])
			pointer1 +=1
			if pointer1 &gt;=len(array1):
				output += array2[pointer2:]
				break
		else:
			output.append(array2[pointer2])
			pointer2 +=1
			if pointer2 &gt;=len(array2):
				output +=array1[pointer1:]
				break
	return output

def MergeSort(myarray):
	arraylength = len(myarray)
	if arraylength&lt;=1:
		return myarray
	else:
		left = myarray[0:int(round(arraylength/2))]
		right = myarray[int(round(arraylength/2)):]

		return merge(MergeSort(left),MergeSort(right))

import random
a =  [random.randint(1,100) for i in range(20)]
print 'Original Data'
print a
print 
results = MergeSort(a)
print 
print 
print results
&lt;/pre&gt;

==Sorting a dictionary==
http://www.saltycrane.com/blog/2007/09/how-to-sort-python-dictionary-by-keys/
===How to sort a dict by keys (Python 2.4 or greater):===
&lt;pre&gt;
mydict = {'carl':40,
          'alan':2,
          'bob':1,
          'danny':3}

for key in sorted(mydict.iterkeys()):
    print &quot;%s: %s&quot; % (key, mydict[key])
&lt;/pre&gt;

Taken from the Python FAQ: http://www.python.org/doc/faq/general/#why-doesn-t-list-sort-return-the-sorted-list. To sort the keys in reverse, add reverse=True as a keyword argument to the sorted function.

===How to sort a dict by keys (Python older than 2.4):===
&lt;pre&gt;
keylist = mydict.keys()
keylist.sort()
for key in keylist:
    print &quot;%s: %s&quot; % (key, mydict[key])
&lt;/pre&gt;
The results are the same as the above.

===How to sort a dict by value (Python 2.4 or greater):===
&lt;pre&gt;
for key, value in sorted(mydict.iteritems(), key=lambda (k,v): (v,k)):
    print &quot;%s: %s&quot; % (key, value)

== Brace Style ==
An important problem is how to have NPOV in the indent styles of examples. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]]

:Present all the styles and &quot;let the reader decide&quot;...  at least that is my idea. -- [[User:Emperorbma|Emperorbma]] 19:59, 16 Dec 2003 (UTC)

::I didn't quite get that. Obviously each example cannot be presented in all styles. So we should present one particular example in all styles &amp; the rest all in the same style as a `convention we'll adopt in this book' (which may itself be controversial). But then the example must be comprehensive enough (to include, e.g. cuddling of else, do-while, etc.). Then what about the examples which are presented ''before'' this comprehensive example? -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 07:37, 17 Dec 2003 (UTC)

== Separate Chapters ==
y not split the content into different chapters? --[[User:Yacht|Yacht]] ([[User talk:Yacht|talk]])[[Queer|Q]] 02:48, 21 Feb 2004 (UTC)

::Follow the link to &quot;your first program&quot;. I have been making separate chapters. I am just reluctant to make N different pages now itself (them each would be with nothing more than a few lines). Once each chapter is sort of complete, content from here would be moved there and a link added here. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 06:47, 22 Feb 2004 (UTC)

== Broad overview ? ==
Sorry to ask, but do you think you have here a broad overview of C++, like the first chapter in Kernighan &amp; Ritchie ? 

Now the same subjects would have to be expanded in specialized chapters, right ? 

[[User:Hgfernan|Hgfernan]] 12 May 2004

== Images... ==
I've uploaded some pics .png .jpg and .gif can't seem to make them work is it problems with size optimization ?

upload reports all ok... strange any info ?
--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 00:12, 28 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:On downloading the images you uploaded, I'm not able to open them with any viewer I have. My guess is that they are corrupt or are in a non-standard image format (in spite of standard extensions). -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 20:53, 3 Nov 2004 (UTC)

::humm it seems that I have problems then with the upload on wikibooks... can I use another place as a reference and you or other editor will then correct it and use wikibooks as a repository ? how do I refer to an offsite image? can it be done ? give me an example if it can... txs --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:48, 5 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:::If wikibooks hasn't disabled the option (wikipedia has, to minimize vandalism), mentioning an external URL ending in a recognised image extension causes that image to be included. But your images are corrupted. No viewer I used were able to open them. BTW in case you're reading this, please read your talk page and the section above for Dysprosia's and my responses. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 09:12, 5 Nov 2004 (UTC)

::::Yup, they are corrupted after uploading (here they are ok), I see that Dysprosia agrees with you so I will take the time to give again in an ordered way my arguments (this is time lost on editing BTW but I'll do it for a clarification if ideas and future base of discussion :)... --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:49, 6 Nov 2004 (UTC)

::::This image [http://images-partners.google.com/images?q=tbn:hVOtj3coUnMJ:www.fau.edu/images/dont-panic.gif] was transcluded here&lt;!-- http://images-partners.google.com/images?q=tbn:hVOtj3coUnMJ:www.fau.edu/images/dont-panic.gif --&gt;.

::::Oky it works [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] Ill start using this and if you can make them local that would be great... txs [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 03:12, 7 Nov 2004 (UTC)

If you want to propose C++-specific conventions that could be adopted by this book, you can do that at [[Talk:Programming:C plus plus/proposals]]. If your conventions are general programming-related, you can also add those to [[Talk:Computer programming]] or [[Wikibooks Talk:Manual of Style]]. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 19:41, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Common Programming Errors Proposal -- dead? ==
[[user:Paddu|Paddu]] said &quot;&lt;code&gt;It would be nice to point out some common programming errors, pitfalls and the like by highlighting it.&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, porposed to look into [[w:infobox|Infoboxes]]
; NOTE : [[user:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] aggreed but proposed a dif. book ( Programming:Improving programming skills ), didn't start one and doesn't seem to be a &quot;major&quot; contributor to CPP and never replied if she missundestod the proposal.
:[[user:Paddu|Paddu]] did not advance the ideia further.
'''P1 - Last action -&gt; 17 Oct 2004'''
:[[user:Panic2k4|Panic]] implemented a limited reference note on possible errors/styles.
* There are now some limited references on errors/styles so the proposal is dead (will add this to the conventions and remove proposal as adopted, I do think that it can be improved maybe [[user:Paddu|Paddu]] takes on the ideia again) -- Panic2k4 (signature added by [[User:Paddu|Paddu]])

:This is one of the statements that made me furious. How could you call the proposal dead? I sure am going to use templates to implement what are implemented by &quot;specially highlighted &amp; boxed paragraphs&quot; in [[w:paper|dead-tree]] books, unless stopped by death/insanity/any other incident severe enough to stop my ability to edit wikibooks. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 15:33, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Brace Style -- dead? ==
[[user:Paddu|Paddu]] said &quot;&lt;code&gt;An important problem is how to have NPOV in the indent styles of examples.&lt;/code&gt;&quot;, did advance the ideia of a convention on the subject but did not implement one.
; NOTE : [[user:Paddu|Emperorbma]] did not agree that there was a problem and did't seem to care if there were a convention.
'''P2''' - Last action -&gt; 17 Dec 2003'''
:[[user:Panic2k4|Panic]] agrees with [[user:Paddu|Emperorbma]] that no particular style should be forced on all the book, started a chapter on it so readers can get it.

::Note that Panic created a misleading link to User:Paddu titled Emperorbma. These kinds of goof-ups point to a clueless newbie overenthusiastic about refactoring the page. Even though Panic is around for some time, he has accepted that he doesn't want to explore this &amp; related wikis much, which means he'd be a newbie for quite some time. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 15:33, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)

* There is now a non adoption of a single standard on styles so the proposal is dead (will add this to the conventions and remove proposal as adopted (as a negative), I do think that in this ways it's makes the works of importing any other snips of code easier. -- Panic2k4 (signature added by [[User:Paddu|Paddu]])

::You seem to suggest that I said that a single style should not be used in the entire book. I didn't say that. Importing works is always easy. They could always be in a different style, but over time someone should make all examples use the same style. If you don't like to do that, don't worry. I do like to do such &quot;drab&quot; work. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 15:33, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Separate Chapters -- Modules? ==
[[user:Yacht|Yacht]] requested different chapters (not modules but may have intended to).
; NOTE : [[user:Paddu|Paddu]] refered it to a chapter (not a module) refering that he would move chapters to modules as they were finished.
'''P3''' - Last action -&gt; 22 Feb 2004
*There are now different and separate chapters, so the proposal is dead (will add this to the conventions and remove proposal as adopted) -- Panic2k4 (signature added by [[User:Paddu|Paddu]])

:Of course he/she referred to having separate modules. If your sense of chapters (like :functions&quot;, &quot;classes&quot;, &quot;pointers&quot;, &quot;STL&quot;, etc.) were to be used, there were already many such thingies when Yann made that comment. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 20:02, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)







==Adds &amp; Community building==
I've started posting some adds on the newsgroups and as an addon to my signature in many places, it seemed to work as for the new number of contributors I'll try to contact some other sources if you find a guide faq etc try sending the autor a email maybe he would like to port it over here or contributing... --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:50, 9 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:You mean [[w:advertisements|advertisements]]? -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 19:41, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Images... ==
[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] had a problem in including pics .png .jpg and .gif to the book, it must be problems with wikibooks upload function, [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] pointed out that direct references to a WEB resource that ends with any of the supported formats would work... '''IT DOES''' -- Panic2k4 (signature added by [[User:Paddu|Paddu]])

==Rearranged discussion &quot;area&quot;==

&lt;s&gt;The above three sections enclosed within horizontal rules is [[User:Panic2k4]]'s interpretation of the previous discussion.&lt;/s&gt; I'm opposed to his/her refactoring at least because:
#I was misquoted at least once &amp;mdash; Panic's interpretation is that I asked someone to be nice, though I'd just said that doing something would be nice.
#:Geezz Paddu just correct them, people do make errors, English is not my natural language, and try to not spend my time taking things that seriously... (probably the mess this was, if anyone changes your lines you wouldn't notice it :)
#::Nope! One is not supposed to edit another's comments. If it was just a spelling mistake it'd've been ok, but the reformatted para. seemed to imply something I didn't said, so I became angry. Sorry for that. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 22:25, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)
#The interpretation makes at least one false claim &amp;mdash; It's false that I didn't implement the highlighting I proposed. All the pages that I edited (except those in which I added navigation links) follow the convention I proposed.
#:Didn't see any and I didn't contribute to any modules only to &quot;the book&quot; (modules have seperate discussion &quot;boxes&quot; (hint) ) was this miss plassed here ?
#::Book != module. That's just your POV you are trying to impose around here. No one else seems to agree. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 22:25, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)
#It calls proposals without any opposition as dead.

I didn't check for more errors as I don't have much time. Besides, even then I wouldn't be correcting them as IMHO they form a comment Panic has posted and I

:Apparently Panic doesn't bother about others editing his comments for spelling/grammatical errors, but this couldn't have been assumed by me. Also, editing others comments is &quot;The Bad Thing (TM)&quot; even if they allow it. It's equivalent to attempting to misrepresent someone else's opinion. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 22:25, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)

believe I shouldn't edit his/her comment. Presenting the original is an easy way to make clear what each person said.

:Humm the originals are still there only commented out so to reduce the mess (I reverted it again), and missquoted are is not the same as edited, it's easier to

::Yeah, you replaced again with your &quot;mess&quot;. C'mon not everyone defines &quot;mess&quot; the same way. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 22:25, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:prioritize stuff as I have arranged it, please try to give it a chance, as for the dead proposals as adopted, heck if a house is pink I say it's pink I dind't select the color...

::As for the live proposals as discarded, &quot;heck if a whatever whatever color...&quot;. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 22:25, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:Please state what proposals you wish still to debate (if you still consider that for example the highlights are open, you should consider helping on heerr highlighting stuff :)

::I can't edit ''articles'' more than 50kB. I'm not that &lt;insert appropriate adjective&gt;. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 22:25, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:lol at this point in time I don't think it's a great idea if that would have been settled before no time would be have to be lost on this

::OK, so you think about 90% of the job is done. Good for me, I can peacefully do my work once you leave after the 10% is completed. The book I'm writing would take at least 10 man-years to come to the four-green-boxes stage, after which it'll still keep getting modified to match the latest C++ standards of that time. BTW I don't expect everyone to follow those conventions. Just that if no one does, I'll do that taking my own sweet time. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 22:25, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:(humm btw for example &quot;In My First C++ ...&quot; I didn't seem to notice any nor in the other modules I've seen...)

::Lol. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 22:25, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:It can be done when all sections are filled and a full revision starts, but now it's a bit late on the game 

And BTW Panic, Dysprosia is a &quot;she&quot; not a &quot;he&quot;. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 13:11, 8 Nov 2004 (UTC)

:Lol I'll correct that one :)--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:10, 9 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== That is one ugly cover image. ==

Really, it's not that readable and it has no border or mesh... heck it doesnt even make sense. Lightning + Brick-Wall Letters + Red/Yellow Letters + Weird Curve in the Background


Does this article really warrant a hard to read image that in no way meshes with the rest of the site?

----

Well, since I'm the author of the image, and you seem at least to have taken some time to comment on it, I can give you some creative points on how to interpret it:

Lighting = Power&lt;br&gt;
Brick-Wall = Objects / Modular Concept

Red/Yellow letters is known to be a binary color mix to provide an eye catching point to the image,
so to keep you on the point and try to make you read the title :)

As for the &quot;weird curve&quot;, heck, you can see it as the non static nature of the language...

The point is not if the book (not article) needs a cover image but that someone (in this case I) took the time to create one and removing data or information from a work will not improve it, unless it is wrong or a better content can replace it (you are free to create another one).

As for the &quot;meshing&quot; of the picture with the rest of the site it's in-relevant, dif. users use dif. skins/layouts and the book is a closed work in itself there isn't a common link on books as in articles in lets say Wikipedia, where the flow of designs can have some relevance...

== I '''DO''' disagree with the merge... ==

''All resolution discussions seem to have broken down so I am taking drastic action to enforce Wikibooks:Forking policy. I have moved Programming: C -/- -/- to Programming:C plus plus/Temp, please merge any and ALL information there into this book's hierarchy. Remember wiki is not paper, a single 223 KB page is absolutely inexcusable.''

''If you disagree please use this page's talk page and I will do my best to address the issue.''

* The referred policy took form after the fork.

* Moderation was requested (but not provided) by the two users involved before I did decided on the fork that fallowed the Wikipedia policy (the active one at the time).

''Forking can harm Wikibooks in that it divides the community effort into producing a Wikibook,''

I did take every factor into account before forking the work, you should have noted the contributors activity on both works before doing anything, even the size of the works. C -/- -/- did have more content that the original C Plus Plus work, and since wikibooks names lose relevance on this discussion because of the + sign a more &quot;neutral&quot; name should be used like CPP or any other variation in any case. 

''a warning to the forker of the book, authors of the original, and notices to both the talk pages will be made. Both parties should endeavour to merge the fork back to the original. ''

* I was not informed about the merge or requested to do so by a moderator/administrator...

''where this fails, either by one or both parties actively disagreeing to reunify the books, or after two weeks, a notice that the fork will be deleted in two weeks will be placed on the fork page. If this time period expires and the forker of the book requests this deleted content available, administrators should readily endeavour to do so.''

* No notice was posted, and I DO request that the content be restored...

''The creation of multiple Wikibooks on the same topic is permitted in circumstances of...''
''-appeal to differing audiences'' 
''-differing approaches''

* the fork was done not only but also because these points were not met on the original work, and no compromise could be reached with the previous contributor, reversions started to occur even if the person reverting it was not actively contributing at the time. (this is not a personal attack but one of the many motivations that lead to the fork)

I do request that the work be restored (and) or if a merge is needed (a significant part of C Plus Plus was already on C -/- -/-) the person/moderator/administrator should merge the smalled work into the bigger one, I do acknowledge the need for a policy for forks and &quot;we&quot; did try to prevent it from opening (both users involved tried to come to terms and it was proven impossible at that time). Even if the policy can be enforced on site, I will move the content to another service if this merge is taken forward. ( I have invested some time working on the book and asking for others to contribute to it, to see it be lost on political/personal moves, I'm sorry, but I do not have the time to be involved on discussions (not related to the actual content) and on the creation of the book at the same time.

--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 03:25, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

Ah, a reply at last. I was not aware that the policy had spawned due to this (had I been I would have treaded more carefully in its application) but it doesn't alter my use of it. I'm sorry to say I forgot to inform the contributors about my merge &quot;ultimatum&quot;, I was fully intending to.

Due to the general inactivity on both books (at the time) I decided to take the merge to task myself on any word-for-word sections (using ''see also'' links to the &quot;other version&quot;), but due to a lack of free time and no knowledge of the subject I ended up only doing the intro blurb (and maybe one or two other things).

The hierarchy of the C plus plus book is somewhat flawed and probably confusing, but the single page also has its flaws in that it often stops downloading half-way through, even on my (pseudo-)broadband connection. This is very bad for the reader, as if it stops at the end of a sentence they may not even realise it's not the end of the page (not all browsers report stoppings).

Now I am only interested in the ''method'' of providing the content, rather than the content itself; I'm not saying the one book is &quot;better&quot; than the other, just that it is ''really'' confusing to the average reader to have two separate but &quot;identical&quot; books.

I couldn't easily tell which work was bigger (since plus plus has numerous subpages) so I merely chose to merge into the &quot;plus plus&quot; as it is the more acceptable alternate naming convention due to avoiding the slash (which is reserved for parent and child directory functions and other complex MediaWiki 1.5 and 1.5+ features). It wasn't me favouring the content, just the page name and separate-pages structure (again, massive KB causes problems).

I'm not trying to strongarm anyone or drive anyone away, but there needs to be some ''active'' work at resolving the problem and turning the two into one.

Having two ostensibly &quot;identical&quot; books is confusing for the reader--some sections in one book, some in another--and inherently counterproductive for contributors--a small section gets updated on the one and updated differently on the other by two different people leading to two different explanations--leading to a fair amount of overlap and redundancy

I hope you can work on the resolution some more, as I really don't have the knowledge of the topic to fathom any of the audience differences etc. that these two may or may not have.

Anyway, I've rambled, so, I hope that answers everything. :) If not, ask away. I just want this resolved as quickly and easily as possible so actual ''work'' can be done on a united book, rather than the arguing and reverting of the past.

I do comprehend your job on keeping things tight and clean but it bothers me and probably every contributor to the books in question that it took so much time to the problem to get moderated ...

The problem is that, as I tell you above, there is no need for moderation at this point as the new book falls into the rules as a valid fork. Paddu the last active editor before I took to the task, did have a different approach (and for a particular audience) that lead to a different structure.

I do understand that you may not know the particular topics of the books in question but even if you intended just for a speedy solution you could have  and probably should have taken the time to examine the works in question.

I and for what I did understand Paddu agreed that the works, that talk about the same &quot;topic&quot;, do complement each-other but they do not address the same problems or are intended to the same audience.

Paddu selected the beginner approach to the problem of explaining the &quot;topic&quot;. I for one decided that the &quot;topic&quot; was so vast that a point by point explanation was valid and needed (I have even started other books because of it). Paddu (and the ones before him) intended or were headed to a on &quot;topic&quot; only book....

I do think in the terms of:
:I need to drive a car, I should know what roads are, whats inside the engine, how it works and why or even how many brands/types of tires can I get, etc... 
The previous approach was more like an introduction and a FAQ with an area for a kind'a'forum for users to solve questions (that part was inactive and did not reported any real activity...), heck, just check the it's status before any of my contributions...

If you need more details please take a look at the books and you can google Panic2k4 or Paddu to see any reference and cache of pages related to the problems that lead to the fork in detail, if they aren't available on wikibooks cache. You should/can also see what pages (and how many links) each page has but again that is a system problem (in this case the NET) not a content one, the book is valid no mater how many times or how it gets &quot;addressed&quot;...

Again, I request that you put the books as they were before you started the &quot;merge&quot; or as C Plus Plus was a lot smaller and if no one objects to it using C -/- -/- as the template and active work (as I said part of C Plus Plus is already on C -/- -/-) if that solution doesn't agree with wikibooks naming &quot;system&quot;, and for a common ground or just for a quick fix, I don't mind you rename C -/- -/- as CPP (for me that point in irrelevant as it's a system limitation we can't use &quot;+&quot; not a content (book) related problem, &quot;you&quot; should fix the system so the proper name could be used) the idea behind the weird name was to permit the evolution of the book having in mind a later &quot;merge&quot; or central page to select one of the books, for example you could centralize all C++ &quot;topic&quot; books on a CPP page...

About the monolithic structure, if you had/do read the talk you could/can see that actions were taken to resolve that problem, but a monolithic display would be preserved (Its easier to print out for once and to develop a logical structure or just to see were work needs to be done without having to navigate obscure links, again this is a problem with the system not the content), a framework or a per topic approach can and would be available to readers as the work matures and then (using topics) a &quot;merge&quot; could be made to C Plus Plus (or the relevant parts of it, as the intended audience and approaches aren't the same and so they can't really merge as a single book.

I'll have to note that the tipping point that lead to a fork was the start of a revert war without moderation, that was actively requested from both parts, any later merge requests did came from Paddu (as he was had stopped contributing to the work) but at that time I was more interested in providing order and content than on spending time debating every structure or changes that lead to a different book as Paddu pointed out at the time, so, as I already stated the late and now the new fork policy do apply. 

And so, again I request that you put things as you found them and take the time to examine the problem or another angle that would permit me and other contributors to continue to do productive work. 

You could check the contributions of users to both works and the contributors them selfs as you decide what to do or what approach to fallow, but if you don't have a real solution do not complicate the problem, if the situation was &quot;confusing&quot; now it's a nightmare...

:At the time I thought it a legitimate enough solution, and I certainly didn't try to do a quick job of it as I knew that could easily result in lost content. As it was I gave up due to the complexity of both projects and the lack of overlap.
:At the time there hadn't been changes to any of the pages in roughly a month, and the solution had died long ago, so I decided I might as well help things along in the absence of others.
:Don't worry about renaming at the moment. The -/- was just a minor niggle because at some vague point in the future the slash might generate redlinks to fill up the proposed auto-TOC feature. You see, I couldn't easily tell which book was bigger as plus plus had so many subpages to check over, so I decided the fork should go into the (better-named) original module, which it was probably largely a mirror of anyway. As it is I was quite mistaken.
:But enough of that, I've just thought of a different solution for these somewhat incongruous projects working together... you could have ''your'' content as in-depth examination of ''his'' overview. So at the end of each brief section it would say &quot;read more on XYZ&quot;, and would link to a further in-depth section about it on a subpage of that page named &quot;/Further Info&quot; (or another wording/naming convention). Complete with precise section linking where applicable to go straight to the info.
:That way there is no need of compromise as no content is lost or conflicting; users wanting a refresher or summary could just read the basic info, and those wanting more could click through to the examples after reading the short equivalent. There would also be a &quot;full details Table of Contents&quot;, a mirror of the main TOC but with direct links to each of your writeups.
:AND this would put both books under the same hierarchy, so the reader only sees a single volume on the topic.
:As for the single-page approach, I had already found a solution... didn't I already mention that somewhere? Anyway, I've just made an example of it in use at [[User:Garrett/Temp]]. That way you can have little pages to navigate around easily and quickly, but the gargantuan page is there if you want it--''and'' is always up-to-date. The ''only'' problem is that any new pages need to be added to there as well as to the TOC to ensure it's always complete.
:Anway, see what you think of that. :) [[User:Master Thief Garrett|Garrett]]&lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:Master Thief Garrett|Talk]]&lt;/sup&gt; 11:57, 26 July 2005 (UTC)

== Plagarism ?==
Someone has been filling significant amounts of the body of this text with plagarized material from &quot;How To Think Like A Computer Scientist: Learning with C++&quot; by Allen B. Downey. 

The two sentences that struck me as odd were: &quot;So far we have looked at the elements of a programming language---variables, expressions, and statements---in isolation, without talking about how to combine them.&quot; in the &quot;Composition (Operator Precedence)&quot; section and &quot;A natural way to represent a point in C++ is with two doubles.&quot; in the &quot;Structures&quot; section of the book. The former sentence is from  chapter 2, section 2.19, while the latter is from chapter 8, section 8.2 of the aforementioned book by Allen Downey. A cursory check of the surrounding text seems to have also been copied.

If this work was copied with the permission of Allen Downey, I apologize for playing Chicken Little.

I've checked that on google and it seems there are also references to &quot;So far we have looked at the elements of a programming language&quot; in other works like &quot;How to Think Like a Computer Scientist von Allen B. Downey: Java Version&quot; http://ada.rg16.asn-wien.ac.at/~javafs/cs/ and then found http://allendowney.com/cs230spring02/code/hw09/text.txt that has the GNU Free Documentation License (Ive downloaded the last one) ... so we are cool, I'll add the last work to the list of docs that can be &quot;predated&quot; on as soon as you or any other user checks that what I said is correct (no need to remove that frases of the work so far...), I not calling ya &quot;Chicken Little&quot; :) at this moment (do you know a reference to the story in question? I get the general ideia but dont have a cultural reference)

Humm Ive found this...

 &quot;Chicken Little&quot; is a story for teaching courage.
 Don't be a chicken little.
 Don't be afraid.
 The sky is not falling.

http://eleaston.com/chicken.html is this it ? (I think its a bed time story right ?, it seems that there are some movies about it also :) )

PS: Ill add the actions taken by me to verify that the work did in deed have the right copyrights (or not) to the forword/reader section so to prevent erroneos warnings (or reduce them) --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 20:29, 20 Nov 2004 (UTC)

You have only found additional versions of the work Chuck is referencing.  The first is a translation of Mr. Downey's text, so I don't know what it says; but the second is in fact a GNUFDL'ed version of Mr. Downey's work.  However, there are several problems with its use.  First, Mr. Downey's work is GNU-FDL version 1.1, while we use version 1.2.; as the source text does not declare &quot;GFDL version 1.1 and all future versions&quot;, but only states version 1.1, it can not be used under our license. Secondly, just because a work is GFDL'ed doesn't give us the right to simply copy and paste portions of that work here.  The GFDL requires appropiate credit be given to the author of a work, and right now that has not happened.  I'm considering labeling this entire work a copyright violation, and listing it for deletion on those grounds. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 20:24, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Ok found the original source...

http://web.archive.org/web/20030211041642/www.ibiblio.org/obp/thinkCScpp/

How To Think Like A Computer Scientist
Learning with C++
by Allen B. Downey

referred as an open textbook and as no direct reference to a license is given it falls under the Public Domain it seems that many other sources may exist and many other works may have &quot;cross polarizations&quot; from it...

&quot; Allen B. Downey, professor of Computer Science at Wellesley College, originally wrote &quot;How to Think Like a Computer Scientist&quot;in Java, as a textbook for his computer science class. Over the summer of 1998, Professor Downey converted the Java version of &quot;How to Think Like a Computer Scientist&quot; into C++. Since then, the Java version has undergone several major changes, including the addition of Abstract Data Types such as Stacks, Queues, and Heaps. The C++ version of the open textbook however, did not receive these changes, that is...until now.&quot;

humm... and then the copy I have posted in wikibooks has GFDL 1.1 that states

&quot;Aggregation with Independent Works

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the compilation. Such a compilation is called an ``aggregate, and this License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves derivative works of the Document.&quot;

Even worse, that book, article has/includes a license in it raw state (not filled in) so even if we can attest that it intended to use it, if it's not filled it would fall under published under the Public Domain, right ?

GNU-FDL version 1.1 and GNU-FDL version 1.2+ all have references that allow the use of &quot;snips&quot;

as for:
&quot;Secondly, just because a work is GFDL'ed doesn't give us the right to simply copy and paste portions of that work here.&quot;

Most of the the work here is on Wikipedia GFDL texts/articles so it will also suffer from that problem ? 

I'm not a lawier but that is my interpretation, as for the stated problem this is an open book you can add yourself the needed references to Allen B. Downey in an appropriate section, as you can see was already some actions had already been to rectify this, it's better than removing all of the content...--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 21:56, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC)
----
I have also checked that some other works on wikibooks have snips from other works on wikibooks (not only references from wikipedia) --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 22:09, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC)
----
The first version you said you couldn't read is in English (one topic seems that to be in German, enter any one of the topics and you will see...)

As for the Java references that not the problem as many of the content applies to any other programming language.

A clarification that is missing (and your comment made me check into) and other readers/users should be able to read (you should have put a link to it), is that even if a grave problem arises the work WILL NOT BE DELETED, the page will be blanked but the work accessible with the history function (moderators should have a template for that).

As far as I know no author has made a claim, not even wikipedians, a reader made a remark that was correct but was checked and does have some very good bases to fall under a GDFL or a compatible license.
 
I know moderators are busy people and all that, but I think you should get deeper on your role... or at least state that you are busy at the moment not let us hung with the threat of deletion as you did (on top of that, it seems that a simple action (just reference/credit) taken by yourself would solve part of the moderation problem you have), You also missed all the prev. points/questions on this page that lack moderation attention, this regrettable because it prevents or at least makes people think twice about contribution, [[user:Paddu|Paddu]] as a question waiting on [Wikibooks:Staff_lounge] since October, probably most of the problems I and C++/CPlusPlus users had could have been prevented, a similar topic was already on your own talk page waiting for some time.

As a first time wikibook user/contributor this hasn´t been an overall good experience for me, I thought the idea was to bring content and most people seem to spend the time raising problems and debating small editorial questions, one thing that I observed is that contributors don't tend to spend much time debating such mood points. As a programmer I tend to build on other peoples work not reinvent the wheel, I have based the structure of this book in some books I have and if seen useful and ready to use, with compatible licenses, I will be prone to use them in place of doing all from basic.

I'm not saying that you are doing a bad job but at this time it seems incomplete, can you refer an email (in accord with the wikibooks protocol) so to solve this problem ASAP, I will send all works I have found and in future, any other anyone else intends in using so to expedite the license checks, txs. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 05:58, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)

I´ll move the references to a proper section as soon as this is resolved... --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 06:40, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Images... ==
[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] had a problem in including pics .png .jpg and .gif to the book, it must be problems with wikibooks upload function, [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] pointed out that direct references to a WEB resource that ends with any of the supported formats would work... '''IT DOES'''

== Reference links ==

I see a bunch of useful-looking C++ reference links at
[[User:Paddu]]
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/User:Paddu

Should I copy them to this book in the &quot;Reference Sites&quot; section ?

::Max, you should contribute to the [[Programming:C plus plus]] book. This book is going to be deleted in 10 days. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 19:04, 11 September 2005 (UTC)

So let me know if i got this right: 

I should link to the multi-page version of this book, since this is the future. New stuff / Corrections should also go into the multi-page versions. If a new chapter is added, :_OnePage and :_Index need to be updated, but nothing else. 

The things currently in the :_OnePage need to go into different chapters, and :_OnePage and :_Index need to be updated.

Now the only question i have left is: Some pages have a colon (e.g. Programming_in_C -/- -/-:_Introduction) and some don't (Programming:C_-/-_-/-_Programming_Language). Which version is the way to go?

-- [[User:maxberger|Max]] 11 Sept 2005
:Hi Max. You should link to the [[Programming:C plus plus]] version. That book currently uses space separators for chapter name, although it should really be colons. What you use right now shouldn't be a big deal: so long as it's consistent with whatever style the links near it use, then when it's all changed and standardized it will become correct. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 19:04, 11 September 2005 (UTC)
::Hi MShonle. Thank you for the feedback. However, my indented audience are students taking a beginners C++ programming course. From comparing the two books I found the C -/- -/- way easier to read and understand for beginners. So as longs as there are two book I prefer this one. -- [[User:maxberger|Max]] 11 Sept 2005
:::Well, I suppose that's the catch here. That is, the &quot;so long as their are two books&quot; part: this book will be deleted by the 21st. (It's a rather long and sorted story, but see the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]] for more details.) The most useful of this book's contents, consistent with the other version, should be merged with the existing book. You can merge the contents of the two into [[Programming:C plus plus]] if you'd like. But as a resource this book won't be up on Wikibooks so anything you work on here won't be posted, unless you (or someone else) adds it to [[Programming:C plus plus]].

== Reversion of the work and related pages ==

I saw a reversion done by [[user:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]], no great problem there, but with it other changes were lost, so I propose reversions in accord to the use/warnings wikibooks places on them should only be done by people doing hard contribution (I call them major contributors) or by any other user in cases of vandalization if no loss of content occurs if so it should be edited out not reverted, if anyone has some problems please use this discussion area or read what is written in this discussion area (the why and how should always be found here so others can see it...) --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:15, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)

(cur) (last)  20:01, 17 Nov 2004 Panic2k4 M (reverted - yes and no this is a relevant reference not an add value to the context if portability of the context is to be maintained this info needs to be visible (se 2nd convention)) 
(cur) (last)  06:32, 17 Nov 2004 Dysprosia M (revert. internal wikilinks should be internal, that should be obvious) 
(cur) (last)  02:25, 17 Nov 2004 Panic2k4 M (The Programming Language - fix) 

You are correct, I swear that I saw it, the edits times aren't that close, but could it have been a cross edit ?!? I do have been having huge problems with my ISP using &quot;forced&quot; cache proxy (or wiki not dealing with them properly)... sorry Ill correct my statement... What you did was not a reversion but due to your wording on the comment and the quick (and now confirmed as erroneous) check I did, I was lead on error, but even so the use of reversions does already have a warning from wikibooks, the proposal is valid in the sense it ports it to the conventions section...

So...

I propose reversions in accord to the use/warnings wikibooks places on them should only be done by people doing hard contribution (I call them major contributors) or by any other user in cases of vandalization if no loss of content occurs if so it should be edited out not reverted, if anyone has some problems with the content please use this discussion area or read what is written in this discussion area (the why and how should always be found here so others can see it...)

== Transclusion editing ==

I seems to have a problem with editing content that are included by transclusion. For example the external section have be edited and showing up if one look at the external section on its own. The old one still show up tho on the main page. Any idea / particular reason why ? -- [[User:KTC|KTC]] 08:11, 28 Jan 2004 (UTC)
----
Forceful worked around it today by deleting and then reinserting the transclusion. Somehow, doesn't feel like that being a long term solution tho... -- [[User:KTC|KTC]] 21:58, 28 Jan 2004 (UTC)
----
Sorry KTC, I did not get a notice for this post, txs for the help, I don't particularly master Wiki (or like it) but it is a good tool for this purpose, I've noticed that with transclusions the updates takes a little more time to become active, it's probably some kind of caching that the server/software does to speed stuff up, I've not taken the time to look into it but the updates do become active after a while...

As you did (or not) noticed this &quot;work&quot; is a fork after having had some problems with the last &quot;active&quot; contributor, one of the points under discussion was that the work should be split into chapter/sections, so and thinking on future contributors that have slow connections or software limitations on the edits, I've started splitting some more stable/static parts of the &quot;work&quot; using transclusions that in a future stage could be used to give a more modular look to the project, as my intention is to have at least one global look on the structure (so to facilitate the modification of the logical structure/display of content), a monolithic format is ideal for this as for grabbing a copy of the work, doing a print out or conversion to PDF etc...

Don't panic... use the same steps I do, as you are editing stuff turn on (Watch this page) and take a look on Recent Changes (wikibooks main) and that will keep you up to date with any edits...
--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 05:09, 29 Jan 2005 (UTC)



== TODOs ==

I saw that [[user:James Dennett|James Dennett]] started to use TODOs notes on the book, I was using commented out notes but the idea is probably more pleasant to readers that can see that a section is in evolution and to contributors than can add to it (no one likes to see TODOs :) ) I've made them a bit more visible and removed  &lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt; messes up the text justification on long phrases, I have added

&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 10px; padding: 5px; border: 1px solid red;&quot;&gt; 
;(TODO: &lt;desc.&gt;)
&lt;/div&gt;

done with (You can copy-paste):

&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 10px; padding: 5px; border: 1px solid red;&quot;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;;(TODO: &lt;desc.&gt;)&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;

I have some ideas to the NOTEs and WARNINGs, I'll wait first for anyone to comment on the TODOs... if no one oppose I'll move it to the conventions and add the code to edit section, a wikibooks:template would be nice but I had not the time to see about them properly yet, the TOC should also be fixed, a smaller one (it seems that it can't be &quot;hidden&quot; by default but that will only be useful if we can use the hide/show javascript on it... --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 05:18, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC)

==Having all material in a book in a single page==

Can't the reference tables be moved to the main page into the related part of the doc and use anchors to refer to them ?

This does have something to have with previous discussions about removing part of the work to other pages but as this is not an independent topic (it relates to misc. parts of the main topic) -- [[User:Pani2k4|Panic]]

:It's infeasible to have an entire book in a single wiki page. It may be OK for some people to read that (there do exist a lot of e-books available in &quot;one-big HTML&quot; format), but editing such a page would be difficult. Yeah, we have section editing and all that, but still it is a pain. After submiting it, you've to wait for the whole book to load again. Which reminds me... What about people trying to learn about just one language feature. Do you want them to wait for the entire book to load? That's why pages in the context of wikibooks are called &quot;modules&quot;, not &quot;books&quot;. Depending on the size of the book, each &quot;module&quot; may be a separate chapter or section or sub-section or anything.

::If you want all chapters in one big HTML, it should be possible to create a page like this:

 &lt;nowiki&gt;
 		{{Programming:C plus plus chapter name 1}}
 		----
 		{{Programming:C plus plus chapter name 2}}
 		----
 		{{Programming:C plus plus chapter name ...}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

::but the navigational links I've added to some of the chapters won't point within the page but to the page for individual chapters. But that should be the least of our problems. The real problem is that the servers would slow down. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 20:17, 18 Oct 2004 (UTC)

:::A single page from my point of view is the best trade off, for the user and the writer, as stated above any contributor would find more easily were he can be most useful and avoid repeating already contributed information, as a reader I do really hate wiki because of the limitations it gives to export to a non wiki env. like to get a copy of the work as a PDF.  -- [[User:Pani2k4|Panic]]

:What was dicussed before was not trying to include all C++-related topics into this book but to deal with only one topic &amp;mdash; C++. The other topics must be in different books. Of course there should be a link to those books here and a link to this one in those, but each chapter in those other books should not be mentioned in the table of contents of this book. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]]

::Agree, but the &quot;topics&quot; can be easily moved later if found to be extensible enough to be a stand alone book, moving empty topics will only fragment the user/contributor base...  -- [[User:Pani2k4|Panic]]

and there isn't a wiki &quot;extractor&quot; (does it?) that would facilitate getting a copy of all the work I do think that
it should be avoided and only use external pages to start independent &quot;books&quot; (works with private topics), I have also tried to find an offline editor (that isn't a Emacs or Unix solution...), does anyone know about one ? -- [[User:Pani2k4|Panic]]

:Probably you are looking for [[Special:Export]]?

::Nope, something like a OpenOffice plugin something on those lines... I dont want to install a server and wiki on my comp to be able to edit offline :)...  -- [[User:Pani2k4|Panic]]

... and still on forking the work into multiple books. First lets have a working &quot;book&quot; and then we'll trim it out, using s streamline structure without references to multiple subpages will help to desegregate other topics, hec... even STL, that is part of the standard should have a separated book only for it, but lets try to just keep it on topic and with a simple and logic structure, then we can see if it is worth to fork it for the moment all content (on topic) will help to bring contributions ...  -- [[User:Pani2k4|Panic]]

:It's difficult to have a working &quot;book&quot; without structure, with just random stuff about every C++-related topic thrown about. Talking of forks, splitting a program into a lot many source files is not equivalent to creating forks. Forks in wikibooks would be having two different wikibooks on the same subject. Is there any other book on C++ here? -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 20:45, 17 Oct 2004 (UTC)

::Ok, I should have used thread of subject and not fork (topic would also be wrong as a topic can be linked to a external subject), but I've seen your changes to the &quot;Guide to Writers&quot; but is there a way to list all &quot;modules&quot; on a single page so anyone can get a easy copy of the book (for printing or just to avoid repeating info or just to link to the relevant areas ? ) if not dividing the work into multiple modules is not a good idea it will only hide information and segment the readers reducing the writers as they will only see blocks of the work and probably if a users comes to the book as a reader the probability that he will contribute to a section he wants to read about is less that to a part he already knows, in modules only people that already have some degree of knowledge on the subject would contribute and I really doubt that this would result on more work being done, to do spell checking I don't need to know C++ (for example)...  -- [[User:Pani2k4|Panic]]

:::The intent is to make the readers aware that they can edit ''any page'', not just what they are reading. With [[w:|Wikipedia]], the average newcomer is tempted to read more &amp; more pages following various internal links, and hence can easily arrive at something known and start contributing to that article. In wikibooks, the no. of links is low and this ''may'' be a problem. But IMHO the reader can easily guess that there is more than one module to a book and search for other modules in a book.

:::As far as coverage of new subjects is concerned, the idea probably was to list the books expected to be written in a bookshelf, and a visitor to the bookshelf can easily find what subjects he could contribute to. This approach would not work if bookshelves are (e.g.) given lower Google ranking than to a particular book. In such a case most visitors would only visit that book and might not be able to guess that they are free to contribute to any of the other books listed in the bookshelf.

:::I can't think of a solution to the problem other than what I've mentioned, namely have a huge page that instantiates each page of the wikibook as a template (did you know you could insert the contents of any page into any other page using templates?). It is possible to also have an edit link to individual pages, so any reader could be lured into adding content for any of the modules. But the real problem is that having large pages both irritates the reader and stresses the servers. I think we could get a better solution if we ask this in the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]], which has a greater visibility.

:::BTW, please sign your comments with a &lt;tt&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;~~~~&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/tt&gt;. It's difficult to find which comments are by whom. I'm having a tough time taking our discussion to the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge|Staff lounge]]. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 14:42, 20 Oct 2004 (UTC)

Here's my 2c. A book has a lot of largish chapters - let's emulate this. Having everything on one page disadvantages the reader in having things referenced, it's easy to bookmark a module page to a certain section, but it's not if everything's on one page, since one has to look through that to find something. Not to mention it's more difficult on dialup connections. It also allows one to structure the material and have different people working on different things without loss of apparent continuity in the text.
Speaking of forks, I am strongly against this. If we have any chance of making something decent here we need to pool our resources and create something unified. [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] 21:32, 2 Nov 2004 (UTC)

[[user:Panic2k4|Panic]] said&quot;&lt;code&gt;...people would participate more if given a vast range of options to build upon, this is one of the reasons that a single &quot;huge&quot; page would work better,...&lt;/code&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;code&gt;...A single page from my point of view is the best trade off, for the user and the writer,&lt;/code&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;code&gt;...any contributor would find more easily were he can be most useful and avoid repeating already contributed information,&lt;/code&gt;&quot; and &quot;&lt;code&gt;...because of the limitations it gives to export to a non wiki env. like to get a copy of the work as a PDF&lt;/code&gt;&quot;

'''P6''' - Last action -&gt; Very active :) -- Panic2k4 (signature added by [[User:Paddu|Paddu]])

Here is a possible solution: Either way, the text needs to be split up into different sections. How about splitting up this page into chapters and having more lecture style material more suited for a [[Wikiversity]] type course which can be a bit more freeform as Panic seems to be more comfortable with? (Though you will need to break it up into a set of lectures regardless, ''and'' most importantly keep it structured).

:Lol, sorry about the &quot;he&quot; [[User:Dysprosia|Dysprosia]] you are part of a minority so I did take it for granted, I've been corrected and switched any wrong gender references :) (Hope it alright now...)

:I'll elaborate it more here and them move relevant parts to the &quot;proposals section&quot;, I understand that you are referring to modules (separated pages) as chapters and sections... as for the order or structure I do think it's taking shape but stuff needs from time to time to be moved around just to make sense (we can't talk about classes before going into what OOP brings to C++ etc...), as for the fixed idea [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] has with modules, I'm not against it nor mind set into a huge page but to make it a logical work. If we have multiple pages and with it discussion pages etc... it makes it a very difficult job on making a good work just take a look on the wiki bib. (on the previous modules) they go all over the place, I think that the problem is that people tend to look at this wiki book as an extension of wikipedia and this is separated work that must stand by itself if we fragment it it stops being a book. I'm taking the road set by P3 &quot;move chapters to modules as they were finished&quot; (they aren't) 

:Nope, I didn't mean that. What I meant was (a clearer/vaguer explanation is in your talk page) that once an individual &quot;submodule&quot; nears completion, stuff from the main module would be added to the &quot;submodule&quot;. -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 22:54, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)

and see if the solution [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] indicated will work (transclusion, I think its a great option), still waiting for him to give me a working example 

:I've given in your talk page. You didn't bother to see. And even otherwise, I'm not the one who wrote the transclusion code in MediaWiki. There are many here who know about it. If only you convince yourself to explore the wiki... -- [[User:Paddu|Paddu]] 22:54, 17 Nov 2004 (UTC)

but that would solve the problem of extracting all content to let's say a .TXT file and make it easier to coordinate edits (stop the duplication) and keep the ease of editing (if you go into the history you can easily see that people edit and contribute to different &quot;chapters&quot; that would be made impossible if using modules at this stage... ufff I think it's all, combined with I and others have

===About the starting the merge===

It seems like the discussion here has died down, and we agree on most things that we need to agree on to do the actual merge. So here's another proposition:

* We'll take the TOC as it is presented here, and merge / move the contents to the appropriate chapters.
* We will use this page for coordination (write your name next to the chapter(s) you're working on)
* we'll start as soon as everyone involved in the heated discussion (panic, mshonle) agrees.

How it would work:
* Sign in on this page
* Create a page with the content your working on
* modify the main toc
* sign out on this page

Your answer (either: &quot;ok&quot;, &quot;no, wait a little longer, there are still some open issues&quot;, or &quot;no, this is a bad idea&quot;). If you voted no, please explain.

* ok --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 19:25, 15 September 2005 (UTC)
* no, wait a little longer, there are still some open issues, the C -/- -/- will have to be processed (marked for deletion) at that time some other users may have 1) a better solution 2)can vote to prevent deletion.
What was proposed so far was already being done (not exacly equal but with the same general idea, only at C -/- -/-, you can check the last talks on C Plus Plus with another admin (the commenst marked as mine, before that one can be out of context since Paddu edited and moved stuff arround and I didn't check it out), untill C -/- -/- is moved for deletion, I will, edit it.
I will only contribute actively to C Plus Plus after the other work is closed for edit, and after subject of the so called fork is resolved.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 21:34, 15 September 2005 (UTC)

So to talk dates:
* C -/- -/- is supposed to be deleted on sept 21
* the contents will still be available for two weeks after that
* the merge will then start on sept 21?
--[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 21:42, 15 September 2005 (UTC)

:Just a note. There will be no &quot;marked for deletion&quot; process or any voting. This ''is'' the process for the book. I've considered locking the contents of the C -/- -/- book, but I didn't think there was much need to do so. (If there is some need we can still do that, though.) But no other event should be bound to the Sept 21st date, we don't need to wait until then to start the merge. In other words, Max, start at it!

I am confused. Panik: You say wait. MShonle: You say start. I do not think it makes sense to start merging before the -/- -/- is locked (to be safe). So if we have to wait for the 21st to conform with the rules we will do that. I think locking it on the 21st and making it avaiable for at least two weeks after that (or if we merged it before, that would work). --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 05:28, 16 September 2005 (UTC)

I've started doing some of the moves (some pages are still protected) and some content is still inside the monolithic page... remember that if you move any content to redirect it so it doesn't become lost or missing, the missing part will be resolved as soon as C -/- -/- is deleted there is another problem I'll add a reference to Programming:Java and Programming in C -/- -/- to the list of works we are using contents as even if the last is deleted at wikibooks there are now copies on the wild...--01:50, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

==Charter==
This book is an introduction to programming concepts using C++. The book covers the essential features of the language and its standard library. It also provides a survey of important concepts, like the STL, software design, and design patterns, but only as a stepping stone for the reader to learn more from other books. The book does not cover non-standard C++ libraries, some of the more advanced or esoteric concepts, nor general computer science data-structures and algorithm techniques (although recursion and other basic concepts should be covered). The book is not intended to be a complete reference to the C++ language. This book would be appropriate for a first course in programming or computer science.

==Contents==

This is a tentative Table of contents. Feel free to modify it if needed, but always add a short paragraph saying what you did and why. If you remove larger sections, please copy the removed section into your paragraph.

==Discussion==

===About the charter===
I'd take the charter word-for-word into the foreword --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 00:32, 15 September 2005 (UTC)
:We might also want to consider a charter for the C++ Reference book at the same time, and carefully word it so that it does not conflict with this work. That way, if a couple of months down the road we find someone really wants to contribute material that's way too advanced we can just direct them to the C++ Reference book instead. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 02:08, 15 September 2005 (UTC)
::So what is currently &quot;Part VIII: Reference Tables&quot; will be the start of the reference book? --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 02:17, 15 September 2005 (UTC)
----
There is some problems with the charter, even if we agree in having a simplified version of the book.

The [[Programming]] is already a wikibook, if we continue to use this name space, as stated in the naming proposal, the [[Programming:C plus plus]] will not be a stand alone work but a &quot;module&quot; of the other work, as such the authors/refereces and other GFDL needed sections would have to be included on the [[Programming]] work not on the module.

A solution is to move the work to the Wikibooks root and use a redirect to a simplified TOC directed as was stated is the intention of [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] of a basic and introductory &quot;module&quot; of the C++ Programming Language.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 00:05, 18 September 2005 (UTC)

===Reference book===
:::I think a good start for the reference book would be a GFDL-compatible syntactic specification (BNF or similar), and then the writing task would be to add the semantics to the rules of the syntax. There would probably need to be a chapter on type conversions and promotions, all of the built in types, the separate-compiling/linking strategy, the implementation of vtables, the precise differences from C, and plus the public interfaces of the standard library (simply including GNU headers in the text, as done for one header in this book, wouldn't be good: too much info in some places, and not enough descriptions in others). It's possible that the GNU libraries already have GFDL references, in which case the job would be to either: (1) link to them; or (2) include them, and elide the GNU-specific features. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 04:03, 15 September 2005 (UTC)
::::This is way beyond something that I'd be interested in. It may be a good thing to have, but we'd need someone to write it. Volunteers? --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 19:14, 15 September 2005 (UTC)

----
Why limit it only to ''The book covers the essential features of the language'', I think the namespace (or url or location) is wrong for that but a new location like Programming in C++ could include all the C++ related information, and '''request''' that if parts of the book are made into stand alone works a copy and urls and short introduction takes its place, but then will it not constitute a fork of the book like this was considered, part of the book was copied even if not addressing the exact same topic or objective. (probably the fork policy should be made more clear as the standard interpretation of what a fork is can be broad.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:07, 15 September 2005 (UTC)
:Yes, makes sense. Use this as a start, but when / if something gets to big, then it'll get its own book. --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 01:49, 15 September 2005 (UTC)

:I would consider a fork to be any book that would be ''competing'' for the same audience as another wikibook (instead of ''complementing'' that book) and that would also divide contributors. A C++ reference book is appropriate for Wikibooks. For example, one that talks about each feature of the language, specifies its syntax, provides examples of its use, and describes its semantics. (And it would alreay presume programming langauge knowledge.) I suppose the same could be done for the standard library as well. Both would be enormous undertakings, however. But there is also clearly a need for an introductory textbook that might (or might not) get to covering member-templates, the auto keyword, the modern compiler-ignored register keyword, or what exactly happens when a virtual function is also inline. This book is that introductory book. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 02:06, 15 September 2005 (UTC)

::Again it's your interpretation, as &quot;fork&quot; you have to go by the GFDL definition of it, since there is no reference to it all, forks == derivative works, fork can't be realy described by the GFDL since it is a software related term, fork is historical defined only on that field.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:10, 15 September 2005 (UTC) 
----
STL as part of the C++ Standard should not be moved to another book, stuff like BOOST or Win32 -&gt; MFC or even OOP could if a small intro (as I said above, and with that limitations) substitutes and gives indication to the new work location, even better is ignoring creating C++ related sub-books and aggregate all in the same namespace, and so keeping all information reachable and easy to port/access and referencing (this goes beyond the scope of the wikibooks location)...--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:15, 15 September 2005 (UTC)
:Good question. But again, I'd say start with the STL here, and if it gets too big move it to a different book --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 01:49, 15 September 2005 (UTC)

:There are plenty of details of the standard library that an introductory textbook should elide. It should be a non-goal to cover it all. (That would be the job for a reference, not an introductory tutorial; those who want both can read both books. Those who want just one will actually get it.) [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 02:06, 15 September 2005 (UTC)

::Were did you get the idea ''introductory textbook'', that was what C plus Plus was aiming to not C -/- -/- and I don't like the limitation as there is no need for it, there is no reason to. is there ? It's all in how it's displayed or organized...(multiple books around the same subject/topic/title have the same problem as forks they fragment the reader base and doing so the possible contributors, in paper since there is a cost factor and other physical  limitations, the problem doesn't exist even more because the work becomes static)--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:04, 15 September 2005 (UTC)
:::Wikibooks is primarily a textbook project. There is a clear need for introductory texts to C++. That's essentially what this book has aimed to do. The charter just makes explicit what was already intendend. A reference book would be a great complement to this book, though, so there's no problem with us planning them together. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 04:16, 15 September 2005 (UTC)
:::I guess the idea of an ''introductory textbook'' came from me since this is what I personally need. If we can somehow do both (introductory and advanced) that would be good. If not, we'll have to figure out how to do two different books and still use synergy. --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 05:05, 15 September 2005 (UTC)

----
''The book is not intended to be a complete reference to the C++ language. This book would be appropriate for a first course in programming or computer science''

As size is not a problem I don't think this limitation should be imposed, it relates also to prev. comments I have made on the same topic.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:17, 15 September 2005 (UTC) 
:I believe reference material should be in there, but ideally at the end. Same argument as above using this as a plattform to get started. --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 01:49, 15 September 2005 (UTC)

===About the page-structure===
I would suggest that everything that is a dot here (in the TOC) will be one page. Subitems here are shown for explanation of some topics, they should be subitems on that particular page. --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 00:28, 15 September 2005 (UTC)
----
Probably a limit by number of lines should be used to divide chapters into subchapters as they grow...--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:10, 15 September 2005 (UTC)
:as far as i understand (and i have no idea if i'm right on this) the navigation is very limited. And hierachical subpages are discouraged. However, big pages are bad. Here's an alternate suggestion: wikibooks gives me a warning if a page is bigger / close to 32k. Maybe that could be a limit? However, 32k is a lot of text. So, to sum it up: Even though i don't like a rule for splitting up subtopics, I do see that it makes sense technically, so as long as each section can have a good size (at least 10 pages printed) i can live with whatever we agree on. --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 01:49, 15 September 2005 (UTC)

:We can write more advanced navigation templates. Here's how it'd work: (1) The current modules at Programming:C_plus_plus/Foo would get renamed to Programming:C_plus_plus/Foo_content. (2) A new page, named Programming:C_plus_plus/Foo would be created. (3) That new page, which has the name of the original page, will just do a &lt;nowiki&gt;{{:Programming:C_plus_plus/Foo}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; to transclude it. It will also include this &lt;nowiki&gt;{{:Programming:C_plus_plus/Navigation}}&lt;/nowiki&gt; and the top and or bottom, which would be a navigation template listing all chapters by name or by number (or whatever). Finally, (4) the All Chapters view will transclude the _content pages instead of the pages that now have the navigation. It's all pretty easy to do, but only worth doing when the time is right for it. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 02:13, 15 September 2005 (UTC)
::Sounds complicated, but do-able if there is a clear how-to --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 02:17, 15 September 2005 (UTC)
:::I can do that heavy lifting when needed, and leave it up to you for the NavBar design itself. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 03:46, 15

# About a wikibook Development

Max do you think this is needed I think that a simple reference in the foreword would suffice (and that section would only be needed if the book is hosted on wikibooks) if needed a link to the discussion area could be included on the foreword.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:28, 23 September 2005 (UTC)

:In my mind I have an image of a printed version of the book that I can make my students get (for $20 instead of $100). A printed version would require at least some comments about this book being open, and that it can be found on wikibooks. So maybe this would be something that is only required in the all-on-one-page version? But then again, it can't hurt to have it in the other version too --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 16:36, 23 September 2005 (UTC)
----
humm, and extending a little more what is in the actual foreword (with links to the related sections) wouldn't suffice? Do we need a dedicated page to, in my POV do a redundant description of what a Wikibook is ?--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 21:04, 23 September 2005 (UTC)
:Not if we have the foreword as it is right now. Then what I mean by &quot;What is a wikibook&quot; is what the foreword is now. However. if we elaborate a little more on both (e.g. put more information into the foreword like: this is a beginners book, how the book is structured, etc.) then this is definitely a different context, and should imo belong on a different page. --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 23:33, 23 September 2005 (UTC)
:The other idea was that a page like &quot;What is a wikibook&quot; could be re-used across multiple projects for the print versions. --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 23:33, 23 September 2005 (UTC)
:If you think all this is nonsense, we can delete the &quot;what is a wikibook&quot; for now and re-add it later if we write an actual foreword --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 23:33, 23 September 2005 (UTC)
----
Yup I agree with your view but I don't think we have much more to add to what is in there already, we can include your idea and insert references to the wikibook general information and a reference to the site and to the book talk pages in a way we don't overburden it, but, in thinking about stating the charter or even the wording of it as [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] wrote, it's not the best thing we could do. That idea will limit future contributions stating a narrow evolution path, we can make a reference that if a sub-subject get's to big (we can debate how big it would have to be, and create a Convention) it would be used (my POV, depending on how huge it would be) not as another book (that will have the same problems as a fork) but as an addendum or even a different structure of the main book but on the same namespace (my POV, this will depend on the subject ex: CASE Tools or UML can and would have if developed it's own namespace, but for instance WIN32 or a GCC manual depending on the size can be used on the same namespace as the C++ book)--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:22, 24 September 2005 (UTC)
:I like the idea of reusing the same namespace for parts that get too big. The should then be linked from the main page, but omitted in the one-page version. Kinda like: &quot;Programming C Plus Plus, Volume 1: Introduction to C++. Programming C Plus Plus, Volume 2: Win32 Programming, etc. --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 16:37, 24 September 2005 (UTC)
----
That was the idea, but I think [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] doesn't like it... but we have some other stuff to do first so we shouldn't need to address it right now.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 00:15, 25 September 2005 (UTC)

===About the contents===
'''Makefiles''' should be on the compiler section.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:20, 15 September 2005 (UTC)
:Makefiles are not part of C++. Unfortunately, we need them. So we can mention them in the introduction (with the example build under unix maybe). They should be mentioned in the compiler section as well as a TOOL. And i believe the belong to the &quot;real world&quot;, especially for unix users. However, they should have about the same attention as other build systems (Visual Studio, Borland, Watcom, XCode, Eclipse CDT, your-favorite-ide-here) --[[User:Maxberger|Max]] 01:49, 15 September 2005 (UTC)

:I think all of the OS/Compiler-specific information should be put into an appendix. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 02:15, 15 September 2005 (UTC)

::I don't agree, the info that relates to specific implementations or OSs yes, but how can you talk about C++ without an introduction to how a compiler works and the preprossesor (defines codeguards headers even linkage to external libs etc...), even how to do basic interpretation of the debugging, traces, breakpoints this is needed information for learning, most of the time people ask about stuff that is probably already described on the error message the compiler gave, for a newbie to the language that is  a must...--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:53, 15 September 2005 (UTC)

:::Yes, how a compiler works, and what the praeprocessor does is Standard C++. However, how to build (with makefiles or IDE) and how to debug (IDE / GDB) is so different on different platforms / environments that they can be covered on a conpectual level (a debugger lets you go through the program line-by-line) but can not be explained with an example. This specific things should go either into an appendix (building and debugging on linux) or in a separate book (and referenced here).

==Notice of Merge==
As per Wikibook's [[Wikibooks:Forking policy|Forking policy]] the separate books '''Programming:C plus plus''' and '''Programming:C -/- -/-''' will be merged into a single book. The monolithic book versus separate chapters conflict shall be resolved by including an All Chapters page that is a transclusion of all of the sub-modules. The book '''Programming:C -/- -/-''' and its subpages will be deleted in two weeks (roughly around September 21, 2005). Upon request the material can be available (in some form) for a period longer than the two weeks.&lt;p&gt;Forking can harm Wikibooks in that it divides the community effort into producing a Wikibook, essentially lengthening the time it creates to finish a Wikibook and creating redundant information. This policy aims to encourage community cooperation, unify contributor effort, and reduce the amount of redundant material on Wikibooks.

{{TODO|'''Programming:C -/- -/-''' or '''Programming in C -/- -/-''' is marked for deletion due to the application of the [[Wikibooks:Forking policy]], deletion is marked for 22 September 2005, the adminstrative action was started by [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]], dispute of the action can be reached [[User talk:Mshonle|here]], [[User talk:Mshonle/Fork issue|here]] and [[User talk:Mshonle/Fork issue 2|here]].}}

::Max, you should contribute to the [[Programming:C plus plus]] book. This book is going to be deleted in 10 days. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 19:04, 11 September 2005 (UTC)

So let me know if i got this right: 

I should link to the multi-page version of this book, since this is the future. New stuff / Corrections should also go into the multi-page versions. If a new chapter is added, :_OnePage and :_Index need to be updated, but nothing else. 

The things currently in the :_OnePage need to go into different chapters, and :_OnePage and :_Index need to be updated.

Now the only question i have left is: Some pages have a colon (e.g. Programming_in_C -/- -/-:_Introduction) and some don't (Programming:C_-/-_-/-_Programming_Language). Which version is the way to go?

-- [[User:maxberger|Max]] 11 Sept 2005
:Hi Max. You should link to the [[Programming:C plus plus]] version. That book currently uses space separators for chapter name, although it should really be colons. What you use right now shouldn't be a big deal: so long as it's consistent with whatever style the links near it use, then when it's all changed and standardized it will become correct. [[User:Mshonle|MShonle]] 19:04, 11 September 2005 (UTC)
::Hi MShonle. Thank you for the feedback. However, my indented audience are students taking a beginners C++ programming course. From comparing the two books I found the C -/- -/- way easier to read and understand for beginners. So as longs as there are two book I prefer this one. -- [[User:maxberger|Max]] 11 Sept 2005
:::Well, I suppose that's the catch here. That is, the &quot;so long as their are two books&quot; part: this book will be deleted by the 21st. (It's a rather long and sorted story, but see the [[Wikibooks:Staff lounge]] for more details.) The most useful of this book's contents, consistent with the other version, should be merged with the existing book. You can merge the contents of the two into [[Programming:C plus plus]] if you'd like. But as a resource this book won't be up on Wikibooks so anything you work on here won't be posted, unless you (or someone else) adds it to [[Programming:C plus plus]].

* There is now a non adoption of a single standard on styles so the proposal is dead (will add this to the conventions and remove proposal as adopted (as a negative), I do think that in this ways it's makes the works of importing any other snips of code easier.

You are correct, I swear that I saw it, the edits times aren't that close, but could it have been a cross edit ?!? I do have been having huge problems with my ISP using &quot;forced&quot; cache proxy (or wiki not dealing with them properly)... sorry Ill correct my statement... What you did was not a reversion but due to your wording on the comment and the quick (and now confirmed as erroneous) check I did, I was lead on error, but even so the use of reversions does already have a warning from wikibooks, the proposal is valid in the sense it ports it to the conventions section...

So...

I propose reversions in accord to the use/warnings wikibooks places on them should only be done by people doing hard contribution (I call them major contributors) or by any other user in cases of vandalization if no loss of content occurs if so it should be edited out not reverted, if anyone has some problems with the content please use this discussion area or read what is written in this discussion area (the why and how should always be found here so others can see it...)

== Plagarism ?==

Someone has been filling significant amounts of the body of this text with plagarized material from &quot;How To Think Like A Computer Scientist: Learning with C++&quot; by Allen B. Downey. 

The two sentences that struck me as odd were: &quot;So far we have looked at the elements of a programming language---variables, expressions, and statements---in isolation, without talking about how to combine them.&quot; in the &quot;Composition (Operator Precedence)&quot; section and &quot;A natural way to represent a point in C++ is with two doubles.&quot; in the &quot;Structures&quot; section of the book. The former sentence is from  chapter 2, section 2.19, while the latter is from chapter 8, section 8.2 of the aforementioned book by Allen Downey. A cursory check of the surrounding text seems to have also been copied.

You have only found additional versions of the work Chuck is referencing.  The first is a translation of Mr. Downey's text, so I don't know what it says; but the second is in fact a GNUFDL'ed version of Mr. Downey's work.  However, there are several problems with its use.  First, Mr. Downey's work is GNU-FDL version 1.1, while we use version 1.2.; as the source text does not declare &quot;GFDL version 1.1 and all future versions&quot;, but only states version 1.1, it can not be used under our license. Secondly, just because a work is GFDL'ed doesn't give us the right to simply copy and paste portions of that work here.  The GFDL requires appropiate credit be given to the author of a work, and right now that has not happened.  I'm considering labeling this entire work a copyright violation, and listing it for deletion on those grounds. [[User:Gentgeen|Gentgeen]] 20:24, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC)

Ok found the original source...

How To Think Like A Computer Scientist
Learning with C++
by Allen B. Downey

referred as an open textbook and as no direct reference to a license is given it falls under the Public Domain it seems that many other sources may exist and many other works may have &quot;cross polarizations&quot; from it...

&quot; Allen B. Downey, professor of Computer Science at Wellesley College, originally wrote &quot;How to Think Like a Computer Scientist&quot;in Java, as a textbook for his computer science class. Over the summer of 1998, Professor Downey converted the Java version of &quot;How to Think Like a Computer Scientist&quot; into C++. Since then, the Java version has undergone several major changes, including the addition of Abstract Data Types such as Stacks, Queues, and Heaps. The C++ version of the open textbook however, did not receive these changes, that is...until now.&quot;

humm... and then the copy I have posted in wikibooks has GFDL 1.1 that states

&quot;Aggregation with Independent Works

A compilation of the Document or its derivatives with other separate and independent documents or works, in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, does not as a whole count as a Modified Version of the Document, provided no compilation copyright is claimed for the compilation. Such a compilation is called an ``aggregate, and this License does not apply to the other self-contained works thus compiled with the Document, on account of their being thus compiled, if they are not themselves derivative works of the Document.&quot;

Even worse, that book, article has/includes a license in it raw state (not filled in) so even if we can attest that it intended to use it, if it's not filled it would fall under published under the Public Domain, right ?

GNU-FDL version 1.1 and GNU-FDL version 1.2+ all have references that allow the use of &quot;snips&quot;

as for:
&quot;Secondly, just because a work is GFDL'ed doesn't give us the right to simply copy and paste portions of that work here.&quot;

Most of the the work here is on Wikipedia GFDL texts/articles so it will also suffer from that problem ? 

I'm not a lawier but that is my interpretation, as for the stated problem this is an open book you can add yourself the needed references to Allen B. Downey in an appropriate section, as you can see was already some actions had already been to rectify this, it's better than removing all of the content...--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 21:56, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC)
----
I have also checked that some other works on wikibooks have snips from other works on wikibooks (not only references from wikipedia) --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 22:09, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC)
----
The first version you said you couldn't read is in English (one topic seems that to be in German, enter any one of the topics and you will see...)

As for the Java references that not the problem as many of the content applies to any other programming language.

A clarification that is missing (and your comment made me check into) and other readers/users should be able to read (you should have put a link to it), is that even if a grave problem arises the work WILL NOT BE DELETED, the page will be blanked but the work accessible with the history function (moderators should have a template for that).

As far as I know no author has made a claim, not even wikipedians, a reader made a remark that was correct but was checked and does have some very good bases to fall under a GDFL or a compatible license.
 
I know moderators are busy people and all that, but I think you should get deeper on your role... or at least state that you are busy at the moment not let us hung with the threat of deletion as you did (on top of that, it seems that a simple action (just reference/credit) taken by yourself would solve part of the moderation problem you have), You also missed all the prev. points/questions on this page that lack moderation attention, this regrettable because it prevents or at least makes people think twice about contribution, [[user:Paddu|Paddu]] as a question waiting on [Wikibooks:Staff_lounge] since October, probably most of the problems I and C++/CPlusPlus users had could have been prevented, a similar topic was already on your own talk page waiting for some time.

As a first time wikibook user/contributor this hasn´t been an overall good experience for me, I thought the idea was to bring content and most people seem to spend the time raising problems and debating small editorial questions, one thing that I observed is that contributors don't tend to spend much time debating such mood points. As a programmer I tend to build on other peoples work not reinvent the wheel, I have based the structure of this book in some books I have and if seen useful and ready to use, with compatible licenses, I will be prone to use them in place of doing all from basic.

I'm not saying that you are doing a bad job but at this time it seems incomplete, can you refer an email (in accord with the wikibooks protocol) so to solve this problem ASAP, I will send all works I have found and in future, any other anyone else intends in using so to expedite the license checks, txs. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 05:58, 23 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== TODOs ==

I saw that [[user:James Dennett|James Dennett]] started to use TODOs notes on the book, I was using commented out notes but the idea is probably more pleasant to readers that can see that a section is in evolution and to contributors than can add to it (no one likes to see TODOs :) ) I've made them a bit more visible and removed  &lt;nowiki&gt;'''&lt;/nowiki&gt; messes up the text justification on long phrases, I have added

&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 10px; padding: 5px; border: 1px solid red;&quot;&gt; 
;(TODO: &lt;desc.&gt;)
&lt;/div&gt;

done with (You can copy-paste):

&lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;margin: 10px; padding: 5px; border: 1px solid red;&quot;&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;;(TODO: &lt;desc.&gt;)&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;

I have some ideas to the NOTEs and WARNINGs, I'll wait first for anyone to comment on the TODOs... if no one oppose I'll move it to the conventions and add the code to edit section, a wikibooks:template would be nice but I had not the time to see about them properly yet, the TOC should also be fixed, a smaller one (it seems that it can't be &quot;hidden&quot; by default but that will only be useful if we can use the hide/show javascript on it... --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 05:18, 22 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== NOTE ==

Ive started to implement a new style for NOTEs

{| WIDTH=&quot;95%&quot;
| style=&quot;background-color: #f2fff2; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top|
NOTE:&lt;br&gt;
|}

&lt;nowiki&gt;{| WIDTH=&quot;95%&quot;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;| style=&quot;background-color: #f2fff2; border: solid 1px #bfffbf; padding: 1em;&quot; valign=top|&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;NOTE:&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt;
&lt;nowiki&gt;|}&lt;/nowiki&gt;

I had it centred but now I can't remember how I did it maybe &lt;nowiki&gt;&lt;div align=center&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;br&gt; n1 ? --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:47, 27 Nov 2004 (UTC)

== Transclusion editing ==

I seems to have a problem with editing content that are included by transclusion. For example the external section have be edited and showing up if one look at the external section on its own. The old one still show up tho on the main page. Any idea / particular reason why ? -- [[User:KTC|KTC]] 08:11, 28 Jan 2004 (UTC)
----
Forceful worked around it today by deleting and then reinserting the transclusion. Somehow, doesn't feel like that being a long term solution tho... -- [[User:KTC|KTC]] 21:58, 28 Jan 2004 (UTC)
----
Sorry KTC, I did not get a notice for this post, txs for the help, I don't particularly master Wiki (or like it) but it is a good tool for this purpose, I've noticed that with transclusions the updates takes a little more time to become active, it's probably some kind of caching that the server/software does to speed stuff up, I've not taken the time to look into it but the updates do become active after a while...

As you did (or not) noticed this &quot;work&quot; is a fork after having had some problems with the last &quot;active&quot; contributor, one of the points under discussion was that the work should be split into chapter/sections, so and thinking on future contributors that have slow connections or software limitations on the edits, I've started splitting some more stable/static parts of the &quot;work&quot; using transclusions that in a future stage could be used to give a more modular look to the project, as my intention is to have at least one global look on the structure (so to facilitate the modification of the logical structure/display of content), a monolithic format is ideal for this as for grabbing a copy of the work, doing a print out or conversion to PDF etc...

Don't panic... use the same steps I do, as you are editing stuff turn on (Watch this page) and take a look on Recent Changes (wikibooks main) and that will keep you up to date with any edits...

As for the license I didn't intend to protect the image it should fall on the Public Domain, I did it for fun and after looking at another book that had a cover image.

Hum I didn't copy or examine any other image to create this one, I used some tools that reduced any need to do the handwork (so similar creations may exist)
but I find doubtful that they can have a similar look...

Prehaps you should read the [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]]. The current name is running under [[WB:NP#Historical_conventions]]. So if at all a new name should be somthing like:

* [[Cpp Programming]]
* [[How-To programm in C plus plus]]
* [[Programming in C -/- -/-]]

Ohterwise you end up being not a book but only chapter in a very very big [[Programming]] book. 

--[[User:Krischik|Krischik]] 17:57, 6 September 2005 (UTC)

PS: with a good browser/internet connection you can rename about a 100 pages per hour.
----
Grummbll, it's hard to fallow all the policies as they get changed / created all the time (even if you really don't care about it, my main problem is content not reformatting the books every 4 months because some new order of the bookshelf was adopted, that is real annoying, it's the 3rd time I have to pass that ordeal first in C Plus Plus) I will comply with:

 '''The hyphen convention''': &lt;tt&gt;[[Bookname - Chaptername]]&lt;/tt&gt;

if no one objects, I'll do the renames as I go along editing stuff (if n1 helps that would be great, but check the dependencies and remember that templates  seem to notice page name changes), as for the name I do like the -/- -/- it's the closes to ++ one can get... the problem is with wikimedia not the name in itself, as for CPP (I really don't like it, not even as a file extension for C++ source files) and C Plus Plus only sounds better because it's the name adopted by Wikipedia... so the best option available seems Programming in C -/- -/-

Since I read the page I've noticed '''The colon convention''' I'll use that on the Index also...

Hello there DavidCary...

In the rule book of wikibooks it says that talk pages should be kept to a minimum and due probably to fact that the creation of the C# book was done by a contributor to this book (on C++) and the generic debated topics would be the same or similar.
Is there a reason for a stand alone page for it ?
(My opinion is that would probably duplicate discussions and fragment the contributors base)...

Looks great, I think you can do it with no need for a vote on the subject, just add the link to the new display/order on the top next to the single page version of the book or make a selection/entry point menu to the dif. ways a user can access the content and substitute the &quot;cover&quot; page with it. As of using a single finished &quot;look&quot; as the main entry to the book that is another thing (and will probably be voted on as soon as the book &quot;seems&quot; complete, still, we have to remember that this is an ever evolving framework), every reader is a potential contributor to the book, &quot;hiding&quot; the structure/modules and working pages may do more harm than good, the final objective is to have the GFDL content, the visualization or order can have many implementations as we make the content more modular.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 03:15, 4 March 2006 (UTC)

Why not using a redirect from that page to an addendum to the C++ book and use the same name place of the actual book for all the content and have a cross reference to each part on the book to the exercises (the solution should not be on the same page as the proposed task)

No problem, I also do not have English as my main language, I've started working on this book in English so to get as many contributors/readers as possible (there are other versions of the book, see bottom of main page) the content should be the top most priority, translations can be done after the book gets to a comfortable stage.&lt;br&gt;

Merging into the book should be initiate ASAP, provide a stand alone TOC to the exercises, extract the completed examples and add them to the proper subject matter, also indexing them as examples and complete all examples extraction from C++ Programming and provide a example TOC (not exercises but only with the example source codes)--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 22:11, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

What do you have in mind for organizing it into the book? I think for now, it should all be its own chapter on the form &quot;C++ Programming/Exercises/exercise-name&quot; and maybe &quot;C++ Programming/Exercises/exercise-name/solution&quot; if theres solutions to the exercises. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 22:48, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

----

Yup, but using transclusion and posting the examples in the proper chapter under exercises (see variables/exercise) this will make it easier in the future to check all the code and add boxes.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:13, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

----

Transclusion to where? I'm against transinclude the exercises into the chapters, they should be there own seperate part only placed in whole book view after the chapter, if you want to have it orginized that way. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 23:33, 20 October 2006 (UTC)

----

Ok just to go ahead with this, do you agree to move the book to a Chapter Exercises at the end of the actual book, humm, maybe after the STL and before Beyond the Standard ?, Or a Volume if you are adamant in preserving it's structure after the Appendixes (will have to rename the first Volume I, (preserve the visualization and add it to the Volume Title and next to the whole book view) don't add to the whole book view and add a note on that. We can then decide how to organize it, this will preserve it's structure as is and enable us to link to sections of it) I think at the end of each chapter adding an exercise list (related to it) would be productive.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 05:32, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

----

I agree with moving the book into its own chapter if there are no objections from anyone else. I suggest using the mergeto/mergefrom tags both on the main page and the main page here, to see if anyone has any objections with its merger. If noboby objections, then where its located in the Table of Contents or full/print book view doesn't really matter, since we're both presenting different views of the book. Preserving its structure may be a good idea for now. For example if/when moving the main page of the book move it to &quot;C++ Programming/Exercises&quot; and move its chapters to &quot;C++ Programming/Exercises/chapter&quot;. My only objections is transcluding to existing chapters of the C++ Programming book, since that would effect multiple views, but changing Table of Contents and full/print views isn't as big a deal, since different perspectives on this can still be maintained. So for now if you wish to get it done, do the mergeto/mergefrom tags, give it a week or so, then move into here if nobody objects, preserving its structure and make changes to the Table of Contents and full/print view as you wish.

BTW I still think the TOC thats the main page seen when going to this book needs to be moved to something like &quot;C++ Programming/TOC1&quot; and instead present a different main/front page that shows the current cover image, chapters needing work and list of different views along with a link to the print/full page view and if you wish an edit link for the print/full page view. I've looked at how another book makes use of the front page that looks promising for ideas of what might work for this one, so I think I may do some more editing of my test page. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 13:02, 30 October 2006 (UTC)

== Book Reorganization ==

There seems to be a few remaining issues with some chapters overlaping one another that I think should be addressed.

*There are multiple chapters that try to do an overview of basic programming related concepts, that I think should be merged into one chapter, after some editing to cut down on details. I think instead of giving too much details the chapter could also act as a guide to where more details on the relevant information can be found in the book. The chapters are:

# Introduction
# What is a programming language?
# What is a program?
# Understanding the Source Files
# Programming Paradigms

The new chapter could cover the history of programming briefly leading up to the creation of C++, somewhat expanding on whats already in Introduction and possibly explaining the rest of the concepts in terms of when they were introduced. This chapter could then end with a summary of basic C++ programming concepts that are explained fully in later chapters along with what those chapter names are as wiki links. This chapter would be for readers not familar with C++'s history or with the most basic programming terms and concepts.

*There is some overlap between what are variables and what are operators that needs to be addressed as well as two chapters on operators that should be merged. There is also the statements chapter which I think should be part of whatever chapter describes these concepts. This chapter would also describe chaining operators together and how C++ evaluates expressions. My idea is to have one chapter that talks about statements, expressions and operators. This would probably require rewriting the chapter once merged together. Arrays should be be part of the chapter on variables because arrays are out of place anywhere else. References and pointers I think should either be in the chapter on variables or described in a chapter on memory management. The varies operators used for arrays, references, pointers I think should only be described in terms of their binding order in whatever chapter describes expressions, states and operators instead of fully explaining what arrays, references and pointers are as seems to be the purpose now.

*There should be a chapter on memory management which discusses using new, new[], delete and delete[] operators and describes basic concepts of how memory works. Since references and pointers are typically related to memory this may also be a better place to discuss them in detail rather then a chapter on operators where I think they are a bit out of place. This would also involve merging the contents of &quot;Internal storage of data types&quot; into this new chapter.

*The two chapters &quot;Abstract classes&quot; and &quot;Pure abstract classes (abstract types)&quot; I think should be merged into the &quot;Polymorphism&quot; chapter, because abstraction is one of the key concepts of polymorphism and shouldn't be separated into different chapters.

I would be willing to try to do all this if there's no objections. I think all these changes would improve this book a lot and then I should be able to concentrate more on correcting errors and expanding on concepts. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 20:01, 7 November 2006 (UTC)

If you intention is extend The Introduction chapter, clean it up and move parts to a sub chapter that would cover the history of programming languages and C++ in particular, that I think is a fantastic idea.

As for moving the *The two chapters &quot;Abstract classes&quot; and &quot;Pure abstract classes (abstract types)&quot;, this are C++ topic that must be easy to find and read for a users and Polymorphism is a concept that can be learned or skipped as it is independent of the only C++ content and should be introduced in Programming Paradigms under the OOP information.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 01:08, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

----

No my intention is to combine &quot;Introduction&quot;, &quot;What is a programming language?&quot;, &quot;What is a program?&quot;, &quot;Understanding the Source Files&quot; and &quot;Programming Paradigms&quot; into one chapter and clean it up. Whether its split up into sub chapters or not depends on the results after the merging, cleanup and extending happens.

As for the &quot;Abstract class&quot; and &quot;Pure abstract classes (abstract types)&quot; bits being combined with Polymorphism being hard to find. Part of the reorginization plan with the above combined chapter is to describe what each chapter covers in more detail then whats provided in the table of contents description, as is sometimes found in the first chapter of a book. This should make it very easy to find what a reader is looking for.

To give an example:

;[[C++ Programming/Variables|Variables]] : Variables store or hold information that a program needs to know about. This chapter covers the concept of variables in more detail along with the various kinds of variables you need to know about.

...but the information for the chapters would be a bit longer than that.

This first chapter would become a quick walkthrough of important Historical events that lead to the creation of the C++ Programming language and then what new concepts C++ introduced. Along with explaining what a programming language is and what events lead to the concepts of divided a program up into logical units such as source files. This would also effectively cover different programming paradigms from there historical 	significance. Followed lastly by what this book covers and how the chapters are layed out. Whether this ends up being a single page or spreed out over multiple pages depends on how big it becomes. All I got to say is we should start with just one page and go from there. If it needs to be split up over multiple pages so be it, but transclude all the subchapters into a chapter page for those readers who wish to read it all at once. 
This was my motivation for trasncluding those chapters into one, to begin this process. Really it needed to be copy and pasted into one chapter rather then trasncluded, but I was trying to start off slow for you. I really rather see the first chapter be an overview chapter and leave later chapters as &quot;closer look&quot; at what was just covered in the first chapter, then readers who need or want to know can read the first chapter and those readers who want to dive right in can skip ahead without losing out on any important information. I believe this is what you want too, even if we don't exactly agree with how much or how little information should be given. If you can agree that certain stuff like how C++ implements data abstraction is held off until later chapters like Polymorphism with this reorganization then all the better. The first chapter becomes an overview what it is all about, and the later chapters the why and how. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 02:41, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

I don't see a need in reducing the books parts (unless it has some duplicated content) as for merging &quot;Introduction&quot;, &quot;What is a programming language?&quot;, &quot;What is a program?&quot;, &quot;Understanding the Source Files&quot; and &quot;Programming Paradigms&quot; into one chapter (if you mean more that under the single section), I don't like the idea as the subjects are independent of each other and &quot;Understanding the Source Files&quot; is the only one that deals directly with C++ concepts, if the intention was to set them on the same section/chapter what would you name it? (ultra-basic ?), the only problem with that is &quot;Understanding the Source Files&quot; doesn't belong on the same section. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:15, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

----

Well I think those parts need to be cleaned up a lot and tied together as one chapter. My idea to try to take a slightly different approach to the topics covered in those pages so that it is easier to follow and understand and those who know already something about it can skip ahead. Source files are not concepts strictly new to C++. My intention is to set them up as part of the same chapter and the name could be Introduction. To give a general idea of what could happen if it gets long enough after merging and cleaning it all up is:

&lt;pre&gt;
Introduction (actual chapter name, transclusion of all subpages)
 Introduction/History (includes history of OOP, procederal programming, structural programming, early history of C++, etc.)
 Introduction/About (description of what this book covers, description of what each chapter covers)
&lt;/pre&gt;

It would be basically like what you did to Inheritance and Polymorphism in a way in which you made them subpages of the Class chapter. The only difference is they would be one page for now while I cleaned it all up, possibly make major changes to it and expand on it. Its a bit hard to explain it without doing it. Think of a &quot;dead tree&quot; book, books have chapters in them that try to be self contained, generally with the exception of the first chapter which covers what the book is about, who is meant to read the book, possibly a bit of a history of the topic and sometimes a overview of what the chapters contain so readers can skip to the chapter they are most interested in. If you look even at other well-written wikibooks that have a big contribution base they follow the same guiding principals as a &quot;dead tree&quot; book.

These last steps that I proposed are what I think are the finishing touches of my &quot;this doesn't flow very well, needs more flow to it&quot; theme that I've been raving about. I think its truly needed to turn a major tide of the book from &quot;difficult to read&quot; to &quot;easy to read&quot; and I think everything else I've worked on so far has been working up to this. I think your decision to hold off on discussion of my other suggested until this is completed is a good idea. I think this major change is a must. Oh and I'm not trying to reduce the contents with this move, just trying to get it in better shape, in the contrary I think it will actually end up increasing the size of the contents of this book.

To give you some more example here's a generalized approach I have in mind:

In &lt;year&gt;, &lt;creator&gt; introduced &lt;language&gt; which contained variables that allowed programmers to store information temporarily in memory, the idea is said to have been borrowed from algebra and in the early days of programming only single letters were allowed to be used to present numbers.

In &lt;year&gt;, &lt;creator&gt; introduced functions with his/her creation of the &lt;language&gt; programming language...This was the beginning of functional programming.

Maybe that will give you an idea of how I plan to combine it all together into one chapter. Right now sure it may not make since, but thats part of the reorganization and clean up process I have in mind. :) --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 18:36, 13 November 2006 (UTC)
----

Well in the part of extending the introduction and adding more history we are in agreement, please don't remove the Wikipedia links, if possible link to this book if a section exists (or if it should exist, leave the link to Wikipedia), if it shouldn't and another Wikibook has the information use Wikibooks as the reference. Ok this will get you go ahead with the work.

As for the section name moving all under an introduction chapter seems acceptable but remember that as I said &quot;Understanding the Source Files&quot; is not generic like the others it introduces the idea of C++ file extension (with limitation on the OS) and naming conventions that are not and should not be part of the style conventions. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:49, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

----

Well perhaps then the Understanding Source files page needs to be split up into seperate parts, with the parts that deal with understanding source files being within this new introductory chapter and the bits about file extensions and naming conventions in some sort of guide to getting and setting up a compiler. Of course I think such a chapter would need to be general enough and not cover how to do every little thing in the compiler. Just how &quot;do I compile this thing?&quot; basically. --[[User:Darklama|darklama]] 19:10, 13 November 2006 (UTC)

----

Ok well talk about that when you get to that part (Understanding Source files), a introductions to the OS would be welcomed and the file extension/names part could be used there. Humm the Hello World example has a little introduction on how to use GCC a more complete one is still missing. A introduction to Make tools is also missing.

As for what a compiler is and how to use (in general) should be kept separated, but all the information would be welcomed. You probably can't write a &quot;how do I compile this thing?&quot; with general orientations in several compilers without needing to introduce more evolved concepts, it can only be done in simple and basic examples (like it is done in the hello world)--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:07, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

----

Actually the simple and basic examples like is used in the hello world page is what I had in mind for any chapter on getting a program compiled and any naming conventions with maybe a note template added to suggest readers read their compiler documentations and maybe also refer readers to the weblinks page in the book for any online documentation that may be available or tutorials or other wikibooks that might be helpful. Something like a 1 to 5 minute guide to compiling with g++, visual studios, etc. is all I had in mind. I don't think we need to cover Make tools, I believe there is already a wikibook that covers Make tools and other common tools found in a Linux/BSD environment. Anyways I guess I can just get started and whatever isn't needed any more from Understanding Source files can be deleted and we can deal with whatever is left of it then. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 17:48, 20 November 2006 (UTC)

== Terminology ==

[[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] makes a good point (I must confess that I have the updated C++ Standard but use it only for consultation) I didn't read it from cover to cover, but his point in the nomenclature used should be followed...

I will start changing:
*methods to member functions
*functions arguments to function parameters

And will try to find a way of introducing this concepts at the beginning since I agree that &quot;Sticking to the terminology used by the C++ standard, where possible, ensures consistency and helps people to adapt to C++ instead of being confused by more general Computer Science terminology or terms from other languages.&quot; --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 21:11, 9 December 2006 (UTC)

----

I've changes all references to methods to member functions, txs to [[User:Darklama|Darklama]] for spotting some mistakes, another point that should be checked is the distinction of  parameters (aka formal arguments) vs arguments that [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] pointed out.--[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:49, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

----

I've done one better and changed ''virtual member function'' to ''virtual function'' as its what the standard uses. I agree we should use the proper C++ standard terminologies. So I think its safe to call this a required style in this book. &quot;Use standard C++ terminology when available&quot;. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 03:43, 10 December 2006 (UTC)

== Scope, Standards and Sequence ==

It seems clear that we want to mostly focus on standard C++, currently meaning C++ as specified in ISO/IEC 14882:2003.  However, as I come to write some more material on memory management, it's very tempting to include some material on shared_ptr, either as boost::shared_ptr, as std::tr1::shared_ptr (from TR1), or as std::shared_ptr (as is likely to be in C++0x).  If we choose to cover material that's not in the 2003 standard, we should at the very least be careful to make it clear that it is not yet standard.  The bigger question is: to what extent, if any, should we cover TR1 or C++0x material?  An argument could be made for having separate chapters for each of TR1 and C++0x, and then referring to them from other chapters as seems helpful, but I'm not sure that's the best approach.  Ideas/opinions? -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 05:45, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

From previous discussions and from becoming more familar with attitudes on Wikibooks, I'm of the opinion that material that might be in a future standard of C++ shouldn't be covered until they become standard. There is probably very little way to cite references that something is going to be in the next standard, not to mention could be qualified as orginal research. We got a chapter on Boost however, so I think boost:shared_ptr would be best served by being covered in that chapter.

I'm of the opinion also that parts of the C++ standard that deals with the library should be covered in its own chapter and for the most part that seems to be the way its been going, as we have a chapter on String and a chapter on Streams. The memory chapter I think should deal with using new, new[], delete and delete[] since they are considered operators rather then part of the standard library. I also think it might make sense to have [[C++ Programming/Data Type Storage]] part of that chapter and to cover references and pointers there as well.

Ok one last point to make, is I think that each chapter should try not to refer to other chapters too much. As you probably can tell there are two different table of contents and print versions available. This reflects differences in view in what order different concepts should be learned. So each chapter should probably not make any assumptions about whats already been covered or not, in order to try to remain neutral in favoring one view over another. It also has the advantage of making no assumption that on what readers have or haven't read yet.

To summarize my opinion:
* Future Standards shouldn't be covered until they are accepted as current standards.
* Standard C++ should be covered separately from the standard C++ library.
* Each chapter should more or less stand alone and not assume other chapters have been read first.

--&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 21:08, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

That position on standards is reasonable (material on C++'s TR1, which has been published, might usefully be covered in a separate book).

As for having a section on memory management that doesn't document that RAII is the canonical C++ approach, with references to ready-made memory management classes, I'd be opposed to it.  I do agree that covering the lower-level facilities should be done, but too many sources cover them without noting the better tools that exist for most uses.  This does get into issues about neutrality, but a book on programming should try to mention best practices, which is non-neutral.

Incidentally, new/delete etc. are interesting in that they are part of the intersection of language and library: they are language features that rely on library features, and can be affected by user-defined replacements for operator new etc.  It's not entirely possible to cover language and library separately -- nor, in my opinion, is it desirable.  Separation should be based on subjects according to what they achieve, not implementation details.

It might be worth having a hierarchy: have a Memory Management chapter with an overview, a section on manual memory management, and a section on RAII.  I'd have to think about a good way to organize that.  Then again, that's pretty much the angle I was coming from already, and you seem uncomfortable at covering both manual memory management and automation of memory management in the same chapter.

-- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 00:31, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

You're somewhat correct. It's not so much uncomfortable with the idea of having manual and automation of memory management in the same chapter, as I do with the POV that automation of memory management is the way to go. I think the chapter's main focus should be on how a programmer can allocate and deallocate memory and gives tips on how to make it easier to do so, through the use of class constructors and destructions to minimize the need to keep track of it oneself and near the end possibly mention things like garbage collection, using tools that help to debug memory leaks, and using automated tools.

I agree there is no real way to separate memory management as provided by the language itself and provided through the standard library. I don't have much of an issue with combining that information in some chapter since it makes sense. Referring to memory management in other chapters is probably not a good idea though and that was mainly what I was referring to. That and suggesting discussing the boost memory management in that chapter, since it already has a chapter and isn't really part of the standard.

I see this book as being divided into three parts:
* the first part teaches how to use C++ as defined by the current standard.
* the second part teaches about the use of the C++ library as defined by the current standard.
* the third part descriptions any non standard extentions and any additional libraries that might be useful.

To sort of tie the first and second parts together I think the memory management chapter falls as the dividing point, since its a little bit of both. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:55, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

: Interesting; I think your last point exposes the core issue here.  C++ can be taught bottom-up (in which case you'd want to cover the &quot;language&quot; aspects before the &quot;library&quot; aspects) or top-down (in which case you'd introduce some of the key pieces of the standard library from the very beginning).  Originally pretty much all C++ texts were bottom-up, and that has caused many problems.  More recently the best C++ texts have been top-down, and that's an approach I'd prefer if we can find a way to make it work.  Is it fair to say that your preference is for what I'm calling a bottom-up approach?  (Would you have a better term for it?) -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 04:46, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

:: This isn't really my approach, rather how it already was before I started contributing. I don't really have much preference on it, but I do agree the approach this book uses does seem to not work too well. The only preference I really have is based on my own preferences in programming books which are ones that can be used both for reading from cover to cover to learn from and can be used later on as a quick reference. This usually means that each chapter is relatively independent of the others, and cases where it is not, it gives an exact reference to the page and section title to make locating the information a breeze and it contains appendexes in the back, which in the example of C++, has all the keywords, library functions, classes, etc that are available to a C++ programmer. I also believe in teaching good habits like not assuming just because X works in compiler Z that its going to work everywhere if its not standard, by not discussing non-standard things until later on the book when everything that is standard has already been covered. Using this method I believe removes clutter from books, since it can focus on just one core concept at a time.

:: So if your willing to help take this book into a completely different direction and have a lot of time on your hands to do so, then I'm all for it. The reason I say if you got the time, is I hate to see it only get half done, it would be better to try to make the current approach work if you don't have time to invest in making some other approach work. In some ways my attempts to change the first chapter may reflect inversing the book from a bottom-up approach to a top-down approach, so we may not be as far off in our thinking. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 05:34, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

:: Another way may be to take it one step at a time, working from the first chapter then moving onto the second chapter, etc. That way may allow for slow adjustments over a longer period of time without the issue of looking inconsistent. I've been working on trying to provide more consistency to the book without trying to change its approach too much, since it doesn't require as much time investment to do so as changing its approach would require. That is really my only concern with changing it from bottom-up to top-down, causing inconsistencies that in the time may make it hard to use for reading. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 15:38, 13 December 2006 (UTC)

== Hmmmm (comments from a reader v. 1.1) ==

Well, while the new front page looks nice, there's no &quot;introduction&quot;. Maybe someone could answer a few questions for me:

*What is C++? What does it do? What is it used for? Why would you use C++ rather than another language?
*Where do I start? What's a compiler? And how do I see if the things I've compiled work?

Them's my first questions :). --[[User:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;'''SB_Johnny'''&lt;/font&gt;]] | &lt;sup&gt;[[User talk:SBJohnny|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:27, 12 December 2006 (UTC)

: There are plans for some kind of talk of some of this, but I think you've done a good job of capturing concretely some of what's needed.

:::::I'm answering here for now, as I'm not sure where this would fit into the book content (or even if it should be part of a different book).  For most platforms, for a &lt;em&gt;compiler&lt;/em&gt;, one of the GCC ports (http://gcc.gnu.org/) is a decent choice, and can be obtained at no cost except time.  Many Open Source platforms include a recent gcc version.  Version 4.0 or later gives fairly good conformance to the C++ standard.  Various IDEs are available to support GCC.  For Windows, Microsoft Visual Studio Express is currently available free of charge with a C++ compiler that can be used from the command line or from the supplied IDE.  Earlier versions of Visual C++ are rather buggier than I would like to recommend for learning C++.  For most platforms Comeau's C++ compiler (http://www.comeaucomputing.com/) is about the best in terms of standards conformance and gives excellent warning/error messages, which can save a pile of time; it costs $50, but does rely on your system already having a working C compiler.

== Request for Feedback, Preprocessing Updates ==

I've recently done significant refactoring and writing of additional material on the [[C++ Programming/Preprocessor]] section of this book, partly in response to a TODO note left by an anonymous contributor.  Feedback is welcomed. -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 19:43, 1 March 2007 (UTC)

== TOC1, TOC2, Editors TOC ==
Can anyone explain in 1000 words or less why there are three different main navigation pages for this book? In what way do readers or contributors benefit? --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 21:13, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

: TOC1 and TOC2 were the result of differences in opinion, on how the chapters should be organized for reading, in which the only compromise that could be reached was to allow more than one way to exist, where readers could pick. Editors TOC was the result of bold action to present a cover page for readers and writers to pick which one to use, along with things that need work or people would like to see added, and links for print versions of all the chapters in the two currently presented reading orders, until it was moved yesterday to Editors TOC.
: This book has a history of having different navigation methods. In the past there existed navigation involving a table of content sidebar with the contents to the left or right of it and one involving table of contents top bar with the contents underneath it. Which eventually was deleted due to nobody maintaining it and agreement to delete it. The only benefits I can see is choice and reuse without actually much duplication. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 22:20, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

:: The statement above is partially correct, TOC1 was the original structure &quot;I&quot; and in that I must be clear that without particular objection, only on some content that Paddu objected and that lead to the so called &quot;fork&quot;. (I say this for historical reference and because it is true).&lt;br&gt;
::Most references inside the various chapters/pages are structured or I actively worked to and intended them to be so, to provide some structure and a logic sequence to the text (I admit that there can be other preferences), the 3 navigation schemes that existed came also from the book merge, I didn't object to their creation and use on the book but they didn't perform any order change to the pages/chapters and were abandoned (one of the conditions I asked to the implementor was that I had not to maintain them, as with TOC2). They were removed as a request for Darklama and without opposition by me.&lt;br&gt;
::I don't object to any navigation scheme that can bypassed to provide a monolithic view (I and several users seem to also like to be able to see the book on that way, for posts I saw here and there, It is a book convention to have that setup), the Editor's TOC (I named it so) as it didn't provide a global view of the book and was mostly useful (and is a great idea) to editors but broke the default navigation scheme provided by the use of the page name convention (&quot;/&quot;) and its substitution was indeed contested by me actively, in particular to the removal of the link to the authors page that I see as a necessity on the book cover/title page.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 22:43, 25 March 2007 (UTC)
:::Okay, so the cover page should contain a link to the author's page, I agree with that. What else? Obviously what is an appropriate index is contested, but there should be at least some general index of content on the front page to serve readers. Speaking about books generally and not this book in particular, it seems to me that the front page should be directed at readers and perhaps a secondary portal page could be created for authors because everyone first experiences the book as a reader. Or am I way off base here? --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 23:44, 25 March 2007 (UTC)
::::That was my intention, I don't even object to a change on the structure (but I would like to be involved and defend my point and in this case &quot;my own work&quot;, I would not attempt to intrude in a similar discussion on another book, I would at most comment as a reader) a structure is the core of a work, all that is added is created above it, I don't object in having several structures (since wikis are virtual spaces and that makes it possible), but if the scope is to change then we must indeed consider a solution that can even result in a fork (that is still an open discussion), but I don't think this is the case here.
::::I think this is the result of Darklama being to much bold on the changes without listening to my objection, there were indeed action that have gone against some conventions of the book and resulted in deletion of pages, content and a corruption on the history logs in particular to the page [[C++ Programming/Programming Basics]] that is a result of merging 3 other pages that were deleted.( this was verified by other Administrator like Whiteknigh and there is still a comment on the last posts of this thread [[User_talk:Robert_Horning#Sorry_for_all_that_mess]]).   --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:55, 25 March 2007 (UTC)

:::: Different books do different things: Some use the front page for just a cover image with a link to the table of contents. [[Political Economy]], [[Social and Cultural Foundations of American Education]], [[Non-nerds Guide to Computers]], [[FontLab]], etc. Which is probably what we need, with a link to all three &quot;table of contents&quot;. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:06, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

:::::# So if we created a cover page with a cover graphic, links to the two alternate TOC's, a link to the editors (which is probably better named &quot;contributors&quot;) portal, a link authors page and the charter would everyone be happy with that?

The terminology TOC 1 and TOC 2 seems a little unfriendly to the causal surfer. It would be better if it actually described what the surfer would find if they followed the link. 
:::::# Can we try not to bring up old arguments and instead find commonality moving forward?

That is not so easy (and that is why it wasn't done in the first place besides changes to the content), it will continue to break the navigation scheme used by the page names the root must always be a index of all the content.&lt;br&gt;It is possible to add a different root but not a bifurcation Go A or Go B.&lt;br&gt;
BOOKCOVER &lt;-&gt; BOOKTOC &lt;-&gt; BOOKCHAPTER &lt;-&gt; BOOKPAGE/SECTION  (how can there be a path selection there ?)&lt;br&gt;
As for the names I don't have a clue, TOC stands for table of content or index as Darklamas was next, probably calling TOC2  Alternative Index is a good definition but the problems don't end there, who will maintain 3+ TOCs, and if anyone offered to create yet another or several? And who will check for divergences and collisions on the content (references to pages or chapter names, content out of order because in a TOC subject A goes before B and in the other A is after B etc... and this only in 2 distinct structures)&lt;br&gt;
Xixtas if I understand what you are stating, is that history has no relevance, and if it's so, I strongly disagree with that assessment. Have you created or contributed heavily to any book on Wikibooks, please state the name, I have a urge to create a new TOC there, or just start reorganizing the hell out of it (and I can probably find 1001 ways to justify the changes) :), lol see the logic? lol it would be very, very, funny if anyone attempted that for instance on the Ada book.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 05:10, 26 March 2007 (UTC)
: I have contributed to many books on Wikibooks. You can check my edit logs to find out which ones. 
: I'm sure you can think of better solutions than I to all those concerns if you try in good faith. These do not seem like insurmountable problems to me. You seem to be asserting a right of editorial control here. 
: Perhaps you would like to make an alternate proposal taking into account the concerns of other contributors? --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:37, 26 March 2007 (UTC)
::I was giving you an example, not proposing to really change a book to prove the point. The point is that you think it is fine if a  new contributor to change the structure of books without seeking consensus with the people working on it.
::I said it isn't easy and I don't even see solution to some of the problems, and it would involve lots of work to maintain, I was not discarding a solution by compromise as I said I have no problem with different structures.
::I really can't think on solve all solution. Darklama is the creator of the multiple  structure, he has gone from a proposal to a partial implementation ignoring objections, he is the one that has to find and propose solutions.(a discussion of this same points is on the book proposals, I have done what I could and attempted to explain the problems with it)  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 15:32, 26 March 2007 (UTC)
::: ''&quot;...you think it is fine if a  new contributor to change the structure of books without seeking consensus...&quot;'' I do not recall saying this. Please do not put words in my mouth that I did not say. Besides, what I do or do not think is immaterial. I'm just trying to help the contributors to this book work through what seems like a serious and dysfunctional disagreement. 
::: Perhaps you can explain to me why you believe that ''&quot;it will continue to break the navigation scheme used by the page names the root must always be a index of all the content.&quot;'' In what specific way would the navigation scheme be broken if the TOC was moved to a subpage like Book Name/Table of Contents? I do not understand.  
::: Divergences and collisions of content can be handled by avoiding clumsy linear references and common sense ordering of indexes. As to who maintains the indexes, as with everything else on the wiki, those who are interested in doing so will do it. 
::: ''&quot;...he is the one that has to find and propose solutions.&quot;'' I disagree. I think you should work together to find mutually acceptable solutions. Each needs to identify areas of agreement and concern and each needs to participate in the process of proposing and evaluating potential solutions. I encourage you to find middle ground. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 01:43, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
::::Sorry about that, but then what was you referring to &quot;try not to bring up old arguments&quot; ?, today only exist because of yesterday, it is that sequence of events that brings linearity and logic, if we deny the past what meaning has the present.  By arguments I understand facts or points of divergence, that until resolved must be addressed, ignoring them wont do and what you (and others) think and do is very relevant, at least to me, how else could I interact with you ?
::::The navigation scheme only supports movements forward and backward, a cover pages as Darklama indicated has no problem in being inserted on the front but how do you implement a bifurcation (or even 3 TOCs) if a user choses a chapter and wants to get to the list of chapters how does he work it out, it will have to remember at least what TOC he selected to get to the proper index, imagine this repeated 3 or 4 times, that is really non intuitive and so breaks it.
::::Can you give me an example on that &quot;Divergences and collisions of content can be handled by avoiding clumsy linear references&quot; this works on the Wiki env but not in a single page or in the printed version. (changing these option can't be part of a BeBold action).
::::I have helped him as much as I can, I gave him the freedom to implement all he wished until it infringes on my own freedoms, some things I like, some I don't but can live with it, some I object and state so, but this is voluntary I didn't sign anything that makes me work toward a single user vision, I volunteered to collaborate with any Wikibookian that doesn't make it an obligation. This it is like someone asking you to help him paint the moon blue and you state that it will be impossible but see if using some glasses with blue colored lenses will help, if he isn't satisfied what can you do.
::::I have identified areas of agreement and concern and have actively participated in the process of proposing and evaluating potential solutions, do you have any solution that resolves any of the concerns I stated so far? This can be basically summarized to an edit dispute and reduced to single line of text. (Most other books would even object in having several TOCs)  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:25, 27 March 2007 (UTC)
:::::I am trying to get you to focus on the way forward, not on the road already traveled. You read far too much subtext into my comments that is not intended. I did not ask you not to dwell on the past because I disagreed with what you said, I asked you because I didn't want you to dwell on the past. I didn't bring this up because I didn't like the original TOC, I brought it up because I thought it should be discussed. 
:::::Thank you for explaining the problem with return navigation. To me that's an even better reason to give the tables of contents meaningful labels. I don't understand why darklama wanted to create an alternate TOC, it does seem to cause a lot of challenges.

=== ===
I am focused in resolving the issues, but if Darklama doesn't maintain the TOC it will be a question of time to make this issue irrelevant, and I'm still against the logic of making changes off this nature on a very active book, knowing that it was not agreed upon. (not because of this book, but changes of this kind should not be subject to BeBold action it is almost as chattering to a book as a merge of significant content)&lt;br&gt;
When I asked you to reposition TOC1 in its original position was based on that fact, because it was there and was removed on a unilateral decission in express contradiction of what I and him had talked about (it was indeed waiting a viable solution).&lt;br&gt;
I don't agree with the wording obligation in &quot;obligation that we all have, to work with others&quot; there are various levels of collaboration and collaboration doesn't make it an obligation. An making others wishes came to fruition is way beyond collaboration.&lt;br&gt;
You haven't understood the problem completely :) if we add a cover pages (and considering only that) we must move all pages for instance coverpage &lt;-&gt; toc (on root) &lt;-&gt; some other page (on root) if you click on the default navigation button you will go to the coverpage not the toc as you need to select another page/chapter.
To understand the problem enter the book as a reader and start using toc2, select a page and examine the navigation options, go back to the same toc2 and select another page, and you will see the problem.&lt;br&gt;
As for the image it is cool (what city is it?) but doesn't have nothing to do with the subject (in that the actual one also doesn't but at least it is smaller (and in file size as well), the one that exist now was enforced by the merging administrator (the merging of the books was unlawful), the original cover page is still on the book for further discussion and waiting a proposal to restore the books name (see content discussion page) one of the first posts. You should add your creation to that discussion. A full explanation is given about the one I created.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 04:36, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

: It's the rainbow bridge in Tokyo, Japan. Has nothing to do with the subject, huh? I think a suspension bridge is actually a pretty good visual metaphor for computer programming topics generally. It has the curve of the bridge line representing the C and the two towers crossed by the deck representing the two pluses. My visual work is one place where I do go for subtext. The image can easily be resized. If the cover was to be professionally printed it would need to be at least that high a resolution. You can slag on me about a lot of things, but don't slag my art. ;P Whether you choose to use it or not doesn't really matter to me. It's not my book. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 05:13, 27 March 2007 (UTC)

:Results of the restructuring of Darklama. Darklama advanced the concept of named structure to support even better the page names navigation scheme, specific sections were aggregated (see class / stl /api ), works ok and was an improvement to the navigation. The specific pages were restructured not only to accommodate to that but also due to the extensive changes of the text and order. I'm saving the original pages to state only the concept and class/xpto to the applications of it (like a page to state what is a plug and another to show how to install a plug on a wall), and as it seems there is duplication with the page Darklama created merging other 3 pages (the one with history logs problems), but that one will require very careful work to see what was done there.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 15:36, 26 March 2007 (UTC)

I would prefer to have only one section which starts from basic and advances gradually. Wish we could come up with a bible kind of book. 
[[User:Jayaram Ganapathy|Jayaram Ganapathy]]

:That was how it was structured in the beginning of the book (on the introduction to programming paradigms) but that information was reduced (some of the historic part was removed) and there is a problem for a single part that addresses it all, that is a bit difficult as several concepts have a general definition but implications in several parts of the language, take a look for instance on the Editor's ToC at the memory management and see if you can merge it properly with the book (it's a hard task to make the book not only usable to for people that only will use it for consultation and people that like to read a book from cover to cover), I personalty prefer the first concept for technical books but I have not imposed that view on my edits if you have a better solution give it a try with that page.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 16:55, 11 April 2007 (UTC)

What I would suggest is to add a chapter before inheritance with title resource management. There we have to discuss everything related to object creation including the usage of placement new, delete[], auto pointers , smart pointers etc.  Before knowing OOPS a person should know memory management in C++. Then only he will be able to understand properly virtual functions, multiple inheritance with a common ancestor etc...  Also I would say add one error management in C++ before we dive into OOPS. Once these are done, discuss inheritance. At this point a reader will be able to understand descent code which contains memory management and exception handling code. We also will be able to throw good examples of inheritance. Then move to generics/templates. 
Regarding the Editor's ToC at procedural idioms, it contanins boost specific examples. I would prefer to take out boost specif things to the beyond the basics section of TOC 2. There an exhaustive boost chapter is welcome. After all we don't have a company like SUN who will provide JDK like API. So we should encourage all third party tools usage and anybody interested let them add one chater about usge of a specific tool there.

== Page protection ==

I have protected this page because it is part of a revert war among multiple authors of the book. There are apparently multiple Table of Contents pages for use in this book, and everybody wants this page to point to their own. the authors must agree on a particular course of action here, or I will not unprotect this page. 

I have altered the page to include links to all the TOC pages, until the dispute can be resolved. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 15:16, 28 March 2007 (UTC)

== Authors ==

At this moment, the [[C++ Programming/Authors|Authors]] page and template (maybe it has been used but I don't think that it is obvious enough) is &quot;hidden&quot; from general users. I think that we should add the link to somewhere appropriate, such as TOCs. - [[User:Ronyclau|Ron Lau]]

== RFC: What should be on the front page? ==

This is a request for comment about what should be on the front page.

Appropriate parts of TOC1 should be incorporated into TOC2 (the front page) and TOC1 should be deleted leaving only one table of contents, one editor's portal and one book.

: That would certainly seem to me to be an improvement on the status quo.  I'd like what is currently TOC2 to be more prominent and to be extended to be comprehensive.  It might be nice to have a &quot;cover page&quot; with some kind of picture and few words, linking to what's now TOC2, but that can be added at leisure; the main need is to make the book useful from the front page, and moving TOC2 there would largely achieve that.  In my opinion, though it was not my work, TOC2 is the best-structured and best-presented top-level navigation tool for this book at the present time. -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 16:46, 6 April 2007 (UTC)

: I agree with James Dennett on the coverpage with a picture and probably with the scope of the book, as people navigating to the toc aren't particularly interested in having the scope shown every time the page loads, the problem with that proposal is that all pages would have to be shifted to a new location, probably a content &quot;directory&quot;, no big problem but lots of work for something that is more eye candy than anything else, if anyone would commit doing it they would need to finish it, that is the only problem I have with that change.
: As for selecting TOC2 as the main table of content I have several problem that I have already enumerated previously, but I would like to understand what for James is the benefit that particular selection would bring over any other?
: Xixtas can you express also why you suggest TOC2 ?
: To me TOC1 is easier to navigate to any page of the book, provides a better insight on were all information is (this is also useful to point contributions as people can more easily edit and contribute in the proper section/page without a deep understanding of the global structure/framework), it uses chapters and is up-to-date now, as it reflects and provides the structure to the actual content and I guarantee my commitment to its maintenance (in the meaning that if no one updates it, I guarantee doing it), the only &quot;problem&quot; is that it displays more text but it offers also more options, this is a Wikimedia software limitation that menus or other type of controls can't be used. --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 21:45, 6 April 2007 (UTC)

:: (Re: the choice of which TOC.) It's subjective, bug I cannot read TOC1 or find anything on it; it's visually too cluttered and chaotic looking.  If I wanted to exaggerate for effect, I'd say it was in the &quot;please stop it, it makes my eyes bleed&quot; category of page design.  The simpler, &quot;cleaner&quot; presentation of TOC2 makes it a lot easier to use -- for me, at least.  (I'll observe in passing that when I design user interfaces, other people usually dislike them but they're very efficient &lt;em&gt;for me&lt;/em&gt;.  Visual design is hugely subjective.) -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 22:52, 6 April 2007 (UTC)

:::Ho, I understand you there and agree that it contains to much text, probably removing the summaries would make it less cumbersome but would also hide useful information (to a user that doesn't know much about the structure or what content is available), we must also consider that the book isn't even in a 50% done situation by removing the extra information it would indeed make it less chaotic but probably harder to use and contribute, to me as editor and as user of the book I prefer using the monolithic version to have a feel on how the book is doing and evolving and to know what is missing and it does indeed helps to fix the structure, this was the principal reason the TOC1 has evolved has it did, bandwidth and speed is a major limitation to most users.
:::I'm not oppose to removing the summaries of the chapters if people think it would make it better (one can always have a complete copy on his userspace for reference) but the idea that lead to be as it is was to make it easy to go from page to page without having to open a complete chapter to read a single page, this is the basic usefulness of having a TOC (there was a request and approved on the book conventions to limit pages to 32K), a result from users requesting the dropping of the old monolithic view I used at the beginning to structure the book.
:::Personally I like a sparse(to the point) interfaces (that is one of the requisites I use to select and use anything)  for example Google above Yahoo or del.ici.os over other bookmarking services but here we have a interface limitation that does prevent the customization of what is shown (for instance it would be great to hide the summaries as we can hide/show the TOC of a page)
:::Probably removing the image and the book scope (and print and Q&amp;A boxes) to a previous page (coverpage) would remove some of the confusion but it would also implicate much work probably a bot that would fixes the structure would be indicated to do it...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:26, 6 April 2007 (UTC)
::::In my opinion there's, too many unnecessary words in TOC1. Also the deep hierarchal structure seems undesirable to me. Something flatter that requires less decision-making from the reader appeals to me. TOC2 is definitely a more conventional structure. I've never seen a professionally produced book structured like TOC1 before. It's 4 levels deep (if you count the chapter headings as a level (which we should). But I don't really think my opinion matters too much. Also I would be happy with any table of contents that results in a low amount of duplicate content and pages with similar names being used in different versions. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 22:53, 8 April 2007 (UTC)

For me TOC2 is better. For example the core language exception and templates is added into an advanced section whch I cannot agree. It gives a wrong impression to the reader and for a beginner he will feel exception, templates etc are advanced features and no need to know. I will suggest we create good quality materials in each section which should become a bible for the subtopic. 
Meanwhile we shouldn't omit any section from TOC1. All to be merged with TOC2 and if TOC2 is missing we have to add new sections.

:TOC2 is incomplete, the print version is not equal to the TOC's content, and the header levels are (and were from the start in conflict with the ones on TOC1, it also has several pages that are agglutinations of old versions of pages in TOC1 (even duplicating some content), do you consider it better or you have a distaste for the master heading (let's call them Chapters) of TOC1 ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:32, 11 April 2007 (UTC)

TOC1 contents which actually makes a long page is due to including the subsections in the page. Anyway when we open a chapter we get again the subsections in the top of the page. So all info in TOC1 we should link to subsections of appropriate main titles. This will be easy to navigate and the reader will not deviate from the concept he was actually looking for.

I have now addressed the problem of pages with &quot;similar&quot; names (and even removed some unused pages and redirects) and  restored some of the log history of others and the names now at least reflect more the content (there is some more work needed there but it is being addressed).&lt;br&gt;
As for the wording and the levels I personally don't need them nor do I make use of it, but for a TOC as I said above the need is to have all the pages at your finger tips, at the moment that is the only way, it can be indeed simplified the chapters aren't pages in themselves they aggregation of sections under a subject, the summaries lists all pages in use on the book (that is the function of the TOC) I am incapable or reducing the display of that information without reducing the usefulness or need of the TOC, the book is big and will even grow bigger (when the exercise book is added there will be exercises for each section).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:09, 8 April 2007 (UTC)

: I disagree that it fixes the concerns Xixtas and James have. In fact with Xixtas' concerns it makes the problem worse, because you've introduced even more sublevels with the module moves. You also seem to have misunderstood something I said awhile back again, with your introduction of all the Chapter_&lt;title&gt; pages. Those aren't chapters at all, but units (using textbook terminology), because a chapter covers only one topic such as Variables, rather then Variables, Functions, etc. Units covers the latter, helping to group related topics. Also including &quot;Chapter&quot; in the module name goes against naming conventions. I also support using TOC2 as the one and only table of contents (if such a decision is needed), and including a cover page.
: I also think the 32k limit on size of modules need to be dropped too. This is a very limiting restriction, instead what should probably be the case is a module can be broken up into separate modules, when it becomes possible to divide a module into two or more unique topics. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 12:31, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

::To what do you disagree? That it addressed in some ways Xixtas and James comments about TOC1 ?
::Chapters are simply one of the ways to create divisions on a relatively lengthy piece of writing, such as a book, they are usually numbered or titled, chapters can have sub chapter for instance and yes in the lower levels the subject should be as restricted as possible, as for the structure. I think I know a thing or two about what I'm doing, part of the my formation also included Documentation Technologies were we were not only instructed on national and international norms but also how to write  papers and in special technical paper and reports (by this I don't intent to imply that your views are less worthy of attention or consideration), I have agreed with Xixtas and James as they are right, the page has to much text but the book has too much content also and the TOC is intended for people to use and facilitate navigation that same content, TOC2 bare display is quicker and less confusing by it is also less informative on what is inside the each section, I have agreed that if they strongly feel that is best to remove that information I will do it, so to what are you objecting? That even removing that information would not suffice ?
::I have done a review on other books and there is a great variety there are even more confusing setups, but few are as bare as TOC2, I have looked in particular to the books we most relate to C Programming and Java Programming and agree that in TOC1 we are a bit above those levels of complexity but also our book is now way beyond the C Programming and has just passed the Java Programming not only in the level of content but on topics, considering the still to do merge of the exercises book and adding an exercise section to each chapter, that will be even more text...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 16:32, 9 April 2007 (UTC)

::: Yes, I disagree that it addressed Xixtas and James comments about TOC1. I think it goes in the wrong direction and introduces more of the problems that were commented on. There a lot of problems with TOC1 that I think TOC2 addresses and clearly people just prefer TOC2. I had previously tried to address the concern on finding out what each chapter is about as part of the general reorganization of several small modules which dealt with general programming concepts into one chapter by suggesting that this chapter also include a general introductory to what each chapter covers. I think the structure of this book is only complex because of how you do things and you butt heads with anyone who tries to reduce the complexity of the book. Its one thing to be instructed on how things should be done and another thing to be able to make it actually work. Your qualifications or lack of qualifications means nothing on Wikibooks, your only judged on your work and actions here.

::::Darklama you know perfectly well that you were the first to ask for a new structure (and your objections were not only on the verbosity of the TOC but on the order or the chapter and in your need to remove, move and delete content, to what I wouldn't have any problem if you just added as much as you removed, this is the second problem we have amount our selves, second only to your objection to the authors page and the need to add the GFDL to TOC2  print version (at least that one is resolved) and the authors page seems to finally being addressed...)
::::More I have been particularly cooperative, you got your TOC2, with my support, but I notice that you haven't cared for it, even the print version is not equal to what the TOC contains, new pages were introduced and you have failed to add them to TOC2, in any case I will block any deletion plans for TOC1 (unless you can convince me of a real benefit, I haven't seen any but the real bare and simple aspect of it, to what I have stated my objections, we need to take into consideration the readers and that persons using the TOC may not know nothing about the subject or being just wanting to look at a particular section).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:29, 11 April 2007 (UTC)

::::: I'm hardly the first person to suggest it or say it needs to be done, I could possible be the first to try to do it though since the &quot;forced merger&quot; of two books. There was never a need to address the GFDL on the print out for TOC2, because it was always there, so I ignored that part of your false copyright violation complaint. You've only moved pages around and added pages which make no sense, so I have seen no need to add them. There are still yet other pages like the Windows API ones which of course haven't been added, because I think they shouldn't even be part of this book and any attempts in the past to address that have been subverted by you through reverting. TOC2 wouldn't of even been necessary if you have been more cooperative rather then simply reverting changes made to TOC1 to begin with. People's preference for TOC2, I would hope would open your eyes to the fact that your preferences are not necessary what makes a good book. I am a bit surprised admittedly that your even trying to understand people's objections to it. Saying you'll block any attempts to delete it though is a step back however.
::::: In traditional textbooks, table of contents rarely mention what the chapters discussion, only what the names of the chapters are and the page number that the chapter begins on. I think that is one of the things Xixtas means by professional textbooks. Readers who know nothing about the subject aren't going to understand a summary of the chapter's topic either, by the time they've finished reading the chapter though, hopefully they will understand that aspect of the books subject. A person who knows nothing about the subject isn't going to know what section they want to read first and is very likely to assume its the first chapter listed. OTOH a person who knows something about the subject should be able to figure it out from the chapter names. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 19:12, 11 April 2007 (UTC)

I will not rehash discussions we already know not to see eye to eye, take a look on the talk page of the print version of TOC2 and see perfectly well you objecting to the GFDL being included and the authors page.
As for the first person to suggest a need to the TOC it was indeed you (or you can say it was me and that lead to the fork), for me you could also fork the book (there isn't really a policy or guideline closed on that subject), I don't think it would be helpful but if you think my objections is the only think preventing you of being productive (so far you have not added much content) then I would support you forking the book.
Darklama consensus includes the option to not agree with, this in not about numbers I can even be the only one opposing your changes but if you fail to convince me of the merits I have the option to block (and I think it's obvious that I'm not blocking all your changes nor doing it in bad faith, some of your changes not only demonstrates a bit of disrespect but also consideration, your actions about the author pages and my request to include the GFDL was just an example.&lt;br&gt;

:::::My input has been [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=User_talk%3AWhiteknight&amp;diff=826684&amp;oldid=825987 requested] so i've taken a look at the pages in question. First and foremost we can all agree that the page [[C++ Programming]] should not redirect to [[C++ Programming/Editor's TOC]]. I agree with the criticisms i've read above:
:::::#[[C++ Programming/TOC1]] is confusing and cluttered. However, TOC1 contains all pages and has a complete print version.
:::::#[[C++ Programming/TOC2]] is cleaner and more elegant, but there appear to be some chapters that do not appear on TOC2.
:::::If TOC2 has the superior design (as it seems most people agree) then it should be made into the official TOC and TOC1 should be deleted. However, no TOC should be made the &quot;official&quot; one until it can pass two requirements: (1) it must be clean and easy to read, and (2) it must be complete. To that effect, there are two options available, from which I would advocate for the second:
:::::#Clean up TOC1 to use a better style, and to be less cluttered.
:::::#Expand TOC2 to contain all chapters, and ensure that the print version  for this TOC is complete. 
:::::Putting this issue to a straw poll now would likely show 4 or 5 votes to 1, which is hardly consensus but at the same time is an indication that the minority should consider some form of compromise. Failure to reach consensus on the matter results in maintaining [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=C%2B%2B_Programming&amp;diff=810284&amp;oldid=810242 the status quo], which is ugly and not helpful.

I object to a decission by straw pool (also you numbers don't seem correct, see talk page of TOC2 and I think I saw some user commenting in James talk page also), as for  confusing and cluttered we can make the same claim of many other book TOCs this is your personal interpretation and it seem that even the main page of Wikibooks seems to have problems on this regard, but I agree if TOC2 fails to be updated it should be deprecated that was the reason I and Darklama used to remove a previous existing navigation scheme used on the book...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:31, 11 April 2007 (UTC)

:I didnt say to make the decision by straw poll. Straw polls cannot be used to make decisions, only to measure consensus. My point was only that there appears to be a majority in favor of TOC2, and that you seem to be the only person here defending TOC1. You mention deprecating TOC2 if it is not expanded, but by the same token TOC1 needs to be deprecated if it is not cleaned and improved. Furthermore, as the minority, it is unlikely that the decision will be made in your favor, and if you dont compromise you will be personally responsible for the decreased usefulness of the entire book. Beyond that, if you choose not to compromise (as is typically your method) you will be ignored as being stubborn and &quot;eccentric&quot; and the rest of the book community will move on without you. You have an opportunity to work towards compromise, i suggest you not waste that opportunity. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 19:47, 11 April 2007 (UTC)

That statement is not correct, I don't need to ask permission to change any page (but at least I should exert careful consideration when I do perform an action covered by being bold) that is perfectly explained on the BeBold, Darklama wasn't being bold he had previous knowledge that I opposed it, it was indeed a editors conflict that he unilaterally decided to shift to his understanding of what should be there, to his credit he only used editor's toc (my name it was TOC3), the status of the present cover page was created by that action nothing more.&lt;br&gt;
I'm not being stubborn, I'm blocking the change because I think the actual page (you creation) is not perfect but it is indeed better than toc2 or editor's toc, and continue to defend that toc1 is the better option, and until consensus is reached should have been restored.

::Whiteknight, TOC1 isn't bad, it can indeed be improved as anything else, I have consideration for you comments as all other users views on what should be there, the toc is not overcomplicated and there are other examples of similar tocs on Wikibooks or even other that are more complex, in this case, I'm not the only &quot;contributor&quot; of that toc, it was the result of the evolution of the book under several editors (you can check the history of both tocs), toc2 on the other hand was a creation of Darklama (I even have contributed to it, but little I stated to Darklama that I thought it was of benefit having another structure available to the users, but that i would not actively maintain it) and was added with my agreement to the book (even altering the order of the pages, I have no problem with that).  I have a problem on how you see that any user that wants to make a change can impose or even lead the book into disorder or degrade it's use by unilaterally and with disregard the be bold setup, that action has lead the book into what is indeed a edit dispute (not a revert war, even if you want to believe that the alteration was done by one of my puppets it didn't revert a change of Darklama), your action and SB Jhonny on this has been partial since you have empowered a user to bypass the normal decission and discussion process, in several steps this is supported by other discussions and divergences we have had and still have in other points.
::I have no problem in working with Darklama or any other user I just reserve the right to disagree with some changes if not convinced that they are an improvement or of benefit to this book or on anything that does have an impact on the community, for instance TOC3 (the editor's toc, I see it as a great idea, and have used it and maintained it) I don't interfere in books I have no part in (even if I may do some edits or have some ideas I'll always abstain to do major reformatting without checking with the people actively working on it, this falls into the definition of respect for others views and in agreement of the BeBold), I'm not asking that toc2 should be deleted or in any way changed but it is my view that taking in consideration precedence and how the change was done, toc1 should be restored to its old position and discussion continue on how to improve it nothing more.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 02:04, 12 April 2007 (UTC)

===Suggestions on TOC1===
Hello friends,
I would like to bring your attention to the way the Contents of TOC1 is organized. You can see Baics, Advanced wtc. I found templates, exception handling etc in the advanced section. What I feel is few years before the text books organised these sections to advanced when they were introduced. Now they are mandatory part of core C++ language knowledge. Hence I would suggest to remove those kind of subsectioning. Rather what will be appealing is have a chapter on Exception handling which should become a bible as we progress. Have a chapter on Resource Management where we should collect everything about memory management. PLEASE DON@T DIVIDE THE CORE LANGUAGE FEATURES TO ADVANCED SECTION AS THE READERS WILL FEEL THAT THEY KNOW ENOUGH C++ AFTER READING BASICS BUT IN REAL LIFE THAT IS NOT AT ALL ENOUGH.
Regards,
[[User:Jayaram Ganapathy|Jayaram Ganapathy]]

:Good point, the naming of the chapters has also suffered a bit of evolution, Darklama didn't agreed with the original names and order (that was I think one of the motivations for the creation of TOC2), I'll give a look on how it was before...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:02, 11 April 2007 (UTC)

:Take a look at [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=C%2B%2B_Programming/TOC1&amp;oldid=430468 TOC1 in 16 April 2006] the basics was called fundamentals, and indeed fundamentals give the idea of the foundation for something else and doesn't qualify the content in itself. I'll try and see what I can do about it.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:07, 11 April 2007 (UTC)

:As for removing the advanced section what is your proposition? Merging with the &quot;Fundamentals&quot; would not be correct (they are indeed extra features of the language that may not even be used for simple programs and there are old programs that don't use this &quot;new&quot; concepts&quot;), it would also be wrong to mix it with the part about objects (classes etc) do you have a particular idea for that or removing the word Basic and probably give a little introduction at the begging of the chapter (with your points about the importance on learning all and probably a bit of history on the evolution of C++, to explain why). I have removed the word basic (if you feel that it partially addresses the problem I will rename the pages also. Did it help at all ?  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:17, 11 April 2007 (UTC)

The core language of C++ should comprise one section. The language is so interdependent that you cannot say exception handling is advanced and constrors are basic. When you write a ctor you should be aware that only exceptions are the only way to return the status of what happened in a ctor. Similarly you should not through an exception from destructor because when stack unwinding happens if an objects being destructed again throws an exception what will you do etc..
So the core language is one section and don't divide it into basic advanced etc. then the standard things as a section and non standard things in another section.
Divide contents into 4

 Introduction 
            having all general things like what is a compiler, history of B, C C++ etc..
 C++ Language
            Core language
 Standard libraries
           standard c libraries, STL etc
 Design Patterns implemented in C++
           STructura, behavioural etc..
 Beyond the standard
           Socke programming, threads etc Boost library , crypto graphy etc 
 Appendix
         what ever meta information we want to have

 And by the way we are into an ocean and new things will always keep on coming to be added. We will discuss and include it appropriately.

[[User:Jayaram Ganapathy|Jayaram Ganapathy]]

:Have you got the C++ Standard ? If you take a look they do precisely that, I removed the word basic, it wasn't there because I added it fundamentals seems a better definition and was the original label of that section, the idea is that you can code in C++ without using exception handling, but contructors are needed to explain classes and um problably would be crazy not to use classes on a C++ program, but the TOC as it is is perfectly acceptable the problem seem to be the verbosity of the summaries of some section and that with time will be resolved (we have to take into consideration that the book originally was a monolithic page, I have split it across topics but some topics are still to generic to by name give an idea of what is inside, the other problem with TOC2 is the order of the topic again if we take a look as how it is ordered on the standard reference we see that there isn't no optimal order, so far I have ordered as people have asked and how I would have liked to read a book about C++ and other were ordered that way before I wrote a line into it.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 17:34, 12 April 2007 (UTC)

::I agree with Jayaram that exceptions ought not to be considered an advanced topic in any modern text on C++.  The C++ standard is emphatically not organized as a tutorial or even as a reference guide.  The ordering in TOC2 seems to me to be much closer to what I want in a contemporary book on C++.

:::The visual cleanliness of TOC2 can't be guaranteed (unless we make it a book convention), make a proposal that explains what you meant by visual cleanliness (I call it simplicity), or provide a simple structural framework as example, and that would at least prevent it degrading, in any case anyone is are free to edit any page, but to provide a &quot;standard&quot; it should be written down, so to avoid divergences, add the proposal to the proper section and if up to me we should adopt it.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 18:46, 12 April 2007 (UTC)

Agree but if you don't inform others what the goal is, it is difficult to hope that the layout or appearance would evolve on a single line or that it would continue to be as clean as it is now, that was what I was stating, if you provide some guideline people may decide to agree with you and commit to it (I would support it), if not &quot;so long as it retains its visual cleanliness&quot; may indeed be a small timeframe, it all depends on the number of editors and how divergent their aesthetic values are.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 20:15, 12 April 2007 (UTC)

Take for instance the TODO box example, we could have 101 versions of the box in use on the book but agreeing in using a standard the text becomes more consistent, or for instance how you set code styles on a project if you don't inform the other programmers the result can be very messy, but do as you will, I was just pointing out that particular need...  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 20:21, 12 April 2007 (UTC)

:It's not necessary to inform others in advance, though a small note on the Talk page could do that anyway.  Assume good faith; most editors will not do dreadful things.  If there is something that looks problematic, we can discuss it with the relevant editor at the time and resolve it.  I don't see a need for people to &quot;commit&quot; to guidelines for a specific page; the general principles of courtesy and common sense governing Wikibooks are usually sufficient. -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 22:23, 12 April 2007 (UTC)

::That was what I was pointing out, it isn't a question of good or bad faith it is a question of consistency of actions, if you agree move this discussion to the content discussion page and evolve a bit more on what you consider maintaining the toc2 clear, I think I understand what you mean by it, but even that main not be correct, I don't intend in editing toc2 but if I see activity there I will help fix anything that becomes broken.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 22:36, 12 April 2007 (UTC)

:::I'm sorry, I don't understand what you've written above.  Could you rephrase it maybe? -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 23:45, 12 April 2007 (UTC)

::::No problem, What I was trying to say from the start is that this is not a case of assuming good or bad faith, if not informed editors may pull in divergent directions. Stating some expectations or guidelines will improve consistency of edits, reduce confusion and avoid divergence of viewpoints (or at least make them clear), this can only be done by providing a goal or objective.
::::Toward that objective and considering your views and it seems Darklama's opinion expressed on TOC2, it would be helpful that some of what you expect to be written down so others can work in the same direction.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 23:53, 12 April 2007 (UTC)

That is an hard one, I have looked at several wikibooks and there seems not to exist a standard look, each seems to use the best format that addresses that particular book, I have made comments that the [[Nanotechnology]] TOC seems complex, but I would be hard pressed to came with a setup that would result as good as the one they used, another &quot;look&quot; is the one used on the [[C Programming]] book, it is close to what is now on TOC2, a simple and direct not thrills or with extensive information, that seems also to work well as the book is still very small (much more could be added to it), our TOC1 resembles more the [[Java Programming]] but has gone beyond that has the C++ Programming book now has more content and topics. As for the optimal or preferred option or setup I can't say I have one, I like the one that works for me (but I take into consideration not only what I want but the purpose that it serves), I'm not a Web designed (nor I like it very much, heck I use TiddlyWiki for my own pages as much as I can not to get into it :) ), I have done several UIs and I have an active project with a community than seems to like my design but software human-machine interfaces aren't exactly portable to the Web environment or even more to a Wikistyle, anyhow every CS course has a class that teaches how to go about it (colors, distribution, stratification of information by usefulness etc) but it doesn't take into consideration personal tastes or ones eye for detail :).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 00:26, 13 April 2007 (UTC)

I generally prefer both simplicity and making good use of space on a page, so to me [[Bartending]] and [[European History/Contents|European History]] look kind of good. I also think [[Haskell]]'s use of tables for the table of contents across the page looks good, because it uses more of the page, not leaving as much empty space and could be useful for this book too. --&lt;span style=&quot;font: bold 10pt 'courier new', comic, sans, ms;&quot;&gt;[[User:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;dark&lt;/font&gt;]][[Image:Yin yang.svg|12px]][[User_talk:Darklama|&lt;font color=&quot;green&quot;&gt;lama&lt;/font&gt;]]&lt;/span&gt; 00:55, 13 April 2007 (UTC)

: Some observations/opinions about those TOCs. [[Nanotechnology]] - Great book very interesting read. But the Table of Contents isn't one I'd want to emulate. I think it makes it harder to find content than if it were presented linearly. [[C Programming]] is spare and lacks a lot of the features I think a good TOC can have. [[Java Programming]] seems to have some consistency problems but leaving that aside, the subheads are used for placemarkers within the module. I like the practical, spare setup of of Java programming. I think it makes it pretty easy to find what you are looking for. This is not how TOC1 is set up, TOC1 is much more difficult to use to find content. [[Bartending]] I really like this one except for the unused whitespace under the picture. [[European History/Contents|European History]] I like but isn't really suitable for a programming book. [[Haskell]]'s tables and use of tracks are interesting, and I don't feel that they are as difficult to navigate as the Nanotech TOC. In general people go to tables of contents to direct them to somewhere else. They are looking for something. Having too many words makes finding things difficult, having too deep a hierarchal structure makes finding things more difficult, not less so. --[[User:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:turquoise&quot;&gt;xixtas&lt;/span&gt;]] &lt;sup&gt;[[User_Talk:Xixtas|&lt;span style=&quot;color:magenta&quot;&gt;talk&lt;/span&gt;]]&lt;/sup&gt; 13:31, 13 April 2007 (UTC)

=== Cleaning TOC1 ===

Since nobody else was trying anything, I decided to try to clean up TOC1 a little bit as per the criticisms people have mentioned about it. I wasn't able to clean all of it, because most of the TOC is nested in transclusions. My edits are [http://en.wikibooks.org/w/index.php?title=C%2B%2B_Programming%2FTOC1&amp;diff=828855&amp;oldid=828578 HERE]. If people like this, then I suggest we clean the transcluded summary pages as well. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 14:30, 13 April 2007 (UTC)

=== Any progress? ===

I haven't been watching this discussion, but i didn't forget about it. Have you people decided which TOC to use here? If you guys have a solution, I will unprotect the page and make it redirect to the proper place. --[[User:Whiteknight|Whiteknight]] &lt;small&gt;([[User talk:Whiteknight|talk]]) ([[User:Whiteknight/Proposed Books|projects]])&lt;/small&gt; 18:22, 25 April 2007 (UTC)

==Thoughts on the C++ Book ==
Perhaps more real world examples and flow within the book would make it more user friendly. Having more than one table of contents may serve to confuse and frustrate readers as well. Also, looking at programs from a larger scale and focusing on practical applications like user interface design within C++ in Windows and Linux (or other) systems and  maybe fruitful. Thank you all for your contributions to the C++ book. C++ certainly is quite an important topic and probably one of the most widely used and functional languages as well, so it is quite an important book for the community. --[[User:Remi0o|Remi]] 23:39, 13 April 2007 (UTC)

:Interesting ideas.

:One difficulty with covering large scale programming issues is that the examples and explanations of any one could often fill a dedicated book -- and it's necessary to have a good understanding of the language (and standard library) before looking at the many factors involved in &quot;real-world&quot; programming in the large.  It might be interesting to try to address that though; the online/wikibook form might have strengths that print books do not (for example, the fact that a 200-page appendix to cover one example might be entirely reasonable online).

:User interface design (with a C++ slant) is another area worthy of one or more books on its own.  Two issues are (a) the fact that C++ has no standard UI library, so it's necessary to pick one or more to use, and (b) the fact that many UI designs are handled fairly well by less powerful tools than C++.

:(An aside: C++ isn't much of a &quot;functional&quot; programming language, though it has some limited support for some functional concepts.  But you probably didn't mean &quot;functional&quot; in the technical sense.)

:Thanks for the feedback/ideas (and your other input too).  -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] 18:25, 14 April 2007 (UTC)

::I share Remi vision for the development for the book, but such vision was contested previously on the book, it was one on the reasons that lead to the fork, or for the yet to be resolved move of the MFC pages out of the book unilaterally by Darklama, having said this, if we think about priorities, there are for now plenty to be added yet and some of the subjects Remi points out are now listed at least on the editor's toc for development...
::Make files, source control, POSIX, Unicode, 32 to 64Bits and unit testing are without doubt less contested or less prone to cause conflict in adding them to the book, for me I also have a personal wish to take on wxWidgets in a near future, at the moment I'm developing software for windows (and with Linux in mind, WINE) using the MFC libraries, considering market share of the OSs this is a important subject not only for anyone intending to build more that experimental software or generic libraries. GUI and Networking are nowadays important to every developer and even to the a language (the C++ may evolve to support some of this functionalities in one way or another directly), at least that is what I've been reading from time to time, even if making it a reality would be difficulty, uniformity and a consistent API would indeed be a life improvement to any C++ programmer, at the moment we are faced with competing  solutions battling for developers attention, some are not as free as they could be and are more shackles than an helping hand (btw I have a personal &quot;hate&quot; for the .net platform in specially to C++/CLI, count me out to contribute to one section about it :), but for instance I'm watching with attention the development of IronPython as a RAD tool for the MS platform, it will make prototyping a breeze).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] 19:28, 14 April 2007 (UTC)

== The Tocs ==

We really need to merge this into one TOC so we can start working on this book instead of adding this content here but not there and then take this content away from that and ect.
See my point? [[Special:Contributions/4.254.217.210|4.254.217.210]] ([[User talk:4.254.217.210|talk]]) 02:53, 10 June 2008 (UTC)
:Okay, everybody's ignoring me. That's nice.
Anyway, for those of you that do read this, I'm giving you a week to come up with the ToC this page is going to redirect to. If you have not settled the issue after a week, I'm going to let outside opinions decide. [[User:VenomousNinja|~VNinja]][[User talk:VenomousNinja|~]] 23:13, 27 June 2008 (UTC)

::Unfortunately this book has history and issues which lead to the current mess with multiple TOCs, and improvement has been resisted doggedly in the past.  If you'd like to be constructive, you would do well to adopt a less confrontational approach; help to resolve this would be great, but throwing oils on the fire doesn't have much chance of a good outcome. -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] ([[User talk:James Dennett|talk]]) 03:16, 28 June 2008 (UTC)
:::Mmhm. However, it doesn't really seem like people want to solve our ToC problem, so, I'm attempting to force them too. [[User:VenomousNinja|~VNinja]][[User talk:VenomousNinja|~]] 02:02, 29 June 2008 (UTC)
::::Well I was going to stay quiet and see were you were going [[User talk:VenomousNinja]], since you had much enthusiasm but showed  a limited level of knowledge of the problem involving the TOCs, and indeed you seemed aggressive in your stance, if the issue was still hot you would probably cause more damage than help solve anything in that way. Wikibooks is about dialog, compromise and consensus and a small set or rules are provided to avoid conflicts, due to the level/tone of your overall contributions I didn't took your first (signed) post as needing a reply and I generally avoid replying to unsigned posts, if you were the author of those, please consider that as the probable reason no one did address you. 
::::Since [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] did try to address your concerns I will take this time to explain the issues to you, so to reduce the possibility that any problem may arise. As it is the TOCs have no real problem, at least at present the issue, as I see it is almost resolved.
::::The foremost problem was addressed by an administrative removal of any TOC from the &quot;coverpage&quot; (to no one satisfaction I'm sure) and a lock is in place since then, that in itself as I see it against the normal ways such edit disputes should addressed or resolved but the conflict at the time was hot and not primarily around the TOCs.
::::As I see it the original sin and my primary concern was the unilateral substitution of the existing TOC by another, even after an extensive dialog and expressed objections were known and understood, looking back, it could have been a result of other active debates around several other and mostly unrelated issues, anyway the issue was as I said above resolved administratively with the result that we now have. What is still on the table is not the content/validity or immutability of of the TOCs (all TOCs were always open to edits, the book had even previously to this problem other TOCs) but the reposition of the status quo, that is the reversal of the first action, restoring the TOC to its original location (since the implementation of an address all solution is impractical if not technically impossible at present, having multiple TOCs exist on the cover page enabling several navigational schemes), in any case the substitution toc that was moved to the coverpage has been stale since the last &quot;content&quot; edit September 2007, at present it indexes less that 50% of the work and is mostly obsolete (there are other related edit concerns but not directly relevant to the issue). Since the creator of the alternative TOC did mostly esthetically and structural changes to the work, ie: created also the useful Editor's TOC (not part of the issue), and has since then started another book on the same topic (that is also stale now but created with the scope he was attempting to formalize on TOC2), since then there was a proposal to deleted TOC2 that has (formally) passed but need that I gather some confidence and check if the other part was aware of it (the page was monitored but may have removed it from the watchlist by accident), since I think the other editor must be directly informed before proceeding, but I have been procrastinating doing it...
::::Ok hope I have passed to you an understanding of what &quot;was&quot; the problem and why things are as they are, or why I'm not to keen in speeding things up.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 05:24, 29 June 2008 (UTC)
:Nice history lesson, thanks. Really.
::That doesn't help me, nor does it help the book. See, because of these multiple ToCs, we aren't getting any work done on this wikibook. The C# book is a featured book, and C++ is much better(in my opinion), so why should'nt we be a featured book? The answer is because our books don't have a high quality of work, which is caused by the multiple ToCs, another one of the reasons we aren't a featured book. In reality, I'm trying to work towards the goal of making this book featured, but before that can happen, we need an official ToC.

Any chance of refraining from unilaterally removing the link to TOC2 from the Editor's TOC while there's clearly not consensus? -- [[User:James Dennett|James Dennett]] ([[User talk:James Dennett|talk]]) 13:54, 14 August 2008 (UTC)
:I'll restore it if you object to the removal. But consensus on the proposal was reached James, in the [[Wikibooks:Decision making]] if you look in the [http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Wikibooks:Decision_making#Process process] in point 5 it states &quot;''If there are no objections, the proposal is accepted and affirmative &quot;community consensus&quot; has been reached on the proposal.''&quot;. I take you have some reservations on toc2 deletion by your vote on the aborted VFD (to what I gave a reply) but you failed again to commit in the extension (7-9 days) made to the adoption of the proposal, just to address the VFD vote you made, since there was no objection before that, I have made you direct request to express any still lingering objection, solution or alternative on the proper forum. Doing those type of asynchronous statement isn't very productive either.

== C I/O and C++ I/O ==

&quot;Standard C style I/O&quot; looks like
&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
    printf(&quot;%s&quot;, &quot;Hello, world!\n&quot;);
&lt;/source&gt;

&quot;C++ style I/O&quot; looks like
&lt;source lang=&quot;cpp&quot;&gt;
    cout &lt;&lt; &quot;Hello, world!&quot; &lt;&lt; endl;
&lt;/source&gt;

Currently this book discusses &quot;Standard C style I/O&quot; in the [[C++ Programming/Chapter Fundamentals]] chapter,
and then later discusses &quot;C++ style I/O&quot; in the [[C++ Programming/Chapter Advanced Features]] chapter.
I think that's exactly backwards.

So today I did this:
Moved the following links from the &quot;Advanced Features&quot; chapter to the &quot;Fundamentals&quot; chapter:
* [[C++ Programming/Code/IO]]
* [[C++ Programming/Code/IO/Streams/string]]
* [[C++ Programming/Code/IO/Streams]]

Moved the following links from the &quot;Fundamentals&quot; chapter to the &quot;Advanced Features&quot; chapter:
* [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library]]
* [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/IO]]
* [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/String &amp; Character]]
* [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/Math]]
* [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/Time&amp;Date]]
* [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/Memory]]
* [[C++ Programming/Code/Standard C Library/Other]]

--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 03:00, 10 March 2009 (UTC)

I also updated [[C++ Programming/Chapter Fundamentals Summary]] and [[C++ Programming/Chapter Advanced Features Summary]] to reflect this change.
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 04:01, 10 March 2009 (UTC)

I'm considering going even further:
* Old C style stuff in the Standard C Library that has been made obsolete by newer, better C++ stuff -- printf(), malloc(), etc. has been obsoleted by &quot;cout &lt;&lt;&quot;, &quot;new&quot;, etc. -- tear those pages out of this book and stick them into the the [[C Programming]] book; let this C++ book pretend they never existed.
* Stuff in the Standard C library that is still useful to C++ programmers -- sin(), cos(), difftime(), etc. -- stick them into the [[C Programming]] book also, but leave behind a short summary with links to the more detailed information in that other book.
Do you think that's going too far?
--[[User:DavidCary|DavidCary]] ([[User talk:DavidCary|talk]]) 03:00, 10 March 2009 (UTC)

:I would wish you had made this post in the right discussion area...
:In any case the change you made is &quot;political&quot; and cosmetic (and only partially complete) not about content or defending your view/approach next to the reader.
:I think I understand your view point, but don't feel that the move at this time is productive and that it has no informative value, it even breaks the existing structure since the place holders or qualifiers were also changed in a similar way before calling the Standard C Library as Advanced or placing it after the STL to me is detrimental to the work, you could have done it by explaining the approach and relevance on how to handle the concepts in the book itself that would be informative to the reader.
:The C part of C++ is as relevant as discussing the unique concepts of the language, hiding or banning it to the back pages will in no way promote the understanding of the language, you are in fact enforcing your &quot;understanding&quot; of the language on others going about it this way, especially if the user/reader cant get hold (or doesn't need) to use the new features of the language, like if he is working on embedded systems, but that is another discussion, sadly you made the change before explaining your ideas (I did spend some time looking for the post mentioned in the edit comment).
:'''Old C style stuff in the Standard C Library that has been made obsolete by newer, better C++ stuff''' this statement makes the last changes really objectionable, there is no old or new stuff in the terms you are putting it, even less '''better C++ stuff''', there is the C++ language, the point of how one should go about learning it is debatable and I think you could, with better arguments behind it, explain and promote it to the reader, granting him the choice to select one approach without moving the pages around on the table of content. I would like you to think about how the changes did improve the book and see if you can live with restoring it as it was and approach the reader in the text.
:You are ultimately going about it the wrong way, similar to some people that impose the OOP approach to the language, there is space for all approaches, there is no specific &quot;right way&quot;, it all depends on the objective one is attempting to archive .  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|talk]]) 03:33, 10 March 2009 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Revised sections of Next Steps ==

=== case ===
Haskell, like many other languages, also supports &lt;tt&gt;'''case'''&lt;/tt&gt; constructions. These are used when there are multiple values that you want to check against (case expressions are actually quite a bit more powerful than this – see the [[../Pattern matching/]] chapter for all of the details).

Suppose we wanted to define a function that had a value of &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; if its argument were &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;; a value of &lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt; if its argument were &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;; a value of &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt; if its argument were &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;; and a value of &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; in all other instances. Writing this function using &lt;tt&gt;'''if'''&lt;/tt&gt; statements would be long and very unreadable; so we write it using a &lt;tt&gt;'''case'''&lt;/tt&gt; statement as follows (we call this function &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt;):

{{HaskellExample|1=|2=&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
f x =
    case x of
      0 -&gt; 1
      1 -&gt; 5
      2 -&gt; 2
      _ -&gt; -1
&lt;/source&gt;}}

In this program, we're defining &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; to take an argument &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; and then inspecting the value of &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;. If it matches &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, the value of &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;. If it matches &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, the value of &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;math&gt;5&lt;/math&gt;. If it matches &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;, then the value of &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;math&gt;2&lt;/math&gt;; and if it hasn't matched anything by that point, the value of &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; is &lt;math&gt;-1&lt;/math&gt; (the underscore can be thought of as a &quot;wildcard&quot; – it will match anything).

The indentation here is important. Haskell uses a system called &quot;layout&quot; to structure its code (the programming language Python uses a similar system). The layout system allows you to write code without the explicit semicolons and braces that other languages like C and Java require.

{{warning|1=
Because whitespace matters in Haskell, you need to be careful about whether you are using tabs or spaces. If you can configure your editor to never use tabs, that's probably better. If not, make sure your tabs are always 8 spaces long, or you're likely to run into problems.
}}

=== Indentation ===

The general rule for layout is that an opening ''brace'' (the &lt;tt&gt;{&lt;/tt&gt; character) is inserted after the keywords &lt;tt&gt;'''where'''&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;'''let'''&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;'''do'''&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;'''of'''&lt;/tt&gt;, and the column position at which the next command appears is remembered. From then on, a semicolon is inserted before every new line that is indented the same amount. If a following line is indented less, a closing brace (&lt;tt&gt;}&lt;/tt&gt;) is inserted. This may sound complicated, but if you follow the general rule of indenting after each of those keywords, you'll never have to remember it (see the [[../Indentation/]] chapter for a more complete discussion of layout).

Some people prefer not to use layout and write the braces and semicolons explicitly. This is perfectly acceptable. In this style, the above function might look like:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
f x = case x of
        { 0 -&gt; 1 ; 1 -&gt; 5 ; 2 -&gt; 2 ; _ -&gt; -1 }
&lt;/source&gt;
Of course, if you write the braces and semicolons explicitly, you're free to structure the code as you wish. The following is also equally valid:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
f x =
    case x of { 0 -&gt; 1 ;
      1 -&gt; 5 ; 2 -&gt; 2
   ; _ -&gt; -1 }
&lt;/source&gt;
However, structuring your code like this only serves to make it unreadable (in this case).

=== Defining one function for different parameters ===

Functions can also be defined piece-wise, meaning that you can write one version of your function for certain parameters and then another version for other parameters. For instance, the above function &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; could also be written as:

{{HaskellExample|1=|2=&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
f 0 = 1
f 1 = 5
f 2 = 2
f _ = -1
&lt;/source&gt;}}

Just like in the &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; situation above, order is important. If we had put the last line first, it would have matched every argument, and &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; would return &lt;code&gt;-1&lt;/code&gt;, regardless of its argument (most compilers will warn you about this, though, saying something about overlapping patterns). If we had not included this last line, &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; would produce an error if anything other than 0, 1 or 2 were applied to it (most compilers will warn you about this, too, saying something about incomplete patterns). This style of piece-wise definition is very popular and will be used quite frequently throughout this tutorial. These two definitions of &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; are actually equivalent – this piece-wise version is translated into the case expression.

=== Function composition ===

More complicated functions can be built from simpler functions using ''function composition''. Function composition is simply taking the result of the application of one function and using that as an argument for another. We've already seen this back in the [[../Getting set up/]] chapter, when we wrote &lt;code&gt;5*4+3&lt;/code&gt;. In this, we were evaluating &lt;math&gt;5 \cdot 4&lt;/math&gt; and then applying &lt;math&gt;+3&lt;/math&gt; to the result. We can do the same thing with our &lt;code&gt;square&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; functions:

{{HaskellExample||
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
square x = x^2
&lt;/source&gt;

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
*Main&gt; square (f 1)
25
*Main&gt; square (f 2)
4
*Main&gt; f (square 1)
5
*Main&gt; f (square 2)
-1
}}}}

The result of each of these function applications is fairly straightforward. The parentheses around the inner function are necessary; otherwise, in the first line, the interpreter would think that you were trying to get the value of ''&lt;code&gt;square f&lt;/code&gt;'', which has no meaning. Function application like this is fairly standard in most programming languages.

There is another, more mathematical way to express function composition: the (&lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;) enclosed period function. This (&lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;) function is modeled after the (&lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt;) operator in mathematics.

{{body note|1=
In mathematics we write &lt;math&gt;f \circ g&lt;/math&gt; to mean &quot;f following g.&quot;  In Haskell , we write &lt;code&gt;f . g&lt;/code&gt; also to mean &quot;f following g.&quot;

The meaning of &lt;math&gt;f \circ g&lt;/math&gt; is simply that &lt;math&gt;(f \circ g)(x) = f(g(x))&lt;/math&gt;. That is, applying the function &lt;math&gt;f \circ g&lt;/math&gt; to the value &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is the same as applying &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, taking the result, and then applying &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; to that.
}}

The (&lt;code&gt;.&lt;/code&gt;) function (called the function composition function), takes two functions and makes them into one. For instance, if we write &lt;code&gt;(square . f)&lt;/code&gt;, this means that it creates a new function that takes an argument, applies &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; to that argument and then applies &lt;code&gt;square&lt;/code&gt; to the result. Conversely, &lt;code&gt;(f . square)&lt;/code&gt; means that a new function is created that takes an argument, applies &lt;code&gt;square&lt;/code&gt; to that argument and then applies &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; to the result.  We can see this by testing it as before:

{{HaskellGHCiExample|1=|2=
*Main&gt; (square . f) 1
25
*Main&gt; (square . f) 2
4
*Main&gt; (f . square) 1
5
*Main&gt; (f . square) 2
-1
}}

Here, we must enclose the function composition in parentheses; otherwise, the Haskell compiler will think we're trying to compose &lt;code&gt;square&lt;/code&gt; with the value &lt;code&gt;f 1&lt;/code&gt; in the first line, which makes no sense since &lt;code&gt;f 1&lt;/code&gt; isn't even a function.

== Remotions from Simple I/O ==

=== Controlling actions ===

(...)

We can write the same &lt;code&gt;doGuessing&lt;/code&gt; function using a &lt;tt&gt;'''case'''&lt;/tt&gt;
statement.  To do this, we first introduce the Prelude function
&lt;code&gt;compare&lt;/code&gt;, which takes two values of the same type (in the &lt;code&gt;Ord&lt;/code&gt;
class) and returns a value of type &lt;code&gt;Ordering&lt;/code&gt;, namely one of 
&lt;code&gt;GT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;LT&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;EQ&lt;/code&gt;, depending on
whether the first is greater than, less than or equal to the second.

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
doGuessing num = do
  putStrLn &quot;Enter your guess:&quot;
  guess &lt;- getLine
  case compare (read guess) num of
    LT -&gt; do putStrLn &quot;Too low!&quot;
             doGuessing num
    GT -&gt; do putStrLn &quot;Too high!&quot;
             doGuessing num
    EQ -&gt; putStrLn &quot;You Win!&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
Here, again, the &lt;tt&gt;'''do'''&lt;/tt&gt;s after the &lt;code&gt;-&gt;&lt;/code&gt;s are necessary on the
first two options, because we are sequencing actions.

If you're used to programming in an imperative language like C or Java, you might think that &lt;tt&gt;'''return'''&lt;/tt&gt; will exit you from the current function.  This is not so in Haskell.  In Haskell, &lt;tt&gt;'''return'''&lt;/tt&gt; simply
takes a normal value (for instance, one of type &lt;code&gt;Int&lt;/code&gt;) and makes
it into an action that when evaluated, gives the given value (for the same example, the
action would be of type &lt;code&gt;IO Int&lt;/code&gt;). In particular, in an imperative
language, you might write this function as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;c&quot;&gt;
void doGuessing(int num) {
  print &quot;Enter your guess:&quot;;
  int guess = atoi(readLine());
  if (guess == num) {
    print &quot;You win!&quot;;
    return ();
  }

  // we won't get here if guess == num
  if (guess &lt; num) {
    print &quot;Too low!&quot;;
    doGuessing(num);
  } else {
    print &quot;Too high!&quot;;
    doGuessing(num);
  }
}
&lt;/source&gt;
Here, because we have the &lt;code&gt;return ()&lt;/code&gt; in the first &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; match,
we expect the code to exit there (and in most imperative languages, it
does).  However, the equivalent code in Haskell, which might look
something like:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
doGuessing num = do
  putStrLn &quot;Enter your guess:&quot;
  guess &lt;- getLine
  case compare (read guess) num of
    EQ -&gt; do putStrLn &quot;You win!&quot;
             return ()

  -- we don't expect to get here if guess == num
  if (read guess &lt; num)
    then do print &quot;Too low!&quot;;
            doGuessing num
    else do print &quot;Too high!&quot;;
            doGuessing num
&lt;/source&gt;
First of all, if you guess correctly, it will first print &quot;You win!,&quot; but it won't exit, and it
will check whether &lt;code&gt;guess&lt;/code&gt; is less than &lt;code&gt;num&lt;/code&gt;.  Of course it is
not, so the else branch is taken, and it will print &quot;Too high!&quot; and
then ask you to guess again.

On the other hand, if you guess incorrectly, it will try to evaluate
the case statement and get either &lt;code&gt;LT&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;GT&lt;/code&gt; as the result of
the &lt;code&gt;compare&lt;/code&gt;.  In either case, it won't have a pattern that
matches, and the program will fail immediately with an exception.

Another typical usage of pattern binding is on the left hand side of case branches:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
describeList :: (Show a) =&gt; [a] -&gt; String
describeList list = 
  case list of
   []     -&gt; &quot;The list was empty&quot;
   (x:xs) -&gt; &quot;The list wasn't empty: the first element was &quot; ++ show x ++ &quot;, and &quot; ++
             &quot;there were &quot; ++ show (length xs) ++ &quot; more elements in the list.&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Other places ===
There are a few other situations in which patterns can be used that we'll meet later on. Here's a list in case you're very eager already:

* &lt;code&gt;where&lt;/code&gt; clauses, which are an alternative to &lt;code&gt;let&lt;/code&gt; bindings;
* lambdas, which are anonymous function definitions;
* In &lt;code&gt;p &lt;- x&lt;/code&gt; assignments in do-blocks, &lt;code&gt;p&lt;/code&gt; can be a pattern.
* Similarly, with let bindings in do-blocks, you can pattern match analogously to 'real' let bindings.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
Circumstantial evidence is evidence that is put forward to establish a fact that can be used to suggest an inference that other facts exist that would resolve a matter at issue.

In a case based on circumstantial evidence, it is often said that the rule in hodge’s applies.&lt;ref&gt;Hodge's Case (1838), 2 Lewin 227, 168 E.R. 1136 per Baron Alderson regarding a case made entirely of circumstantial evidence, the court must be satisfied &quot;not only that those circumstances were consistent with his having committed the act, but they must also be satisfied that the facts were such as to be inconsistent with any other rational conclusion than that the prisoner was the guilty person&quot;&lt;br&gt;
also considered in R. v. Linn 1994 CanLII 4643 (SK CA), (1994), 116 Sask.R. 203, [1994] 4 W.W.R. 305 at para. 13-15 and R. v. Munro, 2001 SKQB 138 (CanLII) at 13-14
&lt;/ref&gt; The rule says that one can only convict on circumstantial evidence if the evidence is consistent with guilt and inconsistent with any other rational conclusion. &lt;ref&gt;Mezzo v. The Queen, [http://canlii.ca/t/1ftrq 1986 CanLII 16], [1986] 1 SCR 802 at para. 12&lt;/ref&gt; Other rational conclusions must be based on inferences from facts and not merely speculative. Underlying the rule, is the principle of reasonable doubt. 

Circumstantial evidence is based on reasoning and inference-drawing  through probability.&lt;ref&gt;R v Arp 1998 CanLII 769, [1998] 3 SCR 339 at p. 375&lt;/ref&gt; The judge must apply logic, common sense and experience to the evidence. They must consider the inherent probabilities and improbabilities, frequently eliminating the possibility of coincidence.&lt;Ref&gt;
F.H. v. McDougall, 2008 SCC 53 (CanLII), [2008] 3 S.C.R. 41, at paras. 33-40, 47-8&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Yousif, 2011 ABCA 12 (CanLII), at para. 5&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Circumstantial evidence may be used to support the inference of innocence as well as long as the probative value outweighs prejudicial effect and it is not given undue weight.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. S.C.B. (1997), 104 O.A.C. 81 (CA) at para. 33 to 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of circumstantial evidence:
* motive (past hostility to Victim)
* opportunity (including exclusive opportunity)
* means, capacity and skills
* post-offence conduct (flight, false alibi, destruction of evidence)
* knowledge and state of mind
* habit&lt;ref&gt;R v Pilon (2009) 243 CCC (3d) 109 (ONCA)&lt;/ref&gt;
* disposition for violence by victim

A judge must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the only rational inference that can be drawn from the circumstantial evidence is one of guilt.&lt;ref&gt; Griffin, 2009 SCC 28 [http://canlii.ca/en/ca/scc/doc/2009/2009scc28/2009scc28.html#par33 at para 33]&lt;/ref&gt;

Proof by circumstantial evidence requires consideration of the evidence as a whole and not in part.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Stewart, [1977] 2 SCR 748&lt;Br&gt;
R v Turlon, (1989)  49 C.C.C. (3d) 186 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

A conclusion cannot be found without evidence, which is to say that it cannot be speculation.&lt;ref&gt; R v Torrie [1967] 3 CCC 303 (ONCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

A judge does not need to give special instructions for circumstantial evidence.&lt;ref&gt;R v Griffin, 2008 SCC 28 at [http://canlii.ca/en/ca/scc/doc/2009/2009scc28/2009scc28.html#par33 para 33]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Evidence of prior violence by the victim, including threats, can be relevant circumstantial evidence to establish reasonableness of an apprehension of harm and could not otherwise protect themselves from harm.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Petel [1994] 1 SCR 3 &lt;/ref&gt;

Drug paraphernalia found with drugs can be relevant to support the inference of knowledge of the nature of the drugs, participation in drug dealing, and specific plans of dealing.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Froese (1988) 44 CCC (3d) 1 (MBCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

Fingerprint evidence can infer that the person who the fingerprint matches touched or held the object it was found on. It is other evidence that will determine the time and place that the object was touched or held.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Mars (2006), 205 CCC (3d) 376&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Motive==
Motive is a form of ulterior intent that permits the inferential proof of other essential elements of the offence. Evidence of a motive to commit the offence is circumstantial evidence supporting a conviction.&lt;ref&gt;R v Griffin, 2009 SCC 28 -- statement of deceased suggests motive for murder&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, evidence of a lack of motive is circumstantial evidence supporting an acquittal. Evidence of a lack of motive is not the same as lack of evidence of a motive.&lt;ref&gt;R v Lewis [1979] 2 SCR 821&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence that the accused and victim had a good relationship is not evidence of a lack of motive, but a lack of evidence of a motive.&lt;ref&gt;R v Ilina 2003 MBCA 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of motive goes to prove intent as well as the act.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Cloutier, [1940] SCR 131&lt;Br&gt;
Bari c. R., [http://canlii.ca/t/1q41l 2006 NBCA 119]&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of insolvency or debt can be admitted to establish motive for an offence of theft, fraud or arson.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Portillo, [http://canlii.ca/t/6360 2003 CanLII 5709] (ON CA) - accused's possession of victim's property establish motive of theft for murder charge&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of the accused previously threatening the victim is admissible to establish an animus and motive to harm the victim, an intent to kill, as well as narrative. It is not bad character evidence.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Cooper, [http://canlii.ca/t/1j0mf 2004 BCCA 540]
&lt;/ref&gt;

In a murder case, evidence of a prior abuse that establishes an animus or motive to kill is admissible against the accused.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Chapman 2006 CanLII 1178 (ON CA), (2006), 204 CCC (3d) 449 (Ont CA) at para. 27&lt;br&gt; 
R v Cudjoe, 2009 ONCA 543 (CanLII), 2009 ONCA 543 at para. 64&lt;br&gt;
R v Van Osselaer 2002 BCCA 464 (CanLII), (2002), 167 CCC (3d) 225 (BC CA) at para. 23, leave to appeal refused, [2002] SCCA No 444 (SCC)&lt;Br&gt;
R v Batte 2000 CanLII 5750 (ON CA), (2000), 145 CCC (3d) 449 (Ont CA) at paras. 97 and 102, 49 OR (3d) 321&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
==State of Mind==
Evidence of an utterance by the deceased victim goes to the state of mind of the victim.&lt;Ref&gt;
Bari c. R., [http://canlii.ca/t/1q41l 2006 NBCA 119]&lt;/ref&gt;

A complainant's post-even demeanour or emotional state is admissible and may be used to support the credibility of the complainant's evidence of a sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Woollam, [http://canlii.ca/t/fscd8 2012 ONSC 2188] (CanLII) at para. 48&lt;br&gt;
see  Murphy and Butt v. The Queen 1976 CanLII 198 (SCC), [1977) 2 S.C.R. 603 at 617&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Boss, 1988 CanLII 190 (ON CA), (1988), 46 C.C.C. (3d) 523 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;br&gt;
Varcoe, 2007 ONCA 194 at para. 33&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Arsenault, [1997] O.J. No. 3977 (C.A.) at para. 9&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Clark, [1995] O.J. No. 4036 (C.A.) at para. 7&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Means, Capacity and Expertise== 

Evidence of the accused in possession of the weapon of the offence at a time outside of the offence time is admissible to prove that the accused had the necessary means to commit the offence. Without further details it cannot be put to establish that he had the weapon of the assault or that he be convicted for the offence.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Backhouse, [http://canlii.ca/t/1jvwn 2005 CanLII 4937] (ON CA), (2005) 194 CCC (3d) 1 (ONCA)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Kinkead, [http://canlii.ca/t/5xwn 2003 CanLII 52177] (ON CA)
&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of tools and gear in the possession of the accused consistent with the offence is evidence of expertise.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Davison (1974) 20 C.C.C. (2d) 422 (ONCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
==Opportunity==
Where the accused is the last person seen with the victim is circumstantial evidence of opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Stevens (1984), 11 CCC (3d) 318&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; However, opportunity alone cannot be sufficient to make the case.

Evidence of the accused's frequented the area near where the victim frequented and where victim's body was found.

{{reflist|2}}
===Exclusive Opportunity===
Evidence that shows only a single person was present at the time of the offence and was otherwise capable of committing the offence, then it will be sufficient to prove identity of the culprit. The issue is whether the opportunity is truly &quot;exclusive&quot; and not simply a likely amongst several potential persons. This will often address factors such as who had access to the location of the offence as well as timing of events and each person's location during or near that time.

Evidence of opportunity that is not exclusive is akin to evidence of motive. It cannot be used as a form of corroboration.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Ferianz (1962), 37 C.R. 37 (Ont. C.A.)(“Evidence of opportunity, unless it is exclusive opportunity, is on a somewhat similar footing as evidence of motive.  Mere opportunity is not accepted as corroboration where corroboration is required or desirable....”)&lt;/ref&gt; However, where opportunity is coupled with some other form of inculpatory evidence, then it may be sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Yebes, [http://canlii.ca/t/1ftlc 1987 CanLII 17], [1987] 2 SCR 168 
(&quot;where evidence of opportunity is accompanied by other inculpatory evidence, something less than exclusive opportunity may suffice.&quot;); See Johnson [http://canlii.ca/t/1hjwq 2004 NSCA 91]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Form of Evidence==

Demeanour evidence may constitute circumstantial evidence of guilty knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;
e.g., R. v. Goulart-Nelson, [2004] O.J. No. 4010 (C.A.) at para. 14&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Morales 2006 CanLII 19930 (ON CA), (2006), 81 O.R. (3d) 161 (C.A.), at paras. 12, 14&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; The judge should consider the nature and context of the observations, such as a person's natural display of nervousness common to interactions with police.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. De Rojas, [http://canlii.ca/t/ftcn0 2012 ONSC 3227] (CanLII) at para. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
The police have a common law right to detain people for investigative purposes. The investigation must be based on a &quot;reasonable suspicion that the particular individual is implicated in the criminal activity under investigation&quot; for it to be considered lawful.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Mann, 2004 SCC 52, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 59 [http://canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2004/2004scc52/2004scc52.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
An officer's grounds to believe an offence has been committed will fall short of being &quot;objectively reasonable and probable&quot; allowing for an arrest. It the officer instead has a &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot; that the suspect was involved in a criminal offence, it may be enough to justify investigative detention.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Cunsolo, [2008] O.J. No. 3754 (S.C.J.) - summary of rules of arrest and detention&lt;br&gt;
R. v. D.L.W., [http://canlii.ca/t/fts53 2012 BCSC 1700] (CanLII) at para. 31
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Right Against Arbitrary Detention==
Section 9 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms provides that 
{{quotation|9. Everyone has the right not to be arbitrarily detained or imprisoned.}}

The &quot;purpose of s. 9, broadly put, is to protect individual liberty from unjustified state interference&quot;&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Grant, 2009 SCC 32 at 20[http://canlii.ca/t/24kwz#par20]&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus &quot;a detention in the absence of at least reasonable suspicion is unlawful and therefore arbitrary within s. 9&quot;&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Grant, 2009 SCC 32 at 55 [http://canlii.ca/t/24kwz#par55]&lt;/ref&gt;

The burden is upon the applicant to prove that the accused was &quot;detained&quot; within the meaning of s. 9 which must be proven on a balance of probabilities.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Bush (2010), 259 C.C.C. (3d) 127 at para. 74 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. B.(L.) [http://canlii.ca/t/1srnc 2007 ONCA 596] (CanLII), (2007), 227 C.C.C. (3d) 70 at para. 60 (Ont. C.A.)
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
==Types of Detention==
A person can be detained physically or psychologically.

Psychological detention has three elements:  
#a police direction or demand; 
#the individual’s voluntary compliance with the direction or demand resulting in a deprivation of liberty or other serious legal consequences; and 
# the individual’s reasonable belief that there is no choice but to comply&lt;ref&gt; 
R. v. Grant 2006 CanLII 18347, (2006), 209 C.C.C. (3d) 250 at para. 8 and 28 (ONCA)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Nesbeth, [http://canlii.ca/t/2065l 2008 ONCA 579] at para. 15-17 &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Harris, [http://canlii.ca/t/1smfn 2007 ONCA 574] at para. 17 &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Suberu 2009 SCC 33 (CanLII), (2009), 245 C.C.C. (3d) 112 at paras. 23-35&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Detetion by police does not continue subsequent to release on terms of bail, and so entitlements such as the right to silence do not apply.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Earhart, 2011 BCCA 490 [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/2011/2011bcca490/2011bcca490.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose for detention can have concurrent reasons, such as conducting traffic enquiries while making observations of drug related offences.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Harding  2010 ABCA 180 at para. 18&lt;br&gt;
R v Yague, 2005 ABCA 140, 371 AR 286 at paras 7 - 9&lt;br&gt;
R v Nolet, 2010 SCC 24 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

An officer cannot detain a suspect on the basis of a hunch.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Mann, 2004 SCC 52 at paras 34-35 [2004] 3 SCR 59&lt;br&gt;
R v Harrison, 2009 SCC 34 at para 20&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Public Encounters==
Stopping a person will not always amount to detention. &lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Grafe, [http://canlii.ca/t/1p77c 1987 CanLII 170] (ON CA)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Hall, [http://canlii.ca/t/6jv0 1995 CanLII 647] (ON CA)&lt;/ref&gt; It is only where there is either physical restraint or police direction. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Grant [http://canlii.ca/t/24kwz 2009 SCC 32] at para. 30&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Answering Questions===
There is no legal duty upon a person to identify himself to a police officer in ''every'' situation.&lt;ref&gt; 
R v Moore (1978) 24 NR 181 (SCC); see also Rice v. Connelly, [1966] 2 ALL E.R. 649 (House of Lords)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is well understood that merely asking for ID alone does not amount to detention.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Frank, [http://canlii.ca/t/ftp15 2012 ONSC 6274] (CanLII) at para. 47
&lt;/ref&gt;

There should be a questioning that of suspected criminal activity that results in a &quot;focused interrogation amounting to detention&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Suberu [http://canlii.ca/t/24kx4 2009 SCC 33] (CanLII)
&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the obligation to answer questions, such as those related to identity, then the failure to do so may result in a charge of [[Canadian Criminal Law/Offences/Obstruction of a Peace Officer|Obstruction of a Peace Officer]] under s. 129 of the Criminal Code.

The compelled attendance to the principal's office is not a detention.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. M. (M.R.), [http://canlii.ca/t/1fqq9 1998 CanLII 770] (SCC), [1998] 3 SCR 393
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Motor Vehicle stops==
A vehicle stop is a form of detention.&lt;ref&gt; R v. Brookwell 2008 ABQB 545 at para. 29, citing R v. Orbanski &amp; Elias 2005 SCC 37, at para. 31.&lt;/ref&gt; This includes waiting for a breathalyzer test pursuant to the breathalyzer demand or the taking of blood samples pursuant to a blood sample demand.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Harder, 1989 CanLII 2857, 49 C.C.C. (3d) 565 (B.C.C.A.);[http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/1989/1989canlii2857/1989canlii2857.html]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Greene, [1991] N.J. No. 12 , 62 C.C.C. (3d) 344 (Nfld. C.A.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Random traffic check stops are ''prima facie'' violations of right to be free from arbitrary detention, however, have often been declared justifiable pursuant to s. 1 of the Charter. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Hufsky, 1988 CanLII 72, [1988] 1 S.C.R. 621 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1988/1988canlii72/1988canlii72.html]; R. v. Ladouceur, 1990 CanLII 108, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1257 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1990/1990canlii108/1990canlii108.html]; and R. v. Mellenthin, 1992 CanLII 50 (S.C.C.), [1992] 3 S.C.R. 615 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1992/1992canlii50/1992canlii50.html]; R. v. Simpson (1993), 79 C.C.C. (3d) 482 (Ont. C.A.) [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1993/1993canlii3379/1993canlii3379.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigating a Motor Vehicle Act violation does not permit the officer to take the detained person into the police vehicle even where safety may be a concern.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Timmer, 2011 ABQB 629[http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abqb/doc/2011/2011abqb629/2011abqb629.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

Random stops of persons for &quot;reasons related to driving a car such as checking the driver's licence and insurance, the sobriety of the driver and the mechanical fitness of the vehicle&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Nolet, 2010 SCC 24 at 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Dual purposes in random traffic stops are permissible.

Random stop programs that are used to investigate for any number of offences, providing for a &quot;comprehensive check for criminal activity&quot;, are flawed and cannot permit detention for any purpose at all.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Nolet, 2010 SCC 24 referencing R v Ladouceur 2002 SKCA 73&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
==Rights Upon Detention==
===Right to be Informed of Reasons===
:''See also [[Canadian_Criminal_Procedure_and_Practice/Arrest_and_Detention/Arrest_Procedure#Right_to_be_Informed_of_Charges|Rights upon Arrest]]''

At point of detention the detainee must be immediately &quot;advised, in clear and simple language, of the reasons for the detention.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
Mann at para. 21&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Kelly, (1985), 7 O.A.C. 46, [1985] O.J. No. 2 at para. 14&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

A person can only exercise his right to counsel under s. 10(b) in a meaningful way if he knows the extent of his jeopardy.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. S.E.V., 2009 ABCA 108 (CanLII) at para. 22&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Black, 1989 CanLII 75 (SCC), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 138, 50 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at para. 24&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

The rights under s.10(b) have been met where the substance of what the accused can reasonably be supposed to understand in the context and circumstances of the case.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Evans, 1991 CanLII 98 (SCC), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 869, 63 C.C.C. (3d) 289 at para. 35&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
A warrant is one among several means of securing an accused's attendance at court. On warrants, the Criminal Code states:
{{quotation|
'''Contents of warrant to arrest'''&lt;br&gt;
511. (1) A warrant issued under this Part shall
:(a) name or describe the accused;
:(b) set out briefly the offence in respect of which the accused is charged; and
:(c) order that the accused be forthwith arrested and brought before the judge or justice who issued the warrant or before some other judge or justice having jurisdiction in the same territorial division, to be dealt with according to law.
...&lt;p&gt;
'''Discretion to postpone execution'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(c), a judge or justice who issues a warrant may specify in the warrant the period before which the warrant shall not be executed, to allow the accused to appear voluntarily before a judge or justice having jurisdiction in the territorial division in which the warrant was issued.
&lt;p&gt;
'''Deemed execution of warrant'''&lt;br&gt;
(4) Where the accused appears voluntarily for the offence in respect of which the accused is charged, the warrant is deemed to be executed.
&lt;p&gt;
'''Certain actions not to preclude issue of warrant'''&lt;br&gt;
512. (1) A justice may, where the justice has reasonable and probable grounds to believe that it is necessary in the public interest to issue a summons or a warrant for the arrest of the accused, issue a summons or warrant, notwithstanding that
:(a) an appearance notice or a promise to appear or a recognizance entered into before an officer in charge or another peace officer has been confirmed or cancelled under subsection 508(1);
:(b) a summons has previously been issued under subsection 507(4); or
:(c) the accused has been released unconditionally or with the intention of compelling his appearance by way of summons.
&lt;p&gt;
'''Warrant in default of appearance'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) Where
:(a) service of a summons is proved and the accused fails to attend court in accordance with the summons,
:(b) an appearance notice or a promise to appear or a recognizance entered into before an officer in charge or another peace officer has been confirmed under subsection 508(1) and the accused fails to attend court in accordance therewith in order to be dealt with according to law, or
:(c) it appears that a summons cannot be served because the accused is evading service,
&lt;p&gt;
a justice may issue a warrant for the arrest of the accused.
&lt;br&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
'''Formalities of warrant'''&lt;br&gt;
513. A warrant in accordance with this Part shall be directed to the peace officers within the territorial jurisdiction of the justice, judge or court by whom or by which it is issued.
&lt;p&gt;
'''Execution of warrant'''&lt;br&gt;
514. (1) A warrant in accordance with this Part may be executed by arresting the accused
:(a) wherever he is found within the territorial jurisdiction of the justice, judge or court by whom or by which the warrant was issued; or
:(b) wherever he is found in Canada, in the case of fresh pursuit.
&lt;p&gt;
'''By whom warrant may be executed'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) A warrant in accordance with this Part may be executed by a person who is one of the peace officers to whom it is directed, whether or not the place in which the warrant is to be executed is within the territory for which the person is a peace officer.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec513 CCC]
}}

Under s. 511, the execution of a warrant or arrest authorizes 1) the arrest of the accused and 2) the officer to bring the accused before a judge in the territorial division in which the warrant was issued.

==Judge Issued Warrant==
{{quotation|
'''Issue of warrant for arrest of accused'''&lt;br&gt;
524. (1) Where a justice is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that an accused
:(a) has contravened or is about to contravene any summons, appearance notice, promise to appear, undertaking or recognizance that was issued or given to him or entered into by him, or
:(b) has committed an indictable offence after any summons, appearance notice, promise to appear, undertaking or recognizance was issued or given to him or entered into by him,
&lt;P&gt;
he may issue a warrant for the arrest of the accused.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec524 CCC]
}}

==Feeney Warrant of Arrest==
When a suspect is the subject of an arrest warrant and he is believed to be found in a dwelling-house, the peace officer must seek authorization to enter the dwelling using a &quot;feeney warrant&quot;.

A person has an increased privacy right in their home which prohibits warrantless entries even for the purpose of a lawful arrest&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Feeney 1997 CanLII 342, [1997] 2 SCR 13 at para. 19-20&lt;/ref&gt; or seizure of evidence.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Golub 1997 CanLII 6316 (ONCA) at para. 41&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 529 states:
{{quotation|
'''Including authorization to enter in warrant of arrest'''&lt;br&gt;
529. (1) A warrant to arrest or apprehend a person issued by a judge or justice under this or any other Act of Parliament may authorize a peace officer, subject to subsection (2), to enter a dwelling-house described in the warrant for the purpose of arresting or apprehending the person if the judge or justice is satisfied by information on oath in writing that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person is or will be present in the dwelling-house.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Execution'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) An authorization to enter a dwelling-house granted under subsection (1) is subject to the condition that the peace officer may not enter the dwelling-house unless the peace officer has, immediately before entering the dwelling-house, reasonable grounds to believe that the person to be arrested or apprehended is present in the dwelling-house.
&lt;P&gt;
R.S., 1985, c. C-46, s. 529; 1994, c. 44, s. 52; 1997, c. 39, s. 2.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec529 CCC]
}}

Any power to enter a dwelling-house to carry out an arrest under a criminal code offence will equally apply to warrants under other federal Acts.&lt;ref&gt;
see [http://canlii.ca/t/7vhg s. 34.1] of the Interpretation Act&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Outside Native Jurisdiction==

===Canada-wide Warrant===
Canada-wide warrants are warrants that are not attached to particular jurisdictions. It can only be issued by a judge of a superior court and not a provincial court judge. 

It is provided for under s. 703:
{{quotation|
703(1)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, a warrant of arrest or committal that is issued out of a superior court of criminal jurisdiction, a court of appeal, an appeal court within the meaning of section 812 or a court of criminal jurisdiction other than a provincial court judge acting under Part XIX may be executed anywhere in Canada.
&lt;P&gt;
(2) Despite any other provision of this Act but subject to subsections 487.0551(2) and 705(3), a warrant of arrest or committal that is issued by a justice or provincial court judge may be executed anywhere in the province in which it is issued.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec703 CCC]
}}


===Transferring Local Warrants to Different Provinces===
Where no Canada-wide warrant is issued and a regular 514 warrant has been issued in another jurisdiction, under s. 528 the local court may endorse the foreign warrant:
{{Quotation|
528.(1) Where a warrant for the arrest or committal of an accused, in any form set out in Part XXVIII in relation thereto, cannot be executed in accordance with section 514 or 703, a justice within whose jurisdiction the accused is or is believed to be shall, on application and proof on oath or by affidavit of the signature of the justice who issued the warrant, authorize the arrest of the accused within his jurisdiction by making an endorsement, which may be in Form 28, on the warrant.
&lt;P&gt;
(1.1)     A copy of an affidavit or warrant submitted by a means of telecommunication that produces a writing has the same probative force as the original for the purposes of subsection (1).
&lt;P&gt;
(2)        An endorsement that is made upon a warrant pursuant to subsection (1) is sufficient authority to the peace officers to whom it was originally directed, and to all peace officers within the territorial jurisdiction of the justice by whom it is endorsed, to execute the warrant and to take the accused before the justice who issued the warrant or before any other justice for the same territorial division.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec528 CCC]
}}

This section allows either local police or the police of the other jurisdiction to arrest the accused, who is located locally, and be transported to the jurisdiction of the original warrant.

===Executing Warrants from Other Provinces===
Section 503(3) addresses the situation where an accused is arrested without a warrant outside of the jurisdiction and the local jurisdiction would like to compel their attendance at court.
{{Quotation|
503.(3) Where a person has been arrested without warrant for an indictable offence alleged to have been committed in Canada outside the territorial division where the arrest took place, the person shall, within the time prescribed in paragraph (1)(a) or (b), be taken before a justice within whose jurisdiction the person was arrested … and the justice within whose jurisdiction the person was arrested
:(a)        If the justice is not satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person arrested is the person alleged to have committed the offence, shall release that person; or
:(b)        If the justice is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person arrested is the person alleged to have committed the offence, may
::(i)               Remand the person to the custody of a peace officer to await execution of a warrant for his or her arrest in accordance with section 528, but if no warrant is so executed within a period of six days after the time he or she is remanded to such custody, the person in whose custody he or she then is shall release him or her…..

'''Possession of break-in instrument'''&lt;br&gt;
351. (1) Every one who, without lawful excuse, the proof of which lies on them, has in their possession any instrument suitable for the purpose of breaking into any place, motor vehicle, vault or safe under circumstances that give rise to a reasonable inference that the instrument has been used or is or was intended to be used for such a purpose,
:(a) is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years; or
:(b) is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.&lt;br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''Possession of instruments for breaking into coin-operated or currency exchange devices'''&lt;br&gt;
352. Every one who, without lawful excuse, the proof of which lies on him, has in his possession any instrument suitable for breaking into a coin-operated device or a currency exchange device, under circumstances that give rise to a reasonable inference that the instrument has been used or is or was intended to be used for breaking into a coin-operated device or a currency exchange device, is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years.

}}
==Proof of the Offence==
In addition to the essential elements of time, location, and identity, the crown must prove that:
# the accused possessed instruments
# the instruments were suitable for the purpose of breaking into a location
# there was some nexus between the tools' purpose and a location that was targeted by the accused

==Interpretation==
A knife, even a broken one, can be found to be a break-in instrument as it can be used to force a gate or drawer lock.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">GMAW or Gas Tungsten Arc Welding also more know as Tig Welding is a very popular welding method today. With this method you weld by heating up the base metal and create a weld puddle and at the same time add a filler material or filler rod into the welding pool. Tig welding is used mostly on thin materials, and also when quality is of highest importance. With GMAW you will be able to weld the highest amount of different metals and because of that it is a good solution for a lot of people

==Note on External Links==

External links should only be used to reference useful educational sites. It is questionable that theweldingworld.com is such a site, especially if you link to it three times in three different pages. This can make it look like spam. For now I've removed the three links. It might be a reasonable source to use once but the overuse does make it look like you might be trying to advertise the site. I'm not accusing you of doing so, just suggesting that you don't overuse such links.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Procedure Overloading ==

Like several other languages, Fortran 90 and newer supports the ability to select the appropriate routine from a list of routines based on the arguments passed.  This selection is done at compile time and is thus unencumbered by run-time performance penalties.  This feature is accessed by use of modules and the interface block.

In the following example, a module is specified with contains a single logical function which can handle arguments of various types.

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
module extension_mod
   implicit none
   private

   interface f
      module procedure f_i
      module procedure f_r
      module procedure f_z
   end interface

   public::f

contains

   function f_i(x) result(y)
      integer,intent(in)::x
      integer::y

      y = x**2-1
   end function f_i

   function f_r(x) result(y)
      real,intent(in)::x
      real::y

      y = x**2-1.0
   end function f_r

   function f_z(x) result(y)
      complex,intent(in)::x
      complex::y

      y = x**2-1.0
   end function f_z

end module extension_mod
&lt;/source&gt;

A program which uses this module now has access to a single logical function f which accepts arguments which are of the integer, real, or complex data types.  The return type of the function is the same as the input type.  In this way the routine is much like many of the intrinsic functions defined as part of the Fortran standard.  An example program is given below:

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
program main
   use extension_mod
   implicit none

   integer::xi,yi
   real::xr,yr
   complex::xz,yz

   xi = 2
   xr = 2.0
   xz = 2.0

   yi = f(xi)
   yr = f(xr)
   yz = f(xz)

end program main
&lt;/source&gt;

== Derived Data Types ==

Fortran 90 and newer supports the creation of new data types which are composites of existing types.  In some ways this is similar to an array, but the components need not be all of the same type and they are referenced by name, not index.  Such data types must be declared before variables of that type, and the declaration must be in scope to be used.  An example of a simple 2d vector type is given below.

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
type::vec_t
   real::x,y
end type
&lt;/source&gt;

Variables of this type can be declared much like any other variable, including variable characteristics such are pointer or dimension.

&lt;source lang=&quot;fortran&quot;&gt;
type(vec_t)::a,b
type(vec_t),dimension(10)::vecs
&lt;/source&gt;

Using derived data types, the Fortran language can be extended to represent more diverse types of data than those represented by the primitive types.

== Operator Overloading ==

Operators can be overloaded so that derived data types support the standard operations, opening the possibility of extending the Fortran language to have new types which behave nearly like the native types.

{{body note|1=
There are legitimate uses of &lt;code&gt;return ()&lt;/code&gt; as a placeholder do-nothing action.
For instance, take the following action:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
loop = do
    c &lt;- getChar
    if c == 'Q' 
        then return ()
        else loop
    putStrLn &quot;&quot;
    putStrLn [c]
&lt;/source&gt;

Admittedly, this looks a lot like a &lt;code&gt;while (true) / break&lt;/code&gt; loop in your
favourite imperative language. As we can tell now, however, there is something quite
different going on here.
}}

Explain, step by step, what the &lt;code&gt;loop&lt;/code&gt; action in the final box note
does, and in particular what is the role of the &lt;code&gt;return ()&lt;/code&gt;. Hints:
* &lt;code&gt;getChar&lt;/code&gt; is an action analogous to &lt;code&gt;getLine&lt;/code&gt;, except that, instead of taking a newline-terminated series of characters from the standard input and making a &lt;code&gt;IO String&lt;/code&gt;, it takes just a single character as soon as it is input.
* If you have trouble with the control flow within &lt;code&gt;loop&lt;/code&gt;, run it in GHCi to get a better feel of what it does.</text>

== &lt;tt&gt;case&lt;/tt&gt; expressions ==

{{Exercises|1=
Use a &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; statement to implement a &lt;code&gt;fakeIf&lt;/code&gt; function which might be used as a replacement to the familiar &lt;code&gt;if&lt;/code&gt; expressions.  
}}
&lt;br/&gt;
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
fakeIf :: Bool -&gt; a -&gt; a -&gt; a
fakeIf condition ifTrue ifFalse =
  case condition of
    True  -&gt; ifTrue
    False -&gt; ifFalse
&lt;/source&gt;

== Controlling actions, revisited ==

{{Exercises|1=
# Redo the &quot;Haskell greeting&quot; exercise in [[../Simple input and output#Controlling actions|Simple input and output/Controlling actions]], this time using a &lt;code&gt;case&lt;/code&gt; statement.
# What does the following program print out? And why?
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
main =
 do x &lt;- getX
    putStrLn x

getX =
 do return &quot;My Shangri-La&quot;
    return &quot;beneath&quot;
    return &quot;the summer moon&quot;
    return &quot;I will&quot;
    return &quot;return&quot;
    return &quot;again&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;
}}


1. 
&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
main = do
  putStrLn &quot;Hello, what is your name?&quot;
  name &lt;- getLine
  case name of
      &quot;Simon&quot; -&gt; greatlanguage
      &quot;John&quot;  -&gt; greatlanguage
      &quot;Phil&quot;  -&gt; greatlanguage
      &quot;Koen&quot;  -&gt; putStrLn &quot;I think debugging Haskell is fun.&quot;
      _       -&gt; putStrLn &quot;Sorry, I don't know you.&quot;
      where
      greatlanguage = putStrLn &quot;I think Haskell is a great programming language.&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;


2. Executing &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; will print &lt;code&gt;&quot;again&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. Remember that the value of a sequence of IO actions is the same as the value of the last action in the sequence. &lt;code&gt;getX&lt;/code&gt; can also be written as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
getX =
  do return &quot;again&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

or even shorter, as:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
getX = return &quot;again&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;

As a result, &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; function has the value &lt;code&gt;&quot;again&quot;&lt;/code&gt;, which will then be written to the screen.

'''Accessory after the fact'''&lt;br&gt;
23. (1) An accessory after the fact to an offence is one who, knowing that a person has been a party to the offence, receives, comforts or assists that person for the purpose of enabling that person to escape.
&lt;br&gt;
(2) [Repealed, 2000, c. 12, s. 92]
&lt;br&gt;
R.S., 1985, c. C-46, s. 23; 2000, c. 12, s. 92.&lt;br&gt;
'''Where one party cannot be convicted'''&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
23.1 For greater certainty, sections 21 to 23 apply in respect of an accused notwithstanding the fact that the person whom the accused aids or abets, counsels or procures or receives, comforts or assists cannot be convicted of the offence.
&lt;br&gt;
R.S., 1985, c. 24 (2nd Supp.), s. 45.

'''Accessory after fact to murder'''&lt;br&gt;
240. Every one who is an accessory after the fact to murder is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for life.
&lt;br&gt;

657.2 ...&lt;br&gt;
'''Accessory after the fact'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) Where an accused is charged with being an accessory after the fact to the commission of an offence, evidence of the conviction or discharge of another person of the offence is admissible against the accused, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary is proof that the offence was committed.
&lt;br&gt;
1997, c. 18, s. 80.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec657.2 CCC]
}}

==Proof of the offence==

To prove the offence, the crown should establish the following in addition to the essential elements of time, location and identity:&lt;Ref&gt;R v Young (1950 10 C.R. 142, 98 CCC 195 (Que.CA)&lt;/ref&gt;
# the accused knew a crime had been committed
# the accused intended to aid the principal 
# the accused did an act that enabled the principle to escape (arrest, trial, punishment)


{{reflist|2}}

==Interpretation==
An accessory to an offence is not the same as a party to an offence. It is a separate offence that is committed subsequent to the initial offence.&lt;ref&gt;R v Vinette [1975] 2 SCR 222 [http://canlii.ca/t/1z198 2 SCR 222]&lt;/ref&gt;

The accused must know that that the person they are assisting was a principle or party to an offence, and the assistance must be ''for the purpose'' of enabling the person to escape. It is not sufficient that the accused merely do an act that enables the escape.&lt;ref&gt;R v McVay (1982) 66 CCC (2d) 512 (ONCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not necessary for the principle or party to the main offence be charged or convicted for it for an accused to be convicted as an accessory.&lt;ref&gt;R v Camponi (1993) 22 CR (4th) 348 (BCCA)&lt;br&gt; 
R v Anderson (1980) 26 AR 172 (ABCA)&lt;/ref&gt; But if the principle or party is acquitted, then the accused cannot be convicted.&lt;ref&gt;R v Vinette&lt;/ref&gt; However, R v S(FJ), [1998] 1 SCR 88 seems to go so far to say that the words &quot;Whether or not the principal is convicted&quot; can include an acquittal.

The conviction of the principle is admissible to prove that the principal committed the offence.&lt;Ref&gt; R v Duong (1998) 124 CCC (3d) 392 (ONCA) see also s.657.1 relating to criminal records&lt;/ref&gt;

All evidence that has been found admissible for the principle will be admissible against the accessory.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Vinette&lt;/ref&gt;

See Also: R v Wisdom, 1992 OJ No. 3110 (Ont.Gen.Div.)

A person is not guilty as an accessory for refusing to provide information to authorities.,Ref&gt; R v Semenick (1955) 11 CCC 337 (BCCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sexual exploitation of person with disability'''&lt;Br&gt;
153.1 (1) Every person who is in a position of trust or authority towards a person with a mental or physical disability or who is a person with whom a person with a mental or physical disability is in a relationship of dependency and who, for a sexual purpose, counsels or incites that person to touch, without that person’s consent, his or her own body, the body of the person who so counsels or incites, or the body of any other person, directly or indirectly, with a part of the body or with an object, is guilty of
:(a) an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years; or
:(b) an offence punishable on summary conviction and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding eighteen months.&lt;br&gt;

'''Definition of “consent”'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) Subject to subsection (3), “consent” means, for the purposes of this section, the voluntary agreement of the complainant to engage in the sexual activity in question.&lt;br&gt;

'''When no consent obtained'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) No consent is obtained, for the purposes of this section, if
:(a) the agreement is expressed by the words or conduct of a person other than the complainant;
:(b) the complainant is incapable of consenting to the activity;
:(c) the accused counsels or incites the complainant to engage in the activity by abusing a position of trust, power or authority;
:(d) the complainant expresses, by words or conduct, a lack of agreement to engage in the activity; or
:(e) the complainant, having consented to engage in sexual activity, expresses, by words or conduct, a lack of agreement to continue to engage in the activity.&lt;br&gt;

'''Subsection (3) not limiting'''&lt;br&gt;
(4) Nothing in subsection (3) shall be construed as limiting the circumstances in which no consent is obtained.
&lt;br&gt;
'''When belief in consent not a defence'''&lt;br&gt;
(5) It is not a defence to a charge under this section that the accused believed that the complainant consented to the activity that forms the subject-matter of the charge if
:(a) the accused’s belief arose from the accused’s
::(i) self-induced intoxication, or
::(ii) recklessness or wilful blindness; or
:(b) the accused did not take reasonable steps, in the circumstances known to the accused at the time, to ascertain that the complainant was consenting.&lt;br&gt;

'''Accused’s belief as to consent'''&lt;Br&gt;
(6) If an accused alleges that he or she believed that the complainant consented to the conduct that is the subject-matter of the charge, a judge, if satisfied that there is sufficient evidence and that, if believed by the jury, the evidence would constitute a defence, shall instruct the jury, when reviewing all the evidence relating to the determination of the honesty of the accused’s belief, to consider the presence or absence of reasonable grounds for that belief.
&lt;br&gt;
1998, c. 9, s. 2.

==Proving the Offence==

'''Sexual Exploitation'''&lt;br&gt;
In addition to the essential elements of time, location, and identity, the prosecution should prove:
# the complainant was a young person (between 16 and 17 years old)
# the accused was in a position of trust or authority with respect to the complainant, the complainant was dependant upon the accused, or the complainant was in an exploitive relationship
# the accused touched a party of the complainant's body
# the touching was direct (with the body of the accused) or indirectly ( with an object)
# the touching was for a sexual purpose

==Interpretation==

===&quot;Young Person&quot;===
Under s. 153(2), &quot;young person&quot; for this offence means &quot;a person 16 years of age or more but under the age of eighteen years.&quot;

===Position of Trust or Authority===
Where the accused runs the operation that employs the complainant and is physically larger than the complainant is not sufficient on its own to establish a position of trust or authority over the complainant.
&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Caskenette (1993), 80 C.C.C. (3d) 439 - Accused testified that he was not regularly on the work site&lt;/ref&gt;

A teacher will be in a position of trust absent exceptional circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;
R v McLachlan, [http://canlii.ca/t/fs665 2012 SKCA 74] (CanLII)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Sexual Exploitation===
The meaning of &quot;exploitive relationship&quot; is largely determined by  the scope of the other types of relationships set for in ss. (1.2). (R. v. Anderson, [http://canlii.ca/t/22hvs 2009 PECA 4] at 67)

Of some use is the definition of &quot;exploitive&quot; from Black’s Law Dictionary 8th ed. which defines it as &quot;the act of taking unfair advantage of another for one’s own benefit.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Anderson, [http://canlii.ca/t/22hvs 2009 PECA 4] at 68&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|
'''Inference of sexual exploitation'''&lt;br&gt;
(1.2) A judge may infer that a person is in a relationship with a young person that is exploitative of the young person from the nature and circumstances of the relationship, including
:(a) the age of the young person;
:(b) the age difference between the person and the young person;
:(c) the evolution of the relationship; and
:(d) the degree of control or influence by the person over the young person.
&lt;P&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
===Included Offences===

Sexual assault is not an included offence. Exploitation is a specific intent offence and involves more subjective proof than sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Nelson (1989), 51 C.C.C. (3d) 150, Philp J. (Ont. H.C.)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===History===
In 2005,  &quot;An Act to amend the Criminal Code (protection of children and other vulnerable persons) and the Canada Evidence Act, S.C. 2005, c. 32&quot; amended 153(1) and added 153(1.1) and (1.2). It came into force November 1, 2005.

In 2008, &quot;Tackling Violent Crime Act, S.C. 2008, c. 6&quot; added s. 153(2). It came into force May 1, 2008.

'''Extortion'''&lt;Br&gt;

&lt;br&gt;
'''Extortion'''&lt;br&gt;
(1.1) Every person who commits extortion is guilty of an indictable offence and liable
:(a) if a restricted firearm or prohibited firearm is used in the commission of the offence or if any firearm is used in the commission of the offence and the offence is committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with, a criminal organization, to imprisonment for life and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of

&lt;br&gt;
'''Subsequent offences'''&lt;br&gt;
(1.2) In determining, for the purpose of paragraph (1.1)(a), whether a convicted person has committed a second or subsequent offence, if the person was earlier convicted of any of the following offences, that offence is to be considered as an earlier offence:

:(c) an offence under section 220, 236, 239, 272 or 273, subsection 279(1) or section 279.1 or 344 if a firearm was used in the commission of the offence.
&lt;br&gt;
However, an earlier offence shall not be taken into account if 10 years have elapsed between the day on which the person was convicted of the earlier offence and the day on which the person was convicted of the offence for which sentence is being imposed, not taking into account any time in custody.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Sequence of convictions only'''&lt;br&gt;
(1.3) For the purposes of subsection (1.2), the only question to be considered is the sequence of convictions and no consideration shall be given to the sequence of commission of offences or whether any offence occurred before or after any conviction.

Pathogenic bacteria are [[bacteria]] that cause '''bacterial [[infectious disease|infection]]'''. This article deals with human pathogenic bacteria.

Although the vast majority of bacteria are harmless or beneficial, quite a few bacteria are [[pathogenic]]. One of the bacterial diseases with highest [[disease burden]] is [[tuberculosis]], caused by the bacterium ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'', which kills about 2 million people a year, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. Pathogenic bacteria contribute to other globally important diseases, such as [[pneumonia]], which can be caused by bacteria such as ''[[Streptococcus]]'' and ''[[Pseudomonas]]'', and foodborne illnesses, which can be caused by bacteria such as ''[[Shigella]]'', ''[[Campylobacter]]'' and ''[[Salmonella]]''. Pathogenic bacteria also cause infections such as [[tetanus]], [[typhoid fever]], [[diphtheria]], [[syphilis]] and [[leprosy]]. 

[[Koch's postulates]] are criteria designed to establish a causal relationship between a causative microbe and a disease.

==Diseases==
Each pathogenic species has a characteristic spectrum of interactions with its human [[host (biology)|hosts]].

===Conditionally pathogenic===
Conditionally pathogenic bacteria are only pathogenic under certain conditions, such as a wound that allows for entry into the blood, or a decrease in immune function.

For example, ''[[Staphylococcus]]'' or ''[[Streptococcus]]'' are also part of the normal [[human flora]] and usually exist on the skin or in the nose without causing disease, but can potentially cause skin infections, [[pneumonia]], [[meningitis]] and even overwhelming [[sepsis]], a systemic inflammatory response producing shock, massive vasodilation and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fish DN |title=Optimal antimicrobial therapy for sepsis |journal=Am J Health Syst Pharm |volume=59 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=S13–9 |year=2002 |month=February |pmid=11885408 |url=http://www.ajhp.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11885408}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some species of bacteria, such as ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'', ''[[Burkholderia cenocepacia]]'', and ''[[Mycobacterium avium complex|Mycobacterium avium]]'', are [[opportunistic infection|opportunistic pathogens]] and cause disease mainly in people suffering from [[immunosuppression]] or [[cystic fibrosis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Heise E | title = Diseases associated with immunosuppression | pmc=1568899 | journal = Environ Health Perspect | volume = 43 | issue = |pages=9–19 |year=1982 |pmid=7037390 |doi=10.2307/3429162 | jstor=3429162}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Saiman&gt;{{cite journal |author=Saiman L |title=Microbiology of early CF lung disease |journal=Paediatr Respir Rev |volume=5 |issue=Suppl A |pages=S367–9 |year=2004 |pmid=14980298 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1526054204900656 |doi=10.1016/S1526-0542(04)90065-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intracellular===
Other organisms invariably cause disease in humans, such as [[obligate intracellular parasite]]s that are able to grow and reproduce only within the cells of other organisms. Still, infections with intracellular bacteria may be [[asymptomatic]], such as during the [[incubation period]]. An example of intracellular bacteria is ''[[Rickettsia]]''. One species of ''Rickettsia'' causes [[typhus]], while another causes [[Rocky Mountain spotted fever]]. 

[[Chlamydia (bacterium)|Chlamydia]], another phylum of obligate intracellular parasites, contains species that can cause [[pneumonia]], or [[urinary tract infection]] and may be involved in [[coronary heart disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Belland R, Ouellette S, Gieffers J, Byrne G | title = Chlamydia pneumoniae and atherosclerosis | journal = Cell Microbiol | volume = 6 |issue=2 |pages=117–27 |year=2004 |pmid=14706098 |doi=10.1046/j.1462-5822.2003.00352.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''[[Mycobacterium]]'' and ''[[Brucella]]'' can exist intracellularly, though they are facultative (not obligate intracellular parasites.)

===By location===
Following is a list of bacterial infections classified by location in the body:
*[[Bacterial vaginosis]] is a disease of the vagina caused by an imbalance of naturally occurring bacterial flora and is often confused with [[yeast infection]] ([[candidiasis]]), or infection with ''[[Trichomonas vaginalis]]'' ([[trichomoniasis]]), which are not caused by [[bacteria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://women.webmd.com/features/is-it-yeast-infection |author=Terri Warren, RN |title=Is It a Yeast Infection? |year=2010 |accessdate=2011-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0029-7844(01)01759-8 |author=Ferris DG, Nyirjesy P, Sobel JD, Soper D, Pavletic A, Litaker MS |year=2002 |month=March |title=Over-the-counter antifungal drug misuse associated with patient-diagnosed vulvovaginal candidiasis |journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=99 |issue=3 |pages=419–425 |pmid=11864668 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Bacterial meningitis]] is a bacterial [[inflammation]] of the [[meninges]], that is, the protective membranes covering the [[brain]] and [[spinal cord]].
*[[Bacterial pneumonia]] is a bacterial infection of the [[lung]]s.
*[[Urinary tract infection]] is almost exclusively caused by bacteria. Symptoms include frequent feeling and/or need to urinate, pain during [[urination]], and cloudy urine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/urine_infection/page4.htm|title=Urinary Tract Infections|accessdate=2010-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main causal agent is ''[[Escherichia coli]]''. Although [[urine]] contains a variety of fluids, salts, and waste products, it does not usually have bacteria in it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.med.umich.edu/1libr/aha/aha_asybac_crs.htm|title=Adult Health Advisor 2005.4: Bacteria in Urine, No Symptoms (Asymptomatic Bacteriuria)|accessdate=2007-08-25|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070712060000/http://www.med.umich.edu/1libr/aha/aha_asybac_crs.htm|archivedate=2007-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but when bacteria get into the [[Urinary bladder|bladder]] or [[kidney]] and multiply in the urine, they may cause a UTI.
*[[Bacterial gastroenteritis]] is caused by pathogenic enteric bacteria. Such pathogenic enteric bacteria are generally distinguished from the usually harmless bacteria of the normal [[gut flora]], but the distinction is often not fully clear, and ''[[Escherichia]]'', for example, can belong to either group.
*Bacterial [[skin infection]]s include:
** [[Impetigo]] is a highly contagious [[bacteria]]l [[human skin|skin]] [[infection]] most common among pre-school children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Impetigo/Pages/Introduction.aspx NHS Impetigo]&lt;/ref&gt; It is primarily caused by ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', and sometimes by ''[[Streptococcus pyogenes]]''.&lt;ref name=Robbins&gt;Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson; &amp; Mitchell, Richard N. (2007). ''Robbins Basic Pathology'' (8th ed.). Saunders Elsevier. pp. 843 ISBN 978-1-4160-2973-1&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Erysipelas]] is an acute [[streptococcus]] [[bacteria]]l infection&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|three/000036667|erysipelas}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the deep epidermis with lymphatic spread.
** [[Cellulitis]] is a diffuse [[inflammation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|two/000019077|cellulitis}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[connective tissue]] with severe inflammation of dermal and subcutaneous layers of the [[skin]]. Cellulitis can be caused by normal [[skin flora]] or by [[exogenous bacteria]], and often occurs where the skin has previously been broken: cracks in the skin, cuts, [[blister]]s, [[burn (injury)|burns]], [[insect bite]]s, [[surgical wound]]s, intravenous [[drug injection]] or sites of [[intravenous]] [[catheter]] insertion.  Skin on the face or lower legs is most commonly affected by this infection, though cellulitis can occur on any part of the body.

==Treatment==
{{main|Antibiotics}}
:''See also [[Pathogenic bacteria#Clinical characteristics|overview list]] below''

Bacterial infections may be treated with [[antibiotic]]s, which are classified as [[bacteriocide|bacteriocidal]] if they kill bacteria, or [[bacteriostatic]] if they just prevent bacterial growth. There are many types of antibiotics and each class [[enzyme inhibitor|inhibits]] a process that is different in the pathogen from that found in the host. For example, the antibiotics [[chloramphenicol]] and [[tetracyclin]] inhibit the bacterial [[ribosome]], but not the structurally-different eukaryotic ribosome, and so exhibit selective toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Yonath A, Bashan A | title = Ribosomal crystallography: initiation, peptide bond formation, and amino acid polymerization are hampered by antibiotics |journal=Annu Rev Microbiol |volume=58 |pages=233–51 |year=2004 |pmid=15487937 |doi=10.1146/annurev.micro.58.030603.123822}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antibiotics are used both in treating human disease and in [[intensive farming]] to promote animal growth. Both uses may be contributing to the rapid development of [[antibiotic resistance]] in bacterial populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Khachatourians GG |title=Agricultural use of antibiotics and the evolution and transfer of antibiotic-resistant bacteria |journal=CMAJ |volume=159 |issue=9 |pages=1129–36 |year=1998 |month=November |pmid=9835883 |pmc=1229782 |doi= |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/pmidlookup?view=reprint&amp;pmid=9835883}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infections can be prevented by [[antiseptic]] measures such as sterilizing the skin prior to piercing it with the needle of a syringe, and by proper care of indwelling catheters. Surgical and dental instruments are also [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilized]] to prevent infection by bacteria. [[Disinfectants]] such as [[bleach]] are used to kill bacteria or other pathogens on surfaces to prevent contamination and further reduce the risk of infection. Most bacteria in food are killed by cooking to temperatures above 73 °C (163°F).

==Overview==
Section 212 creates 13 separate indictable offences related to facilitating prostitution and similar offences.
==Legislation==
{{Quotation|
'''Procuring'''&lt;br&gt;
212. (1) Every one who
:(a) procures, attempts to procure or solicits a person to have illicit sexual intercourse with another person, whether in or out of Canada,
:(b) inveigles or entices a person who is not a prostitute to a common bawdy-house for the purpose of illicit sexual intercourse or prostitution,
:(c) knowingly conceals a person in a common bawdy-house,
:(d) procures or attempts to procure a person to become, whether in or out of Canada, a prostitute,

:(f) on the arrival of a person in Canada, directs or causes that person to be directed or takes or causes that person to be taken, to a common bawdy-house,
:(g) procures a person to enter or leave Canada, for the purpose of prostitution,
:(h) for the purposes of gain, exercises control, direction or influence over the movements of a person in such manner as to show that he is aiding, abetting or compelling that person to engage in or carry on prostitution with any person or generally,
:(i) applies or administers to a person or causes that person to take any drug, intoxicating liquor, matter or thing with intent to stupefy or overpower that person in order thereby to enable any person to have illicit sexual intercourse with that person, or
:(j) lives wholly or in part on the avails of prostitution of another person,&lt;br&gt;

is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Living on the avails of prostitution of person under eighteen'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) Despite paragraph (1)(j), every person who lives wholly or in part on the avails of prostitution of another person who is under the age of eighteen years is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of two years.
&lt;br&gt;
Aggravated offence in relation to living on the avails of prostitution of a person under the age of eighteen years&lt;br&gt;
(2.1) Notwithstanding paragraph (1)(j) and subsection (2), every person who lives wholly or in part on the avails of prostitution of another person under the age of eighteen years, and who
:(a) for the purposes of profit, aids, abets, counsels or compels the person under that age to engage in or carry on prostitution with any person or generally, and
:(b) uses, threatens to use or attempts to use violence, intimidation or coercion in relation to the person under that age,&lt;br&gt;

is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years but not less than five years.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Presumption'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) Evidence that a person lives with or is habitually in the company of a prostitute or lives in a common bawdy-house is, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, proof that the person lives on the avails of prostitution, for the purposes of paragraph (1)(j) and subsections (2) and (2.1).
&lt;br&gt;
'''Offence — prostitution of person under eighteen'''&lt;br&gt;
(4) Every person who, in any place, obtains for consideration, or communicates with anyone for the purpose of obtaining for consideration, the sexual services of a person who is under the age of eighteen years is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of six months.
&lt;br&gt;

==Proof of the Offence==
'''Procuring Sex for Another (212(1)(a))'''&lt;br&gt;

'''Inveigle or Entice (212(1)(b))'''&lt;br&gt;

'''Conceal in Bawdy-house (212(1)(c))'''&lt;br&gt;

'''Procuring a Prostitute (212(1)(d))'''&lt;br&gt;

'''Procuring another to a bawdy-house (212(1)(e))'''&lt;br&gt;

'''Procuring person arriving in Canada (212(1)(f))'''&lt;br&gt;

'''Procuring another to enter or leave Canada (212(1)(g))'''&lt;br&gt;

'''Control or Influence in Prostitution (212(1)(h))'''&lt;br&gt;

'''Overpowering or Stupefying Another to Enable Sex (212(1)(i))'''&lt;br&gt;

'''Living on Avails of Prostitution (212(1)(j))'''&lt;br&gt;

'''Living on Avails of Under-age Prostitute (212(2))'''&lt;br&gt;

'''Living on Avails of Under-age Prostitute with Violence (212(2.1))'''&lt;br&gt;

'''Obtains Sex of Under-age Prostitute 212(4)'''&lt;br&gt; 

==Interpretation==
&quot;Living-on-the-avails&quot; does not require the Crown to prove there was coercion.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Barrow, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fbvw 2001 CanLII 8550 (ON CA)] at 31&lt;/ref&gt;

Under s. 197, a &quot;prostitute&quot; &quot;means a person of either sex who engages in prostitution&quot;

Under s. 197, a &quot;place&quot; &quot;includes any place, whether or not (a) it is covered or enclosed, (b) it is used permanently or temporarily, or (c) any person has an exclusive right of user with respect to it;&quot;

{{reflist|2}}

===Living on Avails===
Section 212(1)(j) was found to be arbitrary, overbroad, and disproportionate to the provisions objectives and so violates s. 7 of the Charter.&lt;ref&gt;
Canada (Attorney General) v. Bedford, [http://canlii.ca/t/fqqwq 2012 ONCA 186] appeal to SCC pending&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 212(3) creates a presumption for those who are found to live in a common bawdy-house or lives with or is habitually in the company of a prostitute is living on the avails of prostitution. This section violates the presumption of innocence but is within a reasonable limit and is constitutionally valid.&lt;ref&gt; R v Downey, [1992] 2 SCR 10&lt;/reF&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

=== Under-age Prostitutes===
Soliciting under s.213 is not a lesser included offence to the offence under s. 212(4).&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Amabile (2000), 143 CCC (3d) 270 (BCCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not necessary that the prostitute solicited by the accused be a real person.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Kerster, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fm00 2001 BCSC 230] at para 41 (NB: concerned an earlier version of s. 212(4))&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|
'''Bestiality'''&lt;Br&gt;
160. (1) Every person who commits bestiality is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years or is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Compelling the commission of bestiality'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) Every person who compels another to commit bestiality is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years or is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Bestiality in presence of or by child'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) Despite subsection (1), every person who commits bestiality in the presence of a person under the age of 16 years, or who incites a person under the age of 16 years to commit bestiality,
:(a) is guilty of an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term of not more than 10 years and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of one year; or
:(b) is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction and is liable to imprisonment for a term of not more than two years less a day and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of six months.

}}


==Proof of the Offence==
In addition to the essential elements of time, location, and identity, the prosecution should prove the following: 
# the accused performs vaginal or anal intercourse with an animal 

==Interpretation==
“Bestiality” has generally required that there be penetrative sex, either vaginal or anal with an animal. It does not include sexual acts involving genital touching or oral sex.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Ruvinsky [1998] O.J. No. 3621 (&quot;[i]n my respectful opinion, &quot;bestiality&quot; is anal or vaginal intercourse with an animal, by a man or a woman. ... I do not believe that it is my role to expand the definition of this offence to include genital touching or licking. That responsibility lies with Parliament, who in their wisdom, have to date not defined the offence.&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
See also R v M.C. [2002] JQ No 8055, [http://canlii.ca/t/1c0kf 2002 CanLII 45200]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
==History==
On August 9, 2012, section 160(3) was amended to increase the penalties from a hybrid offence with no minimums to a hybrid offence with minimums of 6 months on summary conviction and 1 year on indictable election. The maximum on the summary election was increased to 2 years less a day.

==Proof of the Offence==
The Crown must prove that:&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Labaye [http://canlii.ca/t/1m76r 2005 SCC 80] (CanLII), [2005] 3 SCR 728 at para. 62&lt;/ref&gt;
# the accused's conduct, by its nature, caused harm or presented a significant risk of harm to individuals or society 
# the risk was in a way that undermined or threatened to undermine a value reflected in and formally endorsed by the Constitution or other fundamental laws by
## confronting members of the public with conduct that significantly interferes with their autonomy and liberty; or
## predisposing others to anti-social behaviour; or
## physically or psychologically harming persons involved in the conduct, and
# the harm or risk of harm is of a degree that is incompatible with the proper functioning of society.

==Interpretation==
The categories of harm is not a closed list.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Identity Theft and Identity Fraud'''&lt;Br&gt;
...&lt;br&gt;
'''Identity theft'''&lt;br&gt;
402.2 (1) Everyone commits an offence who knowingly obtains or possesses another person’s identity information in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable inference that the information is intended to be used to commit an indictable offence that includes fraud, deceit or falsehood as an element of the offence.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Trafficking in identity information'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) Everyone commits an offence who transmits, makes available, distributes, sells or offers for sale another person’s identity information, or has it in their possession for any of those purposes, knowing that or being reckless as to whether the information will be used to commit an indictable offence that includes fraud, deceit or falsehood as an element of the offence.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Clarification'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) For the purposes of subsections (1) and (2), an indictable offence referred to in either of those subsections includes an offence under any of the following sections:
:(a) section 57 (forgery of or uttering forged passport);
:(b) section 58 (fraudulent use of certificate of citizenship);
:(c) section 130 (personating peace officer);
:(d) section 131 (perjury);
:(e) section 342 (theft, forgery, etc., of credit card);

'''Jurisdiction'''&lt;Br&gt;
(4) An accused who is charged with an offence under subsection (1) or (2) may be tried and punished by any court having jurisdiction to try that offence in the place where the offence is alleged to have been committed or in the place where the accused is found, is arrested or is in custody. However, no proceeding in respect of the offence shall be commenced in a province without the consent of the Attorney General of that province if the offence is alleged to have been committed outside that province.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Punishment'''&lt;br&gt;
(5) Everyone who commits an offence under subsection (1) or (2)
:(a) is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term of not more than five years; or

&lt;br&gt;
'''Punishment'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) Everyone who commits an offence under subsection (1)
:(a) is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term of not more than 10 years; or

==Proof of the Offence==
Sections 402.2 and 403 outline three offences. 

In addition to the essential elements of time, location, and identity, the crown should prove the following for each offence:

'''Identity Theft'''&lt;br&gt;
# the accused obtained or possessed another persons' identity information
# the accused intended to use the information to to commit an indictable offence that includes fraud, deceit or falsehood as an element of the offence.

'''Trafficking in Identity Information'''&lt;br&gt;
# the accused did at least one of the prohibited acts of:
## transmitting;
## making available;
## distributing;
## selling; or 
## offering 
# the subject matter is another persons' identity information &lt;br&gt;
''or''
# possesses another persons' identity information for the purpose of committing at least one of the prohibited acts above
# the accused knew or was reckless as to whether it would be used to commit an indictable offence that includes fraud, deceit or falsehood as an element of the offence.

'''Identity Fraud'''&lt;br&gt;
# the accused personated another person
# the person was either living or dead
# the personation was in a fraudulent manner
# the personation was with the intent to do any of the following:
##to gain advantage for themselves or another person;
##to obtain any property or an interest in any property;
##to cause disadvantage to the person being personated or another person; or
##to avoid arrest or prosecution or to obstruct, pervert or defeat the course of justice.

* here is a really useful article on what happened. I really like the web of connections on the first page- maybe we could include it as a visual http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-14846456

4/9/12
* Worked as a group to edit and re-organize background section
*by next Monday: go over case studies for structure ideas and look at professional ethics book for lesson ideas
*try to establish timeline

5/5/12
*Mary worked out formatting stuff for quotes, etc.
*timeline is likely done
*Kate did basic references for the timeline section; did not name references or check for duplicates.  Decided this could be done once they're all in.
*Mary and Kate decided they missed Hannah and she needs to come back from Florida

*Hannah forgot to sign in this morning (started ~ one hour before realizing i wasn't signed in). I was working on the Cast of Characters and am planning on removing a large portion of text under NoW because it can just be cross referenced.

*Mary, Kate and Hannah all contributed equal efforts in completing this assignment. Sometimes we would work on the same computer or forget to sign in, which may skew the records for how much a person worked on the wikichapter.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
Section 2 of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act states:
{{quotation|
'''Definitions'''&lt;br&gt;
2. (1) In this Act,
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;p&gt;
“traffic” means, in respect of a substance included in any of Schedules I to IV,
:(a) to sell, administer, give, transfer, transport, send or deliver the substance,
:(b) to sell an authorization to obtain the substance, or
:(c) to offer to do anything mentioned in paragraph (a) or (b), otherwise than under the authority of the regulations.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vtc#sec2 CDSA]}}

{{reflist|2}}
==Offer to Sell==
Trafficking by offer under s. 2(2)(c) only requires that the crown prove an intent to make the offer. It is not necessary to prove that the accused had an intent to follow through with the offer.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Mamchur, [1978] 3 WWR 481 (SKCA) at p. 483&lt;br&gt;
R v Jones, (1988) 74 Sask R. 4 (SKCA) at 10&lt;Br&gt;  
R. v. Campbell, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fqp4 1999 CanLII 676] (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 565 at 25&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Murdock [http://canlii.ca/t/6mdj 2003 CanLII 4306] (ON CA), (2003), 176 C.C.C. (3d) 232 at 14&lt;br&gt;
R v Crain, [http://canlii.ca/t/fpw5n 2012 SKCA 8]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; 
As such, there is no need to prove that the accused had drugs on themselves at the time or was capable of fulfilling the request.&lt;ref&gt;
e.g. R. v. Petrie, [1947] O.W.N. 601 (C.A.) -- drugs offered weren’t available;&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Murdock, supra -- offer was withdrawn &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Sherman, [1977] 5 W.W.R. 283 (B.C.C.A.) -- offer was made for purpose of ripping buyer off&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Reid [http://canlii.ca/t/1mmhl 1996 CanLII 5213], (1996), 155 N.S.R. (2d) 368 (NSCA) -- no evidence that drugs were even available to seller&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Brown (1953), 9 W.W.R. (N.S.) 701 (B.C.C.A.) -- drugs not on the seller&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; 
{{reflist|2}}

==Opinion Evidence on Trafficking==
To prove that someone was in possession of a controlled substance ''for the purpose of trafficking'', the Crown must call expert evidence to given an opinion that the circumstances allow for the inference that the possessor intended to traffick.

See also: [[Canadian Criminal Evidence/Opinion/Expert Evidence]] for details on the law of expert evidence.
{{reflist|2}}

==Evidence of Intent==

'''Amount of drugs'''&lt;br&gt;
Trafficking can be inferred where the quantity/purity/value of drugs is high.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Le, [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/2001/2001bcca658/2001bcca658.html 2001 BCCA 658]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Adelberg, [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/2001/2001bcca637/2001bcca637.html 2001 BCCA 637]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. L'Huillier, [http://www.canlii.org/en/nb/nbqb/doc/1997/1997canlii9606/1997canlii9606.html  1997 CanLII 9606 (NB Q.B.)]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Falahatchian, [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1995/1995canlii941/1995canlii941.html 1995 CanLII 941 (ON C.A.)]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Naugler,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abca/doc/1994/1994abca110/1994abca110.html 1994 ABCA 110]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Where an accused is a user of drugs, there may be evidence suggestive that the drugs found in their possession may be consistent with personal use as opposed to trafficking. The amounts required to maintain the addiction and the habits of typical users are relevant. Either party is permitted to lead evidence concerning typical use, however, this usually takes the form of expert evidence.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Petavel, [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcsc/doc/2006/2006bcsc1931/2006bcsc1931.html 2006 BCSC 1931]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The amount of drugs ''alone'' cannot be used to establish trafficking.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. McCallum [http://canlii.ca/t/1nw48 2006 SKQB 287] (CanLII), (2006), 281 Sask.R. 272 at 28&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Mehari, [http://canlii.ca/t/25039 2009 ABPC 217] at 7&lt;/ref&gt;

Marijuana amounts in the range of 3 pounds have been found to be unreasonable to be considered consumable for personal use.
&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Brophy (W.) (1971), 3 N.B.R.(2d) 594 (CA)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Money'''&lt;br&gt;
Large quantities of unexplained wealth can allow a judge to lead to the conclusion of trafficking. This is particularly true where cash is in small denominations and is found near drugs.&lt;ref&gt; 
R. v. Alberts, [http://canlii.ca/t/1f9d9 1999 CanLII 2246] (ON C.A.)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Le, [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/2001/2001bcca694/2001bcca694.html 2001 BCCA 694]
&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Packaging'''&lt;br&gt;
Where packaging is found this may allow a judge to infer an intent to traffick. Packaging in numerous quantities, such as numerous  small baggies, can create such an inference. &lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Scott, [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2003/2003canlii27446/2003canlii27446.html 2003 CanLII 27446 (ON S.C.)]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Kwok, [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/2002/2002bcca177/2002bcca177.html 2002 BCCA 177] &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Petavel, [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcsc/doc/2006/2006bcsc1931/2006bcsc1931.html 2006 BCSC 1931]
&lt;/ref&gt;
{{reflist|2}}

==Dial-a-Dope operations==
A Dial-a-Dope operation is the manner in which drugs are often distributed to their customers. The seller and buyer will contact each other by phone and arrange to make an exchange at a pre-determined location.

The Crown will often adduce evidence to argue that the evidence suggests that such an operation was undertaken. This is determined by expert opinion of the evidence suggestive of such an operation.

Several cases have considered the methods of a dial-a-dope operation.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Franklyn, [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcsc/doc/2001/2001bcsc706/2001bcsc706.html 2001 BCSC 706]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Tran, [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/2007/2007bcca613/2007bcca613.html 2007 BCCA 613]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Tetreault, [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcsc/doc/2008/2008bcsc412/2008bcsc412.html 2008 BCSC 412] -- Acquitted&lt;br&gt;

==Proof of the Offence==
There are three offences relating to Defamatory Libel. The Crown will generally prove the following for each offence:

'''Publishing Defamatory Libel Known to be False'''&lt;Br&gt;
# identity of the accused as the culprit
# the jurisdiction of the incident
# the time and date of the incident
# the accused publishes materials
# the materials is defamatory libel
# accused knows the materials is false

'''Publishing Defamatory Libel'''&lt;Br&gt;
# identity of the accused as the culprit
# the jurisdiction of the incident
# the time and date of the incident
# accused publishes materials
# the materials is defamatory libel

'''Extortion by Libel'''&lt;Br&gt;
# identity of the accused as the culprit
# the jurisdiction of the incident
# the time and date of the incident
# accused does any one of the prohibited conduct:
## publishes, 
##threatens to publish, 
##offers to abstain from publishing, or
##offers to prevent the publishing 
# the subject matter of publishing is defamatory libel
# accused intended to either
##extort money from any person ''or'' 
##induce the person to confer on or procure for another person an appointment or office of profit or trust.

==Interpretation==

The offence of publishing defamatory libel under s. 301 is of no force and effect as it violates s. 2 of the Charter is not savable under s. 1 of the Charter.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Lucas (1995) 129 Sask R 53 (QB)&lt;Br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Seizure of Things Not Specified==
Section 489 authorizes police officers to seize certain property. It specifically addresses the situation where police seek to seize property other than what is specified in the warrant.

{{quotation|
'''Seizure of things not specified'''&lt;br&gt;
489. (1) Every person who executes a warrant may seize, in addition to the things mentioned in the warrant, any thing that the person believes on reasonable grounds
:(a) has been obtained by the commission of an offence against this or any other Act of Parliament;
:(b) has been used in the commission of an offence against this or any other Act of Parliament; or
:(c) will afford evidence in respect of an offence against this or any other Act of Parliament.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Seizure without warrant'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) Every peace officer, and every public officer who has been appointed or designated to administer or enforce any federal or provincial law and whose duties include the enforcement of this or any other Act of Parliament, who is lawfully present in a place pursuant to a warrant or otherwise in the execution of duties may, without a warrant, seize any thing that the officer believes on reasonable grounds
:(a) has been obtained by the commission of an offence against this or any other Act of Parliament;
:(b) has been used in the commission of an offence against this or any other Act of Parliament; or
:(c) will afford evidence in respect of an offence against this or any other Act of Parliament.
&lt;P&gt;
R.S., 1985, c. C-46, s. 489; R.S., 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 72, c. 42 (4th Supp.), s. 3; 1993, c. 40, s. 16; 1997, c. 18, s. 48.
|[http://www.canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec489 CCC]
}}

Under s. 489, a peace officer in lawful execution of their duty may seize anything without a warrant that they reasonably believe to be:
# obtained by crime;
# used in a crime; or
# affords evidence of a crime.

All items that are seized must be reported to a justice of the peace pursuant to s. 489.1. The justice of the peace will grant a detention order for a period of time. The property must be returned on the expiration of the order unless the justice grants an extension under s. 490(1) or if charges are laid.

This section does not codify or incorporate any part of the common law doctrine of &quot;plain view&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Bottineau, [http://canlii.ca/t/fkgld 2011 ONCA 194] (CanLII)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Procedure Upon Seizure of Property==
Section 489.1 governs the procedure to be followed by the police upon seizing property, whether under warrant, warrantless, or otherwise under an Act of Parliament including s. 489. This applies to seizure on search incident to arrest as well as seizure incidental to a search warrant.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Backhouse, [http://canlii.ca/t/1jvwn 2005 CanLII 4937] (ON CA)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|
489.1 (1) Subject to this or any other Act of Parliament, where a peace officer has seized anything under a warrant issued under this Act or under section 487.11 or 489 or otherwise in the execution of duties under this or any other Act of Parliament, the peace officer shall, as soon as is practicable,
:(a) where the peace officer is satisfied,
::(i) that there is no dispute as to who is lawfully entitled to possession of the thing seized, and
::(ii) that the continued detention of the thing seized is not required for the purposes of any investigation or a preliminary inquiry, trial or other proceeding,
&lt;P&gt;
return the thing seized ... to the person lawfully entitled to its possession and report to the justice who issued the warrant ... or, if no warrant was issued, a justice having jurisdiction in respect of the matter, that he has done so; or
:(b) where the peace officer is not satisfied as described in subparagraphs (a)(i) and (ii),
::(i) bring the thing seized before the justice referred to in paragraph (a), or
::(ii) report to the justice that he has seized the thing and is detaining it or causing it to be detained
&lt;P&gt;
to be dealt with by the justice in accordance with subsection 490(1).
...
&lt;P&gt;
'''Form'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) A report to a justice under this section shall be in the form set out as Form 5.2 in Part XXVIII, varied to suit the case...
&lt;P&gt;
R.S., 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 72; 1993, c. 40, s. 17; 1997, c. 18, s. 49.
|[http://www.canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec489.1 CCC]
}}

Under s. 489.1(1)(b)(ii), where the police seize property either in execution of a warrant or otherwise in execution of their duties, they must file a Report to Justice that is filed with the justice of the peace.

This will permit the officer to hold onto the property for a period of 90 days without laying charges. Where further time is needed the officer must apply for a further detention order under s. 490.

{{reflist|2}}
===Inventory Searches===
Seizure of property will create an authority to perform a warrantless search the items seized for the purpose itemizing them and ensuring safe keeping. It cannot be searched for the purpose of advancing an investigation.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Adam [http://canlii.ca/t/fr1p8 2012 ABPC 77]&lt;br&gt; 
R v Wint [http://canlii.ca/t/225zz 2009 ONCA 52]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Detention Order==
Section 490 governs the procedure for detaining property seized under s. 489 or 489.1, including obtaining the approval of justice to detain the property for a period of time.

An order can be made by a justice of the peace to allow the police to detain property under s.490(1):

{{quotation|
'''Detention of things seized'''&lt;br&gt;
490. (1) Subject to this or any other Act of Parliament, where, pursuant to paragraph 489.1(1)(b) or subsection 489.1(2), anything that has been seized is brought before a justice or a report in respect of anything seized is made to a justice, the justice shall,
:(a) where the lawful owner or person who is lawfully entitled to possession of the thing seized is known, order it to be returned to that owner or person, unless the prosecutor, or the peace officer or other person having custody of the thing seized, satisfies the justice that the detention of the thing seized is required for the purposes of any investigation or a preliminary inquiry, trial or other proceeding; or
:(b) where the prosecutor, or the peace officer or other person having custody of the thing seized, satisfies the justice that the thing seized should be detained for a reason set out in paragraph (a), detain the thing seized or order that it be detained, taking reasonable care to ensure that it is preserved until the conclusion of any investigation or until it is required to be produced for the purposes of a preliminary inquiry, trial or other proceeding.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec490 CCC]
}}

Section 489.1 and 490, together set out an administrative scheme for managing detained property in the course of a criminal investigation as well as returning property.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Mann, [http://canlii.ca/t/fsdzc 2012 BCSC 1247] (CanLII) at para. 71 and 83&lt;/ref&gt;

These provisions establish &quot;a predictable, fair, efficient, and orderly procedure for the detention, retention, return, and forfeiture of seized items, consistent with the interests of justice.&quot; Non-compliance is not to be translated into &quot;substantive trial remedies&quot; such as a stay of proceedings. Failure to comply may result in the return of the property. However, &quot;may 
not make such an order if it is not in the interests of justice to do so.&quot;
&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Mann, [http://canlii.ca/t/fsdzc 2012 BCSC 1247] (CanLII) at para. 83&lt;br&gt;
see also R. v. Arason (1992), 21 B.C.A.C. 20 (Report to Justice is “an administrative procedure to be carried out after the completion of a search. Non compliance with it ought not to affect the validity of the search itself.&quot;&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Berube [http://canlii.ca/t/1mvr2 1999 CanLII 13241] (QC CA), (1999), 139 C.C.C. (3d) 304 (Que.C.A.) : late filing was a technicality and not enough to invalidate search&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Karim, [http://canlii.ca/t/fs5p1 2012 ABQB 470] (&quot;I can think of no [...] situation in our criminal law where a lawful act that meets the requirements of the Charter, ...can subsequently become non Charter compliant because of another action separated by time.&quot;) 
&lt;/ref&gt;

Other courts have suggested that a failure to comply with the provisions, in particular, make a filing under s.489.1, will render the search unlawful.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Guiller, (1985) 25 CRR 273 (Ont. Dist.Ct.): evidence excluded under s.24(2)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Noseworthy, [1995] O.J. No. 1759, [http://canlii.ca/t/1wctm 1995 CanLII 7425] (ON SC) (Ont. Ct. Jus G.D.)&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Macneil [http://canlii.ca/t/1nh1d 1994 CanLII 4314] (NS SC), (1994), 130 N.S.R. (2d) 202 (N.S.S.C)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; 

Still other courts have been reluctant to provide trial remedies.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Martens, [http://canlii.ca/t/1j2gw 2004 BCSC 1450] (CanLII) at para. 264&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Valiquette, [http://canlii.ca/t/2d4b8 2010 BCSC 1423] (CanLII)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Patterson, [http://canlii.ca/t/fqcwl 2011 BCSC 1728] (CanLII)&lt;/ref&gt;

The obligations imposed by s. 489.1 and 490 are mandatory.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Pickton, [http://canlii.ca/t/2c72m 2006 BCSC 1098] at para 60&lt;/ref&gt;

These provisions &quot;safeguard in the balance between the state’s jurisdiction to invade the privacy rights of citizens and the high value that Parliament and the courts have seen fit to ascribe to those rights&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Pickton, [http://canlii.ca/t/2c72m 2006 BCSC 1098] at para 60&lt;/ref&gt;

The onus is on the applicant to prove on a balance of probabilities that the provisions were not complied with.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Mann, [http://canlii.ca/t/fsdzc 2012 BCSC 1247] (CanLII) at para. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

Once property has been detained under s. 490, it is considered &quot;under the control of the court, not the Crown or anyone else.&quot; Thus, can only be disposed of pursuant to an order of the court.
&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Bellefleur, [1992] S.J. No. 473 (Q.B.)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Extending Time Period of Detention==
Under [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec490 s. 490(2)], all property that is seized by police must be released after the detention period. That is, unless there are proceedings &quot;instituted in which the thing detained may be required.&quot; (s. 490(2)(b)) This would include criminal charges where the thing may be part of the evidence for trial.

Under s. 490(2)(a), the party may apply to have property seized pursuant to s. 490(1) detained past the time limit where &quot;a justice, on the making of a summary application to him after three clear days notice thereof to the person from whom the thing detained was seized, is satisfied that, having regard to the nature of the investigation, its further detention for a specified period is warranted and the justice so orders&quot;

==Release and Return of Property==
A Superior Court Justice has inherent jurisdiction to order the return of property seized by the police where the items are not needed for trial and otherwise not needed to be held by the police. &lt;ref&gt;see Butler v. Canada (Attorney General), [http://canlii.ca/t/23m2v 1981 CanLII 373] (BC SC)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Access to Exhibits==
===Release of Exhibits for Testing===
All objects that are put in as exhibits before the court may be released for the purpose of testing on application of a party.

Section 605 states:
{{Quotation|
'''Release of exhibits for testing'''&lt;br&gt;
605. (1) A judge of a superior court of criminal jurisdiction or a court of criminal jurisdiction may, on summary application on behalf of the accused or the prosecutor, after three days notice to the accused or prosecutor, as the case may be, order the release of any exhibit for the purpose of a scientific or other test or examination, subject to such terms as appear to be necessary or desirable to ensure the safeguarding of the exhibit and its preservation for use at the trial.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Disobeying orders'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) Every one who fails to comply with the terms of an order made under subsection (1) is guilty of contempt of court and may be dealt with summarily by the judge or provincial court judge who made the order or before whom the trial of the accused takes place.
&lt;P&gt;
R.S., 1985, c. C-46, s. 605; R.S., 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 203.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec605 CCC]
}}

The application may be made before either a superior court judge or a provincial court judge on three days notice.

Once the proceedings are complete and all avenues of appeal are exhausted this section no longer applies to exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;
e.g. R. v. Horne, [http://canlii.ca/t/5nts 1999 ABQB 754] (CanLII) at para. 34&lt;bR&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Media Access to Exhibits===
The right to access to exhibits flows from the &quot;open court principle&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, [http://canlii.ca/t/2d4c5 2010 ONCA 726] (CanLII)
&lt;/ref&gt;

Dagenais/Mentuck test should apply to requests of third-parties to access exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;
Canadian Broadcasting Corporation&lt;/ref&gt;

The test requires the party opposing access to show that it is &quot;necessary to prevent a serious risk to the proper administration of justice and that the salutary effects of the order sought outweigh the deleterious effects on the rights and interests of the parties and the public.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;

Under [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec117.02 s.117.02], an officer believes that a firearm or related item&lt;ref&gt; a prohibited device, any ammunition, any prohibited ammunition or an explosive substance&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;was used in the commission of an offence&quot; or where there was, or is ongoing, an offence where the subject-matter is a firearm or related item&lt;ref&gt;firearm, an imitation firearm, a cross-bow, a prohibited weapon, a restricted weapon, a prohibited device, ammunition, prohibited ammunition or an explosive substance&lt;/ref&gt; and the officer believes the item &quot;is likely to be found on a person, in a vehicle or in any place or premises other than a dwelling-house&quot;, then the officer may search the premises or person without a warrant, so long as it under exigent circumstances where it &quot;would not be practicable to obtain a warrant&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
see also s 487, 487.11&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
====Failure to Produce Authorization====
Under [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec117.03 s. 117.03], where a person is found in possession of a firearm or related items and cannot produce the appropriate documents authorizing them to possess it, an officer may seize the items. If the proper documentation is produced within 14 days, the officer must return the items seized. If 14 days pass without producing the authorization, the officer may apply to the court to have the firearm forfeited.

====Danger to self or public====
Under s.117.04, an officer may seize a firearm from someone in lawful possession of it where the officer believes he may pose a danger to themselves or the public. A warrant is required unless there are exigent circumstances such that &quot;by reason of a possible danger to the safety of that person or any other person, it would not be practicable to obtain a warrant&quot;.(s. 117.04(2)) 

Under s.117.05, the officer may apply to forfeit the firearm after 30 days where it can be established that forfeiture is in the &quot;interests of the safety of the person&quot;. (see [[Canadian_Criminal_Sentencing/Ancillary_Orders/Forfeiture#interests_of_the_safety]])

[[File:Arcimboldo Librarian Stokholm.jpg|thumb|''The Librarian'', a 1556 painting by [[wikipedia:Giuseppe Arcimboldo|Giuseppe Arcimboldo]]]]
Cataloging is the process of adding an item to a catalog, a process typically including bibliographic description, subject analysis, and classification.  Cataloging has a rich history of practice, which can provide valuable lessons for many of today's information workers, from metadata specialists to reference librarians.  A basic understanding of cataloging is highly beneficial for library employees, library users wishing to improve their catalog searching skills, and anybody interested in metadata.  This textbook aims to provide a practical and engaging introduction to Cataloging and Classification, with numerous examples taken from public domain and freely licensed catalogs, such as those of the [http://explore.bl.uk/ British Library], [http://hollis.harvard.edu/ Harvard University] and the [http://www.uflib.ufl.edu/ University of Florida Smathers Libraries].

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Cutter's Objectives==
What's the point of a catalog?  For [[wikipedia:Charles Ammi Cutter|Charles Ammi Cutter]] (1837-1903), an important pioneer in the field of cataloging, the catalog exists to help library users find books.  In his ''Rules for a Dictionary Catalog'', Cutter identified specific &quot;objects&quot; that a catalog to fulfill.  When a user is trying to find a book, Cutter says, they will want the catalog to help them in at least one of the following ways.

#To enable a person to find a book of which either...
## ...the ''author'',
## ...the ''title'', or
## ...the ''subject'' is known
# To show what the library has...
## ...by a given ''author'',
## ...on a given ''subject'', or
## ...in a given ''kind of literature''.
# To assist in the choice of a book...
## ...as to its ''edition'' (bibliographically), or
## ...as to its ''character'' (literary or topical).

===Legacy of Cutter's Objectives===
Cutter's Objectives, in somewhat modified forms, have influenced the development of cataloging practices greatly.  The objectives are certainly useful, but also have their limitations.  One critique can be found in Hope Olson's ''The Power to Name''.

==AACR2's Eight Areas of Description==
AACR2 1.0B1 lists eight areas of description:
# Title and statement of responsibility (MARC field 245)
# Edition (MARC field 250)
# Material (or type of publication) specific details (not used for monographs)
# Publication, distribution, etc. (MARC field 260)
# Physical description (MARC field 300)
# Series (MARC fields 4xx)
# Note (MARC fields 5xx)
# Standard number (MARC fields 0xx) and terms of availability

      <comment>/* Limitations of MARC */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">In 1901, the Library of Congress began selling catalog cards to other libraries.  Rather than paying local catalogers to create catalog cards for items in their collections, these libraries could simply use cards created by the Library of Congress.  The service led to a standardization of cataloging, and this sharing of bibliographic records can be seen to this days in cooperative cataloging programs such as OCLC.

In the 1960s, the Library of Congress developed a format to automate the production of these catalog cards.  This format, Machine-Readable Cataloging (MARC), is still widely used today as the basis for most library catalogs.  Though the use of such an old data format has frequently been critiqued, no clear successor to MARC has been identified, and the costs of converting thousands or millions of MARC records to a new format would be substantial.  In 2011, the Library of Congress released a [http://www.loc.gov/marc/transition/news/framework-051311.html statement] indicating that it was exploring alternatives to MARC. 

==What is a MARC record?==


Each MARC record is composed of a leader, a directory, and several fields.  The leader occurs at the very beginning of a record, and gives the system information about how to process the record.  The directory is a computer-generated number that a cataloger typically never sees, telling the system where in a file each field starts and ends.  The fields are character strings that contain data about the item being cataloged.

Each field starts with a ''tag'' -- a three-digit number that conveys ''what kind'' information is being stored (e.g. title, note, table of contents).  Depending on the tag, it may be followed by one or two ''indicators'' -- numbers or letters that tell what ''flavor''  or ''form'' the information will take (e.g. will the person's name start with the last name or the first name? Is a 520 summary field specifically an abstract or a review?).  Finally comes the actual information itself, which may be presented in one piece, or split up into separate ''subfields''.

At first, tags may seem like completely arbitrary numbers, but there are some useful patterns in the MARC bibliographic record format that may help you remember them.  Numbers starting with a 6 (the 6xx, in cataloging lingo) will always be subjects, and numbers starting with a 1 (1xx) will always be main entries.  A tag ending in 00 will likely refer to a person's name, so a 100 is going to contain the name of a person who is the main entry (the primary author, in the case of books), and a 600 will contain the name of a person who is the subject of the item (the subject of a biography, for instance).  Here are some handy things to remember:

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;

==Limitations of MARC==
1. MARC is virtually unknown outside of libraries. 
2. MARC’s size limitations and its inability to convey complex relationships among entities.
3. inability to embed related objects in the record (book cover).
4.It’s computerized catalogue systems,shortage of manpower to design and operate machine-readable catalogues. 
5. many have suggested that an XML schema should replace MARC

'''Swine influenza''', also called '''pig influenza''', '''swine flu''', '''hog flu''' and '''pig flu''', is an infection by any one of several types of swine influenza [[virus]]es. '''Swine influenza virus''' ('''SIV''') or '''swine-origin influenza virus''' ('''S-OIV''' ) is any strain of the [[Orthomyxoviridae|influenza family of viruses]] that is [[endemism|endemic]] in [[pig]]s.&lt;ref name=Merck&gt;{{Cite journal
|url=http://www.merckvetmanual.com/mvm/index.jsp?cfile=htm/bc/121407.htm
|title=Swine influenza|journal=The Merck Veterinary Manual
|year=2008|accessdate=April 30, 2009
|isbn=1442167424}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2009, the known SIV strains include [[Influenzavirus C|influenza C]] and the subtypes of [[Influenza A Virus|influenza A]] known as [[H1N1]], [[H1N2]], H2N1, [[H3N1]], [[H3N2]], and [[H2N3]].

Swine influenza virus is common throughout pig populations worldwide. Transmission of the virus from pigs to humans is not common and does not always lead to [[human flu]], often resulting only in the production of [[antibody|antibodies]] in the blood. If transmission does cause human flu, it is called [[zoonosis|zoonotic]] swine flu. People with regular exposure to pigs are at increased risk of swine flu infection.

During the mid-20th century, identification of influenza subtypes became possible, allowing accurate diagnosis of transmission to humans. Since then, only 50 such transmissions have been confirmed. These strains of swine flu rarely pass from human to human. Symptoms of zoonotic swine flu in humans are similar to those of [[influenza]] and of [[influenza-like illness]] in general, namely [[chills]], [[fever]], [[pharyngitis|sore throat]], [[myalgia|muscle pains]], severe [[headache]], [[cough]]ing, [[fatigue (medical)|weakness]] and [[malaise|general discomfort]].

In August 2010, the [[World Health Organization]] declared the swine flu [[pandemic]] officially over.&lt;ref&gt;[http://abclocal.go.com/kabc/story?section=news/health&amp;id=7602267 ]{{dead link|date=May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification==
Of the three [[genera]] of influenza viruses that cause [[human flu]], two also cause influenza in pigs, with [[Influenzavirus A|influenza A]] being common in pigs and [[Influenzavirus C|influenza C]] being rare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==History==
Swine influenza was first proposed to be a disease related to human flu during the [[1918 flu pandemic]], when pigs became really sick at the same time as humans.&lt;ref name=Knobler&gt;{{Cite book|editor=Knobler S, Mack A, Mahmoud A, Lemon S |title=The Threat of Pandemic Influenza: Are We Ready?

Then, between 1997 and 2002, new strains of three different subtypes and five different genotypes emerged as causes of influenza among pigs in North America. In 1997–1998, [[H3N2]] strains emerged. These strains, which include genes derived by [[reassortment]] from human, swine and avian viruses, have become a major cause of swine influenza in North America. Reassortment between H1N1 and [[H3N2]] produced [[H1N2]]. In 1999 in Canada, a strain of [[H4N6]] crossed the species barrier from birds to pigs, but was contained on a single farm.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid12034486&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal

Swine flu has been reported numerous times as a [[zoonosis]] in humans, usually with limited distribution, rarely with a widespread distribution. Outbreaks in swine are common and cause significant economic losses in industry, primarily by causing stunting and extended time to market. For example, this disease costs the British meat industry about £65 million every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|doi=10.1136/vr.135.9.199|author=Kay RM, Done SH, Paton DJ |title=Effect of sequential porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome and swine influenza on the growth and performance of finishing pigs |journal=Vet.

This new strain appeared to be closely related to the strain involved in the 1918 flu pandemic. Moreover, the ensuing increased surveillance uncovered another strain in circulation in the U.S.: [[H3N2|A/Victoria/75 (H3N2)]] spread simultaneously, also caused illness, and persisted until March.&lt;ref name=&quot;Gaydos+2006&quot;/&gt; Alarmed public health officials decided action must be taken to head off another major pandemic, and urged President [[Gerald Ford]] that every person in the U.S. be vaccinated for the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Harold M. |last=Schmeck |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Ford Urges Flu Campaign To Inoculate Entire U.S. |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50A17FD3C5A167493C7AB1788D85F428785F9 |work=The New York Times |publisher= |date=March 25, 1976 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[vaccination]] program was plagued by delays and public relations problems.&lt;ref&gt;Richard E. Neustadt and Harvey V. Fineberg. (1978). [http://www.nap.edu/catalog.php?record_id=12660 The Swine Flu Affair: Decision-Making on a Slippery Disease]. ''National Academies Press''.&lt;/ref&gt; On October 1, 1976, immunizations began, and three senior citizens died soon after receiving their injections. This resulted in a media outcry that linked these deaths to the immunizations, despite the lack of any proof the vaccine was the cause. According to science writer Patrick Di Justo, however, by the time the truth was known—that the deaths were not proven to be related to the vaccine—it was too late. &quot;The government had long feared mass panic about swine flu—now they feared mass panic about the swine flu vaccinations.&quot; This became a strong setback to the program.&lt;ref name=DiJusto&gt;[http://www.salon.com/env/feature/2009/04/28/1976_swine_flu/ &quot;The Last Great Swine Flu Epidemic&quot;], ''Salon.com'', April 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

There were reports of [[Guillain-Barré syndrome]], a paralyzing [[neuromuscular]] disorder, affecting some people who had received swine flu immunizations. Although if a link exists is still not clear, this syndrome may be a side effect of influenza vaccines. As a result, Di Justo writes, &quot;the public refused to trust a government-operated health program that killed old people and crippled young people.&quot; In total, 48,161,019 Americans, or just over 22% of the population, had been immunized by the time the [[National Influenza Immunization Program]] was effectively halted on December 16, 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Retailliau HF, Curtis AC, Storr G, Caesar G, Eddins DL, Hattwick MA |title=Illness after influenza vaccination reported through a nationwide surveillance system, 1976-1977 |journal=American Journal of Epidemiology |volume=111 |issue=3 |pages=270–8 |year=1980 |month=March |pmid=7361749 |url=http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7361749}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2009 Northern Ireland outbreak in swine===
Since November 2009, 14 deaths as a result of swine flu in Northern Ireland have been reported. The majority of the victims were reported to have pre-existing health conditions which had lowered their immunity. This closely corresponds to the 19 patients who had died in the year prior due to swine flu, where 18 of the 19 were determined to have lowered immune systems. Because of this, many mothers who have just given birth are strongly encouraged to get a flu shot because their immune systems are vulnerable. Also, studies have shown that people between the ages of 15 and 44 have the highest rate of infection. Although most people now recover, having any conditions that lower one's immune system increases the risk of having the flu become potentially lethal. In Northern Ireland now, approximately 56% of all people under 65 who are entitled to the vaccine have gotten the shot, and the outbreak is said to be under control.&lt;ref&gt;

==H1N1 virus pandemic history==
A study conducted in 2011, and published in the journal Nature, has managed to establish the evolutionary origin of the flu strain of swine origin (S-OIV).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v459/n7250/full/nature08182.html |title=Origins and evolutionary genomics of the 2009 swine-origin H1N1 influenza A epidemic : Article |publisher=Nature |date= |accessdate=2011-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The phylogenetic origin of the flu virus that caused the 2009 pandemics can be traced before 1918. Around 1918, the ancestral virus, of avian origin, crossed the species boundaries and infected humans as human H1N1. The same phenomenon took place soon after in America, where the human virus was infecting pigs; it lead the emergence of the H1N1 swine strain, which later became the classic swine flu.

The new human H1N1 flu strain of avian origin kept transmitting among human populations until around 1957, when there was a co-infection between this strain and the avian H1N1 in humans. A reassortment event lead to the development of a new strain (H2N2). From this point onwards, no outbreaks of H1N1 were reported in humans until around 1976.

New events of reassortment were not reported until 1968, when the avian strain H1N1 infected humans again; this time the virus met the strain H2N2, and the reassortment originated the strain H3N2. This strain has remained as a stable flu strain until now.

The mid-1970s were important for the evolution of flu strains. First, the re-emergence of the human H1N1 strain became a seasonal strain. Then, a small outbreak of swine H1N1 occurred in humans, and finally, the human H2N2 strain apparently became extinct. Around 1979, the avian H1N1 strain infected pigs and gave rise to Euroasiatic swine flu and H1N1 Euroasiatic swine virus, which is still being transmitted in swine populations.

The critical moment for the 2009 outbreak was between 1990 and 1993. A triple reassortment event in a pig host of North American H1N1 swine virus, the human H3N2 virus and avian H1N1 virus generated the swine H1N2 strain.
Finally, the last step in S-OIV history, was in 2009, when the virus H1N2 co-infected a human host at the same time as the Euroasiatic H1N1 swine strain. This led to the emergence of a new human H1N1 strain, which caused the 2009 pandemic.

On June 11, 2009, the World Health Organization raised the worldwide pandemic alert level to Phase 6 for swine flu which is the highest alert level.&lt;ref name=&quot;Choffnes, Eileen R. 2010&quot;&gt;Choffnes, Eileen R., Alison Mack, and David A. Relman. The Domestic and International Impacts of the 2009-H1N1 Influenza a Pandemic: Global Challenges, Global Solutions : Workshop Summary. Washington, D.C.: National Academies, 2010. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; This alert level means that the swine flu had spread worldwide and there were cases of people with the virus in most countries.  The pandemic level identifies the spread of the disease or virus and not necessarily the severity of the disease.

Swine flu spread very rapidly worldwide due to its high human to human transmission rate and due to the frequency of air travel.&lt;ref name=&quot;Choffnes, Eileen R. 2010&quot;/&gt;

==Transmission==
===Transmission between pigs===
Influenza is quite common in pigs, with about half of breeding pigs having been exposed to the virus in the US.&lt;ref name=cfsph/&gt; Antibodies to the virus are also common in pigs in other countries.&lt;ref name=cfsph/&gt;

Direct transmission of a swine flu virus from pigs to humans is occasionally possible (called [[zoonosis|zoonotic]] swine flu). In all, 50 cases are known to have occurred since the first report in medical literature in 1958, which have resulted in a total of six deaths.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17366454&quot;&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Myers KP, Olsen CW, Gray GC |title=Cases of Swine Influenza in Humans: A Review of the Literature |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases |volume=44 |issue=8 |pages=1084–8 |year=2007 |month=April |pmid=17366454 |pmc=1973337 |doi=10.1086/512813}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of these six people, one was pregnant, one had [[leukemia]], one had [[Hodgkin's lymphoma]] and two were known to be previously healthy.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17366454&quot;/&gt; Despite these apparently low numbers of infections, the true rate of infection may be higher, since most cases only cause a very mild disease, and will probably never be reported or diagnosed.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17366454&quot;/&gt;

According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC), in humans the symptoms of the 2009 &quot;swine flu&quot; H1N1 virus are similar to those of [[influenza]] and of [[influenza-like illness]] in general. Symptoms include [[fever]], [[cough]], [[sore throat]], body aches, [[headache]], [[chills]] and [[fatigue (medical)|fatigue]]. The 2009 outbreak has shown an increased percentage of patients reporting [[diarrhea]] and [[vomiting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2009 H1N1 virus is not zoonotic swine flu, as it is not transmitted from pigs to humans, but from person to person.

Because these symptoms are not specific to swine flu, a [[differential diagnosis]] of ''probable'' swine flu requires not only symptoms, but also a high likelihood of swine flu due to the person's recent history. For example, during the [[2009 swine flu outbreak in the United States]], the CDC advised physicians to &quot;consider swine influenza infection in the differential diagnosis of patients with [[acute febrile respiratory illness]] who have either been in contact with persons with confirmed swine flu, or who were in one of the five U.S. states that have reported swine flu cases or in Mexico during the seven days preceding their illness onset.&quot;&lt;ref name=CDCguideHD&gt;{{cite web

==Prevention==
Prevention of swine influenza has three components: prevention in swine, prevention of transmission to humans, and prevention of its spread among humans.

===In swine===
Methods of preventing the spread of influenza among swine include facility management, herd management, and vaccination ([[ATCvet]] code: {{ATCvet|I09|AA03}}). Because much of the illness and death associated with swine flu involves secondary infection by other pathogens, control strategies that rely on vaccination may be insufficient.

Control of swine influenza by vaccination has become more difficult in recent decades, as the [[evolution]] of the [[virus]] has resulted in inconsistent responses to traditional vaccines. Standard commercial swine flu vaccines are effective in controlling the infection when the virus strains match enough to have significant cross-protection, and custom (autogenous) vaccines made from the specific viruses isolated are created and used in the more difficult cases.&lt;ref&gt;

Present [[Influenza vaccine|vaccination]] strategies for SIV control and prevention in swine farms typically include the use of one of several bivalent SIV vaccines commercially available in the United States. Of the 97 recent H3N2 isolates examined, only 41 isolates had strong serologic cross-reactions with antiserum to three commercial SIV vaccines. Since the protective ability of influenza vaccines depends primarily on the closeness of the match between the vaccine virus and the epidemic virus, the presence of nonreactive H3N2 SIV variants suggests current commercial vaccines might not effectively protect pigs from infection with a majority of H3N2 viruses.&lt;ref name=&quot;pmid17366454&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Gramer MR, Lee JH, Choi YK, Goyal SM, Joo HS |title=Serologic and genetic characterization of North American H3N2 swine influenza A viruses |journal=Canadian Journal of Veterinary Research |volume=71 |issue=3 |pages=201–6 |year=2007 |month=July |pmid=17695595 |pmc=1899866}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States Department of Agriculture researchers say while pig vaccination keeps pigs from getting sick, it does not block infection or shedding of the virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20227063.800-swine-flu-the-predictable-pandemic.html?full=true/|title=Swine flu: The predictable pandemic?|date=2009-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facility management includes using disinfectants and ambient temperature to control viruses in the environment. They are unlikely to survive outside living cells for more than two weeks, except in cold (but above freezing) conditions, and are readily inactivated by disinfectants.&lt;ref name=Merck/&gt; Herd management includes not adding pigs carrying influenza to herds that have not been exposed to the virus. The virus survives in healthy carrier pigs for up to three months, and can be recovered from them between outbreaks. Carrier pigs are usually responsible for the introduction of SIV into previously uninfected herds and countries, so new animals should be [[quarantine]]d.&lt;ref name=cfsph/&gt; After an outbreak, as immunity in exposed pigs wanes, new outbreaks of the same strain can occur.&lt;ref name=Merck/&gt;

===In humans===
;Prevention of pig-to-human transmission
[[Image:AntigenicShift HiRes vector.svg|thumb|]] Swine can be infected by both avian and human flu strains of influenza, and therefore are hosts where the [[antigenic shift]]s can occur that create new influenza strains.
The transmission from swine to humans is believed to occur mainly in swine farms, where farmers are in close contact with live pigs. Although strains of swine influenza are usually not able to infect humans, this may occasionally happen, so farmers and veterinarians are encouraged to use face [[surgical mask|mask]]s when dealing with infected animals. The use of vaccines on swine to prevent their infection is a major method of limiting swine-to-human transmission. Risk factors that may contribute to swine-to-human transmission include smoking and, especially, not wearing gloves when working with sick animals, thereby increasing the likelihood of subsequent hand-to-eye, hand-to-nose or hand-to-mouth transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Ramirez A, Capuano AW, Wellman DA, Lesher KA, Setterquist SF, Gray GC |title=Preventing Zoonotic Influenza Virus Infection |journal=Emerging Infect.

[[Image:Airport Thermographic Camera.jpg|thumb|Thermal imaging camera and screen, photographed in an airport terminal in Greece - thermal imaging can detect elevated body temperature, one of the signs of the virus H1N1 (swine influenza).]]
Recommendations to prevent spread of the virus among humans include using standard [[Influenza#Infection control|infection control]], which includes frequent washing of hands with soap and water or with [[Hand sanitizer|alcohol-based hand sanitizers]], especially after being out in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdc.gov/swineflu/investigation.htm|title=CDC - Influenza (Flu) &amp;#124; Swine Influenza (Flu) Investigation|publisher=Cdc.gov|date=|accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chance of transmission is also reduced by disinfecting household surfaces, which can be done effectively with a diluted chlorine bleach solution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waterandhealth.org/newsletter/new/winter_2005/chlorine_bleach.html

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experts agree hand-washing can help prevent viral infections, including ordinary and the swine flu infections. Also, avoiding touching one's eyes, nose or mouth with one's hands helps to prevent the flu.&lt;ref name=&quot;2009 H1N1 Swine Flu and You&quot; /&gt; Influenza can spread in coughs or sneezes, but an increasing body of evidence shows small droplets containing the virus can linger on tabletops, telephones and other surfaces and be transferred via the fingers to the eyes, nose or mouth. [[Hand sanitizer|Alcohol-based gel or foam hand sanitizers]] work well to destroy viruses and bacteria. Anyone with flu-like symptoms, such as a sudden fever, cough or muscle aches, should stay away from work or public transportation, and should contact a doctor for advice.&lt;ref name=&quot;How to protect yourself?&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://pn.lifehugger.com/doc/989/Swine_Flu | title = Self protection measures | publisher = LHC | accessdate = 2009-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Social distancing]], another tactic, is staying away from other people who might be infected, and can include avoiding large gatherings, spreading out a little at work, or perhaps staying home and lying low if an infection is spreading in a community. [[Public health]] and other responsible authorities have action plans which may request or require social distancing actions, depending on the severity of the outbreak.

====Vaccination====
{{Main|2009 flu pandemic vaccine}}
[[Vaccine]]s are available for different kinds of swine flu. The U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approved the new swine flu vaccine for use in the United States on September 15, 2009.&lt;ref name=&quot;Vaccine approval news release&quot;&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm182399.htm | title = FDA Approves Vaccines for 2009 H1N1 Influenza Virus  | publisher = FDA | accessdate = 2009-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies by the [[National Institutes of Health]] show a single dose creates enough antibodies to protect against the virus within about 10 days.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web| url =  http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/news/fullstory_89221.html | title = NIH studies  on Swine flu vaccine  | publisher = NIH | accessdate = 2009-10-15}}{{dead link|date=May 2011}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the 2009 pandemic, several studies were conducted to see who received influenza vaccines.  These studies show that whites are much more likely to be vaccinated for seasonal influenza and for the H1N1 strain than African Americans &lt;ref&gt;Uscher-Pines, Lori, Jurgen Maurer, and Katherine M. Harris. &quot;Racial And Ethnic Disparities In Uptake And Location Of Vaccination For 2009-H1N1 And Seasonal Influenza.&quot; American Journal Of Public Health 101.7 (2011): 1252-1255. SocINDEX with Full Text. Web. 6 Dec. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This could be due to several factors.  Historically, there has been mistrust of vaccines and of the medical community from African Americans.  Many African Americans do not believe vaccines or doctors to be effective.  This mistrust stems from the exploitation of the African American communities during studies like the Tuskegee study.  Additionally, vaccines are typically administered in clinics, hospitals, or doctor’s offices.  Many people of lower socioeconomic status are less likely to receive vaccinations because they do not have health insurance.

==Treatment==
===In swine===
As swine influenza is rarely fatal to pigs, little treatment beyond rest and supportive care is required.&lt;ref name=cfsph&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfsph.iastate.edu/Factsheets/pdfs/influenza.pdf |title=Influenza Factsheet |publisher=Center for Food Security and Public Health, Iowa State University}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, veterinary efforts are focused on preventing the spread of the virus throughout the farm, or to other farms.&lt;ref name=Kothalawala/&gt; Vaccination and animal management techniques are most important in these efforts. Antibiotics are also used to treat this disease, which although they have no effect against the influenza virus, do help prevent bacterial [[pneumonia]] and other [[secondary infection]]s in influenza-weakened herds.&lt;ref name=&quot;cfsph&quot;/&gt;

===In humans===
If a person becomes sick with swine flu, antiviral drugs can make the illness milder and make the patient feel better faster. They may also prevent serious flu complications. For treatment, antiviral drugs work best if started soon after getting sick (within two days of symptoms). Beside antivirals, supportive care at home or in a hospital focuses on controlling fevers, relieving pain and maintaining fluid balance, as well as identifying and treating any secondary infections or other medical problems. The U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] recommends the use of [[oseltamivir]] (Tamiflu) or [[zanamivir]] (Relenza) for the treatment and/or prevention of infection with swine influenza viruses; however, the majority of people infected with the virus make a full recovery without requiring medical attention or antiviral drugs.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/faq/en/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; The virus isolates in the 2009 outbreak have been found resistant to [[amantadine]] and [[rimantadine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdc.gov/swineflu/antiviral_swine.htm |title=Antiviral Drugs and Swine Influenza |publisher=Centers for Disease Control |accessdate=2009-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., on April 27, 2009, the FDA issued [[emergency use authorization]]s to make available [[Relenza]] and [[Tamiflu]] [[antiviral drug]]s to treat the swine influenza virus in cases for which they are currently unapproved. The agency issued these EUAs to allow treatment of patients younger than the current approval allows and to allow the widespread distribution of the drugs, including by unlicensed volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm149571.htm |title=''FDA Authorizes Emergency Use of Influenza Medicines, Diagnostic Test in Response to Swine Flu Outbreak in Humans.''

= Fish Oil Basics =

According to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Maryland_Medical_Center University of Maryland Medical Center], &quot;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omega_3 Omega-3 fatty acids] are considered essential&quot; in that they are believe to be integral to human health. 
&lt;ref name=&quot;UMM&quot;&gt;http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/omega-3-000316.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  What is interesting, however, is that the human body is unable to produce these acids on its own; instead, they are most commonly obtained through food, more specifically in fish, such as &quot;mackerel, tuna, salmon, sturgeon, mullet, bluefish, anchovy, sardines, herring, trout, and menhaden.&quot; 
&lt;ref name=&quot;NLM&quot;&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/993.html&lt;/ref&gt;  While it is true that these Omega-3 fatty acids have been around since the dawn of time, recent interest in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fish_oil fish oil] supplements have surged in popularity as a remedy to treat &quot;heart disease, high blood pressure, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psoriasis psoriasis], and a number of other ailments.&quot; 
&lt;ref name=&quot;LA&quot;&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/2011/dec/06/news/la-heb-fish-oil-supplements-consumer-reports-20111206&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2008 survey revealed that 75% of Americans who take some sort of daily [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multivitamin multivitamin] also take fish oil supplements &lt;ref&gt;http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/2011-02-01/health/os-fish-oil-most-popular-supplement-20110131_1_multivitamin-fish-oil-amino-acids&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, fish oil supplements started to gain national recognition once some people started taking them for use in treating &quot;depression, psychosis, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ADHD attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)], [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease Alzheimer's disease], and other thinking disorders.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;LA&quot;&gt;http://articles.latimes.com/2011/dec/06/news/la-heb-fish-oil-supplements-consumer-reports-20111206&lt;/ref&gt;  But just what exactly is inside these magic pills?


== How Fish Oil is Made and Manufactured ==

The key ingredient to fish oil supplements is just what it sounds like: oil from certain types of fish that are high in Omega-3 fatty acid oil concentration.  The two most notable acids in fish oil that are believed to provide health benefits are [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eicosapentaenoic_acid eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA)] and [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docosahexaenoic_acid decosahexaenoic acid (DHA)]. &lt;ref name=&quot;Fish&quot;&gt;http://www.fishoilbenefit.net/&lt;/ref&gt;  An understanding of how these acids are harvested from fish and manufactured is important, not only for the sake of being a knowledgeable consumer, but also to ensure again ingestion of harmful or contaminated fish oil tablets which may result from contaminated fish or processing procedures. 


Fish oil is manufactured by taking [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oily_fish oily fish] and cutting it into pieces, which are then steamed and pressed to separate the fat-free solid from liquid. The liquid that is released from the fish consists mainly of fish oil (and all resulting acids from the oil) and water.  The solid pieces of fish are set aside and used for other purposes, most often as an ingredient for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Compound_feed animal feed]; they are not used for human consumption.  The collected liquid is then processed to separate the water from the oil.  Separation of water and oil is a key step because the water that is separated often times still contains small fishy-solids that can damage or even destroy the intended effect of the Omega-3 acids.  Therefore, failure to completely remove all the water from the oil is one way in which defective fish oil tablets may be produced. However, once all water has been removed the oil is processed a second time in an attempt to remove any last-minute impurities that may still be remaining in the liquid.  Lastly, anti-oxidants are added to the fish oil to help increase health benefits, as well as for preservation purposes, and the oil is then stored in steel storage containers until it is manufactured into the tiny fish oil tablets that are commercially available in stores.


Quality of fish oil supplements depends mainly on the type of fish being used to gather the oil, in addition to the separation, purity, and enhancement standards listed above used by the plant in the manufacturing process.  It is important to note that since fish oil is acquired from fish, it is possible for the fish itself being harvested to be contaminated by pollutants they either ate or were exposed to in the ocean.  Therefore, a good test to perform before being committed to taking a bottle of fish oil is to see if a tablet inside tastes &quot;fishy.&quot;  Lack of a fishy taste often results in toxins or other harmful chemicals in the oil that are destroying its true taste and nature, in which case the entire bottle should be thrown-out and no other tables from the bottle ingested.  &lt;ref name=&quot;Fish&quot;&gt;http://www.fishoilbenefit.net/&lt;/ref&gt;


== Supposed Benefits ==

According to the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NIH NIH], fish oil is most commonly used for conditions related to the &quot;heart and blood system&quot; such as trying to &quot;lower blood pressure or [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triglyceride triglyceride] levels.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;NLM&quot;&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/993.html&lt;/ref&gt;  Clinical research of fish oil and the human body has yielded the following results:


'''Effective For:'''

- ''High Triglycerides:'' associated with heart disease and untreated diabetes.  Doctors believe keeping triglyceride levels below a certain level to maintain a healthy heart.


'''Likely Effective For:'''

- ''Heart Disease:'' Fish Oil may help lower risk of heart disease, though not all research wil agree.


'''Possibly Effective For:'''

- ''High Blood Pressure''

-&quot;Menstrual Pain ([http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dysmenorrhea dysmenorrhea])&quot;

-&quot;[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rheumatoid_arthritis Rheumatoid Arthritis]&quot; 

-&quot;Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)&quot;

-&quot;Kidney Problems&quot;

-&quot;Psoriasis&quot; 

And a myriad of other yet-to-be-proven ailments. &lt;ref name=&quot;NLM&quot;&gt;http://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/druginfo/natural/993.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Possible Side Effects ==

While it is true that taking contaminated Fish Oil can be bad for you, there are currently no proven side affects that could be a deterrent from taking the supplements.  The most common known side effects include &quot;a fishy aftertaste, bad breath, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartburn heartburn] or indigestion, and some other [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gastrointestinal gastrointestinal]-related side effects&quot; &lt;ref&gt;http://heart-disease.emedtv.com/fish-oil/fish-oil-side-effects.html&lt;/ref&gt;

= The Durham Fish Oil Trials =
In [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durham Durham], England, the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Local_education_authority Local Education Authority] [LEA] was becoming increasingly concerned about pupils underachieving due problems concentrating and staying on task. &lt;ref name=&quot;Durham&quot;&gt;http://www.durhamtrial.org/&lt;/ref&gt;  As mentioned above, there has been much speculation as to the benefits of fatty acid supplements. Omega-3's are necessary for human health but the body can not make them, thus you have to get them through food. &lt;ref name=&quot;UMM&quot;&gt;http://www.umm.edu/altmed/articles/omega-3-000316.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the average westerner's diet tends to be low on Omega-3's&lt;ref&gt;http://borntoexplore.org/omega.htm&lt;/ref&gt;, and high on man-made trans fats and saturated fats which can increase bad cholesterol among other negative side effects &lt;ref&gt;http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/nutrition/fat/overview.html&lt;/ref&gt;. The LEA clearly had no way of monitoring a complete dietary over-haul for its students, so they decided to use Omega-3 supplements.


The LEA partnered with the [http://www.dyslexic.org.uk/ Dyslexia Research Trust] and Dr. Alex Richardson, whose specialty is on how fatty acids can help with learning conditions. &lt;ref name=&quot;Durham&quot;&gt;http://www.durhamtrial.org/&lt;/ref&gt;  They chose to do a double-blind, six-month long trial throughout the 2002 school year, with a one-way cross over at the mid-point. &lt;ref name=&quot;Durham&quot;&gt;http://www.durhamtrial.org/&lt;/ref&gt;  This meant that neither the children nor those administering the capsules would know whether the child was receiving the placebo or the supplement, and that all participates would be on the supplement for the second half of the study. In order to ensure compliance, the capsules were administered by school staff before classes started, at lunch-time, and before the students went home every day for a total of 1000mg per day, and parents were to administer the capsules on the weekend. &lt;ref name=&quot;Durham&quot;&gt;http://www.durhamtrial.org/&lt;/ref&gt;  All of the participants were selected on the basis that they were not fulfilling their potential at school, though their general ability was normal &lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/science/humanbody/mind/articles/intelligenceandmemory/omega_three.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;. The study assessed: reading, spelling, handwriting, drawing, visual and auditory memory, and perceptual skills as well as excitability/hyperactivity, manual dexterity, ball skills, static and dynamic balance and organisational skills. &lt;ref name=&quot;Durham&quot;&gt;http://www.durhamtrial.org/&lt;/ref&gt;  


The children in the active group saw significant improvements in reading, spelling, and behavior compared to the placebo group, and during the second half of the study the placebo group crossed over to fatty acid supplements and saw considerable improvements in the same areas. &lt;ref name=&quot;Durham&quot;&gt;http://www.durhamtrial.org/&lt;/ref&gt;  The study found that &quot;compared to those in the placecbo group, children taking active supplementation made significant decreases in 11 out of 13 behavioral ratings, including features of inattention, hyperactivity, and impulsivity.&quot; &lt;ref name=&quot;Durham&quot;&gt;http://www.durhamtrial.org/&lt;/ref&gt;  Though there was no noticeable effect on treatment of motor skills observed, it was concluded that fatty acid suplementation may offer a safe efficacious treatment option for educational and behavioral problems &lt;ref&gt;http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/115/5/1360.abstract&lt;/ref&gt;.


= Ethical Questions =

In September of 2008, [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Goldacre Ben Goldacre], a well-known science writer and psychiatrist published an article in [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Guardian The Guardian] newspaper decrying the Durham Fish Oil Trials. Dr. Goldacre called the Durham study “possibly the greatest example of scientific incompetence ever documented from a local authority.” &lt;ref name=&quot;Bad&quot;&gt;http://www.badscience.net/2008/09/dave-ford-from-durham-council-plays-at-being-a-scientist-again/&lt;/ref&gt;  While the news coverage of the Durham experiment called what happened a &quot;trial,&quot; they later told Dr. Goldacre that they had never outwardly used that terminology. &lt;ref name=&quot;Bad&quot;&gt;http://www.badscience.net/2008/09/dave-ford-from-durham-council-plays-at-being-a-scientist-again/&lt;/ref&gt;  Dr. Goldacre also claims that the researchers in the fish oil trials refused to give him information he had requested under the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_information_in_the_United_Kingdom Freedom of Information Act]. &lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;&gt;http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/sep/27/medicalresearch&lt;/ref&gt;  

Dr. Goldacre has made a career out of commenting on science to a general audience. In his book entitled [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Science_%28book%29 Bad Science], Goldacre looks at scientific studies that he considers flawed, and does a case study analysis in hopes of improving the way in which experiments are designed and executed. &lt;ref&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Science_%28book%29&lt;/ref&gt;  He also has a [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ben_Goldacre#Bad_Science_column column] in The Guardian under the same name as his book, which continues on the theme of pointing out and commenting on what he considers inaccuracies in popular science. A large part of his livelihood, and most of his notoriety, comes from criticizing studies.  Therefore, it is not be unreasonable to conclude that he at the forefront of the attack being led against the Durham fish oil trials, if for any reason, to simply to further his career&lt;ref&gt;http://rationalwiki.org/wiki/Ben_Goldacre&lt;/ref&gt;.


While It is intuitive that students who can follow a strict regimen (such as taking a pill every day) are more likely to have success in school due to better discipline and focus.  However, the researcher in this particular experiment removed children from the study that did not meet their 80% standard for compliance.  This is to say that of the 3,000 children initially in the study, only 629 were used for the analysis. &lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;&gt;http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/sep/27/medicalresearch&lt;/ref&gt;  Hence, by switching everyone over to fish oil, the researchers were able to justify narrowing their sample group, possibly for the purpose of removing unfavorable data points who would pose as outliers in experiment data.  The results of the study are inevitably inconclusive because they could simply be a correlation with consistency of doing a task (taking daily fish oil tablets) and having good study habits. &lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;&gt;http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/sep/27/medicalresearch&lt;/ref&gt;

== Conflicts of Interest ==

If this study accurately showed that fish oil could help students perform better in school, then naturally, it follows that many concerned parents would begin to put their children on fish oil supplements. This would lead to an increase in the demand for fish oil, and therefore, would drastically increase industry’s profits. Additionally, it is important to note that only one supplier of fish oil was used in conducting this study. Therefore, if this company’s fish oil brand was acknowledged by the study as being a successful tool in improving student effectiveness, parents would be more most likely be more prone to buying the brand mentioned in the study. This would ultimately give the company a competitive advantage and allow for success in achieving a greater market share. 


One big criticism regarding this particular trial is that whether or not the [http://www.dyslexic.org.uk/ Dyslexia Research Trust] put pressure on the scientists to find favorable results. Since the Dyslexia Research Trust gets a significant portion of its funds for researching methods to treat dyslexia&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dyslexic.org.uk/aboutus.htm&lt;/ref&gt;, the publicity of finding a positive effect of fish oil on dyslexia would increase interest in their organization and therefore, would likely increase their number of donations. The Dyslexia Research Trust was not the only party who would benefit from favorable results, however. In Durham, the local schools' test scores were low, and the city council was under pressure to fix it--fast. &lt;ref name=&quot;Guardian&quot;&gt;http://www.guardian.co.uk/commentisfree/2008/sep/27/medicalresearch&lt;/ref&gt;  If they could improve performance of their students with something as simple as a magic pill, or in this case, fish oil tablets, then there would be hope of regaining trust of its citizens and staying favorable with their voters. In addition to the pressure to find a quick fix for this problem, if the experiment failed then the parents of the students that participated would feel as though their time had been wasted, and the voters would consider their money to have been robbed of them in performing the fish oil trials.


= Who Is To Blame: The Scientists Or Society? =

In many parts of Western society there exists a culture that believes that every problem can be solved with a pill. Overhauling the students' diet was not an option; neither was providing more special programs for students with learning needs or reducing class sizes. The easiest and cheapest possible solution, therefore, was some sort of pill or vitamin--especially something inexpensive and easily obtained like fish oil. Therefore, the trials may have actually been the byproduct of this &quot;pill culture&quot; mentality, reinforcing the notion that the most convenient way to change a student's performance is through digestion of some sort of vitamin. After all, this would be a quicker and easier way of solving the problem than physically changing the student's study habits or work environment.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;!--[[File:&quot;Cover_Coughs,_Cover_Sneezes&quot;_-_NARA_-_514081.tif]]Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette in Healthcare Settings--&gt;

To prevent the transmission of all respiratory infections in healthcare settings, including influenza, the following infection control measures should be implemented at the first point of contact with a 

potentially infected person. They should be incorporated into infection control practices as one component of Standard Precautions.
1. Visual Alerts

Post visual alerts (in appropriate languages) at the entrance to outpatient facilities (e.g., emergency departments, physician offices, outpatient clinics) instructing patients and persons who accompany them 

(e.g., family, friends) to inform healthcare personnel of symptoms of a respiratory infection when they first register for care and to practice Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette.

2. Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette

The following measures to contain respiratory secretions are recommended for all individuals with signs and symptoms of a respiratory infection.

    Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when coughing or sneezing;

    Use in the nearest waste receptacle to dispose of the tissue after use;

    Perform hand hygiene (e.g., hand washing with non-antimicrobial soap and water, alcohol-based hand rub, or antiseptic handwash) after having contact with respiratory secretions and contaminated objects/materials.

Healthcare facilities should ensure the availability of materials for adhering to Respiratory Hygiene/Cough Etiquette in waiting areas for patients and visitors.

    Provide tissues and no-touch receptacles for used tissue disposal.

    Provide conveniently located dispensers of alcohol-based hand rub; where sinks are available, ensure that supplies for hand washing (i.e., soap, disposable towels) are consistently available.


3. Masking and Separation of Persons with Respiratory Symptoms

During periods of increased respiratory infection activity in the community (e.g., when there is increased absenteeism in schools and work settings and increased medical office visits by persons complaining of respiratory illness), offer masks to persons who are coughing. Either procedure masks (i.e., with ear loops) or surgical masks (i.e., with ties) may be used to contain respiratory secretions (respirators such as N-95 or above are not necessary for this purpose). When space and chair availability permit, encourage coughing persons to sit at least three feet away from others in common waiting areas. Some facilities may find it logistically easier to institute this recommendation year-round.
4. Droplet Precautions

Advise healthcare personnel to observe Droplet Precautions (i.e., wearing a surgical or procedure mask for close contact), in addition to Standard Precautions, when examining a patient with symptoms of a respiratory infection, particularly if fever is present. These precautions should be maintained until it is determined that the cause of symptoms is not an infectious agent that requires Droplet Precautions.


NOTE: These recommendations are based on the Draft Guideline for Isolation Precautions: Preventing Transmission of Infectious Agents in Healthcare Settings. Recommendations of the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HICPAC), CDC.

In [[epidemiology]], an '''epidemic''' (επί (epi)- meaning &quot;upon or above&quot; and δήμος (demos)- meaning &quot;people&quot;), occurs when new cases of a certain [[disease]], in a given human population, and during a given period, substantially exceed what is expected based on recent experience.&lt;ref name=&quot;Principles of Epidemiology&quot;/&gt;{{rp|354}}&lt;ref name=Green&gt;{{cite journal |author=Green MS, Swartz T, Mayshar E, Lev B, Leventhal A, Slater PE, Shemer J |title=When is an epidemic an epidemic? |journal=Isr.

An epidemic may be restricted to one [[locale]], however if it spreads to other countries or continents and affects a substantial number of people, it may be termed a [[pandemic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Principles of Epidemiology&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author= |title=Principles of Epidemiology, Second Edition |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] |location=Atlanta, Georgia |year=|pages= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |url=http://www2a.cdc.gov/phtn/catalog/pdf-file/Epi_course.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|55}} The declaration of an epidemic usually requires a good understanding of a [[baseline (medicine)|baseline]] rate of [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]]; epidemics for certain diseases, such as [[influenza]], are defined as reaching some defined increase in incidence above this baseline.&lt;ref name=Green/&gt; A few cases of a very rare [[disease]] may be classified as an epidemic, while many cases of a common disease (such as the [[common cold]]) would not.

==Causes of epidemics==
There are several changes that may occur in an [[infectious agent]] that may trigger an epidemic these include:&lt;ref name=&quot;Principles of Epidemiology&quot;/&gt;{{rp|55}}
* Increased [[virulence]]
* Introduction into a novel setting
* Changes in host susceptibility to the infectious agent
* Changes in host exposure to the infectious agent

An epidemic disease is not required to be [[contagious disease|contagious]],&lt;ref name=Green/&gt;&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt; and the term has been applied to [[West Nile fever]]&lt;ref name=Green/&gt; and the [[obesity epidemic]], among others.&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt;

=='''Types of epidemics'''==
;Common source outbreak
Two examples of common sources of outbreak are the epidemics Emmititus and Powititus. These diseases are reflected in the growth of the skull. In a common source outbreak, the affected individuals had an exposure to a common agent. If the exposure is singular and all of the affected individuals develop the disease over a single exposure and incubation course, it can be termed a point source outbreak. If the exposure was continuous or variable, it can be termed a continuous outbreak or intermittent outbreak, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Principles of Epidemiology&quot;/&gt;{{rp|56}}
'''
;Propagated outbreak'''
In a propagated outbreak, the disease spreads person-to-person. Affected individuals may become independent reservoirs leading to further exposures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Principles of Epidemiology&quot;/&gt;{{rp|56}}

Many epidemics will have characteristics of both common source and propagated outbreaks. For example, secondary person-to-person spread may occur after a common source exposure or a environmental vectors may spread a [[zoonotic]] diseases agent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Principles of Epidemiology&quot;/&gt;{{rp|56-58}}

==Etymology==
The term epidemic derives from a term first attributed to [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', which later took its medical meaning from a treatise by [[Hippocrates]], ''[[Epidemics (Hippocrates)|Epidemics]]''.&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;{{cite journal |author=Martin PM, Martin-Granel E |title=2,500-year evolution of the term epidemic |journal=Emerging Infect.

'''Infectious diseases''', also known as '''contagious diseases''' or '''transmissible diseases''', and include '''communicable diseases''', comprise clinically evident [[illness]] (i.e., characteristic [[medical sign]]s and/or [[symptom]]s of [[disease]]) resulting from the [[infection]], presence and growth of [[pathogen]]ic [[biological]] agents in an individual [[host (biology)|host]] organism. In certain cases, infectious diseases may be asymptomatic for much or all of their course. Infectious pathogens include some [[virus]]es, [[bacteria]], [[Mycosis|fungi]], [[protozoa]], multicellular [[parasite]]s, and aberrant proteins known as [[prion]]s. These pathogens are the cause of disease epidemics, in the sense that without the pathogen, no infectious epidemic occurs.

[[Transmission (medicine)|Transmission]] of pathogen can occur in various ways including physical contact, contaminated food, body fluids, objects, airborne inhalation, or through [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] organisms.&lt;ref name=Sherris&gt;{{cite book | author = Ryan KJ; Ray CG (editors) | title = Sherris Medical Microbiology | edition = 4th | publisher = McGraw Hill | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-8385-8529-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Infectious diseases that are especially infective are sometimes called [[contagious disease|contagious]] and can be easily transmitted by contact with an ill person or their secretions. Infectious diseases with more specialized routes of infection, such as vector transmission or sexual transmission, are usually regarded as contagious but do not require medical [[quarantine]] of victims.

The term ''[[infectivity]]'' describes the ability of an organism to enter, survive and multiply in the host, while the ''infectiousness'' of a disease indicates the comparative ease with which the disease is transmitted to other hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.doh.wa.gov/notify/other/glossary.htm | title=Glossary of Notifiable Conditions | publisher=Washington State Department of Health | accessdate=2010-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; An infection is not [[synonymous]] with an infectious disease, as some infections do not cause illness in a host.&lt;ref name=Sherris/&gt;

==Classification==
Among the almost infinite varieties of [[microorganisms]], relatively few cause disease in otherwise healthy individuals.&lt;ref name= Baron&gt;This section incorporates [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mmed public domain] materials included in the text: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?call=bv.View..ShowTOC&amp;rid=mmed.TOC&amp;depth=10 Medical Microbiology] Fourth Edition: [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=mmed.chapter.594 Chapter 8] (1996) . Baron, Samuel MD. The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston.&lt;/ref&gt; Infectious disease results from the interplay between those few pathogens and the defenses of the hosts they infect. The appearance and severity of disease resulting from any pathogen depends upon the ability of that pathogen to damage the host as well as the ability of the host to resist the pathogen. Clinicians therefore classify infectious microorganisms or microbes according to the status of host defenses - either as ''primary pathogens'' or as ''opportunistic pathogens'':

* '''Primary pathogens''' cause disease as a result of their presence or activity within the normal, healthy host, and their intrinsic [[virulence]] (the severity of the disease they cause) is, in part, a necessary consequence of their need to reproduce and spread. Many of the most common primary pathogens of humans only infect humans, however many serious diseases are caused by organisms acquired from the environment or which infect non-human hosts.
* Organisms which cause an infectious disease in a host with depressed resistance are classified as '''opportunistic pathogens'''. Opportunistic disease may be caused by microbes that are ordinarily in contact with the host, such as [[pathogenic bacteria]] or fungi in the [[gastrointestinal]] or the [[upper respiratory tract]], and they may also result from (otherwise innocuous) microbes acquired from other hosts (as in ''[[Clostridium difficile]]'' [[colitis]]) or from the environment as a result of [[Physical trauma|traumatic]] introduction (as in [[surgical]] wound infections or [[compound fracture]]s). An opportunistic disease requires impairment of host defenses, which may occur as a result of [[genetic defect]]s (such as [[Chronic granulomatous disease]]), exposure to [[antimicrobial]] drugs or [[immunosuppressive]] chemicals (as might occur following [[poison]]ing or [[cancer]] [[chemotherapy]]), exposure to [[ionizing radiation]], or as a result of an infectious disease with immunosuppressive activity (such as with [[measles]], [[malaria]] or [[HIV disease]]). Primary pathogens may also cause more severe disease in a host with depressed resistance than would normally occur in an immunosufficient host.&lt;ref name=Sherris/&gt;

One way of proving that a given disease is &quot;infectious&quot;, is to satisfy [[Koch's postulates]] (first proposed by [[Robert Koch]]), which demands that the [[infectious agent]] be identified only in patients and not in healthy controls, and that patients who contract the agent also develop the disease. These postulates were first used in the discovery that [[Mycobacteria]] species cause [[tuberculosis]]. Koch's postulates can not be met ethically for many human diseases because they require experimental infection of a healthy individual with a pathogen produced as a pure culture. Often, even diseases that are quite clearly infectious do not meet the infectious criteria. For example, ''[[Treponema pallidum]]'', the causative [[spirochete]] of [[syphilis]], cannot be [[microbiological culture|cultured]] ''in vitro'' - however the organism can be cultured in rabbit [[testes]]. It is less clear that a pure culture comes from an animal source serving as host than it is when derived from microbes derived from plate culture.
[[Epidemiology]] is another important tool used to study disease in a population. For infectious diseases it helps to determine if a disease [[outbreak]] is sporadic (occasional occurrence), [[endemic (epidemiology)|endemic]] (regular cases often occurring in a region), epidemic (an unusually high number of cases in a region), or [[pandemic]] (a global epidemic).

==Transmission==
[[Image:OCD handwash.jpg|thumb|right|Washing one's hands, a form of [[hygiene]], is the most effective way to prevent the spread of infectious disease.]]
An infectious disease is transmitted from some source. Defining the means of transmission plays an important part in understanding the biology of an infectious agent, and in addressing the disease it causes. Transmission may occur through several different mechanisms. [[Respiration (physiology)|Respiratory]] diseases and [[meningitis]] are commonly acquired by contact with aerosolized droplets, spread by sneezing, coughing, talking, kissing or even singing. [[Gastrointestinal]] diseases are often acquired by ingesting contaminated food and water. [[Sexually transmitted disease]]s are acquired through contact with bodily fluids, generally as a result of sexual activity. Some infectious agents may be spread as a result of contact with a contaminated, inanimate object (known as a [[fomite]]), such as a coin passed from one person to another, while other diseases penetrate the [[skin]] directly.&lt;ref name=Sherris/&gt;

Transmission of infectious diseases may also involve a [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]]. Vectors may be mechanical or biological. A mechanical vector picks up an infectious agent on the outside of its body and transmits it in a passive manner. An example of a mechanical vector is a [[housefly]], which lands on cow dung, contaminating its appendages with bacteria from the feces, and then lands on food prior to consumption. The pathogen never enters the body of the fly. [[Image:CulexNil.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Culex mosquitos (''[[Culex quinquefasciatus]]'' shown) are biological vectors that transmit [[West Nile Virus]].]]In contrast, biological vectors harbor pathogens within their bodies and deliver pathogens to new hosts in an active manner, usually a bite. Biological vectors are often responsible for serious [[blood-borne disease]]s, such as [[malaria]], [[viral encephalitis]], [[Chagas disease]], [[Lyme disease]] and [[African trypanosomiasis|African sleeping sickness]]. Biological vectors are usually, though not exclusively, [[arthropods]], such as [[mosquitoes]], [[tick]]s, [[fleas]] and [[lice]]. Vectors are often required in the life cycle of a pathogen. A common strategy used to control vector borne infectious diseases is to interrupt the life cycle of a pathogen by killing the vector.

The relationship between virulence and transmission is complex, and has important consequences for the long term evolution of a pathogen. Since it takes many generations for a microbe and a new host species to co-evolve, an emerging pathogen may hit its earliest victims especially hard. It is usually in the first wave of a new disease that death rates are highest. If a disease is rapidly fatal, the host may die before the microbe can get passed along to another host. However, this cost may be overwhelmed by the short term benefit of higher infectiousness if transmission is linked to virulence, as it is for instance in the case of cholera (the explosive diarrhea aids the bacterium in finding new hosts) or many respiratory infections (sneezing and coughing create infectious [[aerosol]]s).

==Prevention==
One of the ways to prevent or slow down the transmission of infectious diseases is to recognize the different characteristics of various diseases.&lt;ref name=Watts&gt;{{cite book |author=Watts, Duncan |title=Six degrees: the science of a connected age |publisher=William Heinemann |location=London |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=0-393-04142-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some critical disease characteristics that should be evaluated include [[virulence]], distance traveled by victims, and level of contagiousness. The human strains of [[Ebola]] virus, for example, incapacitate its victims extremely quickly and kills them soon after. As a result, the victims of this disease do not have the opportunity to travel very far from the initial infection zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Preston, Richard |title=The hot zone |publisher=Anchor Books |location=Garden City, N.Y. |year=1995 |pages= |isbn=0-385-49522-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also, this virus must spread through skin lesions or permeable membranes such as the eye. Thus, the initial stage of [[Ebola]] is not very contagious since its victims experience only internal hemorrhaging. As a result of the above features, the spread of Ebola is very rapid and usually stays within a relatively confined geographical area. In contrast, the [[Human Immunodeficiency Virus]] ([[HIV]]) kills its victims very slowly by attacking their immune system.&lt;ref name=Sherris/&gt;  As a result, many of its victims transmit the virus to other individuals before even realizing that they are carrying the disease. Also, the relatively low virulence allows its victims to travel long distances, increasing the likelihood of an epidemic.

Another effective way to decrease the transmission rate of infectious diseases is to recognize the effects of [[small-world networks]].&lt;ref name=Watts/&gt;  In epidemics, there are often extensive interactions within hubs or groups of infected individuals and other interactions within discrete hubs of susceptible individuals. Despite the low interaction between discrete hubs, the disease can jump to and spread in a susceptible hub via a single or few interactions with an infected hub. Thus, infection rates in small-world networks can be reduced somewhat if interactions between individuals within infected hubs are eliminated (Figure 1). However, infection rates can be drastically reduced if the main focus is on the prevention of transmission jumps between hubs. The use of needle exchange programs in areas with a high density of drug users with HIV is an example of the successful implementation of this treatment method. &lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;  Another example is the use of ring culling or vaccination of potentially susceptible livestock in adjacent farms to prevent the spread of the [[foot-and-mouth]] virus in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ferguson NM, Donnelly CA, Anderson RM |title=The foot-and-mouth epidemic in Great Britain: pattern of spread and impact of interventions |journal=Science |volume=292 |issue=5519 |pages=1155–60 |year=2001 |month=May |pmid=11303090 |doi=10.1126/science.1061020 |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11303090}}&lt;/ref&gt;

General methods to prevent transmission of pathogens may include [[disinfection]] and [[pest control]].

===Immunity===
[[Image:Mallon-Mary 01.jpg|thumb|[[Mary Mallon]] (a.k.a Typhoid Mary) was an asymptomatic carrier of [[typhoid fever]]. Over the course of her career as a cook, she infected 53 people, three of whom died.]]
Infection with most pathogens does not result in death of the host and the offending organism is ultimately cleared after the symptoms of the disease have waned.&lt;ref name= Baron/&gt; This process requires [[immune system|immune mechanisms]] to kill or inactivate the [[inoculum]] of the pathogen. Specific acquired [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] against infectious diseases may be mediated by [[antibodies]] and/or [[T lymphocyte]]s. Immunity mediated by these two factors may be manifested by:
* a direct effect upon a pathogen, such as antibody-initiated [[complement system|complement]]-dependent bacteriolysis, [[Opsonin|opsonoization]], [[phagocytosis]] and killing, as occurs for some bacteria,
* neutralization of viruses so that these organisms cannot enter cells,
* or by T lymphocytes which will kill a cell parasitized by a microorganism.

The immune system response to a microorganism often causes symptoms such as a high [[fever]] and [[inflammation]], and has the potential to be more devastating than direct damage caused by a microbe.&lt;ref name=Sherris/&gt;

Resistance to infection ([[immunity (medical)|immunity]]) may be acquired following a disease, by [[asymptomatic carrier|asymptomatic carriage]] of the pathogen, by harboring an organism with a similar structure (crossreacting), or by [[vaccination]]. Knowledge of the protective antigens and specific acquired host immune factors is more complete for primary pathogens than for opportunistic pathogens.

Immune resistance to an infectious disease requires a critical level of either antigen-specific antibodies and/or T cells when the host encounters the pathogen. Some individuals develop natural [[blood plasma|serum]] antibodies to the surface [[polysaccharide]]s of some agents although they have had little or no contact with the agent, these natural antibodies confer specific protection to adults and are [[passive immunization|passively transmitted]] to newborns.

====Host genetic factors====
The clearance of the pathogens, either treatment-induced or spontaneous, it can be influenced by the genetic variants carried by the individual patients. For instance, for genotype 1 hepatitis C treated with [[Pegylated interferon-alpha-2a]] or [[Pegylated interferon-alpha-2b]] (brand names Pegasys or PEG-Intron) combined with [[ribavirin]], it has been shown that genetic polymorphisms near the human IL28B gene, encoding interferon lambda 3, are associated with significant differences in the treatment-induced clearance of the virus. This finding, originally reported in Nature,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Genetic variation in IL28B predicts hepatitis C treatment-induced viral clearance|author=Ge D|journal=Nature |year=2009 |volume=461|pages=399–401 |pmid=19684573 |doi=10.1038/nature08309|issue=7262|author-separator=,|author2=Fellay J|author3=Thompson AJ|display-authors=3|last4=Simon|first4=Jason S.|last5=Shianna|first5=Kevin V.|last6=Urban|first6=Thomas J.|last7=Heinzen|first7=Erin L.|last8=Qiu|first8=Ping|last9=Bertelsen|first9=Arthur H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that genotype 1 hepatitis C patients carrying certain genetic variant alleles near the IL28B gene are more possibly to achieve sustained virological response after the treatment than others. Later report from Nature&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Genetic variation in IL28B and spontaneous clearance of hepatitis C virus|author=Thomas DL|journal=Nature |year=2009  |pmid=19759533 |doi=10.1038/nature08463|volume=461|issue=7265|pages=798–801 |pmc=3172006|author-separator=,|author2=Thio CL|author3=Martin MP|display-authors=3|last4=Qi|first4=Ying|last5=Ge|first5=Dongliang|last6=o’Huigin|first6=Colm|last7=Kidd|first7=Judith|last8=Kidd|first8=Kenneth|last9=Khakoo|first9=Salim I.}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrated that the same genetic variants are also associated with the natural clearance of the genotype 1 hepatitis C virus.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis of infectious disease sometimes involves identifying an infectious agent either directly or indirectly. In practice most minor infectious diseases such as [[warts]], [[cutaneous]] [[abscesses]], [[respiratory system]] infections and [[diarrheal diseases]] are diagnosed by their clinical presentation. Conclusions about the cause of the disease are based upon the likelihood that a patient came in contact with a particular agent, the presence of a microbe in a community, and other epidemiological considerations. Given sufficient effort, all known infectious agents can be specifically identified. The benefits of identification, however, are often greatly outweighed by the cost, as often there is no specific treatment, the cause is obvious, or the outcome of an infection is [[benign]].

Diagnosis of infectious disease is nearly always initiated by [[medical history]] and physical examination. More detailed identification techniques involve the culture of infectious agents isolated from a patient. Culture allows identification of infectious organisms by examining their microscopic features, by detecting the presence of substances produced by pathogens, and by directly identifying an organism by its genotype. Other techniques (such as [[X-ray]]s, [[CAT scans]], [[PET scan]]s or [[NMR]]) are used to produce images of internal abnormalities resulting from the growth of an infectious agent. The images are useful in detection of, for example, a bone [[abscess]] or a [[spongiform encephalopathy]] produced by a [[prion]].

===Microbial culture===
[[Image:K pneumoniae M morganii providencia styphimuriuma.JPG|thumb|200px|Four [[nutrient agar]] plates growing colonies of common [[Gram negative]] bacteria.]]
[[Microbiological culture]] is a principal tool used to diagnose infectious disease. In a microbial culture, a [[growth medium]] is provided for a specific agent. A sample taken from potentially diseased tissue or fluid is then tested for the presence of an infectious agent able to grow within that medium. Most pathogenic bacteria are easily grown on nutrient [[Agar#Microbiology|agar]], a form of solid medium that supplies carbohydrates and proteins necessary for growth of a [[bacterium]], along with copious amounts of water. A single bacterium will grow into a visible mound on the surface of the plate called a [[Colony (biology)|colony]], which may be separated from other colonies or melded together into a &quot;lawn&quot;. The size, color, shape and form of a colony is characteristic of the bacterial species, its specific genetic makeup (its [[Strain (biology)|strain]]), and the environment which supports its growth. Other ingredients are often added to the plate to aid in identification. Plates may contain substances that permit the growth of some bacteria and not others, or that change color in response to certain bacteria and not others. Bacteriological plates such as these are commonly used in the clinical identification of infectious bacterium. Microbial culture may also be used in the identification of [[virus]]es: the medium in this case being cells grown in culture that the virus can infect, and then alter or kill. In the case of viral identification, a region of dead cells results from viral growth, and is called a &quot;plaque&quot;. [[Eukaryotic]] [[parasites]] may also be grown in culture as a means of identifying a particular agent.

In the absence of suitable plate culture techniques, some microbes require culture within live animals. Bacteria such as ''[[Mycobacterium leprae]]'' and ''[[Treponema pallidum|T. pallidum]]'' can be grown in animals, although serological and microscopic techniques make the use of live animals unnecessary. Viruses are also usually identified using alternatives to growth in culture or animals. Some viruses may be grown in [[embryo]]nated eggs. Another useful identification method is Xenodiagnosis, or the use of a vector to support the growth of an infectious agent. [[Chagas disease]] is the most significant example, because it is difficult to directly demonstrate the presence of the causative agent, ''[[Trypanosoma cruzi]]'' in a patient, which therefore makes it difficult to definitively make a diagnosis. In this case, xenodiagnosis involves the use of the [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] of the Chagas agent ''T. cruzi'', an uninfected [[Triatominae|triatomine]] bug, which takes a blood meal from a person suspected of having been infected. The bug is later inspected for growth of ''T. cruzi'' within its gut.

===Microscopy===
Another principal tool in the diagnosis of infectious disease is [[microscopy]]. Virtually all of the culture techniques discussed above rely, at some point, on microscopic examination for definitive identification of the infectious agent. Microscopy may be carried out with simple instruments, such as the compound [[light microscope]], or with instruments as complex as an [[electron microscope]]. Samples obtained from patients may be viewed directly under the light microscope, and can often rapidly lead to identification. Microscopy is often also used in conjunction with [[biochemical]] [[staining]] techniques, and can be made exquisitely specific when used in combination with [[antibody]] based techniques. For example, the use of [[antibodies]] made artificially [[fluorescent]] (fluorescently labeled antibodies) can be directed to bind to and identify a specific [[antigens]] present on a pathogen. A [[fluorescence microscope]] is then used to detect fluorescently labeled antibodies bound to internalized antigens within clinical samples or cultured cells. This technique is especially useful in the diagnosis of viral diseases, where the light microscope is incapable of identifying a virus directly.

Other microscopic procedures may also aid in identifying infectious agents. Almost all cells readily stain with a number of basic [[dye]]s due to the [[electrostatic]] attraction between negatively charged cellular molecules and the positive charge on the dye. A cell is normally transparent under a microscope, and using a stain increases the contrast of a cell with its background. Staining a cell with a dye such as [[Giemsa]] stain or [[crystal violet]] allows a microscopist to describe its size, shape, internal and external components and its associations with other cells. The response of bacteria to different staining procedures is used in the [[taxonomic classification]] of microbes as well. Two methods, the [[Gram stain]] and the [[acid-fast]] stain, are the standard approaches used to classify bacteria and to diagnosis of disease. The Gram stain identifies the bacterial groups [[Firmicutes]] and [[Actinobacteria]], both of which contain many significant human pathogens. The acid-fast staining procedure identifies the Actinobacterial genera ''[[Mycobacterium]]'' and ''[[Nocardia]]''.

===Biochemical tests===
Biochemical tests used in the identification of infectious agents include the detection of [[metabolic]] or [[enzymatic]] products characteristic of a particular infectious agent. Since bacteria ferment [[carbohydrate]]s in patterns characteristic of their [[genus]] and [[species]], the detection of [[Fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] products is commonly used in bacterial identification. [[Acids]], [[alcohols]] and [[gases]] are usually detected in these tests when bacteria are grown in [[Growth medium#Selective media|selective]] liquid or solid media.

The isolation of [[enzymes]] from infected tissue can also provide the basis of a biochemical diagnosis of an infectious disease. For example, humans can make neither [[RNA replicase]]s nor [[reverse transcriptase]], and the presence of these enzymes are characteristic of specific types of viral infections. The ability of the viral protein [[hemagglutinin]] to bind [[red blood cells]] together into a detectable matrix may also be characterized as a biochemical test for viral infection, although strictly speaking hemagglutinin is not an ''enzyme'' and has no metabolic function.

[[Serological]] methods are highly sensitive, specific and often extremely rapid tests used to identify microorganisms. These tests are based upon the ability of an antibody to bind specifically to an antigen. The antigen, usually a protein or carbohydrate made by an infectious agent, is bound by the antibody. This binding then sets off a chain of events that can be visibly obvious in various ways, dependent upon the test. For example, &quot;[[Strep throat]]&quot; is often diagnosed within minutes, and is based on the appearance of antigens made by the causative agent, ''[[S. pyogenes]]'', that is retrieved from a patients throat with a cotton swab. Serological tests, if available, are usually the preferred route of identification, however the tests are costly to develop and the reagents used in the test often require [[refrigeration]]. Some serological methods are extremely costly, although when commonly used, such as with the &quot;strep test&quot;, they can be inexpensive.&lt;ref name=Sherris/&gt;

Complex serological techniques have been developed into what are known as [[Immunoassays]]. Immunoassays can use the basic antibody – antigen binding as the basis to produce an electro - magnetic or particle radiation signal, which can be detected by some form of instrumentation. Signal of unknowns can be compared to that of standards allowing quantitation of the target antigen. To aid in the diagnosis of infectious diseases, immunoassays can detect or measure antigens from either infectious agents or proteins generated by an infected organism in response to a foreign agent. For example, immunoassay A may detect the presence of a surface protein from a virus particle. Immunoassay B on the other hand may detect or measure antibodies produced by an organism’s immune system which are made to neutralize and allow the destruction of the virus.

Instrumentation can be used to read extremely small signals created by secondary reactions linked to the antibody – antigen binding. Instrumentation can control sampling, reagent use, reaction times, signal detection, calculation of results, and data management to yield a cost effective automated process for diagnosis of infectious disease.

===Molecular diagnostics===
Technologies based upon the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) method will become nearly ubiquitous gold standards of diagnostics of the near future, for several reasons. First, the catalog of infectious agents has grown to the point that virtually all of the significant infectious agents of the human population have been identified. Second, an infectious agent must grow within the human body to cause disease; essentially it must amplify its own nucleic acids in order to cause a disease. This amplification of nucleic acid in infected tissue offers an opportunity to detect the infectious agent by using PCR. Third, the essential tools for directing PCR, [[Primer (molecular biology)|primers]], are derived from the [[genomes]] of infectious agents, and with time those genomes will be known, if they are not already.

Thus, the technological ability to detect any infectious agent rapidly and specifically are currently available. The only remaining blockades to the use of PCR as a standard tool of diagnosis are in its cost and application, neither of which is insurmountable. The diagnosis of a few diseases will not benefit from the development of PCR methods, such as some of the [[clostridia]]l diseases ([[tetanus]] and [[botulism]]). These diseases are fundamentally biological poisonings by relatively small numbers of infectious bacteria that produce extremely potent [[neurotoxin]]s. A significant proliferation of the infectious agent does not occur, this limits the ability of PCR to detect the presence of any bacteria.

===Indication of tests===
There is usually an [[indication (medicine)|indication]] for a specific identification of an infectious agent only when such identification can aid in the treatment or prevention of the disease, or to advance knowledge of the course of an illness prior to the development of effective therapeutic or preventative measures. For example, in the early 1980s, prior to the appearance of [[Zidovudine|AZT]] for the treatment of [[AIDS]], the course of the disease was closely followed by monitoring the composition of patient blood samples, even though the outcome would not offer the patient any further treatment options. In part, these studies on the appearance of [[HIV]] in specific communities permitted the advancement of [[hypotheses]] as to the route of transmission of the virus. By understanding how the disease was transmitted, resources could be targeted to the communities at greatest risk in campaigns aimed at reducing the number of new infections. The specific [[serological]] diagnostic identification, and later [[genotypic]] or molecular identification, of HIV also enabled the development of hypotheses as to the [[Time|temporal]] and [[geographic]]al origins of the virus, as well as a myriad of other hypothesis.&lt;ref name=Sherris/&gt;  The development of molecular diagnostic tools have enabled physicians and researchers to monitor the efficacy of treatment with [[anti-retroviral drugs]]. Molecular diagnostics are now commonly used to identify HIV in healthy people long before the onset of illness and have been used to demonstrate the existence of people who are genetically resistant to HIV infection. Thus, while there still is no cure for AIDS, there is great therapeutic and predictive benefit to identifying the virus and monitoring the virus levels within the blood of infected individuals, both for the patient and for the community at large.

===Historic pandemics===
[[Image:Child with Smallpox Bangladesh.jpg|thumb|A young [[Bangladesh]]i girl infected with smallpox (1973). Due to the development of the smallpox [[vaccine]], the disease was officially eradicated in 1979.]]
A [[pandemic]] (or global epidemic) is a disease that affects people over an extensive geographical area.
* [[Plague of Justinian]], from 541 to 750, killed between 50% and 60% of Europe's population.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eee.uci.edu/clients/bjbecker/PlaguesandPeople/lecture3.html Infectious and Epidemic Disease in History]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Black Death]] of 1347 to 1352 killed 25 million in Europe over 5 years (estimated to be between 25 and 50% of the populations of Europe, Asia, and Africa - the world population at the time was 500 million).
* The introduction of [[smallpox]], measles, and [[typhus]] to the areas of Central and South America by European explorers during the 15th and 16th centuries caused pandemics among the native inhabitants. Between 1518 and 1568 disease pandemics are said to have caused the population of [[Mexico]] to fall from 20 million to 3 million.&lt;ref name= Dobson&gt;Dobson, Andrew P. and E. Robin Carter (1996) [http://www.erin.utoronto.ca/~w3gwynne/BIO418/Dobson1996.pdf Infectious Diseases and Human Population History '''(full-text pdf)'''] Bioscience;46 2.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The first European [[influenza]] epidemic occurred between 1556 and 1560, with an estimated mortality rate of 20%.&lt;ref name= Dobson/&gt;
* [[Smallpox]] killed an estimated 60 million Europeans during the 18th century&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/nchist-twoworlds/1696 Smallpox]. ''North Carolina Digital History.''&lt;/ref&gt; (approximately 400,000 per year).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/bv.fcgi?rid=vacc.chapter.3 Smallpox and Vaccinia]. ''National Center for Biotechnology Information.''&lt;/ref&gt; Up to 30% of those infected, including 80% of the children under 5 years of age, died from the disease, and one-third of the survivors went blind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/127/8_Part_1/635 Smallpox: The Triumph over the Most Terrible of the Ministers of Death]&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the 19th century, [[tuberculosis]] killed an estimated one-quarter of the adult population of Europe;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdc.gov/TB/pubs/mdrtb/default.htm Multidrug-Resistant Tuberculosis]. ''Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.''&lt;/ref&gt; by 1918 one in six deaths in France were still caused by TB.
* The Influenza Pandemic of 1918 (or the [[Spanish Flu]]) killed 25-50 million people (about 2% of world population of 1.7 billion).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/library/online/influenza_main.htm Influenza of 1918 (Spanish Flu) and the US Navy]&lt;/ref&gt; Today [[Influenza]] kills about 250,000 to 500,000 worldwide each year.

===Emerging diseases===
In most cases, microorganisms live in harmony with their hosts via [[mutualism (biology)|mutual]] or [[commensalism|commensal]] interactions. Diseases can emerge when existing parasites become pathogenic or when new pathogenic parasites enter a new host.

#[[Coevolution]] between [[parasite]] and [[host (biology)|host]] can lead to hosts becoming [[Immune tolerance|resistant]] to the parasites or the parasites may evolve greater [[virulence]], leading to [[immunopathology|immunopathological disease]].
#Human activity is involved with many [[emerging infectious disease]]s, such as [[environment (ecology)|environmental change]] enabling a parasite to occupy new [[ecological niche|niche]]s. When that happens, a [[pathogen]] that had been confined to a remote habitat has a wider distribution and possibly a new [[host (biology)|host organism]]. Parasites jumping from nonhuman to human hosts are known as [[zoonosis|zoonoses]]. Under disease invasion, when a parasite invades a new host species, it may  become pathogenic in the new host.&lt;ref name= Krauss&gt;{{cite book |author=Krauss H |title=Zoonoses: Infectious Diseases Transmissible from Animals to Humans |publisher=ASM Press |location=Washington, D.C. |year=2003 |edition=3rd |isbn=1-55581-236-8 |author-separator=, |author2=Weber A |author3=Appel M |display-authors=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several human activities have led to the emergence and spread of new diseases,&lt;ref name= Krauss/&gt; see also [[Globalization and Disease]] and [[Wildlife disease]]:
* Encroachment on wildlife [[habitat]]s. The construction of new villages and housing developments in rural areas force animals to live in dense populations, creating opportunities for microbes to mutate and emerge.&lt;ref&gt;Daszak et al.: Emerging Infectious Diseases of Wildlife-- Threats to Biodiversity and Human Health., USA 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
* Changes in [[agriculture]]. The introduction of new crops attracts new crop pests and the microbes they carry to farming communities, exposing people to unfamiliar diseases.
* The destruction of [[rain forests]]. As countries make use of their rain forests, by building roads through forests and clearing areas for settlement or commercial ventures, people encounter insects and other animals harboring previously unknown microorganisms.
* Uncontrolled [[urbanization]]. The rapid growth of cities in many developing countries tends to concentrate large numbers of people into crowded areas with poor sanitation. These conditions foster transmission of contagious diseases.
* Modern [[transport]]. Ships and other cargo carriers often harbor unintended &quot;passengers&quot;, that can spread diseases to faraway destinations. While with international jet-airplane travel, people infected with a disease can carry it to distant lands, or home to their families, before their first symptoms appear.

==History==
[[Image:Stamps of Germany (DDR) 1980, MiNr Zusammendruck 2534-2537.jpg|thumb|[[East Germany|East German]] [[postage stamp]]s depicting four antique [[microscope]]s. Advancements in microscopy were essential to the early study of infectious diseases.]]

Ideas of contagion became more popular in Europe during the [[Renaissance]], particularly through the writing of the Italian physician [[Girolamo Fracastoro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Beretta M |title=The revival of Lucretian atomism and contagious diseases during the renaissance |journal=Medicina nei secoli |volume=15 |issue=2 |pages=129–54 |year=2003 |pmid=15309812}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anton van Leeuwenhoek]] (1632–1723) advanced the science of [[microscopy]] by being the first to observe microorganisms, allowing for easy visualization of bacteria.

In the mid-19th century [[John Snow (physician)|John Snow]] and [[William Budd]] did important work demonstrating the contagiousness of typhoid and cholera through contaminated water. Both are credited with decreasing epidemics of cholera in their towns by implementing measures to prevent contamination of water.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Moorhead, &quot;[http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1279260/ William Budd and typhoid fever]&quot;. Retrieved March 7, 2010.  ''J R Soc Med.'' 2002 November; 95(11): 561–564.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louis Pasteur]] proved way beyond doubt that certain diseases are caused by infectious agents, and developed a vaccine for [[rabies]].

[[Robert Koch]], provided the study of infectious diseases with a scientific basis known as [[Koch's postulates]].

[[Edward Jenner]], [[Jonas Salk]] and [[Albert Sabin]] developed effective vaccines for [[smallpox]] and [[polio]], which would later result in the  [[eradication of infectious diseases|eradication]] and near-eradication of these diseases, respectively.

[[Alexander Fleming]] discovered the world's first [[antibiotic]] [[Penicillin]] which Florey and Chain then developed.

[[Gerhard Domagk]] developed [[sulfonamide (medicine)|sulphonamides]], the first broad spectrum [[Chemical synthesis|synthetic]] antibacterial drugs.

===Medical specialists===
The [[medicine|medical treatment]] of infectious diseases falls into the medical field of '''Infectiology''' and in some cases the study of propagation pertains to the field of  [[Epidemiology]]. Generally, [[infection]]s are initially diagnosed by [[primary care]] physicians or [[internal medicine]] specialists. For example, an &quot;uncomplicated&quot; [[pneumonia]] will generally be treated by the [[internist]] or the [[pulmology|pulmonologist]] (lung physician).The work of the infectiologist therefore entails working with both patients and general practitioners, as well as [[Research|laboratory scientists]], [[immunology|immunologists]], [[bacteriology|bacteriologists]] and other specialists.

An infectious disease team may be alerted when:
* The disease has not been definitively diagnosed after an initial workup
* The patient is [[immunocompromised]] (for example, in [[AIDS]] or after [[chemotherapy]]);
* The [[infectious agent]] is of an uncommon nature (e.g. [[tropical disease]]s);
* The disease has not responded to first line [[antibiotic]]s;
* The disease might be dangerous to other patients, and the patient might have to be isolated

==Society and culture ==
A number of studies have reported associations between pathogen load in an area and human behavior. Higher pathogen load is associated with decreased size of ethnic and religious groups in an area. This  may be due high pathogen load favoring avoidance other groups which may reduce pathogen transmission or a high pathogen load preventing the creation of large settlements and armies which enforce a common culture. Higher pathogen load is also associated with more restricted sexual behavior which may reduce pathogen transmission. It also associated with higher preferences for health and attractiveness in mates. Higher [[fertility rate]]s and shorter or less parental care per child is another association which may be a compensation for the higher mortality rate. There is also an association with [[polygyny]] which may be due to higher pathogen load making selecting males with a high genetic resistance increasingly important. Higher pathogen load is also associated with more collectivism and less individualism which may limit contacts with outside groups and infections. There are alternative explanations for at least some of the associations although some of these explanations may in turn ultimately be due to pathogen load. Thus, polygny may also be due to a lower male:female ratio in these areas but this may ultimately be due to male infants having increased mortality from infectious diseases. Another example is that poor socioeconomic factors may ultimately in part be due to high pathogen load preventing economic development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite doi|10.1016/j.tree.2009.05.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Pathogenic bacteria are bacteria that cause '''bacterial infectious disease|infection'''. This article deals with human pathogenic bacteria.

Although the vast majority of bacteria are harmless or beneficial, quite a few bacteria are pathogenic. One of the bacterial diseases with highest disease burden is tuberculosis, caused by the bacterium ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis'', which kills about 2 million people a year, mostly in sub-Saharan Africa. Pathogenic bacteria contribute to other globally important diseases, such as pneumonia, which can be caused by bacteria such as ''Streptococcus'' and ''Pseudomonas'', and foodborne illnesses, which can be caused by bacteria such as ''Shigella'', ''Campylobacter'' and ''Salmonella''. Pathogenic bacteria also cause infections such as tetanus, typhoid fever, diphtheria, syphilis and leprosy. 

Koch's postulates are criteria designed to establish a causal relationship between a causative microbe and a disease.

==Diseases==
Each pathogenic species has a characteristic spectrum of interactions with its human host (biology)|hosts.

===Conditionally pathogenic===
Conditionally pathogenic bacteria are only pathogenic under certain conditions, such as a wound that allows for entry into the blood, or a decrease in immune function.

For example, ''Staphylococcus'' or ''Streptococcus'' are also part of the normal human flora and usually exist on the skin or in the nose without causing disease, but can potentially cause skin infections, pneumonia, meningitis and even overwhelming sepsis, a systemic inflammatory response producing shock, massive vasodilation and death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fish DN |title=Optimal antimicrobial therapy for sepsis |journal=Am J Health Syst Pharm |volume=59 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=S13–9 |year=2002 |month=February |pmid=11885408 |url=http://www.ajhp.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=11885408}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some species of bacteria, such as ''Pseudomonas aeruginosa'', ''Burkholderia cenocepacia'', and ''Mycobacterium avium complex|Mycobacterium avium'', are opportunistic infection|opportunistic pathogens and cause disease mainly in people suffering from immunosuppression or cystic fibrosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Heise E | title = Diseases associated with immunosuppression | pmc=1568899 | journal = Environ Health Perspect | volume = 43 | issue = |pages=9–19 |year=1982 |pmid=7037390 |doi=10.2307/3429162 | jstor=3429162}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Saiman&gt;{{cite journal |author=Saiman L |title=Microbiology of early CF lung disease |journal=Paediatr Respir Rev |volume=5 |issue=Suppl A |pages=S367–9 |year=2004 |pmid=14980298 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1526054204900656 |doi=10.1016/S1526-0542(04)90065-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intracellular===
Other organisms invariably cause disease in humans, such as obligate intracellular parasites that are able to grow and reproduce only within the cells of other organisms. Still, infections with intracellular bacteria may be asymptomatic, such as during the incubation period. An example of intracellular bacteria is ''Rickettsia''. One species of ''Rickettsia'' causes typhus, while another causes Rocky Mountain spotted fever. 

Chlamydia (bacterium)|Chlamydia, another phylum of obligate intracellular parasites, contains species that can cause pneumonia, or urinary tract infection and may be involved in coronary heart disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Belland R, Ouellette S, Gieffers J, Byrne G | title = Chlamydia pneumoniae and atherosclerosis | journal = Cell Microbiol | volume = 6 |issue=2 |pages=117–27 |year=2004 |pmid=14706098 |doi=10.1046/j.1462-5822.2003.00352.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Mycobacterium'' and ''Brucella'' can exist intracellularly, though they are facultative (not obligate intracellular parasites.)

===By location===
Following is a list of bacterial infections classified by location in the body:
*Bacterial vaginosis is a disease of the vagina caused by an imbalance of naturally occurring bacterial flora and is often confused with yeast infection (candidiasis), or infection with ''Trichomonas vaginalis'' (trichomoniasis), which are not caused by bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://women.webmd.com/features/is-it-yeast-infection |author=Terri Warren, RN |title=Is It a Yeast Infection? |year=2010 |accessdate=2011-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0029-7844(01)01759-8 |author=Ferris DG, Nyirjesy P, Sobel JD, Soper D, Pavletic A, Litaker MS |year=2002 |month=March |title=Over-the-counter antifungal drug misuse associated with patient-diagnosed vulvovaginal candidiasis |journal=Obstetrics and Gynecology |volume=99 |issue=3 |pages=419–425 |pmid=11864668 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Bacterial meningitis is a bacterial inflammation of the meninges, that is, the protective membranes covering the brain and spinal cord.
*Bacterial pneumonia is a bacterial infection of the lungs.
*Urinary tract infection is almost exclusively caused by bacteria. Symptoms include frequent feeling and/or need to urinate, pain during urination, and cloudy urine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenet.com/urine_infection/page4.htm|title=Urinary Tract Infections|accessdate=2010-02-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The main causal agent is ''Escherichia coli''. Although urine contains a variety of fluids, salts, and waste products, it does not usually have bacteria in it,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.med.umich.edu/1libr/aha/aha_asybac_crs.htm|title=Adult Health Advisor 2005.4: Bacteria in Urine, No Symptoms (Asymptomatic Bacteriuria)|accessdate=2007-08-25|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20070712060000/http://www.med.umich.edu/1libr/aha/aha_asybac_crs.htm|archivedate=2007-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; but when bacteria get into the Urinary bladder|bladder or kidney and multiply in the urine, they may cause a UTI.
*Bacterial gastroenteritis is caused by pathogenic enteric bacteria. Such pathogenic enteric bacteria are generally distinguished from the usually harmless bacteria of the normal gut flora, but the distinction is often not fully clear, and ''Escherichia'', for example, can belong to either group.
*Bacterial skin infections include:
** Impetigo is a highly contagious bacterial human skin|skin infection most common among pre-school children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nhs.uk/conditions/Impetigo/Pages/Introduction.aspx NHS Impetigo]&lt;/ref&gt; It is primarily caused by ''Staphylococcus aureus'', and sometimes by ''Streptococcus pyogenes''.&lt;ref name=Robbins&gt;Kumar, Vinay; Abbas, Abul K.; Fausto, Nelson; &amp; Mitchell, Richard N. (2007). ''Robbins Basic Pathology'' (8th ed.). Saunders Elsevier. pp. 843 ISBN 978-1-4160-2973-1&lt;/ref&gt;
** Erysipelas is an acute streptococcus bacterial infection&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|three/000036667|erysipelas}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the deep epidermis with lymphatic spread.
** Cellulitis is a diffuse inflammation&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|two/000019077|cellulitis}}&lt;/ref&gt; of connective tissue with severe inflammation of dermal and subcutaneous layers of the skin. Cellulitis can be caused by normal skin flora or by exogenous bacteria, and often occurs where the skin has previously been broken: cracks in the skin, cuts, blisters, burn (injury)|burns, insect bites, surgical wounds, intravenous drug injection or sites of intravenous catheter insertion.  Skin on the face or lower legs is most commonly affected by this infection, though cellulitis can occur on any part of the body.

==Treatment==
{{main|Antibiotics}}
:''See also Pathogenic bacteria#Clinical characteristics|overview list below''

Bacterial infections may be treated with antibiotics, which are classified as bacteriocide|bacteriocidal if they kill bacteria, or bacteriostatic if they just prevent bacterial growth. There are many types of antibiotics and each class enzyme inhibitor|inhibits a process that is different in the pathogen from that found in the host. For example, the antibiotics chloramphenicol and tetracyclin inhibit the bacterial ribosome, but not the structurally-different eukaryotic ribosome, and so exhibit selective toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Yonath A, Bashan A | title = Ribosomal crystallography: initiation, peptide bond formation, and amino acid polymerization are hampered by antibiotics |journal=Annu Rev Microbiol |volume=58 |pages=233–51 |year=2004 |pmid=15487937 |doi=10.1146/annurev.micro.58.030603.123822}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antibiotics are used both in treating human disease and in intensive farming to promote animal growth. Both uses may be contributing to the rapid development of antibiotic resistance in bacterial populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Khachatourians GG |title=Agricultural use of antibiotics and the evolution and transfer of antibiotic-resistant bacteria |journal=CMAJ |volume=159 |issue=9 |pages=1129–36 |year=1998 |month=November |pmid=9835883 |pmc=1229782 |doi= |url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/pmidlookup?view=reprint&amp;pmid=9835883}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infections can be prevented by antiseptic measures such as sterilizing the skin prior to piercing it with the needle of a syringe, and by proper care of indwelling catheters. Surgical and dental instruments are also Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilized to prevent infection by bacteria. Disinfectants such as bleach are used to kill bacteria or other pathogens on surfaces to prevent contamination and further reduce the risk of infection. Most bacteria in food are killed by cooking to temperatures above 73 °C (163°F).

      <text xml:space="preserve">{{H5N1}}{{Flu}}
An '''influenza pandemic''' is a large scale [[epidemic]] of the [[influenza]] [[virus]], such as the [[1918]] [[Spanish flu]].  The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) warns that there is a substantial risk of an influenza [[pandemic]] within the next few years.  One of the strongest candidates is a highly pathogenic variation of the [[H5N1]] subtype of [[Influenza A virus]] which is rapidly mutating and could mutate into a variation that transmits easily human to human causing a pandemic. If such a mutation occurs, it might remain an H5N1 subtype or could  shift subtypes as did [[H2N2]] when it evolved into the [[Hong Kong Flu]] strain of [[H3N2]]. For the purpose of flu pandemic preparedness, prepandemic [[flu vaccine]]s are being developed against the most likely suspects which include [[H5N1]], [[H7N1]], and [[H9N2]].&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/panflu/news/sep1906vaccine.html CIDRAP] article ''Sanofi tests H7N1 flu vaccine for pandemic readiness'' published September 19, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; 

Influenza pandemics occur inevitably but at unpredictable intervals. When the next flu pandemic strikes, an outbreak is expected to last about six to eight weeks in each affected community, although multiple waves could occur. High employee absenteeism rates are expected that could disrupt businesses and essential services such as hospitals, police, fire, utilities (water, electricity, communications), garbage pickup and food distribution.&lt;ref&gt; [http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,660208730,00.html Deseret News] article ''Utah influenza report paints a dire picture'' published April 4, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; 

There are three [[genus|genera]] of influenza virus, identified by antigenic differences in their [[nucleoprotein]] and [[matrix protein]]:
* [[Influenzavirus A]] are the cause of all [[flu pandemic]]s and are known to infect [[human]]s, other [[mammal]]s and [[bird]]s (see also [[avian influenza]]),
* [[Influenzavirus B]] are known to infect [[human]]s and [[pinniped|seal]]s,
* [[Influenzavirus C]] are known to infect [[human]]s and [[pig]]s.

==Influenza==
{{main|Influenza}}
Influenza, commonly known as flu, is an [[infectious disease]] of [[bird]]s and [[mammal]]s caused by an [[RNA virus]] of the [[biological family|family]] [[Orthomyxoviridae]] (the influenza viruses). In humans, common symptoms of influenza infection are [[fever]], [[pharyngitis|sore throat]], [[myalgia|muscle pains]], severe [[headache]], [[cough]]ing, and [[malaise|weakness and fatigue]].&lt;ref name=Merck&gt;{{cite web |author= Merck Manual Home Edition |title=Influenza: Viral Infections |url= http://www.merck.com/mmhe/sec17/ch198/ch198c.html?}}&lt;/ref&gt; In more serious cases, influenza [[sequela|causes]] [[pneumonia]], which can be fatal, particularly in young children and the elderly. Sometimes confused with the [[common cold]], influenza is a much more severe disease and is caused by a different type of virus.&lt;ref name=Eccles&gt;{{cite journal | last = Eccles | first = R | title = Understanding the symptoms of the common cold and influenza | journal = Lancet Infect Dis | volume = 5 | issue = 11 | pages = 718–25 | year = 2005 | id = PMID 16253889}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[nausea]] and [[vomiting]] can be produced, especially in children,&lt;ref name=Merck/&gt; these symptoms are more characteristic of the unrelated [[gastroenteritis]], which is sometimes called &quot;stomach flu&quot; or &quot;24-hour flu.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; [http://coldflu.about.com/od/flumisconceptions/f/stomachflu.htm Seasonal Flu vs. Stomach Flu] by Kristina Duda, R.N.; accessed March 12, 2007 (Website: &quot;About, Inc., A part of The New York Times Company&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;

Typically, influenza is transmitted from infected mammals through the air by coughs or sneezes, creating [[particulate|aerosols]] containing the virus, and from infected birds through their [[feces|droppings]].  Influenza can also be transmitted by [[saliva]], [[mucus|nasal secretions]], [[feces]] and [[blood]].  Infections occur through contact with these bodily fluids or with contaminated surfaces. Flu viruses can remain infectious for about one week at human body temperature, over 30 days at 0 [[Celsius|°C]] (32 [[Fahrenheit|°F]]), and indefinitely at very low temperatures (such as lakes in northeast [[Siberia]]). Most influenza strains can be inactivated easily by [[disinfectant]]s and [[detergent]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Suarez | first = D | coauthors = Spackman E, Senne D, Bulaga L, Welsch A, Froberg K | title = The effect of various disinfectants on detection of avian influenza virus by real time RT-PCR | journal = Avian Dis | volume = 47 | issue = 3 Suppl | pages = 1091–5 | year = 2003 | id = PMID 14575118}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/avianflu/biofacts/avflu_human.html  Avian Influenza (Bird Flu)]: Implications for Human Disease.

Flu spreads around the world in seasonal [[epidemic]]s, killing millions of people in [[pandemic]] years and hundreds of thousands in non-pandemic years. Three influenza pandemics occurred in the 20th century and killed tens of millions of people, with each of these pandemics being caused by the appearance of a new [[strain (biology)|strain]] of the virus in humans. Often, these new strains result from the spread of an existing flu virus to humans from other animal [[species]]. Since it first killed humans in Asia in the 1990s, a deadly avian strain of [[H5N1]] has posed the greatest risk for a new influenza pandemic; however, this virus has not [[mutation|mutated]] to spread easily between people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Avian influenza (&quot;bird flu&quot;) fact sheet | url= http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/avian_influenza/en/ | date=February 2006 | publisher=WHO | accessdate=2006-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antiviral drug]]s can be used to treat influenza, with [[neuraminidase inhibitor]]s being particularly effective.

==Pandemic==
{{main|Pandemic}}
A pandemic (from [[Greek language|Greek]] παν ''pan'' all + δήμος ''demos'' people) is an [[epidemic]] (an outbreak of an [[infectious disease]]) that spreads across a large region (for example a continent), or even worldwide.

==Nature of a flu pandemic==
Some pandemics are relatively minor and can be contained quickly such as the one in 1957 which only killed around a million people throughout the world. The mutation in the virus that causes the high infection rate may also cause the virus to be less deadly as it needs to pass from host to host and replicate itself. 

In a bad pandemic, some communities attempt to cut themselves off totally while others have half (or more) of their population die, and others may not feel many of the effects but may still be affected due to the high degree of illness and the bereavement felt by the members of the community. Desperate people try anything to cure or prevent the illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In the worst months of the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, doctors failing to save patients tried all sorts of outlandish 'cures'. Cupping and bleeding made comebacks. Intravenous hydrogen peroxide was tried, sometimes fatally. One doctor injected a mix of blister fluid, morphine, strychnine and caffeine. Typhoid vaccine was given, since it prompts immune reactions; so was quinine, because it breaks malarial fevers.&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;
The 1918 pandemic killed around 150,000 people in the UK, but even the loss of this relatively small number of people in the population caused upheaval and psychological damage to many people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;/ref&gt; There are not enough doctors, hospital rooms, or medical supplies for the living due to their contracting the disease and dead bodies often lie unburied as few people are available to deal with them. There is great social disruption and a sense of fear and efforts to deal with the pandemic always leave a great deal to be desired due to selfishness, lack of trust, illegal behavior, and ignorance. For example in the 1918 pandemic &quot;This horrific disconnect between reassurances and reality destroyed the credibility of those in authority.

===Variable mortality===
Mortality varies widely in a pandemic. In the [[1918]] pandemic:

:In U.S. Army camps where reasonably reliable statistics were kept, case mortality often exceeded 5 percent, and in some circumstances exceeded 10 percent. In the British Army in India, case mortality for white troops was 9.6 percent, for Indian troops 21.9 percent. In isolated human populations, the virus killed at even higher rates. In the Fiji islands, it killed 14 percent of the entire population in 16 days. In Labrador and Alaska, it killed at least one-third of the entire native population. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Spanish Flu (1918–1920)==
{{main|Spanish flu}}
The 1918 flu pandemic, commonly referred to as the Spanish flu, was a [[Pandemic Severity Index|category 5]] influenza pandemic between 1918 and 1920 caused by an unusually severe and deadly  [[Influenza A virus]] [[Strain (biology)|strain]] of subtype [[H1N1]]. By far the most destructive pandemic in history, it killed some 50 million to 100 million people worldwide in just 18 months, &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nap.edu/books/0309095042/html/7.html NAP]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.influenzareport.com/ir/overview.htm Influenza Report]&lt;/ref&gt; dwarfing the bloodshed due to [[World War I]] (1914-1918).

HPAI A(H5N1) is an avian disease. There is no evidence of efficient human-to-human transmission or of airborne transmission of HPAI A(H5N1) to humans. In almost all cases, those infected with H5N1 had extensive physical contact with infected birds. Still, around 60% of humans known to have been infected with the current Asian strain of HPAI A(H5N1) have died from it, and H5N1 may [[mutation|mutate]] or [[reassortment|reassort]] into a strain capable of efficient human-to-human transmission. In 2003, world-renowned virologist [[Robert Webster]] published an article titled &quot;The world is teetering on the edge of a pandemic that could kill a large fraction of the human population&quot; in ''[[American Scientist]]''. He called for adequate resources to fight what he sees as a major world threat to possibly billions of lives.&lt;ref name=webster&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Experts have identified key events (creating new [[clade]]s, infecting new species, spreading to new areas) marking the progression of an avian flu virus towards becoming pandemic, and many of those key events have occurred more rapidly than expected.

Due to the high lethality and [[virulence]] of HPAI A(H5N1), its endemic presence, its increasingly large [[host (biology)|host]] reservoir, and its significant ongoing mutations, the H5N1 virus is the world's largest current pandemic threat, and billions of dollars are being spent researching H5N1 and preparing for a potential influenza pandemic.&lt;ref name=Rosenthal&gt;

To have a flu pandemic several distinct phases must happen. [[H5N1]]'s next phase is easy person to person transmission. After that occurs, it is theoretically possible to stop it before it becomes an epidemic, or if that opportunity is missed, to stop the epidemic before it becomes a pandemic. It is widely believed by the experts that it will not be possible to prevent any of these phases from occurring with [[H5N1]], but if we are lucky enough to delay it for a few years, we might come up with a solution such as a [[flu vaccine]].

[[H5N1]] is just one of the many subtypes of the species [[Influenza A virus]]. Any one of them can combine with each other or with different variant genotypes within its own subtype creating new variants, any one of which could become a pandemic strain. We know enough about the genetics to know what strains to fear most (example: only H5 and H7 subtypes are &quot;highly pathogenic&quot;) and we know what genetic factors make a flu virus a human virus (i.e. easily passed human to human); so we know H5N1 is the biggest pandemic threat of all the strains in circulation and we know it is only a few [[antigenic shift]] mutations or [[antigenic drift]] mutations from being an [[avian flu]] virus to being a [[human flu]] virus. If it does this it may or may not still be in the H5N1 subtype. Both the drift and the shift can happen in any infected animal and then be passed to a human and spread like wildfire. Possible shift scenarios include the shift occurring in humans, pigs, or cats. To acquire the needed mutation through drift, it simply has to continue being an epidemic in birds long enough for the mutations to occur and then be passed to a human.

If influenza remains an animal problem with limited human-to-human transmission it is not a pandemic, though it continues to pose a risk. To prevent the situation from progressing to a pandemic, the following short-term strategies have been put forward:
* Culling and [[Vaccination|vaccinating]] livestock
* Vaccinating poultry workers against common flu
* Limiting travel in areas where the virus is found&lt;ref name=&quot;The Threat of Global Pandemics&quot;/&gt;

The rationale for vaccinating poultry workers against common flu is that it reduces the probability of common influenza virus recombining with avian H5N1 virus to form a pandemic strain. Longer term strategies proposed for regions where highly pathogenic H5N1 is endemic in wild birds have included:
*changing local [[farming]] practices to increase farm hygiene and reduce contact between [[livestock]] and wild birds.
*altering farming practices in regions where animals live in close, often unsanitary quarters with people, and changing the practices of open-air &quot;[[wet markets]]&quot; where birds. A challenge to implementing these measures is widespread poverty, frequently in rural areas, coupled with a reliance upon raising fowl for purposes of [[subsistence farming]] or income without measures to prevent propagation of the disease.
*changing local shopping practices from purchase of live fowl to purchase of slaughtered, pre-packaged fowl.
*improving veterinary [[vaccine]] availability and cost.&lt;ref name=&quot;The Threat of Global Pandemics&quot;/&gt;

==Strategies to slow down a flu pandemic==
{{seealso|Flu research}}

===Vaccines===
A [[vaccine]] probably would not be available in the initial stages of population infection &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdc.gov/flu/avian/gen-info/pandemics.htm CDC]&lt;/ref&gt;. Once a potential virus is identified, it normally takes at least several months before a vaccine becomes widely available, as it must be developed, tested and authorized. The capability to produce vaccines varies widely from country to country; in fact, only 19 countries are listed as &quot;Influenza vaccine manufacturers&quot; according to the World Health Organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
  | title = Influenza vaccine manufacturers
  | publisher = [[World Health Organization]]
  | url = http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/manulist/en/index.html
  | accessdate = 2006-09-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is estimated that, in a best scenario situation, 750 million doses could be produced each year, whereas it is likely that each individual would need two doses of the vaccine in order to become inmuno-competent. Distribution to and inside countries would probably be problematic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | publisher = Phacilitate
  | url = http://www.phacilitate.co.uk/pages/phaciliate/article_fedson.html
  | accessdate = 2006-09-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several countries, however, have well-developed plans for producing large quantities of vaccine. For example, [[Canada|Canadian]] health authorities say that they are developing the capacity to produce 32 million doses within four months, enough vaccine to inoculate every person in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news 
  | title = Canada to launch avian flu vaccine trial

  | accessdate = 2006-09-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two serious technical problems associated with the development of a vaccine against H5N1.  The first problem is this: seasonal influenza vaccines require a single injection of 15 μg haemagluttinin in order to give protection; H5 seems to evoke only a weak immune response and a large multicentre trial found that two injections of 90 µg H5 given 28 days apart provided protection in only 54% of people {{Harv|Treanor|2006}}.  Even if it is considered that 54% is an acceptable level of protection, the world is currently capable of producing only 900 million doses at a strength of 15 μg (assuming that all production were immediately converted to manufacturing H5 vaccine); if two injections of 90 μg are needed then this capacity drops to only 70 million {{Harv|Poland|2006}}.  Trials using [[adjuvant]]s such as [[alum]] or [[MF59]] to try and lower the dose of vaccine are urgently needed.  The second problem is this: there are two circulating [[clade]]s of virus, clade 1 is the virus originally isolated in Vietnam, clade 2 is the virus isolated in Indonesia.  Current vaccine research is focussed on clade 1 viruses, but the clade 2 virus is antigenically distinct and a clade 1 vaccine will probably not protect against a pandemic caused by clade 2 virus.

===Anti-viral drugs===
Many nations, as well as the World Health Organization, are working to stockpile [[anti-viral drug]]s in preparation for a possible pandemic.  [[Oseltamivir]] (trade name Tamiflu) is the most commonly sought drug, since it is available in pill form.  [[Zanamivir]] 
(trade name Relenza) is also considered for use, but it must be inhaled.  Other anti-viral drugs are less likely to be effective against pandemic influenza.

Both Tamiflu and Relenza are in short supply, and production capabilities are limited in the medium term. Some doctors say that co-administration of Tamiflu with [[probenecid]] could double supplies &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7064/full/438006a.html Nature]&lt;/ref&gt;.

There also is the potential of viruses to evolve drug resistance.  Some H5N1-infected persons treated with oseltamivir have developed resistant strains of that virus.

Tamiflu was originally discovered by [[Gilead Sciences]] and licensed to Roche for late-phase development and marketing.

[[Donald Rumsfeld]], a shareholder in [[Gilead Sciences]], has profited from the US government stockpiling of [[oseltamivir]] in case of an influenza pandemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

* '''Social distance'''.  By travelling less, working from home or closing schools there is less opportunity for the virus to spread.
* '''Respiratory hygiene'''. Populations should be repeatedly informed of the need for &quot;respiratory hygiene&quot; (covering mouth when coughing or sneezing, careful disposal of soiled tissues or other materials). 
* '''[[Surgical mask|Masks]]'''.  No mask can provide a perfect barrier but products that meet or exceed the [[NIOSH]] N95 standard recommended by the [[World Health Organization]] are thought to provide good protection.  [[WHO]] recommends that health-care workers wear N95 masks and that patients wear surgical masks (which may prevent respiratory secretions from becoming airborne).&lt;ref name=&quot;non-pharm-interven&quot;/&gt;  Any mask may be useful to remind the wearer not to touch his face. This can reduce infection due to contact with contaminated surfaces, especially in crowded public places where coughing or sneezing people have no way of washing their hands.  The mask itself can become contaminated and must be handled as medical waste when removed.
* '''Hygiene'''. Frequent handwashing, especially when there has been contact with other people or with potentially contaminated surfaces can be very helpful.  Alcohol-based hand sanitizers also kill both bacteria and viruses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Strategies for individuals in a flu pandemic==
In the case of a flu pandemic, to avoid the risk of contracting H5N1 (or indeed, any other strain of the flu virus) people may have to take certain precautions, and make changes to their routine, to minimize the risk of infection. They may also have to prepare for the possibility of their lives being disrupted in a significant way, even if they do not actually become ill. 

===Social disruption===
A flu pandemic could cause major disruption to everyday life, with footpaths and the countryside being partially or even totally off-limits, and even restrictions on public gatherings (such as public meetings, parties, services at places of worship), quarantine, and bans on individuals travelling to certain locations. However, there are a number of things people could do to prepare themselves:

* Plan for the possibility that usual services may be disrupted. These could include services provided by hospitals and other health care facilities, banks, stores, restaurants, government offices, and post offices. Think of a back-up plan - what would you do, for example, if you could not buy food from the supermarket, because it was closed? 
* Think about the possibility of having to grow your own food, and if it is possible, &quot;stock up&quot; on essentials. 
* Prepare backup plans in case public gatherings are cancelled - keep in touch via telephone, for instance.
* Consider how to care for people with special needs or with severe illnesses or disabilities in case the services they rely on are not available - could medicine be delivered to the house, for instance?

===Work===
* Find out if you can work from home. 
* Ask your employer about how business will continue during a pandemic. &lt;ref&gt;(A Business Pandemic Influenza Planning Checklist is available at this [http://www.pandemicflu.gov/plan/businesschecklist.html U.S. government website].)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Plan for the possible reduction or loss of income if you are unable to work or your place of employment is closed.
* Check with your employer or union about sick leave policies.

===Education===
* Help your child's school plan for pandemic influenza. Talk to the school nurse or the health center. Talk to your teachers, administrators, and parent-teacher organizations, and help them put together a strategy if they have not already done so. 
* Be prepared for the idea that you might have to teach your kids at home. Have textbooks, audiotapes etc on hand, and prepare some exercises for the children to do so that their education doesn't suffer. Also plan recreational activities that your children can do at home, so that they do not begin to suffer from boredom. Video games, the Internet, and your home library are three forms of entertainment that are still easily accessible during a quarantine.
* Be prepared for the possibility of your child's school being closed for a prolonged period of time, meaning that your child, and probably you, will be stuck at home.

===Transport===
* Think about how you can rely less on public transport during a pandemic. For example, store or grow food and other essential supplies so you can make fewer trips to the store. Stock up on gas so that you don't have to use the bus or train. 
* Prepare backup plans for taking care of loved ones who are far away. Make sure you keep in touch with these people on a regular basis.

===Organizing===
* Think about what information the people in your workplace will need if you are a manager. This may include information about insurance, leave policies, working from home, possible loss of income, and when not to come to work if sick. &lt;ref&gt;(A Business Pandemic Influenza Planning Checklist is available at this [http://www.pandemicflu.gov/plan/businesschecklist.html US Government website].)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Meet with your colleagues and make lists of things that you will need to know and what actions can be taken. For example, does everyone have access to a computer or a fax machine in the event that the business has to close? 
* Find volunteers who want to help people in need, such as elderly neighbors, single parents of small children, or people without the resources to get the medical help they will need. You could become a volunteer yourself as there are plenty of people who will need your help. 
* Make sure that those close to you know the risks and are safe and sensible, not putting themselves in danger of infection. 
* Provide support to friends, family and others in your community who need it.

===Food storage===
Keep a supply of water and food. During a pandemic you may not be able to get to a store. Even if you can get to a store, it may be out of supplies or it may not be safe to enter it. Public waterworks services may also be interrupted. Stocking supplies can be useful in other types of emergencies. Store foods that:

* are nonperishable (will keep for a long time) and don’t require refrigeration - such as tinned fruit, condensed milk, etc
* are easy to prepare in case you are unable to cook
* require little or no water, so you can conserve water for drinking

===Personal health and hygiene===&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Influenza]] --&gt;
Will the seasonal flu shot protect me against pandemic influenza?

* No, it won't protect you against pandemic influenza. But flu shots can help you to stay healthy.
* Get a flu shot to help protect yourself from seasonal flu.
* Get a pneumonia shot to prevent secondary infection if you are over the age of 65 or have a chronic illness such as [[diabetes]] or [[asthma]]. 
* For specific guidelines, talk to your GP or another healthcare provider. 
* Make sure that your family's immunizations are up-to-date.

Take common-sense steps to limit the spread of germs. Make good hygiene a habit. 

* Wash hands frequently. Touching your face with contaminated hands can infect you with human-adapted flu viruses. 
* Cover your mouth and nose with a tissue when you cough or sneeze. Put used tissues in a waste basket. Do not use cloth or other reuseable methods. Reuseables spread flu.
* Clean your hands after coughing or sneezing. Use soap and water or an alcohol-based hand cleaner.
* Stay at home if you are sick.

It is always a good idea to practice good health habits.

* Eat a balanced diet. Be sure to eat a variety of foods, including plenty of vegetables, fruits, and whole grain products. Also include low-fat dairy products, lean meats, poultry, fish, and beans. Drink lots of water and go easy on salt, sugar, alcohol, and saturated fat.
* Exercise on a regular basis and get plenty of rest.

===Stocks and investments===
Experts agree that a lethal pandemic will have a negative effect on the world and local economies.  
* Review your portfolio for vulnerabilities.  While some sectors of the economy might benefit, most will suffer from absenteeism and lost productivity, lost sales and potentially higher prices for some commodities.  Some businesses may be forced to cut hours or close. 
* Travel, tourism and the hospitality industry will be directly impacted as people avoid unnecessary contact with strangers.  
* Modern just-in-time inventory management makes manufacturers and retailers more vulnerable to disruptions in the supply chain.  Even companies whose products and services are in demand during a pandemic (hospitals, supermarkets) could suffer supply shortfalls.  
* You may not have the option of waiting out a downturn. You or family members may suffer loss of income and be forced to liquidate investments at a disadvantageous time.  Cash-equivalent investments such as money market funds or treasury bills offer relatively higher safety and liquidity.
* Bear market [[mutual funds]] offer a hedge or an investment strategy in down markets. 
* Have some cash on hand for emergencies.  Banks may not maintain normal hours and ATMs may not be restocked.

==Phases of an influenza pandemic==
The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed a global influenza preparedness plan, which defines the stages of a pandemic, outlines WHO's role and makes recommendations for national measures before and during a pandemic. &lt;ref&gt;The [[World Health Organization]] announces the current phase of the pandemic alert [http://www.who.int/csr/disease/avian_influenza/phase/en/index.html here].

See &quot;Assessing the pandemic threat&quot; at [http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/en/]. WHO published a first edition of the Global Influenza Preparedness Plan in [[1999]], and updated it in [[April 2005]].  See [http://www.who.int/csr/disease/influenza/pandemic/en/index.html] and [http://www.who.int/csr/resources/publications/influenza/WHO_CDS_CSR_EDC_99_1/en/] which define the responsibilities of WHO and national authorities in case of an influenza pandemic. This is the first time a pandemic has been anticipated and is being prepared for.

The aims of such plans are, broadly speaking, the following:

* Before a pandemic, attempt to prevent it and prepare for it in case prevention fails.
* If a pandemic does occur, to slow its spread and allow societies to function as normally as possible.
&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigations of small clusters of cases are currently ongoing in [[southeast Asia]], particularly [[Vietnam]],
to rule out limited human-to-human spread (which would signify Phase 4). The phases are defined as:

===Interpandemic period===
*'''Phase 1: Low risk''' No new influenza virus subtypes dangerous to humans detected in humans or animals.
*'''Phase 2: New virus''' A new circulating animal influenza virus subtype poses a substantial risk of human disease but no new influenza virus subtypes have been detected in humans.

===Pandemic alert period===
*'''Phase 3: Self limiting''' Human infection(s) with a new subtype, but no human-to-human spread, or at most rare instances of spread to a close contact. Even without human intervention it would be self limiting among humans.
*'''Phase 4: Person to person:''' Small cluster(s) with limited human-to-human transmission but spread is highly localized, suggesting that the virus is not well adapted to humans. An epidemic is possible but has not yet happened.
*'''Phase 5: Epidemic:''' Larger cluster(s) but human-to-human spread still localized, suggesting that the virus is becoming increasingly well adapted to humans, but may not yet be fully transmissible (substantial pandemic risk).

===Pandemic period===
*'''Phase 6: Pandemic:''' increased and sustained transmission in general population.

===Notes===
The distinction between phase 1 and phase 2 is based on the risk of human infection or disease resulting from circulating strains in animals. The distinction is based on various factors and their relative importance according to current scientific knowledge. Factors may include pathogenicity in animals and humans, occurrence in domesticated animals and livestock or only in wildlife, whether the virus is enzootic or epizootic, geographically localized or widespread, and/or other scientific parameters.

The distinction between phase 3, phase 4 and phase 5 is based on an assessment of the risk of a pandemic. Various factors and their relative importance according to current scientific knowledge may be considered. Factors may include rate of transmission, geographical location and spread, severity of illness, presence of genes from human strains (if derived from an animal strain), and/or other scientific parameters.

The pandemic stage 6 may be marked by two or more waves.  For example, the initial wave of the Spanish Influenza pandemic in the spring of 1918 was so mild in its effects that it received the dismissive nickname of the &quot;three day flu.&quot; But when the second wave hit North America a few months later in the summer of 1918, it was lethal.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vlib.us/medical/parsons.htm | *The Spanish Lady and the Newfoundland Regiment* W. David Parsons, MD, C.M., FRCP (C)&lt;/ref&gt;  Apparently in the interim the novel H1N1 pandemic strain had added the gene or genes that made the final wave a killer.  Perhaps the effects of the lethal second wave would have been even more devastating if the innocuous first wave had not already passed through the population, leaving in its wake at least some immune response to the surface antigens presented by the H1N1 in both waves. 

CIDRAP provides a thoroughgoing overview, which has its roots in materials from the U.S. HHS National Vaccine Program Office.  CIDRAP's overview originally set forth a model listing five numbered stages for the pandemic itself, preceded by four additional pre-pandemic stages, each numbered as zero, that overlapped the WHO's first five stages of a pandemic.  CIDRAP's overview has since adopted the WHO's 6-stage model. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cidrap.umn.edu/cidrap/content/influenza/panflu/biofacts/panflu.html  CIDRAP's ''Pandemic Influenza'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparations for a potential influenza pandemic==
According to ''[[The New York Times]]'' as of March 2006, &quot;governments worldwide have spent billions planning for a potential influenza pandemic: buying medicines, running disaster drills, [and] developing strategies for tighter border controls&quot; due to the [[H5N1]] threat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&quot;[T]he [[United States]] is collaborating closely with eight international organizations, including the [[WHO|World Health Organization]] (WHO), the [[FAO|Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO), the [[OIE|World Organization for Animal Health]] (OIE), and 88 foreign governments to address the situation through planning, greater monitoring, and full transparency in reporting and investigating [[avian influenza]] occurrences. The United States and these international partners have led global efforts to encourage countries to heighten surveillance for outbreaks in poultry and significant numbers of deaths in migratory birds and to rapidly introduce containment measures. The [[U.S. Agency for International Development]] (USAID) and the [[U.S. Department of State|U.S. Departments of State]], [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|Health and Human Services]] (HHS), and [[U.S. Department of Agriculture|Agriculture]] (USDA) are coordinating future international response measures on behalf of the White House with departments and agencies across the federal government.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;usaid&quot;&gt;{{cite web

Together steps are being taken to &quot;minimize the risk of further spread in animal populations&quot;, &quot;reduce the risk of human infections&quot;, and &quot;further support pandemic planning and preparedness&quot;.&lt;ref name=&quot;usaid&quot; /&gt;

Ongoing detailed mutually coordinated onsite surveillance and analysis of human and animal [[H5N1]] avian flu outbreaks are being conducted and reported by the [[USGS]] National Wildlife Health Center, the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], the [[World Health Organization]], the [[European Commission]], the [[National Influenza Centers]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===International government sponsored scientific seminars on H5N1 pandemic prevention===

[[AEWA]] MOP-3: The third Meeting of the Parties to [[AEWA]] met from [[23 October]]-[[27 October]] [[2005]] in Dakar, Senegal. Participants adopted Resolution 3.18, which calls for, inter alia: urgent responses to the spread of HPAI including the development of national surveillance schemes and contingency planning, involving immediate and long-term measures; increased focus on education and awareness programmes and capacity building, particularly in Africa; increased cooperation between relevant bodies; and additional scientific research.

MEETING ON AVIAN INFLUENZA AND HUMAN PANDEMIC INFLUENZA: This meeting was held from [[7 November]]-[[9 November]] [[2005]] in Geneva, Switzerland and was co-sponsored by WHO, FAO and OIE. Participants identified key steps to be taken to contain the spread of HPAI, including source control, surveillance, rapid containment, pandemic preparedness, integrated country plans, and communications.

RAMSAR COP-9: The ninth Conference of the Parties to the Ramsar Convention was held from [[8 November]]-[[15 November]] [[2005]] in Kampala, Uganda. Participants adopted Resolution IX.23, which calls for fully integrated approaches, at both national and international levels, to address HPAI by bringing ornithological, wildlife, and wetland management expertise together with those traditionally responsible for public health and zoonoses. It emphasizes that destruction or substantive modification of wetland habitats with the objective of reducing contact between domesticated and wild birds may exacerbate the problem by causing further dispersal of infected birds.

CMS COP-8: The eighth Conference of the Parties to CMS convened from [[20 November]]-[[25 November]] [[2005]] in Nairobi, Kenya. Participants adopted Resolution 8.27, which calls for support and capacity building for research related to disease processes in migratory bird species, long-term monitoring of their movements and populations, and rapid development of surveillance programmes for HPAI in populations of wild birds. An Annex to the Resolution lists key research needs related to the spread of HPAI in relation to migratory birds and their habitats.

INTERNATIONAL PLEDGING CONFERENCE ON AVIAN AND HUMAN INFLUENZA: This event, held from [[17 January]]-[[18 January]] [[2006]] in Beijing, China, was co-sponsored by the Government of China, the European Commission and the World Bank. During this event the international community pledged US$ 1.9 billion in financial support and discussed coordination mechanisms. Participants adopted the Beijing Declaration, in which they commit themselves to effective development and implementation of integrated national action plans, long-term strategic partnerships, information sharing, increased cooperation on global research, and periodic evaluation of national pandemic influenza preparedness and action plans.

CBD COP-8: The eighth Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) was held in Curitiba, Brazil from [[20 March]]-[[31 March]] [[2006]]. A brainstorming session on HPAI preceded the meeting. Participants at this session: highlighted threats to migratory species and wetlands, knowledge gaps and the need for capacity building; welcomed the participation of the CBD in the Scientific Task Force on Avian Influenza; and suggested that CBD’s Subsidiary Body on Scientific, Technical and Technological Advice (SBSTTA) further assess the interlinkages between ecosystems and health on matters including climate change and avian flu. Participants adopted a Decision on Avian Flu (UNEP/CBD/COP/8/L.35), in which they take note of the brainstorming meeting report and encourage similar consultations as and when emerging issues that may impact CBD implementation arise.

6TH INTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON AVIAN INFLUENZA: This event was held from [[3 April]]-[[6 April]] [[2006]] in Cambridge, UK. Participants addressed lessons learned from recent outbreaks in Asia, Africa and Europe and recent epidemiological and virological information. They identified short- and long-term needs, including enhanced scientific information, cross-sectoral and international cooperation, and improved awareness among decision makers and the general public.

&quot;[E]fforts by the federal government to prepare for pandemic influenza at the national level include a $100 million DHHS initiative in [[2003]] to build U.S. [[vaccine]] production. Several agencies within [[Department of Health and Human Services]] (DHHS)  —  including the Office of the Secretary, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), [[CDC]], and the [[National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases]] (NIAID)  —  are in the process of working with vaccine manufacturers to facilitate production of pilot vaccine lots for both [[H5N1]] and H9N2 strains as well as contracting for the manufacturing of 2 million doses of an H5N1 vaccine. This H5N1 vaccine production will provide a critical pilot test of the pandemic vaccine system; it will also be used for clinical trials to evaluate dose and immunogenicity and can provide initial vaccine for early use in the event of an emerging pandemic.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

On [[August 26]], [[2004]], Secretary of Health and Human Services, [[Tommy Thompson]] released a draft Pandemic Influenza Response and Preparedness Plan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  | accessdate =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;, which outlined a coordinated national strategy to prepare for and respond to an influenza pandemic. Public comments were accepted for 60 days.

In a speech before the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on [[September 14]], [[2005]], President [[George W. Bush]] announced the creation of the [[International Partnership on Avian and Pandemic Influenza]].  The Partnership brings together nations and international organizations to improve global readiness by:
* elevating the issue on national agendas;
* coordinating efforts among donor and affected nations;
* mobilizing and leveraging resources;
* increasing transparency in disease reporting and surveillance; and
* building capacity to identify, contain and respond to a pandemic influenza.

On [[October 5]], [[2005]], Democratic Senators [[Harry Reid]], [[Evan Bayh]], [[Dick Durbin]], [[Ted Kennedy]], [[Barack Obama]], and [[Tom Harkin]] introduced the [[Pandemic Preparedness and Response Act]] as a proposal to deal with a possible outbreak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

On [[October 27]], [[2005]], the Department of Health and Human Services awarded a $62.5 million contract to [[Chiron Corporation]] to manufacture an avian influenza vaccine designed to protect against the H5N1 influenza virus strain.  This followed a previous awarded $100 million contract to [[sanofi pasteur]], the vaccines business of the [[sanofi-aventis]] Group, for avian flu vaccine.

In October 2005, President [[George W Bush|Bush]] urged bird flu vaccine manufacturers to increase their production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The request includes $251 million to detect and contain outbreaks before they spread around the world; $2.8 billion to accelerate development of cell-culture technology; $800 million for development of new treatments and vaccines; $1.519 billion for the Departments of Health and Human Services (HHS) and Defense to purchase influenza vaccines; $1.029 billion to stockpile antiviral medications; and $644 million to ensure that all levels of government are prepared to respond to a pandemic outbreak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On [[6 March]] [[2006]], Mike Leavitt, Secretary of Health and Human Services, said U.S. health agencies are continuing to develop vaccine alternatives that will protect against the evolving avian influenza virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

The U.S. government, bracing for the possibility that migrating birds could carry a deadly strain of bird flu to North America, plans to test nearly eight times as many wild birds starting in April 2006 as have been tested in the past decade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On [[8 March]] [[2006]], Dr. David Nabarro, senior U.N. coordinator for avian and human influenza, said that given the flight patterns of wild birds that have been spreading avian influenza (bird flu) from Asia to Europe and Africa, birds infected with the H5N1 virus could reach the Americas within the next six to 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

&quot;Jul 5, 2006 (CIDRAP News) – In an update on pandemic influenza preparedness efforts, the federal government said last week it had stockpiled enough vaccine against H5N1 avian influenza virus to inoculate about 4 million people and enough antiviral medication to treat about 6.3 million.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==China==
In 1982, Kennedy F. Shortridge and Charles Stuart-Harris proposed that [[China]], particularly southern China, is an epicentre for the emergence of pandemic [[influenza]] viruses&lt;ref&gt;Shortridge, K. F., and Stuart-Harris, C. H. (1982). An influenza epicentre? Lancet 2, 812-813.&lt;/ref&gt;. This hypothesis was based on three observations:

1. The occurrence of a large number of viruses in domestic poultry notably ducks in the region.

2. The dense populations and proximity of humans, poultry and pigs in villages and farms there.

3. The historical records associating China with epidemics and pandemics and, in the last century, the association of southern China with the emergence of the 1957 [[Asian flu|Asian]] and 1968 [[Hong Kong flu|Hong Kong]] pandemic strains and the re-emergence of the 1977 [[H1N1]] virus &lt;ref&gt;Potter, C. W. (1998). Chronicle of influenza pandemics. In Nicholson, K. G., Webster, R. G., and Hay, A. J. (eds.) Textbook of influenza. Blackwell Science Ltd. Oxford, UK. pp. 3-18.&lt;/ref&gt;. These records have been reinforced by the 1997 [[H5N1]] incident that is considered by some to have been an incipient pandemic and a pandemic averted by the slaughter of poultry across Hong Kong SAR in late 1997.

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Pandemic outbreak ===
{{TOC right}}
A '''pandemic''' (from [[Greek language|Greek]] παν ''pan'' all + δήμος ''demos'' people) is an [[w:epidemic|epidemic]] that spreads through human populations across a large region (for example a continent), or even worldwide. 

'''Definition'''&lt;br&gt;
According to the [[w:World Health Organization|World Health Organization]] (WHO), a pandemic can start when three conditions have been met:
* '''the emergence of a disease new to the population.
* the agent infects humans, causing serious illness.
* the agent spreading is sustainable and easy among humans'''.

A disease or condition is not a pandemic merely because it is widespread or kills many people; it must also be infectious. For example [[w:cancer|cancer]] is responsible for many deaths but is not considered a pandemic because the disease is not infectious or contagious (although certain causes of some types of cancer might be).

====WHO pandemic influenza phases====
The ''[[w:World Health Organisation|World Health Organization]] global influenza preparedness plan'' defines the stages of [[w:pandemic influenza|pandemic influenza]], outlines the role of WHO and makes recommendations for national measures before and during a pandemic. The phases are:

Inter-pandemic period:
* '''Phase 1:''' No new influenza [[w:virus|virus]] subtypes have been detected in humans.
* '''Phase 2:''' No new influenza virus subtypes have been detected in humans, but an animal variant threatens human disease.
Pandemic alert period:
* '''Phase 3:''' Human infection(s) with a new subtype but no human-to-human spread.
* '''Phase 4:''' Small cluster(s) with limited localized human-to-human transmission
* '''Phase 5:''' Larger cluster(s) but human-to-human spread still localized.
Pandemic period:
* '''Phase 6:''' Increased and sustained transmission in general population.

====Pandemics and notable epidemics through history====
{{TODO|Look over a possible transwiki of [[wikipedia:Epidemic#Notable epidemics through history]]}}

There have been a number of significant pandemics recorded in human [[history]], generally [[w:zoonosis|zoonoses]] that came about with [[w:domestication|domestication]] of animals — such as [[w:influenza|influenza]] and [[w:tuberculosis|tuberculosis]]. There have been a number of particularly significant [[w:epidemic|epidemic]]s that deserve mention above the &quot;mere&quot; destruction of cities:

* [[w:Typhoid fever|Typhoid fever]], during the[[w:Peloponnesian War|Peloponnesian War]], [[w:430 BC|430 BC]], killed a quarter of the Athenian troops and a quarter of the population over four years. This disease fatally weakened the dominance of [[w:Athens|Athens]], but the sheer virulence of the disease prevented its wider spread; i.e. it killed off its hosts at a rate faster than they could spread it. The exact cause of the plague was unknown for many years; in [[w:January 2006|January 2006]], researchers from the [[w:University of Athens|University of Athens]] analyzed [[w:teeth|teeth]] recovered from a [[w:mass grave|mass grave]] underneath the city, and confirmed the presence of [[w:bacteria|bacteria]] responsible for typhoid. [http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=000BF619-9B78-13D6-9B7883414B7F0135&amp;ref=sciam&amp;chanID=sa003]

* [[w:Antonine Plague|Antonine Plague]], [[w:165|165]] – [[w:180|180]]. Possibly [[w:smallpox|smallpox]] brought back from the Near East; killed a quarter of those infected and up to five million in all. At the height of a second outbreak (251–266) 5,000 people a day were said to be dying in [[w:Rome|Rome]].

* [[w:bubonic plague|Bubonic plague]] also named in the first recorded outbreak as the [[w:Plague of Justinian|Plague of Justinian]], from [[w:541|541]] to [[w:750|750]]. It started in [[w:Egypt|Egypt]] and reached [[w:Constantinople|Constantinople]] the following spring, killing (according to the Byzantine chronicler [[w:Procopius|Procopius]]) 10,000 a day at its height and perhaps 40% of the city's inhabitants. Plague went on to eliminate a quarter to a half of the [[w:human population|human population]] that it struck throughout the known world. &lt;ref&gt; [http://www.cambridge.org/us/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521846390&amp;ss=from Cambridge Catalog page &quot;Plague and the End of Antiquity&quot;] [http://www.speakeasy-forum.com/lofiversion/index.php/t18579.html Quotes from book &quot;Plague and the End of Antiquity&quot;] Lester K. Little, ed., ''Plague and the End of Antiquity: The Pandemic of 541-750'', Cambridge, 2006. ISBN 0-521-84639-0&lt;/ref&gt; It caused the [[w:Medieval demography|Europe's population]] to drop by around 50% between 550 and 700.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dpalm.med.uth.tmc.edu/courses/BT2003/BTstudents2003_files%5CPlague2003.htm The History of the Bubonic Plague]&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[w:Black Death|Black Death]], started [[w:1300s|1300s]]. Eight hundred years after the last outbreak, the [[w:bubonic plague|bubonic plague]] returned to [[w:Europe|Europe]]. Starting in [[w:Asia|Asia]], the disease reached Mediterranean and western Europe in 1348 (possibly from Italian merchants fleeing fighting in the [[w:Crimea|Crimea]]), and killed 20 to 30 million Europeans in six years,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medhunters.com/articles/deathOnAGrandScale.html Death on a Grand Scale]&lt;/ref&gt; a third of the total population and up to a half in the worst-affected urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.1911encyclopedia.org/Plague Plague - LoveToKnow 1911]&lt;/ref&gt;

* The [[w:Sweating sickness|English Sweat]], that struck England, and later continental Europe, in a series of epidemics beginning in 1485. The last outbreak occurred in 1551, after which the disease apparently vanished. The onset of symptoms was dramatic and sudden, with death often occurring within hours making it even more feared  than the bubonic plague. Its cause is still unknown.

* [[w:Typhus|Typhus]], sometimes called &quot;camp fever&quot; because of its pattern of flaring up in times of strife. (It is also known as &quot;gaol fever&quot; and &quot;ship fever&quot;, for its habits of spreading wildly in cramped quarters, such as jails and ships.) Emerging during the [[w:Crusades|Crusades]], it had its first impact in Europe in 1489 in [[w:Spain|Spain]]. During fighting between the Christian Spaniards and the Muslims in [[w:Granada|Granada]], the Spanish lost 3,000 to war casualties and 20,000 to typhus. In 1528 the French lost 18,000 troops in [[w:Italy|Italy]] and lost supremacy in Italy to the Spanish. In 1542, 30,000 people died of typhus while fighting the [[w:Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]] in the Balkans. The disease also played a major role in the destruction of [[w:Napoleon|Napoleon]]'s ''[[w:La Grande Armée|Grande Armée]]'' in Russia in 1812. Typhus also killed numerous prisoners in the Nazi [[w:concentration camps|concentration camps]] during World War II.

** The &quot;Asiatic Flu&quot;, 1889–1890. Was first reported in May of 1889 in [[w:Bukhara|Bukhara]], Russia. By October, it had reached [[w:Tomsk|Tomsk]] and the [[w:Caucasus|Caucasus]]. It rapidly spread west and hit North America in December 1889, South America in February – April 1890, India in February-March 1890, and Australia in March – April 1890. It was purportedly caused by the H2N8 type of flu virus and had a very high attack and [[w:mortality rate|mortality rate]].
** The &quot;[[w:Spanish flu|Spanish flu]]&quot;, 1918–1919. First identified early March 1918 in US troops training at [[w:Fort Riley|Camp Funston]], [[w:Kansas|Kansas]], by October 1918 it had spread to become a world-wide pandemic on all continents. Unusually deadly and virulent, it ended nearly as quickly as it began, vanishing completely within 18 months. In six months, 25 million were dead; some estimates put the total of those killed worldwide at over twice that number. An estimated 17 million died in India, 500,000 in the United States and 200,000 in the UK. The virus was recently reconstructed by scientists at the [[w:Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] studying remains preserved by the Alaskan [[w:permafrost|permafrost]]. They identified it as a type of [[w:H1N1|H1N1]] virus{{Fact|date=October 2007}}.
** The &quot;[[w:Asian Flu|Asian Flu]]&quot;, 1957–58. An H2N2 caused about 70,000 deaths in the United States. First identified in China in late February 1957, the Asian flu spread to the United States by June 1957.
** The &quot;[[w:Hong Kong Flu|Hong Kong Flu]]&quot;, 1968–69. An H3N2 caused about 34,000 deaths in the United States. This virus was first detected in Hong Kong in early 1968 and spread to the United States later that year. Influenza A ([[w:H3N2|H3N2]]) viruses still circulate today.

* [[w:Cholera|Cholera]]
** first pandemic [[w:1816|1816]] – [[w:1826|1826]]. Previously restricted to the [[w:Indian subcontinent|Indian subcontinent]], the pandemic began in [[w:Bengal|Bengal]], then spread across India by 1820. It extended as far as [[w:China|China]] and the [[w:Caspian Sea|Caspian Sea]] before receding.
** The second pandemic (1829–1851) reached [[w:Europe|Europe]], [[London]] in 1832, [[w:Ontario|Ontario]] [[w:Canada|Canada]] and [[w:New York|New York]] in the same year, and the Pacific coast of North America by 1834.
** The third pandemic (1852–1860) mainly affected [[w:Russia|Russia]], with over a million deaths.
** The fourth pandemic (1863–1875) spread mostly in Europe and [[w:Africa|Africa]].
** In 1866 there was an outbreak in North America.
** In 1892 cholera contaminated the water supply of [[w:Hamburg, Germany|Hamburg, Germany]], and caused 8,606 deaths.&lt;ref&gt;John M. Barry, (2004). ''The Great Influenza: The Epic Story of the Greatest Plague in History''. Viking Penguin. ISBN 0-670-89473-7.&lt;/ref&gt;
** The seventh pandemic (1899–1923) had little effect in Europe because of advances in [[w:public health|public health]], but Russia was badly affected again.
** The eighth pandemic began in [[w:Indonesia|Indonesia]] in 1961, called [[w:El Tor|El Tor]] after the strain, and reached [[w:Bangladesh|Bangladesh]] in 1963, India in 1964, and the [[w:Soviet Union|USSR]] in 1966.

Effects of [[w:Colonization|Colonization]]. Encounters between European explorers and populations in the rest of the world often introduced local epidemics of extraordinary virulence. Disease killed the entire native ([[w:Guanches|Guanches]]) population of the [[w:Canary Islands|Canary Islands]] in the 16th century. Half the native population of [[w:Hispaniola|Hispaniola]] in 1518 was killed by [[w:smallpox|smallpox]]. Smallpox also ravaged [[w:Mexico|Mexico]] in the 1520s, killing 150,000 in [[w:Tenochtitlán|Tenochtitlán]] alone, including the emperor, and [[w:Peru|Peru]] in the 1530s, aiding the European conquerors. [[w:Measles|Measles]] killed a further two million Mexican natives in the 1600s. Some believe that the death of 90 to 95 percent of the [[w:Population history of American indigenous peoples|Native American population]] of the [[w:New World|New World]] was caused by [[w:Old World|Old World]] diseases. As late as 1848–49, as many as 40,000 out of 150,000 [[w:Hawaii|Hawaii]]ans are estimated to have died of [[w:measles|measles]], [[w:whooping cough|whooping cough]] and [[w:influenza|influenza]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pbs.org/gunsgermssteel/variables/smallpox.html The Story Of... Smallpox]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/empire_seapower/smallpox_01.shtml Smallpox: Eradicating the Scourge]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[w:Dengue|Dengue]]. Spread of Dengue disease in South Asia by a mosquito.

There are also a number of unknown diseases that were extremely serious but have now vanished, so the [[w:etiology|etiology]] of these diseases cannot be established.

====Concern about possible future pandemics====
=====Ebola virus and other quickly lethal diseases=====
[[w:Lassa fever|Lassa fever]], [[w:Rift Valley fever|Rift Valley fever]], [[w:Marburg virus|Marburg virus]], [[w:Ebola|Ebola virus]] and [[w:Bolivian hemorrhagic fever|Bolivian hemorrhagic fever]] are highly contagious and deadly diseases with the theoretical potential to become pandemics. Their ability to spread efficiently enough to cause a pandemic is limited, however, as transmission of these viruses requires close contact with the infected vector. Furthermore, the short time between a vector becoming infectious and the onset of symptoms allows medical professionals to quickly [[w:quarantine|quarantine]] vectors and prevent them from carrying the pathogen elsewhere. Genetic mutations could occur which could elevate their potential for causing widespread harm, thus close observation by contagious disease specialists is merited.

=====Antibiotic resistance=====
Antibiotic-resistant microorganisms, sometimes referred to as &quot;[[w:Antibiotic resistance|superbug]]s&quot;, may contribute to the re-emergence of diseases which are currently well-controlled. For example, cases of [[w:tuberculosis|tuberculosis]] that are resistant to traditionally effective treatments remain a cause of great concern to health professionals. The [[w:World Health Organization|World Health Organization]] (WHO) reports that approximately 50 million people worldwide are infected with multiple-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR TB), with 79 percent of those cases resistant to three or more antibiotics. In 2005, 124 cases of [[w:MDR TB|MDR TB]] were reported in the United States. Extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis ([[w:XDR TB|XDR TB]]) was identified in Africa in 2006, and subsequently discovered to exist in 17 countries including the United States.

In the past 20 years, common bacteria including ''[[w:Staphylococcus aureus|Staphylococcus aureus]]'', ''[[w:Serratia marcescens|Serratia marcescens]]'' and [[w:Enterococcus|Enterococcus]], have developed resistance to various [[w:antibiotics|antibiotics]] such as [[w:vancomycin|vancomycin]], as well as whole classes of antibiotics, such as the [[w:aminoglycosides|aminoglycosides]] and [[w:cephalosporins|cephalosporins]]. Antibiotic-resistant organisms have become an important cause of health care-associated (nosocomial) infections (HAI). In addition, infections caused by community-acquired strains of methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'' ([[w:MRSA|MRSA]]) in otherwise healthy individuals, have become more frequent in recent years. &lt;!-- Antibiotics are not described as &quot;strongest&quot;; each has a specific range of activity. Antibiotics that are effective against many types of bacteria are termed &quot;broad spectrum&quot;. Vancomycin is only effective against Gram-positive organisms, such as sensitive strains of ''S. aureus'' and Enterococcus. --&gt; &lt;!-- HAIs are a serious concern, but do not meet the definition of a pandemic --&gt;

=====HIV infection=====
[[w:HIV|HIV]] &amp;mdash; the virus that causes [[w:AIDS|AIDS]] &amp;mdash; is of pandemic proportions with infection rates as high as 25% in southern and eastern Africa. Effective education about safer sexual practices and [[w:bloodborne infection|bloodborne infection]] precautions training have helped to slow down infection rates in several African countries sponsoring national education programs. Infection rates are rising again in Asia and the Americas. See [[w:AIDS pandemic|AIDS pandemic]].

=====SARS=====
In [[w:2003|2003]], there were concerns that [[w:Severe acute respiratory syndrome|SARS]], a new, highly contagious form of [[w:atypical pneumonia|atypical pneumonia]] caused by a [[w:coronavirus|coronavirus]] dubbed [[w:SARS-CoV|SARS-CoV]], might become pandemic. Rapid action by national and international health authorities such as the [[w:World Health Organization|World Health Organization]] helped slow transmission and eventually broke the chain of transmission, ending the localized epidemics before they could become a pandemic. The disease has not been eradicated, however, and could re-emerge unexpectedly, warranting monitoring and case reporting of suspicious cases of atypical pneumonia.

=====Influenza=====
{{TODO|Examine [[wikipedia:Influenza pandemic]]}}

Wild aquatic birds are the natural hosts for a range of [[w:influenza|influenza]] A viruses. Occasionally viruses are transmitted from these species to other species and may then cause outbreaks in domestic poultry or (rarely) give rise to a human pandemic. &lt;ref name=sobrino6&gt;{{cite book |chapterurl=http://www.horizonpress.com/avir|author=Klenk et al|year=2008|chapter=Avian Influenza: Molecular Mechanisms of Pathogenesis and Host Range|title=Animal Viruses: Molecular Biology|publisher=Caister Academic Press|id=[http://www.horizonpress.com/avir ISBN 978-1-904455-22-6]}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=Kawaoka&gt;{{cite book | author = Kawaoka Y (editor). | title = Influenza Virology: Current Topics | publisher = Caister Academic Press | year = 2006 | url=http://www.horizonpress.com/flu | id = [http://www.horizonpress.com/flu ISBN 978-1-904455-06-6 ]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====H5N1=====
{{TODO|Examine [[wikipedia:H5N1]]}}
In February [[w:2004|2004]], [[w:avian influenza|avian influenza]] virus was detected in birds in [[w:Vietnam|Vietnam]], increasing fears of the emergence of new variant strains. It is feared that if the avian influenza virus combines with a human influenza virus (in a bird or a human), the new subtype created could be both highly contagious and highly lethal in humans. Such a subtype could cause a global influenza pandemic, similar to the [[w:Spanish Flu|Spanish Flu]], or the lower mortality pandemics such as the [[w:Asian Flu|Asian Flu]] and the [[w:Hong Kong Flu|Hong Kong Flu]].

From October 2004 to February 2005, some 3,700 test kits of the 1957 [[w:Asian Flu|Asian Flu]] virus were accidentally spread around the world from a lab in the US[http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7261].

In May 2005, scientists urgently call nations to prepare for a global [[w:influenza pandemic|influenza pandemic]] that could strike as much as 20% of the world's population.{{Fact|date=November 2007}}

In October 2005, cases of the avian flu (the deadly strain [[w:H5N1|H5N1]]) were identified in [[Turkey]]. EU Health Commissioner Markos Kyprianou said: &quot;We have received now confirmation that the virus found in Turkey is an avian flu H5N1 virus. There is a direct relationship with viruses found in Russia, Mongolia and China.&quot; Cases of bird flu were also identified shortly thereafter in [[w:Romania|Romania]], and then [[w:Greece|Greece]]. Possible cases of the virus have also been found in [[w:Croatia|Croatia]], [[w:Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] and in the [[w:United Kingdom|United Kingdom]] &lt;sup&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4348404.stm]&lt;/sup&gt;. 

By November 2007 numerous confirmed cases of the [[w:H5N1|H5N1]] strain had been identified across [[w:Europe|Europe]] &lt;sup&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/spl/hi/world/05/bird_flu_map/html/1.stm]&lt;/sup&gt;. However, by the end of October only 59 people had died as a result of H5N1 which was atypical of previous influenza pandemics.

Despite sensational media reporting, avian flu cannot yet be categorized as a &quot;pandemic&quot; because the virus cannot yet cause sustained and efficient human-to-human transmission. Cases so far are recognized to have been transmitted from bird to human, but as of December 2006 there have been very few (if any) cases of proven human-to-human transmission. Regular influenza viruses establish infection by attaching to receptors in the throat and lungs, but the avian influenza virus can only attach to receptors located deep in the lungs of humans, requiring close, prolonged contact with infected patients and thus limiting person-to-person transmission. The current WHO phase of pandemic alert is level 3, described as &quot;no or very limited human-to-human transmission.&quot;{{Fact|date=November 2007}}

In epidemiology, an '''epidemic''' (επί (epi)- meaning &quot;upon or above&quot; and δήμος (demos)- meaning &quot;people&quot;), occurs when new cases of a certain [[disease]], in a given human population, and during a given period, substantially exceed what is expected based on recent experience.&lt;ref name=&quot;Principles of Epidemiology&quot;/&gt;{{rp|354}}&lt;ref name=Green&gt;{{cite journal |author=Green MS, Swartz T, Mayshar E, Lev B, Leventhal A, Slater PE, Shemer J |title=When is an epidemic an epidemic? |journal=Isr. Med. Assoc. J. |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=3–6 |year=2002 |month=January |pmid=11802306 |doi= |url=http://www.ima.org.il/imaj/ar02jan-1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Epidemiologists often consider the term [[outbreak]] to be [[synonymous]] to epidemic, but the general public typically perceives outbreaks to be more local and less serious than epidemics&lt;ref name=Green/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Principles of Epidemiology&quot;/&gt;{{rp|55, 354}}

An epidemic may be restricted to one [[locale]], however if it spreads to other countries or continents and affects a substantial number of people, it may be termed a [[pandemic]].&lt;ref name=&quot;Principles of Epidemiology&quot;&gt;{{cite book |author= |title=Principles of Epidemiology, Second Edition |publisher=[[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] |location=Atlanta, Georgia |year=|pages= |isbn= |oclc= |doi= |url=http://www2a.cdc.gov/phtn/catalog/pdf-file/Epi_course.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|55}} The declaration of an epidemic usually requires a good understanding of a [[baseline (medicine)|baseline]] rate of [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]]; epidemics for certain diseases, such as [[influenza]], are defined as reaching some defined increase in incidence above this baseline.&lt;ref name=Green/&gt; A few cases of a very rare [[disease]] may be classified as an epidemic, while many cases of a common disease (such as the [[common cold]]) would not.

==Causes of epidemics==
There are several changes that may occur in an [[infectious agent]] that may trigger an epidemic these include:&lt;ref name=&quot;Principles of Epidemiology&quot;/&gt;{{rp|55}}
* Increased [[virulence]]
* Introduction into a novel setting
* Changes in host susceptibility to the infectious agent
* Changes in host exposure to the infectious agent

An epidemic disease is not required to be [[contagious disease|contagious]],&lt;ref name=Green/&gt;&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt; and the term has been applied to [[West Nile fever]]&lt;ref name=Green/&gt; and the [[obesity epidemic]], among others.&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt;

=='''Types of epidemics'''==
;Common source outbreak
Two examples of common sources of outbreak are the epidemics Emmititus and Powititus. These diseases are reflected in the growth of the skull. In a common source outbreak, the affected individuals had an exposure to a common agent. If the exposure is singular and all of the affected individuals develop the disease over a single exposure and incubation course, it can be termed a point source outbreak. If the exposure was continuous or variable, it can be termed a continuous outbreak or intermittent outbreak, respectively.&lt;ref name=&quot;Principles of Epidemiology&quot;/&gt;{{rp|56}}
'''
;Propagated outbreak'''
In a propagated outbreak, the disease spreads person-to-person. Affected individuals may become independent reservoirs leading to further exposures.&lt;ref name=&quot;Principles of Epidemiology&quot;/&gt;{{rp|56}}

Many epidemics will have characteristics of both common source and propagated outbreaks. For example, secondary person-to-person spread may occur after a common source exposure or a environmental vectors may spread a [[zoonotic]] diseases agent.&lt;ref name=&quot;Principles of Epidemiology&quot;/&gt;{{rp|56-58}}

==Etymology==
The term epidemic derives from a term first attributed to [[Homer]]'s ''[[Odyssey]]'', which later took its medical meaning from a treatise by [[Hippocrates]], ''[[Epidemics (Hippocrates)|Epidemics]]''.&lt;ref name=Martin&gt;{{cite journal |author=Martin PM, Martin-Granel E |title=2,500-year evolution of the term epidemic |journal=Emerging Infect. Dis. |volume=12 |issue=6 |pages=976–80 |year=2006 |month=June |pmid=16707055 |doi= 10.3201/eid1206.051263|url=http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/content/12/6/pdfs/v12-n6.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to Hippocrates, ''epidemios'', ''epidemeo'', ''epidamos'' and other variants had meanings similar to the current definitions of &quot;indigenous&quot; or &quot;[[Endemism|endemic]]&quot;.&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt; [[Thucydides]]'s description of the [[Plague of Athens]] is considered one of the earliest accounts of a disease epidemic.&lt;ref name=Martin/&gt;

==Legislation==
{{quotation|
'''Criminal breach of trust'''&lt;Br&gt;
336. Every one who, being a trustee of anything for the use or benefit, whether in whole or in part, of another person, or for a public or charitable purpose, converts, with intent to defraud and in contravention of his trust, that thing or any part of it to a use that is not authorized by the trust is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding fourteen years.
&lt;br&gt;
R.S., c. C-34, s. 296.|[http://canlii.ca/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec336 CCC]
}}

==Proof of the Offence==
In addition to the essential elements of time, location, and identity, the crown should prove:
&lt;ref&gt;R v Solar, 2012 SKQB 113 at 10&lt;/ref&gt;
# the accused was a trustee of some thing; (actus reus)
# the accused converted the thing to an unauthorized use; and (actus reus)
# the accused intended to defraud. (mens rea)


{{reflist|2}}

==Interpretation==
Section 2 defines “trustee” as &quot;a person who is declared by any Act to be a trustee or is, by the law of a province, a trustee, and, without restricting the generality of the foregoing, includes a trustee on an express trust created by deed, will or instrument in writing, or by parol;&quot;&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec2 section 2]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Does personality influence your major?==
You may have been told that your personality can help predict the type of major you should choose.  But is that true?  Recent research suggests that it is not.&lt;ref name=&quot;Ackerman1997&quot;&gt;Ackerman, P L, and E D Heggestad. 1997. “Intelligence, personality, and interests: evidence for overlapping traits.” Psychological Bulletin 121(2):219-245.&lt;/ref&gt;  Personality is not necessarily a good predictor of occupational choice.  According to one study that looked at this question, &quot;an understanding of what an individual is likely to do is based partly on personality characteristics but also on how much intellectual effort the individual is likely to put forth.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ackerman1997&quot;/&gt; Thus, pure intelligence, discounting drive and personality, does not accurately determine what one should major in or chose as a career. Rather, interest and drive play a large role in determining one’s major and their success within the classroom and beyond. What this research suggests, then, is that people who major in an area that is of personal interest will typically succeed. What's more, one’s interests tend to be correlated with one’s abilities; for example, science and engineering interests tend to be “positively associated with Math, Spatial, and Mechanical ability scores.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Ackerman1997&quot;/&gt; In short, don't take a personality test to choose your major.  Choose a major that you like.

      <comment>/* Diversity */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Diversity==
Many universities today want a [[w:Multiculturalism|diverse]] student body as this tends to broaden minds, improve student self-efficacy, increase students' academic skills, and increase tolerance.&lt;ref name=&quot;Denson2009&quot;&gt;Denson, N., &amp; Chang, M. J. (2009). Racial Diversity Matters: The Impact of Diversity-Related Student Engagement and Institutional Context. American Educational Research Journal, 46(2), 322–353.&lt;/ref&gt;  Universities do not have to be large to have diverse student bodies.  For instance, the University of Tampa, a mid-sized urban university located in downtown Tampa, Florida, has a relatively diverse student body despite having around 6,000 students.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collegeboard-UT&quot;&gt;collegeboard.org University of Tampa: Campus Life https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/college-university-search/university-of-tampa&lt;/ref&gt;  Roughly 73% of students are from out of the state of Florida and come from over 122 countries worldwide. While 61% of the UT student body is white, 7% of students identify themselves as African American and 12% as Latin American. In comparison, the University of Florida, boasting a student body of 32,000, is 58% white, with 9% African American and 17% Latin American minorities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Collegeboard-UF&quot;&gt;collegeboard.org University of Florida: Campus Life https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/college-university-search/university-of-florida&lt;/ref&gt; These differences are quite small, despite the enormous differences in sizes of the universities.  Small universities may have the same amount of diversity as big universities.  Size of the university is less important than the emphasis placed on diversity by the university.

Metrolink is a commuter rail system serving five counties in the southern California area.  The system is centered at Los Angeles Union Station, with seven of its eight lines terminating there.  Metrolink trains arrive less often than [[Getting around Los Angeles by Rail/Metro Rail|Metro Rail]] trains, and unlike the Metro Rail trains, they depart on specific schedules.  (These schedules can be found [http://www.metrolinktrains.com/schedules/ here].)

As someone who, back in 2010, was involved in a tentative restructuring of the early chapters but jumped ship too early, I am partly responsible for all that confusion. Your protests, however, were likely the tipping point to come back and resume trying to improve things. If you go back to the book now, you'll see that most of the points you raised were dealt with in one way or another, and in particular there should be very few instances of missing prerequisites.

Again, thanks! Regards,

      <comment>/* Removal of Administrator Rights Due to Low Activity */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Removal of Administrator Rights Due to Low Activity ==

As helpful members of the community, Wikibooks administrators are expected to provide the community with timely assistance when needed or requested and maintain a general understanding of the current Wikibooks environment and policies. In order to meet these expectations an administrator needs to be active. 

If the activity expectations defined below are not met then any autoconfirmed Wikibooks user can propose the removal of administrator rights at [[Wikibooks:Requests for permissions]]. It is a requirement that the proposer notifies the administrator on both their talk page and via the &quot;E-mail this user&quot; function that a de-admin proposal has been started.

Low activity is defined as follows. The administrator:

#Has not performed an administrative function (see [http://toolserver.org/~vvv/adminstats.php?wiki=enwikibooks_p&amp;tlimit=31536000 here]) in the last six months.
#Has performed less than five administrative functions in the last year
#Has made less than 20 edits to Wikibooks in the last year
#Has made no edits to Wikibooks in the last six months

Inactivity based de-admin proposals may be closed immediately as unsuccessful by any uninvolved administrator if at least one of the criteria defined above is met by the administrator being proposed for de-admin.

As the appointment and removal of administrators is a decision for the Wikibooks community, only the opinions of logged in autoconfirmed editors will be considered. Comments from editors who are not logged in or are not autoconfirmed will be removed from the discussion.

If after one month if there is no objection to the removal (including from the administrator being discussed) then a Bureaucrat will close the discussion and raise a request for a [[meta:Steward_requests/Permissions#Removal_of_access|Steward]] to complete the de-admin.

If after one month there are any objections raised (including from the administrator being discussed) then a Bureaucrat will judge the consensus and determine whether to close the proposal as unsuccessful or raise a request to complete the de-admin.

In the event of a proposal being unsuccessful then no further de-admin request for low activity may be made for three months from the closing date of the previous request except where the administrator meets the criteria for removal due to inactivity defined below.

==Removal of Administrator Rights Due to Inactivity==

Any administrator who is completely inactive, as defined below, can have their administrator rights removed without discussion. Removal for inactivity is a requirement to protect Wikibooks against the risk of inactive privileged accounts being compromised.

An administrator is considered inactive if:

* There has been no use of the administrator flag in one year.
* There has been no edit to any Wikibooks page in one year.

In the case of an inactive administrator a notification will be placed at [[Wikibooks:Requests for permissions]]. It is a requirement that the proposer notifies the administrator on both their talk page and via the &quot;E-mail this user&quot; function that a de-admin proposal has been started.

No discussion will take place for an inactive administrator de-admin. If the inactive administrator does not become active within the one month notice period then any user may request a [[meta:Steward_requests/Permissions#Removal_of_access|Steward]] to complete the de-admin.

==Reinstatement when Activity Resumes==

Any administrator removed for inactivity can within a six month period following the removal request the return of the administrator flag. A request must be raised at [[Wikibooks:Requests for permissions]] to give other editors the opportunity to raise any concerns. 

==Removal of Bureaucrat and Checkuser Rights==

The low level of Bureaucrat and Checkuser activity required at Wikibooks means there is no activity requirement in order to retain these rights. However, any Bureaucrat or Checkuser who has their administrator rights removed for low activity or inactivity will also have their Bureaucrat and Checkuser rights removed.</text>

Not every type of cargo can withstand the high acceleration of the [[Space_Transport_and_Engineering_Methods/Hypervelocity_Launcher|Hypervelocity Launcher]].  In particular, humans are limited to about 3-6 gravities.  So until this step of the combined system, we used whatever existing launchers were available for people and delicate cargo.  With the availability of the [[Space_Transport_and_Engineering_Methods/Space_Elevator|Skyhook]] we now consider the alternatives for this task and how to choose among them.

{{TOC right}}

===Choosing among Alternatives===

There are already existing rockets for launching cargo and people into space, and new ones are under development.  We assume this will continue to be true in the future.  In engineering design, parts are subjected to a '''Make or Buy Analysis''' to determine whether to make a part internally, or buy it from someone else.  This method also applies to the human transport job.  If building our own launcher is sufficiently better on cost, technical risk, and other parameters, then we do so.  If better alternatives are available from others, then simply buy the launch services.  Comparing all the alternatives is called a '''Trade Study'''.  First you choose the parameters to use to compare with, and a scoring system to convert diverse parameters into a common scale. You then make the best estimates for each alternative, and choose the one that scores best.  When doing a trade study, it is important to use the same assumptions, such as material strengths, for all the alternatives.

Technology and what alternate systems are available changes over time.  There is also uncertainty in the engineering estimates before design and construction is completed.  Input assumptions like tons of cargo per year can vary over time.  Thus for a complex system, a single point comparison is not sufficient.  A '''Sensitivity Analysis''' looks at variations of parameters and assumptions ahead of time to see how it affects the final choice.  This can be done efficiently with a mathematical or computer model of the system. Later on, when one of the conditions just mentioned changes, the trade study should be repeated to see if the previous answer is still valid.

===Existing and In-Development Launchers===

As of 2012, the following launchers are specifically designed to transport humans, which requires a pressurized environment and other design features.  Other existing and under-development launchers can deliver cargo, and some of those could be adapted to carrying humans.

====Soyuz====

====Shenzhou====

====Crew Transportation System====

This is a NASA funded project with multiple private sector contracts to develop components and ultimately a functioning transport system. As of April 2012, proposals for the next stage of development were being reviewed by NASA.

====Space Launch System====

====Stratolaunch====

====Skylon====
A project from Reaction Engines Limited (REL) with [[w:Alan Bond|Alan Bond]] directing the efforts. The Skylon spaceplane is designed as a single-stage-to-orbit craft, that can take off and land like a normal airplane. The engine is built around a hybrid approach, it functions both as a normal air-breathing engine (jet) and a rocket (in the high atmosphere). This setup is intended to reduce the amount of oxidizer propellant required to send cargo into space as to cut costs.

An European Space Agency (ESA) design evaluation commissioned by the UK Space Agency (UKSA) and concluded in May 2011 stating that &quot;ESA has not identified any critical topics that would prevent a successful development of the engine,&quot;.

As of April 2012 the funding of the project was mostly from private investors 85%, and funding is still being sought to complete the project. The Reaction Engines Ltd [http://www.reactionengines.co.uk/downloads/SKYLON_User_%20Manual_rev1%5B3%5D.pdf '''Skylon Users' Manual'''] (Rev 1, Sep 2009) gives extensive detail about the vehicle and it's engine.

===Alternative Launchers===

These are potential launchers to add to our combined system.  They are not in any particular order.  A considerable amount of design work will be needed before reliable estimates can be made, and then comparison among them and existing launchers.  So for now this is merely a list with some rough estimates.

====Jet Boost====

The '''[[w:Stratolaunch_Systems|Stratolaunch]]''' system currently in development uses a subsonic carrier aircraft.  The Jet boost launcher uses military fighter engines to reach supersonic speeds and higher altitudes.  Both systems share the idea of using air-breathing engines for the early part of the flight, which are 4-20 times as efficient as rocket engines.  They also avoid using rocket engines in the least efficient part of their operating range: going vertically, which causes gravity loss, and through dense air where you have drag and engine pressure loss.  Jet boost dispenses with most of the carrier aircraft by using vertical launch and landing. Using wings allows getting more mass off the ground, but they also limit operating altitude.  Less hardware to develop should lower the development cost.  The engines are mounted to a '''Booster Ring''', which in turn carries the rocket stage.  The booster ring lifts the rocket to around 15 km altitude and 480 m/s (Mach 1.6) velocity.  The rocket ignites and continues it's flight from there, while the booster ring returns to a vertical landing at the launch site.

'''Early Version'''

For human transport, the minimum capacity is 1 person.  Extrapolating from the SpaceX Dragon capsule mass, which carries up to 7 people, we estimate total mass to orbit as 1,500 kg, of which 750 kg is passenger and life support, or uncrewed low g cargo.  In an early version the Skyhook would not be present and the launcher is used to deliver the first components for orbital assembly.  Air-breathing boosters function better with more air, so unlike an all-rocket system, they prefer to launch at low altitude. We assume a sea-level equatorial launch site.  For a 200 km altitude circular orbit a delta V of 7,900 m/s is required from 15 km, including potential and kinetic energy.  The Earth's rotation contributes 465 m/s, and gravity, drag, and pressure losses are assumed to be 200 m/s from that starting altitude. Therefore the net velocity for the rocket stages is 7635 m/s.

We assume a re-used two stage chemical rocket with exhaust velocity of 3350 m/s, similar to the SpaceX Merlin 1C extended nozzle engine.  Since ignition of the rocket is at altitude, we optimize it for vacuum thrust, which is effectively the operating condition after the first 20 seconds of operation.  We increase the Falcon inert mass from 6.5% of stage mass to 11% of stage mass to account for heat shield and other stage recovery hardware so it can be used again.  Each stage is assigned 50% of the required velocity, so the calculations are as follows:

* Stage 2 delta-V = 3817 m/s.  Mass ratio = 3.125, so final mass = 32% of start mass.  Stage inert = 11% x 68% of start mass fuel consumed = 7.5% of start mass. Thus payload = 24.5% of start mass, and also equal to 1500 kg from above.  Therefore Stage 2 start mass = 6,122 kg.
* Stage 1 delta-V = 3818 m/s.  Mass ratio = 3.126, so final mass = 32% of start mass.  Stage inert = 11% x 68% of start mass = 7.5% of start mass. Thus Stage 2 + Payload (what the first stage has to carry) = 24.5% of start mass, and also = 6,122 kg, thus  Start mass = 24,989 kg, which we round up to 25,000 kg. 
* A modern fighter engine such as the PW F-135 generates 191 kN thrust on full afterburner at sea level.  For performance reasons, we want to take off at 2.0 gravities, thus the allowed mass is 9.74 tons per engine.  The engine itself (1700 kg) , fuel (450 kg), and booster ring hardware (590 kg) has an estimated mass of 2.74 tons . Thus each engine can lift 7 tons of rocket stages and payload, and we need 4 engines for the 25 ton rocket with some margin.

The net payload to orbit of 3% of the rocket initial mass is not remarkable, but the ability to recover and use all the stages repeatedly is.  Liftoff mass of the booster ring + rocket is 36 tons, about an order of magnitude smaller than the Falcon 9 vehicle + Dragon capsule, and it should therefore be proportionally less expensive to develop.  If not too much low-g cargo needs to be delivered to orbit, or if other launch systems reach comparable operating costs, then this system may not be justified.  Buying launch capacity from someone else would be less total cost.

'''Advanced Version'''  

For an advanced version, we assume the Skyhook is in place and reduces the required velocity rocket to 4,810 m/s.  For this version we assume a single rocket stage, and keep other values as above.  The mass ratio is then 4.2, leaving 23.8% of start mass after rocket burn. Net cargo mass is 12.8% of rocket initial mass. With a 20 ton rocket stage, that provides 2.5 tons cargo to the Skyhook, or about 3 human passengers.  If larger payloads are desired, then the booster ring would need more than 3 jet engines. A reasonable limit would be 8 jet engines, which can lift up to 56 tons of rocket stage, and deliver 7.15 tons of cargo.

====Gun Boosted Ramjet====

Ramjets are mechanically simple compared to turbine type jet engines, so potentially low cost.  The drawback is they do not function at low velocity, so for this alternative we assume a low acceleration gun is used to reach sufficient velocity for the ramjet to operate.  At higher velocity, ramjets lose performance, so the vehicle will use rocket power to finish the mission.

The gun location is assumed to be on a mountain slope with a barrel length of 6 km, and the ends at 3200 and 4200 m elevation, such as the SW slope of Cayambe, Ecuador.  Acceleration is limited to 6 g's (60 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) for human passengers, so the muzzle velocity is 850 m/s (Mach 2.8).  An uncomplicated ramjet will operate roughly over a 2:1 velocity range.  Beyond that requires more compensation in inlet shape and combustion conditions, so we assume the maximum velocity will be 1700 m/s. Average equivalent exhaust velocity is about 14 km/s over this range, using hydrocarbon fuel. We will assume single stage to orbit and do calculations purely on theoretical performance for now.

'''Single Passenger Scaling'''

For a single passenger minimal system, we again assume a 1500 kg capsule with 750 kg of delivered human + life support, or low g cargo. Calculations are as follows:

* Rocket mass: 12,500 kg -  The rocket stage needs to supply 5,900 m/s net, which implies a mass ratio of 5.88, or 17% final mass.  With 11% harware mass, we end up with 6% payload.  Our initial rocket mass is therefore payload in kg/payload in percent = 12,500 kg, or about 1/3 lighter than the Jet Boost concept. 
* Ramjet thrust: 400 kN - At an average climb rate of 210 m/s, we want the ramjet to gain 850 m/s velocity over 40 seconds, or a little over 20 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.  Therefore the ramjet thrust needs to be 250 kN for acceleration. Drag is roughly estimated at 150 kN, so total engine thrust is estimated at 400 kN (90,000 lb) A very rough estimate of engine size would be 1.0 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; in area.  Since this is less than human passenger capsule size (1.6 m seated), the passenger size will govern barrel diameter.  
* Ramjet mass: 3950 kg - Ramjet Thrust to engine mass ratio averages about 20:1, thus the engine will have a mass of around 2000 kg.  Fuel required is about 1150 kg, and remaining ramjet related parts about 800 kg.  So total ramjet stage would be 3,950 kg.  
* Total mass: 16,500 kg - By adding the rocket and ramjet stages, or about 40% less than the jet boost.  It should be emphasized that these are preliminary calculations.
* Gun pressure: 500 kPa - A 1.6 m barrel accelerating 16,500 kg at 60 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; requires a total force of 990 kN. Dividing by the barrel area gives a pressure of 492 kPa ( 71 psi ).  This is not expected to be a difficult challenge from a technical standpoint.  More of a challenge will be installing 6 km of pipe on a mountain.

'''Small Prototype Scaling'''

To build a small scale demonstrator for this concept, let us assume a payload of 20 kg to orbit, with a higher allowed acceleration of 10 g's, and a two stage rocket.  The higher acceleration allows us to reach 900 m/s over a shorter barrel length of 4 km, and the ramjet function up to 900 m/s.  The net velocity for the rocket stages is then 5,835 m/s, or 2918 m/s each.  For a smaller size we assume slightly lower exhaust velocity (3300 m/s) and higher hardware fraction (15%). Mass ratio for each stage is 2.42.  Weights are calculated as follows:

* Stage 2 final mass = 1/mass fraction = 41.3%
* Stage 2 payload mass = final mass - hardware = 41.3% - 15% = 26.3% = 20 kg (by assumption)
* Stage 2 initial mass = 20 kg / 26.3% = 75 kg
* Stage 1 final mass = 41.3% (same velocity as 2nd stage)
* Stage 1 fuel used = 1 - final mass = 58.7 %
* Stage 1 hardware weight = 15% x fuel used = 8.8%
* Total Stage 1 = fuel + hardware = 67.5%
* Stage 2 then = 32.5% of launch weight.
* Total mass = Stage 2 / 32.5% = 231 kg

At 20 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; acceleration, the ramjet needs to provide about 5000 N thrust ( 1100 lb ), which only requires roughly 1/80 square meters engine area. The rocket stages can be represented by a cone 0.5 meters in diameter and 3.5 meters tall with a density of 1, so the engine is small relative to the rocket stage diameter. Ramjet mass would be around 25 kg, and fuel used about 15 kg.  Total launch mass would then be 271 kg.  Allow 29 kg for carrier/sabot to fit the barrel, and we have an accelerated mass of 300 kg.  At 100 m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the acceleration force then is 30 kN, and the required pressure is 152 kPa ( 22 psi ).

====Low Acceleration Guns====

You can launch people and delicate cargo with a gas pressure type accelerator if you lower the g forces sufficiently.  That forces the barrel length to be as long as possible, so we need to look at geography to select a location.  Two good locations present themselves, although others may be possible.

:'''Island of Hawaii'''

Hawaii is the best location on Earth as far as a large constant slope mountain, requiring minimal grading and support for the barrel, and so lower construction cost.  An equatorial site would be preferred to meet up with the Skyhook, but let us first look at Hawaii. It is a shield volcano and cooling lava flows at a constant slope.  Therefore you have a nearly perfect ramp on the west side of the island pointing up to the east to build on about 22 km long. You could get as much as 100 km if you extend down into the ocean or add support towers on the eastern slope, but that would be more expensive than building at ground level. For a 100 km long version at 6 g's the muzzle velocity could be as high as 3,460 m/s, but we will use 20 km for this example.

'''Design Scaling''' - Assume a 20 km long pipe x 10 m diameter, pushing a 500 ton single stage multiple use rocket. The vehicle will not fill the whole pipe, it is shaped for aerodynamics, and rides on a sled and pusher plate that fits the pipe.  It works out the pressure in the barrel needs to be 2 atmospheres (200kPa, 30 psi) to give you 3 g's acceleration, safe for most humans (general public) and satellite parts. Muzzle velocity is 1100 m/s (Mach 3.6), which is not a huge fraction of orbit velocity, but a nice running start before you light up your on-board rocket. Given those starting conditions, a non-cryogenic rocket should have a payload of around 35 tons, which along with a 10 meter maximum diameter should be plenty for any cargo or people you want to launch. This is the upper end of what you might want to build in terms of barrel diameter.  For higher mass vehicles, you just need higher operating pressure in the barrel. A first low-g cargo launcher can be a lot smaller than 10 meters, and increased in performance by adding length or going to larger barrels over time.  Hawaii is about 20 degrees N latitude, so a launch from there would not be able to reach an equatorial Skyhook, but it would deliver more passengers and cargo than an unaided rocket.

:'''Cayembe, Ecuador'''

[[File:Cayembe_Ecuador_Launch_System_Fit_to_Terrain.PNG|thumb|right|400px|20 km Barrel Fit to Terrain]]
Cayembe is the name of both a city and large mountain about 50 km north-east of Quito, Ecuador.  We previously discussed a hypervelocity launcher on the side of the mountain.  For transporting people, the barrel will need to be much longer for lower acceleration, and extend west somewhat past the town. For this version we assume a trained crew rather than general public. With pressure suits, conforming seats, +x acceleration (forward facing seats), and crew in good condition you can safely use 6 g's, and thus get a muzzle velocity of 1560 m/s.  That's Mach 5.2, or 20% of orbit velocity. The Skyhook has been available since the previous step in the combined system example, which subtracts another 2400 m/s from the rocket stage requirement.

The '''[http://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-_izqCR4nsS0/T6bJLGsngcI/AAAAAAAAC1c/zA2p3C2doqA/s1577/Cayambe%2520Topo%2520Map.jpg geography of Ecuador]''' is not a smooth slope like Hawaii.  We assume the barrel is 20.25 km long, but curved upward with a segmented radius that keeps centrifugal acceleration at or below 12 m/s^2. That will be felt by passengers as a vertical acceleration (head to toe).  The barrel will need to be supported on towers or use tunnels as needed to fit the terrain, and the curvature roughly fits the geography, which is flat initially, rising to a mountain at the end.  The ends are at 2778 m elevation south west of the town, and 5731 m at the top of the mountain, with initial and final slopes of 1.4 and 12.4 degrees caused by the curved barrel  The gentle curvature keeps the vertical acceleration low relative to the forward acceleration.  The higher slope at the muzzle end also allows faster climb through the atmosphere and less drag loss. These assumptions may be changed with more detailed analysis. We assume the rocket stage is 4 x 32 meters in size, and closely fits the barrel, with a mass of 400 tons at launch.

'''Drag''' - With a drag coefficient of 0.2, the rocket stage will see 1.93 MN of drag at the muzzle, producing -4.82 m/s^2 deceleration if the rocket does not ignite immediately.  The climb rate of sin(12 deg) x 1560 m/s = 335 m/s. The equivalent thickness of the atmosphere is called the '''scale height''' (8640 m vertically) over which the pressure drops by a factor of e (2.718...).  An exponential pressure decay per scale height over many km is how the real atmospheric pressure changes, but it can be approximated as the muzzle pressure for one vertical scale height and then dropping to zero. 8640 m scale height / 335 m/s vertical velocity = 25.76 sec. Multiplied by the deceleration the total drag loss can be estimated at 124 m/s.  This value will change depending when the rocket is started, since drag is a function of velocity.

'''Rocket Performance''' - The net velocity required for the rocket is found from the Skyhook tip velocity relative to the Earth's center (5074 m/s), less the Earth's rotation at the equator (-465 m/s) and gun velocity (-1560 m/s) plus drag loss (+124 m/s) and other losses and maneuvering which we make an estimate for (+200 m/s). This comes to 3,373 m/s net.  The SpaceX Merlin engine has an exhaust velocity of 2980 m/s. 4-6 engines will probably be required for sufficient thrust. The rocket equation gives the rocket mass after reaching the Skyhook as 32.2% of initial mass.  Allowing 10% for the vehicle itself gives 22.2% payload, or 89 tons.  This is a large passenger and cargo capacity, with a correspondingly large Skyhook to support the arrival mass. A first version would likely be smaller.

Knowing the area of the barrel and the rocket vehicle mass and acceleration, we can calculate the required pressure as 1.91 MPa ( 277 psi ) for the 4 meter gun and 1.22 MPa ( 177 psi ) for a 2.5 meter gun.  The challenge will not be barrel pressure, but filling it fast enough when the projectile is moving rapidly.  The length will likely require tanks and valves space out along the barrel.  The muzzle velocity will likely require a heated gas to fill the pipe, but exactly which gas will be left for detailed analysis. Large gas accelerators have reached above twice the muzzle velocity, so it is more a matter of lowest cost than feasibility.

'''Spaceport Growth''' - We had previously built an operational Hypervelocity Gun on the mountain with a muzzle velocity of 5000 m/s and an unaided payload to orbit of 180 kg.  With the Skyhook in place, we can calculate the new payload as follows:

* The Skyhook's tip velocity relative to Earth's center is 5074 m/s. Earth's rotation deducts 465 m/s.  Drag loss is 1000 m/s from the initial 5000 m/s. Trajectory elevation of 23 degrees means the horizontal component, which is all that counts for getting to orbit, is cos(23 deg) = 0.9205 x 4000 m/s after drag = 3682 m/s.  We allow an extra 200 m/s for maneuvering and other unaccounted losses.  So the net delta-V of the rocket becomes 1127 m/s.
* Using the same exhaust velocity as the SpaceX Merlin engine (2980 m/s) but at 1/60th the thrust level, we get a final mass of 68.5% x 1200 kg start mass = 822 kg. With the same empty vehicle mass of 180 kg as the version before the Skyhook, we now have 642 kg payload, or about 3.5 times as much.

Going from 642 kg payload with a 60 cm caliber (barrel diameter) gun to 89 tons with the 4 meter caliber human accelerator is a factor of 139 times larger.  Since the Skyhook has to be enlarged for the larger delivery mass, a program of gradual improvement will be needed.  The launchers will add barrel length and move to larger diameters in steps, and use part of their cargo to deliver Skyhook cable and other materials, so that later deliveries with more payload can be handled.  If orbital mining can supply sufficiently strong materials, they can be used, but otherwise they can come from Earth.  A smaller version of the human accelerator than the one above could use a 2.5 x 20 m size rocket vehicle with a mass of 100 tons.  Using similar calculations, we end up with 20 tons net cargo for it.  At some point the low-g accelerator would be too small for seated human passengers, probably around 1.6 meter diameter, but they can still be used for sensitive cargo.  Bulk non-sensitive cargo will always have a cost advantage because the higher muzzle velocity lets you deliver 3 times more payload as a percentage of rocket vehicle weight, so it makes sense to keep both types of launchers.

Depending on traffic needs, you may want to keep smaller launchers operating in parallel with their larger replacements. In theory you could launch every time the Skyhook passes over in its orbit, which is every 100 minutes, but barrel cool down or other needs may prevent firing a given gun that often, so having several may be useful. At the upper bound, delivering 89 tons per launch x 14.4 orbits per day x 300 days per year (allowing some maintenance time) yields an astounding 384,480 tons/year to orbit.  This compares to the ~1,000 ton/year capacity of current and near-term launchers worldwide.

'''Cost''' - At this point, cost has not been estimated to any degree of accuracy.  The Falcon 9 rocket has a total mass of 333.4 tons and a payload to low orbit of 10.45 tons.  So the ratio of rocket mass besides payload to payload is 30.9 to 1. The bulk cargo launcher has a non payload mass of 558 kg vs 642 kg payload, or a ratio of 0.87 to 1.  This 35.5 to 1 advantage should lower costs significantly, but not in that exact ratio.  The gun and Skyhook are large installations relative to the rocket stage, and their cost per use will depend on how many times they are used.  The Falcon 9 hardware is not currently reused, while the rocket stage is intended to be used multiple times.  De-orbiting from the Skyhook is 63% of the unaided velocity from orbit, and thus (0.63)^2 = 39.5% of the kinetic energy to dissipate.  This makes the heat shield easier to design, and the stage is pretty rugged in design, since it needs to be fired out of a gun at high acceleration.  So in principle it should be able to be recovered and used again.

In the absence of more detailed estimates, for now we will adopt the 35.5 times reduction in rocket size per payload and apply it to the $54 million/10,450 kg = 5,167 $/kg Falcon 9 cost, to get a first estimate of 146 $/kg.  To compare to some popular consumer items, the iPad 3 64 GB costs 583 $/kg including packaging, and a Toyota Camry is about 15 $/kg, although neither is designed to survive high-g launch.

      <text xml:space="preserve">= Middleware =
[[File:MiddlewareOnion.svg|thumb|MiddlewareOnion]]

In the computer industry, middleware is a general term for any programming that serves to &quot;glue together&quot; or mediate between two separate and often already existing programs. A common application of middleware is to allow programs written for access to a particular database to access other databases. http://searchsoa.techtarget.com/definition/middleware
Stimulated by the growth of network-based applications, middleware technologies are taking an increasing importance. They cover a wide range of software systems, including distributed objects and components, message-oriented communication, and mobile application support. http://middleware.objectweb.org/

Typically, middleware programs provide messaging services so that different applications can communicate. The systematic tying together of disparate applications, often through the use of middleware, is known as enterprise application integration (EAI).In all of the above situations, applications use intermediate software that resides on top of the operating systems and communication protocols to perform the following functions :
Hiding distribution, i.e. the fact that an application is usually made up of many interconnected parts running in distributed locations;
Hiding the heterogeneity of the various hardware components, operating systems and communication protocols; Providing uniform, standard, high-level interfaces to the application developers and integrators, so that applications can be easily composed, reused, ported, and made to interoperate;
Supplying a set of common services to perform various general purpose functions, in order to avoid duplicating efforts and to facilitate collaboration between applications.
These intermediate software layers have come to be known under the generic name of middleware.
The role of middleware is to make application development easier, by providing common programming abstractions, by masking the heterogeneity and the distribution of the underlying hardware and operating systems, and by hiding low-level programming details.

If used for web database applications, middleware is oftentimes written as scripts, such as ''JavaScript'', ''VBScript'', ''CGI'', or ''PHP''. Alternately, there are now capabilities in web authoring software that can automatically generate the needed scripts to connect a dynamic webpage to a database, depending on the configuration the web developer sets.

Database Classifications:
'''Single-User vs. Multi-user'''
Single-user databases are located on a single computer and are designed to be accessed by one user. Multi-user database systems may try to access and modify the same data at the same time. Database locking software takes place to prevent data changing at the same time. 
'''Client-server vs. N-tier''' 
Client-server consists of servers that supply resources to other computers which function as client devices. N-tier databases work slightly differently. While client-server database systems just have two parts, N-tier has at least one middle client (programs used with database, or middleware). 
'''Centralized vs. Distributed database system'''
Centralized database systems are all located on a single computer, while distributed database systems have the data divided among several computers connected via a network. 
'''Disk-based vs. In-memory'''
Disk-based databases store data on hard drives or removable disks. In-memory databases store data in the main memory of the computer.

=== In-Memory Database ===
An in-memory database (IMDB, also known as Main Memory Database, or MMDB) stores all the data in the RAM of the computer as opposed to a hard drive.  The advantage of an IMDB is faster performance (recall).  The disadvantage is the potential loss of data in a power outage.  Performing regular backups of IMDB’s is critical to ensure continuation of service if power is lost.  Other methods of minimizing data loss include: using transaction logs, using non-volatile RAM, and complete database replication .

no like a heater in a car well if the train goes in a tunnel we will have to get are bandnana wet and wrap it over are nose and mouth because if you dont you could past out from the chemicals and die 
 
Well that works for dust chemical releases are a different matter. But the deaths I have read about were when people are locked inside...
 
the chemical that comes out of the engine 
 
btw will prob have to publish also on diffferent blog bcz wikibooks is open source but once it is posted somewhere else then it can be quoted on the wikibokk...maybe indymedia would be a good place to put this text also...edited for ease of reading...let me know if you want to be (1) Javier Baker (2) Javier X (3)made up name (4)JB or what
engine smoke yeah that is probably got som CO in it not as bad though i hear an amnmonia car or a chlorine car are bad
the guy fawkes mask is cool it would look cool in a published interview. Please define pusher
 
well a pusher is an engine but its in the back of the train and its in reverse because the train that its hook up to is long and it helps move the long train 
but hey sorry gotta go 
 
so &quot;J.B.&quot; what about getting on the train do you prefer bridge overpass or run and grab and which type car prefered
k
 
run and grab

== More notes on interview ==

 
Hopping trains toget to work 
Opperater
 
so Jack London was into this 
 
Yes
 
anyone you know ever get hurt on the rails?
 
Yes
 
Sorry to hear that.
Trains much faster these days
My heart beat fast with the thrill of adventure. We reached De Kalb without mishap, and ran for a dark place to hide while the train stopped at the depot. When the engine steamed away, we were aboard the first blind. Another man was there ahead of us.
Great clouds of steam and smoke fell all around us. A faded yellow moon would now and then shine through the vapour. The train ran a few miles until it came to a siding. It stopped for a signal, and was slowly starting up again when the third person spoke. &quot;You guys hold up your hands,&quot; he said, as he pointed a long, dark revolver at us.
We did as we were told, and the man hastily handcuffed our wrists together. &quot;We'll ride nice and easy on into Clinton, 'Boes, and I'll see that you get the rock pile for a couple o' months</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==NoSQL==
NoSQL is a classification of database systems that do not conform to the relational database or SQL standard. They have various roots, from distributed internet databases, to object databases, XML databases and even legacy databases. They have become recently popular because of their use in large scale distributed databases in Google, Amazon, and Facebook.

There are various NoSQL databases including:
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MongoDB Mongo DB]
* [http://www.oracle.com/us/products/database/nosql/overview/index.html Oracle NoSQL]
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Cassandra Cassandra]
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BigTable Google BigTable]
* [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CouchDB Couch DB]

Other non-relational data sources include:
* Hierarchical databases, VSAM, and other legacy databases
* CICS, Tuxedo, MQ Series, and other transactional and messaging systems
* Application databases, SAP, Oracle Apps and other apps data
* XML databases, webservices, and other XML services
* Data interchange and B2B services
* Object databases, and object relational data types
* JSON, LDAP, Excel, and various other data formats and services


The JPA specification only defines relational database access, but its API and many of its annotations are not relational specific.  There are several JPA providers that support JPA access to NoSQL databases and non-relational data.

Some NoSQL and non-relational data sources provide JDBC drivers that allow normal JPA providers to provide access to NoSQL data.

Some non-relational data sources also provide JCA (Java Connector Architecture) drivers or JMS (Java Message Service) access to their data.  Some JPA providers support accessing JCA and JMS data in place of JDBC.

:[[Java Persistence/TopLink|TopLink]] / [[Java Persistence/EclipseLink|EclipseLink]] : Support NoSQL data as of the 2.4 release with support for [http://wiki.eclipse.org/EclipseLink/Examples/JPA/NoSQL MongoDB] and Oracle NoSQL.  EIS and non-relational data is also supported through the JCA and JMS specifications.  Support for XML, JAXB and SDO is an integrated part of the products.  Mapping to object relational data types are also supported.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Transaction Processing System (TPS)===

A Transaction Processing System (TPS) also known as data processing systems are used within many companies to provide support and organization in the processing of large amounts of paperwork.  TPS(s) are often used when producing or recording things like pay checks, invoices, student tuition bills and payment reminders.  A TPS would most likely be found in a business’s accounting/billing department and is a necessity for many large companies that may produce hundreds if not thousands of transactions every day.  The primary function of a TPS or data processing system is to effectively and efficiently process and record any data that is a result of a transaction.  Users of transaction processing systems include lower level management, supervisors and operations personnel.  What sets a transaction processing system apart from a management information system is that TPS(s) bring the entire transaction process full circle from start to finish and incorporate many divisions within a business.  (http://www.basicsofcomputer.com/function_of_transaction_processing_system_tps.htm)

Programs that are called Transaction Processing Systems (TPS) by supporting transaction processing  provide three functional areas:

1. System run-time functions:
 ⋅ environment that ensures integrity availability and     
   security of data
     ≈Scheduling and loading balancing
     ≈Managing system resources
     ≈Monitoring the progress of tasks
     ≈Managing communications
     ≈Time management
 ⋅ fast response time and high transaction throughput

2. System administration functions:
 ⋅ administrative support that lets users configure, 
   monitor, and manage their transactions.
  
3. Application development functions
 ⋅ functions for use in custom business applications, 
   including functions to access data, to perform inter-
   computer communications, and to design and manage the
   user interface.

I have been asked to re-format and maintain the Maryland Entrepreneur's Guide (http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/The_Maryland_Entrepreneur%27s_Guide) by the University of Maryland Carey School of Law Business Law Society and the Maryland State Bar Association. The major changes to the Guide that I have made recently have been reviewed and approved, however, I noticed that all minor edits I make to the page come up as pending changes. I would like to be granted reviewer status so I can more easily maintain the Guide and implement changes that first meet the approval of the MSBA. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Growl41|Growl41]] ([[User talk:Growl41|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Growl41|contribs]]) 17:45, 20 February 2012‎ (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;
:As an aside ''implement changes that first '''meet the approval of the MSBA.''''' would be contrary to policy as it implies that the MSBA has control over the book. I trust you realise that having the reviewer flag wouldn't give you the power to reject changes by other editors that weren't &quot;approved by the MSBA&quot;? &lt;font color=&quot;#E66C2C&quot;&gt;[[User:QuiteUnusual|'''QU''']]&lt;/font&gt; &lt;sup&gt;&lt;font color=&quot;#306754&quot;&gt;[[User talk:QuiteUnusual|TalkQu]]&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/sup&gt; 21:11, 20 February 2012 (UTC)
:Unless an administrator has changed the settings then all edits will appear to all users whether approved or not.  Logged in users can change settings so they can only see approved edits.  The exceptions to this are generally Wikijunior and certain high-vandalism-targets.  We would be happy to grant you Reviewer rights but this won't change how your edits are shown to other readers.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 23:28, 20 February 2012 (UTC)
I have just come from a meeting with MSBA members where I was told that the MSBA does want the Guide to be a dynamic resource that gives small business owners and attorneys (anyone) the ability to edit freely. I understand that having a reviewer status would not allow me to reject changes by other editors that were not given prior approval. I would still like a reviewer flag in order to deter against vandalism and guarantee that the Guide remains user friendly. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Growl41|Growl41]] ([[User talk:Growl41|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Growl41|contribs]]) 00:45, 21 February 2012‎ (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;
: You don't need the reviewer bit to deter vandalism and keep the Guide user friendly.  Moreover, if you're going to be editing it on a regular basis, you'll receive the bit automatically after a while.  There's no apparent reason to rush this automatic process since there isn't anything you want to do that needs the bit.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 06:57, 21 February 2012 (UTC)
The reviewer bit may not be entirely necessary to deter vandalism, but it would allow me to correct vandalism and keep the Guide user friendly without having every change I make come up as ''pending''. We are going to begin advertising the Guide in newsletters and local journals beginning next month, and will be expecting a lot of adjustments as more people become aware of its existence. With a reviewer status I can better ensure that the majority of users are viewing a completed and authoritative version of the Guide by limiting the need for users to compare the latest draft to previous ones. Wikipedia states that  ''The purpose of reviewing is to catch and filter out obvious vandalism and obviously inappropriate edits on articles under pending changes protection...'' This is exactly what I would like to do for the Guide, and unless I can automatically recieve the reviewer bit before March 2nd, I would like to ''rush'' the process. &lt;small&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;autosigned&quot;&gt;—Preceding [[w:Wikipedia:Signatures|unsigned]] comment added by [[User:Growl41|Growl41]] ([[User talk:Growl41|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Growl41|contribs]]) 11:46, 21 February 2012‎ (UTC)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/small&gt;&lt;!-- Template:Unsigned --&gt;

::I again am forced to point out that exceptions to the automated process must be few if the process is to have any purpose and the requirements made any validity. I agree with Pi zero, there is no need to &lt;s&gt;jump the hoop here&lt;/s&gt; jump the gun here, continue editing and you will have the flag. Note also that we are not Wikipedia and the flag here has deeper implications especially when attributing the highest levels, we work on books, most will have a complex structure or require a deeper level of knowledge to review, an edit pending may not only mean that no one has looked at the change, but that no one felt competent enough or even entitled to validate it (esthetical and image alterations for instance).  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 06:24, 23 February 2012 (UTC)

This discussion and request is now irrelevant because the user has since been automatically promoted to Reviewer.--[[User:Xania|ЗAНИA]] [[Image:Flag_of_Italy.svg|15px]][[User talk:Xania|&lt;sup&gt;talk&lt;/sup&gt;]] 19:34, 9 March 2012 (UTC)

      <comment>/* Adding Configuration File Options */ parameters (plural); close parenthesis</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Motivation ==
You want to parse a file of comma-separated values (CSV) text into an xml structure or you have a flat file with very similar line/field structure that you want to convert into XML format.

== Method ==
We will use the tokenize($input, '\n') function to break the input file into separate lines. We will then use the tokenize($input, ',') function
to parse each line into separate fields.

== Basic Example ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
xquery version &quot;1.0&quot;;

let $title := 'XQuery CSV Parser'

let $csv-input-sample :=
'John,Smith,x123
Peg,Jones,x456
Sue,Adams,x789
Dan,McCoy,x321'

let $lines := tokenize($csv-input-sample, '\n')

return
&lt;results&gt;{
  for $line in $lines
  let $fields := tokenize($line, ',')
  return
  &lt;row&gt;{
    for $field in $fields
    return
      &lt;field&gt;{$field}&lt;/field&gt;
  }&lt;/row&gt;
}&lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Sample Output ==
&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;results&gt;
   &lt;row&gt;
      &lt;field&gt;John&lt;/field&gt;
      &lt;field&gt;Smith&lt;/field&gt;
      &lt;field&gt;x123&lt;/field&gt;
   &lt;/row&gt;
   &lt;row&gt;
      &lt;field&gt;Peg&lt;/field&gt;
      &lt;field&gt;Jones&lt;/field&gt;
      &lt;field&gt;x456&lt;/field&gt;
   &lt;/row&gt;
   &lt;row&gt;
      &lt;field&gt;Sue&lt;/field&gt;
      &lt;field&gt;Adams&lt;/field&gt;
      &lt;field&gt;x789&lt;/field&gt;
   &lt;/row&gt;
   &lt;row&gt;
      &lt;field&gt;Dan&lt;/field&gt;
      &lt;field&gt;McCoy&lt;/field&gt;
      &lt;field&gt;x321&lt;/field&gt;
   &lt;/row&gt;
&lt;/results&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

== Example With Data Dictionary in Row 1 ==
This second example will use the first row of the CSV file as a data dictionary of the element names for each column of each row.

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
let $csv :=
'name,faculty
alice,anthropology
bob,biology'

let $lines := tokenize($csv, '\n')
let $head := tokenize($lines[1], ',')
let $body := remove($lines, 1)
return
    &lt;people&gt;
        {
            for $line in $body
            let $fields := tokenize($line, ',')
            return
                &lt;person&gt;
                    {
                        for $key at $pos in $head
                        let $value := $fields[$pos]
                        return
                            element { $key } { $value }
                    }
                &lt;/person&gt;
        }
    &lt;/people&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

We will receive below result (tested with eXide in eXist 2.0):

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;people&gt;
  &lt;person&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;alice&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;faculty&gt;anthropology&lt;/faculty&gt;
  &lt;/person&gt;
  &lt;person&gt;
    &lt;name&gt;bob&lt;/name&gt;
    &lt;faculty&gt;biology&lt;/faculty&gt;
  &lt;/person&gt;
&lt;/people&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

Beware though, that this requires the very strict input format proposed. In practice CSV can look quite different.

== Adding Configuration File Options ==
Many times you have a family of CSV files that all may have very similar options for import. In this case it is useful to be able to pass a series of configuration parameters to a single XQuery function. These configuration parameters include:

# What the field delimiter is (comma is the default)
# The element name of the root node
# The element name of each line or row

# If each field could be wrapped in quotes

&lt;source lang=&quot;xml&quot;&gt;
&lt;file-import-config&gt;
   &lt;field-delimiter&gt;,&lt;field-delimiter&gt;
   &lt;root-element-name&gt;people&lt;/root-element-name&gt;
   &lt;line-element-name&gt;person&lt;/line-element-name&gt;
&lt;/file-import-config&gt;
&lt;/source&gt;

You can then pass this configuration file to your XQuery function:

   import-lib:flat-file-import($input-file, $config)

      <comment>/* Secondary Caution */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
At the time of arrest, an officer must typically inform the accused of the following and confirm that they understand:
# inform of reason for arrest
# Charter of Rights caution / Right to Silence
# right to speak to a lawyer
# access to legal aid
# secondary police cautions

==Right to be Informed of Charges==
:''See also [[Canadian Criminal Procedure and Practice/Arrest and Detention/Investigative Detention#Right_to_be_Informed_of_Reasons|Right to be Informed of Reasons for Detention]]''

Section 10(a) of the Charter entitles all people &quot;the right on arrest or detention ... to be informed promptly of the reasons therefore&quot;. It is generally expected that the arresting officer, upon making the arrest, will inform the person of the reason for the arrest. However, where the reason is obvious and the person is well aware of the reason, it is not necessary.&lt;Ref&gt;Koechlin v. Waugh &amp; Hamilton, [1975] O.J. No. 105, 118 C.C.C. 24 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not necessary to always inform the accused of the circumstances of the offence. In a murder case it is not necessary to reveal the identity of the victim's identity.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Jackson, [http://canlii.ca/t/1m5j3 2005 ABCA 430] (CanLII)
&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary point of inquiry is whether the accused can reasonably be supposed to have understood the reason for the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Evans [http://canlii.ca/t/1fsml 1991 CanLII 98] (SCC) at para. 35&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Carrier, [http://canlii.ca/t/1wghz 2008 ABCA 134] (CanLII) at para. 7&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Lund, [http://canlii.ca/t/21dv8 2008 ABCA 373] (CanLII) at para. 11&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Failure to inform the accused that he is &quot;arrested&quot; and charged with a specific offence may not be fatal where the accused understood the basis for his apprehension and the extent of his jeopardy.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Latimer, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fr3w 1997 CanLII 405] (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 217, 112 C.C.C. (3d) 193 at para. 31
&lt;/ref&gt;

To understand the extent of jeopardy it is not necessary to be aware of the precise charge face or the full extent of the details of the case.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Smith, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fsm5 1991 CanLII 91] (SCC), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 714, 63 C.C.C. (3d) 313 at para. 28
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Right to Counsel==
:''See also [[Canadian Criminal Procedure and Practice/Arrest and Detention/Right to Counsel]]''

'''Script'''&lt;br&gt;
The arresting officer must inform the accused of the charges and their right to counsel. Typically, the officer will read from a script such as:

{{quotation|

I am arresting you for [name of offence(s)]. 
&lt;P&gt;
You have the right to retain and instruct counsel without delay. You also have the right to free and immediate legal advice from duty counsel by making free telephone calls to [toll-free phone number(s)] during business hours and [toll-free phone number(s)] during non-business hours. 
&lt;P&gt;
Do you understand? 
&lt;P&gt;
Do you wish to call a lawyer?
&lt;P&gt;
You also have the right to apply for legal assistance through the provincial legal aid program.
&lt;P&gt;
Do you understand?}}

==Right to Silence and Right Against Self-Crimination==
:''See also [[Canadian Criminal Evidence/Admissions and Confessions/Right Against Self-crimination]] and [[Canadian Criminal Evidence/Admissions and Confessions/Voluntariness]]''

Upon arrest the peace officer should inform the accused of their right to silence and right against self-crimination protected under section 7 and section 11(c) of the Charter. 

The script read to the accused will go something like the following:
{{quotation|
POLICE WARNING:&lt;br&gt;
I wish to give you the following warning: You need not say anything. You have nothing to hope from any promise or favour and nothing to fear from any threat whether or not you say anything. Anything you do say may be used as evidence. 
&lt;P&gt;
Do you understand?
}}

===Secondary Caution===
Where there had been previous communication between the police and accused prior to the reading of the first police warning, the police will usually provide what is called a &quot;secondary caution&quot; or &quot;warning&quot; that informs the accused that nothing said by the police prior to the first warning should influence the accused in the decision to make a statement. This is to avoid the tainting and exclusion of potential statement as &quot;derived statements&quot; following a previously involuntary statement.&lt;ref&gt;
See [[Canadian Criminal Evidence/Admissions and Confessions/Voluntariness]] for details&lt;/ref&gt;

The script read is similar to the following:  
{{quotation|
SECONDARY POLICE WARNING:&lt;br&gt;
I wish to give you the following warning: You must clearly understand that anything said to you previously should not influence you or make you feel compelled to say anything at this time. Whatever you felt influenced or compelled to say earlier, you are now not obliged to repeat, nor are you obliged to say anything further, but whatever you do say may be given as evidence. 
&lt;P&gt;
Do you understand?
}}

'''Arrest without warrant by peace officer'''&lt;br&gt;
495. (1) A peace officer may arrest without warrant
:(a) a person who has committed an indictable offence or who, on reasonable grounds, he believes has committed or is about to commit an indictable offence;
:(b) a person whom he finds committing a criminal offence; or
:(c) a person in respect of whom he has reasonable grounds to believe that a warrant of arrest or committal, in any form set out in Part XXVIII in relation thereto, is in force within the territorial jurisdiction in which the person is found.
&lt;p&gt;
'''Limitation'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) A peace officer shall not arrest a person without warrant for
:(a) an indictable offence mentioned in section 553,
:(b) an offence for which the person may be prosecuted by indictment or for which he is punishable on summary conviction, or
:(c) an offence punishable on summary conviction, 
&lt;p&gt;
in any case where
:(d) he believes on reasonable grounds that the public interest, having regard to all the circumstances including the need to
::(i) establish the identity of the person,
::(ii) secure or preserve evidence of or relating to the offence, or
::(iii) prevent the continuation or repetition of the offence or the commission of another offence,
&lt;p&gt;
may be satisfied without so arresting the person, and
&lt;p&gt;
:(e) he has no reasonable grounds to believe that, if he does not so arrest the person, the person will fail to attend court in order to be dealt with according to law.
&lt;p&gt;
'''Consequences of arrest without warrant'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) Notwithstanding subsection (2), a peace officer acting under subsection (1) is deemed to be acting lawfully and in the execution of his duty for the purposes of
:(a) any proceedings under this or any other Act of Parliament; and
:(b) any other proceedings, unless in any such proceedings it is alleged and established by the person making the allegation that the peace officer did not comply with the requirements of subsection (2).
&lt;br&gt;
R.S., 1985, c. C-46, s. 495; R.S., 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 75.|[http://canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec495 CCC]
}}

A police officer can arrest where:
# there is reasonable grounds a person has committed an indictable offence;
# there is reasonable grounds a person is about to commit an indictable offence;
# a person is committing an indictable offence; or 
# a person has a warrant out for his/her arrest.

There is limited power to arrest where the accused is found committing a summary offence ''and'' it is necessary to establish the accused's identity, among other things.&lt;ref&gt;Moore v. The Queen, [1979] 1 S.C.R. 195 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1978/1978canlii160/1978canlii160.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a common law power for peace officers to arrest without a warrant where the officer has an honest and reasonable belief that there is a breach of the peace.&lt;ref&gt;
Hayes v. Thompson [http://canlii.ca/t/1p6p7 1985 CanLII 151] (BC CA), (1985), 18 C.C.C. (3d) 254&lt;br&gt;
Brown v. Durham (Regional Municipality) Police Force, [1998] O.J. No. 5274&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Collins, [http://canlii.ca/t/frd14 2012 CanLII 26587] (NL PC)&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|close=1}}

==Reasonable Grounds==
Reasonable grounds for arrest (pre-1985 was referred to as &quot;reasonable and probable grounds') has an objective and subjective component.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Storrey (1990), 53 C.C.C. 316 (SCC) [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1990/1990canlii125/1990canlii125.html]&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Grotheim 2001 SKCA 116 (SaskCA) [http://www.canlii.org/en/sk/skca/doc/2001/2001skca116/2001skca116.html]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. McClelland, (1995), 165 A.R. 332 (C.A.) at para. 21
&lt;/ref&gt; 

Reasonable grounds is a standard lower than a prima facie case and is less than a balance of probabilities.&lt;reF&gt;see R. v. Debot 1986 CanLII 113 (ON CA), (1986), 17 O.A.C. 141, affirmed 1989 CanLII 13 (SCC), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 1140&lt;/ref&gt;

An arresting officer is not required the same scrutiny as a justice of a peace would need to be in considering a search warrant.&lt;Ref&gt;see R. v. Polashek 1999 CanLII 3714 (ON CA), (1999), 45 O.R. (3d) 434&lt;/ref&gt;

Police cannot arrest first and then determine after the fact whether the accused had a connection with their investigation.&lt;REf&gt;see R. v. Whitaker, 2008 BCCA 174, and R. v. Chaif-Gust, 2011 BCCA 528 (CanLII), 2011 BCCA 528.&lt;/ref&gt;

The officer must take into account both inculpatory as well as exculpatory evidence. Only evidence that is unreliable can be ignored.&lt;ref&gt; Chartier v. Quebec (A.G.), [1979] 2 S.C.R. 474 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1979/1979canlii17/1979canlii17.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The officer must make inquiry as the circumstances reasonably permit.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Golub, 1997 CanLII 6316 (ON C.A.) [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1997/1997canlii6316/1997canlii6316.html] at para. 21&lt;/ref&gt; 

The officer may base his belief upon assumptions or secondary sources. However, the belief cannot be only a hunch. The circumstances must be sufficient to convince a reasonably fair-minded person put in the same position as the officer that the grounds for his or her belief are reasonable. The facts must not be considered piecemeal but in a holistic manner.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Chin, 2003 ABPC 118 at para. 60 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abpc/doc/2003/2003abpc118/2003abpc118.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The officer may use his training and experience in determining objective reasonableness. For example, what may appear to be innocent objects to the general public may have a very different meaning to an officer experienced in drug operations&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Rajaratnam, 2006 ABCA 333 at para. 25&lt;/ref&gt; This objective standard while &quot;standing in the shoes of the police officer&quot; has been interpreted as taking into account the officer's experience and training.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Juan, 2007 BCCA 351, at paras. 27-28 [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/2007/2007bcca351/2007bcca351.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

A conclusory statement from one officer to another, such as “a drug transaction has taken place ”, will not support an objective finding of reasonable and probable grounds for an arrest.&lt;ref&gt; 
R. v. Lal (1998), 130 C.C.C. (3d) 413 (B.C.C.A.) [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/1998/1998canlii4393/1998canlii4393.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The subjective grounds must be based on a ''bona fides'' belief to a relevant fact. It is not necessary that the fact actually be true.&lt;Ref&gt;Eccles v. Bourque, [1975] 2 S.C.R. 739 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1974/1974canlii191/1974canlii191.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|close=1}}
===Finds committing===
Under s. 495(1)(b) empowers a peace officer to make a warrantless arrest where a person is &quot;apparently&quot; committing an offence. This must be an honestly held belief and must be reasonable. The officer does not have to be so certain as equate with a conviction.&lt;ref&gt;The Queen v. Biron, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 56 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1975/1975canlii13/1975canlii13.html 1975 CanLII 13]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Roberge 1983 CanLII 120 (SCC), (1983), 4 C.C.C. (3d) 304&lt;/ref&gt; 

It has been found that the strong smell of raw marijuana can be sufficient to conclude that the accused was in possession or marijuana and is arrestable under s.495(1)(b).&lt;ref&gt;
R v Harding, 2010 ABCA 180, 482 AR 262, at para 29&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; A faint and intermittent smell is not sufficient for arrest.

==Technological Detection==
===Sniffer Dogs===
A drug sniffer dog may be used to search on the basis of the lower standard of &quot;reasonable suspicion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Kang-Brown 2008 SCC 18&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">I'm a math teacher at Perry Street Preparatory Public Charter School.

It's my latest goal to develop a &quot;classroom of the future,&quot; or, really, a classroom of the present; incorporating as much (or as many) electronic and online options as possible to help my students succeed. That's tough to do when you don't have a budget that covers text books, let alone modern electronics, such as laptops on every desk.

It'll be interesting to see how WikiBooks can help. We'll see, so stay tuned.

In the meantime, here's a little bit of my background.

Before joining PSP in 2010, I taught at McKinley Tech high school. Both high schools are in Washington, D.C.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Aspect oriented programming is an approach to program design in which different functions are clearly separated.  It is emerged out of an object- oriented programming as it uses some of its concepts.  It is little different from other programming as it is more advanced.  It makes programming easier.  It is easy to understand as well as efficient.   It makes possible to break the big programs into small programs to make it more understandable and manageable.  It helps to focus on separating the components by using different classes and modules.  It helps to reduce the redundancy by using the code segment without repeating the code throughout the whole program.  These programs basically compliment each other rather than competing.  This is done so program components can be developed and modified individually from one another or the component can be reused with separate non-related objects. 
	

Some benefits of aspect oriented programming is the quality of code have improved. Another benefit is it takes programmers less time to write a program. By using this programming, it reduces redundancy, improve software quality and lower IT maintenance costs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==The Effects of Stephen Colbert’s Super PAC on The Public Sphere==



===PACs, What Are They?=== 
Essentially, Political Action Committees (PACs) are groups that donate money to a campaign or candidate who will favor their opinion in certain issues. They came into being because of the Tillman Act, and the Taft-Hartley Act; both of which were designed to prohibit corporate and labor union contributions to political elections. Basically, PACs were formed to bypass the system and allow corporations and other groups to funnel money to anyone they wanted to.
In 1971, Congress passed the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) to limit campaign contributions. The same bill also set up the Federal Election Commission (FEC) whose purpose is to administer federal campaign finance laws. 
There are different variations of PACs: Connected, Unconnected, Leadership, and Super. Each of them is slightly different than the others. But the main issue is the difference between the others and Super PACs.


===What is The Difference Between a PAC And a Super PAC?===
In 2010 the Supreme Court ruled on the case of Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission. They found that it was unconstitutional to prohibit corporate and union entities from spending money on political matters. Also in 2010, there was a ruling by the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals that allowed groups not donating to an official, or their campaign, to accept a donation of any size.  

With the rulings of these two cases the creation of Super PACs became legal. While they operate like a normal PAC there are a very few noticeable and important differences. They may solicit an unlimited amount of money from anyone, and spend it in almost any way they see fit; the exception being that they may not donate directly to candidate’s campaigns or political parties. The kicker is that to become a Super PAC, all that has to be done is filling out one additional sheet of paperwork.


===Why is This a Problem?===
The real question is “why is this legal?” It is a blatant disregard of democracy. Many elections are already decided by who spends the most. It is literally impossible to find a presidential election where the winner wasn’t the man who spent the most money on campaigning. I will quote what the Center for Responsive Politics said about the 2008 election, “In 93 percent of House of Representatives races and 94 percent of Senate races that had been decided by mid-day Nov. 5, the candidate who spent the most money ended up winning.” And we all know that Barack Obama won the presidency; it happens to be the case that he also spent more than his opponent, John McCain. This essentially equates money to power. Quoting Stephen Colbert, “This is one-hundred percent legal, and at least ten percent ethical.” 


===History of Colbert’s Super PAC===
On July 1st , 2011 the FEC approved Stephen Colbert’s request for a Super PAC —Americans for a Better Tomorrow, Tomorrow — which he proceeded to announce to the public along with a request for donations. Assisting him throughout the process was Trevor Potter, who is still Colbert’s lawyer. Who also assisted him in setting up a 501 (c)(4) under the name of Colbert Super PAC SHH Institute. The 501(c)(4) is a social welfare organization capable of spending money on political issues. And as Colbert pointed out, his 501(c)(4) may take any amount of money and not have to reveal the donor; it can then donate that money to his Super PAC where it will be shown as being donated from his 501(c)(4). This means that anyone could give any amount and nobody would ever be able to find out who it was. Colbert sums it up well when he asks Potter, “What is the difference between this and money laundering?”  
Americans for a Better Tomorrow, Tomorrow ran four ads while Colbert was initially in control of it. The first two were attempts to persuade Iowan residents to write in Rick Parry in lieu of Rick Perry. The third and fourth were related to the NBA lockout incident.

Colbert eventually decided that he wanted to attempt a presidential run, starting in South Carolina, and so he handed control of his Super PAC over to his close friend and business associate Jon Stewart.  Stewart, now in control of the Super PAC, was required by law not to coordinate with Stephen in any way. The penalty for doing so is incarceration and/or a fine, which is payable with Super PAC funds.
When Stewart took over the Super PAC the name became: The Definitely Not Coordinating with Stephen Colbert Super PAC. While he was running the Super PAC he continued to run ads, primarily in South Carolina. The first was an attack ad aimed at Mitt Romney, and equating him to a murderer. The second was to support Herman Cain, and basically said that a vote for Cain was a vote for Colbert; as Stephen could not get onto the ballot in South Carolina. The third was an ironic threat of using negative attack ads to end negative attack ads. The fourth is an attack ad for Colbert; it was meant to show that he was not coordinating with the Definitely Not Coordinating with Stephen Colbert Super PAC.

Colbert and Stewart soon performed skits in which they poked fun at how simple it was for candidates to “not coordinate in any way” with a Super PAC. Bringing up points such as how it was possible for Stewart to hire Colbert’s former Super PAC staff, but only as long as they didn’t know what Colbert was doing. Another relevant point that was no less subtle was Trevor Potter being the legal counsel for both the exploratory committee and the Super PAC. In addition, they found that it was possible for the Super PAC to tell the candidate exactly what it was doing so long as the candidate didn’t advise or coordinate with them; it is also possible for the candidate to speak to the public, and if those in charge of the Super PAC happen to “accidentally” hear his plans that’s too bad. All of this, of course, is legal.

After ending his presidential run due to not being able to get on the ballot Colbert proceeded to take back his Super PAC and continue on his way. And recently Colbert released what he is calling the “Colbert Super PAC Super Fun Pack.” Which is a product geared towards college students, but it can be enjoyed by those of all ages. It is meant to guide the user through the process of creating their own Political Action Committee. It contains: all the legal documents necessary for creating a Super PAC, an instructional booklet by Trevor Potter to guide users along the way, an Allen wrench, official Colbert Super PAC T-shirt, dorm room door sign, official Colbert Super PAC tube socks, a list of the four-hundred richest Americans, and an authentic treasure map. 

Now most of these items make sense, but a treasure map? It’s all part of Colbert’s newest promotion for his Super PAC. Whoever deciphers the treasure map first and claims the treasure gets a fantastic prize; a one-hundred year old silver turtle that also functions as a service bell. Oh, and Colbert will visit the campus of whoever wins. But that’s not important; what is important is that the turtle does not like peanut butter.


===Effects of Colbert’s Super PAC on The Public Sphere===
Stephen Colbert has done more than anyone else to show the general public just how Political Action Committees work, and what it is they actually do. Was it a satirical joke poking fun at the system, and meant to get ratings?  It probably was. Did Colbert send a real message to those who were listening? Yes, absolutely. Colbert’s call to action did not go unheeded; there are already examples of students taking his message to heart.  And as Colbert said, “&quot;We are divided between those who think with their heads and those who know with their heart.”

One such group is the Penn Staters for a Better Tomorrow, Tomorrow; who define themselves as, “The Penn State chapter of Stephen Colbert's Super PAC: Americans for a Better Tomorrow, Tomorrow.” Their mission is, “To make our voices heard in the form of Stephen Colbert's voice and draw attention to the bipartisan issue of Super PACs and money in politics.” Another such group is Texans for a Better Tomorrow, Tomorrow. It is a branch of Colbert’s Super PAC; started by Paul Benefiel, who is a sophomore in the University of Texas, with Colbert’s permission. It is only logical to assume that this trend will continue, and lead to more public involvement in issues like Super PACs and campaign finance; because the public, unlike Super PACs and candidates, can coordinate.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===''&lt;u&gt;Women's Media Center &amp; the Public Sphere&lt;/u&gt;''===

====Overview====
The media is well recognized as a powerful tool of public influence. From the billions of dollars spent each year for 30 second advertising blips during the Super Bowl to the millions shelled out for campaign commercials during election years, we can see quite clearly that marketing agencies value the media and its influence. The Women's Media Center (WMC) understands the power media has over not only public decision making, but perceptions of competency and worth. The organization is concerned about the effect that under-representation of women in the media and sexist media portrayals of females can have on public understanding of the worth of women in society. The WMC, rather than passively complain about the issues they see, uses the media and internet to spread its own message and to point out sexism in order to promote discussion and spark social and political change.

====History====
[[File:Gloria Steinem at news conference, Women's Action Alliance, January 12, 1972.jpg|thumb|Gloria Steinem - one of the founders of WMC]] WMC was founded in 2005 by the writers/activists Gloria Steinem, Jane Fonda, and Robin Morgan. The non-profit organization strives to be connected and engaged with the media at all levels. The organization monitors media outlets for sexism and will often launch their own media campaigns in response to try to mitigate some of the damage done to public perception. The WMC also does advocacy work, creates their own content for the gender equality movement, and holds leadership training for women and girls to encourage active media participation &lt;ref name=”WMCsite&quot;&gt;(2012). About us | women's media center. Retrieved from Women's Media Center website: http://www.womensmediacenter.com/pages/about-us&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Mission/Purpose====
The mission of WMC is to make women more visible and powerful in the media. Although women are 51% of the population, they are significantly underrepresented in media-centered jobs and in the media's construction of reality. What women are on film or in the news often does not correlate with what women are in real life. This issue of not only under-representing women but misrepresenting women ranges from the rampant use of Photoshop to manipulate the bodies of women to the portrayal of whiny, incompetent women appearing on sitcom x. The WMC targets the media in particular, because its operators recognize the significant role that media lays in shaping the public's understanding of the world. The value of women and their competency as human beings is something that can be shifted by the media, if it is left unchecked. The WMC finds great significance in who the media allows to talk, what shapes debates that make it on air, who writes for media outlets, and what issues are deemed worthy of reporting. Not everything can make the evening news, but WMC finds significance in the type of stories and issues which are consistently overlooked. By drawing attention to women's issues and sexist representations, WMC intends to make the issues of women a public concern, rather than allowing them to be swept under the rug or ignored by media and news outlets &lt;ref name=”WMCDoc”&gt;Pugh Yi, R. H., &amp; Dearfield, C. T. (2012, ). The status of women n the u.s. media.

=====Web Presence=====
A fair amount of WMC's activism and awareness efforts are now posted online on their website's blog. Andrew Sullivan (2008) describes blogging as the extreme sports of writing, an opportunity for writers to write as facts emerge in a more free-form, alive way &lt;ref name=&quot;blog&quot;&gt;Sullivan, A. (2008, November). Why I blog. Atlantic. Retrieved from http://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2008/11/why-i-blog/7060/ &lt;/ref&gt;. The writing on WMC does have some “shoot from the hip” qualities in that they often post quickly when events happen, such as when legislation which harms women is passed, in order to keep the site relevant. These rapid posts often link to other sources in order to support or substantiate claims or to provide access to the original, offensive material. Including hyperlinks to other sources is something that Sullivan (2008) claims has a significant influence on both the credibility and functionality of blogging &lt;ref name=&quot;blog&quot;/&gt;. Being credible and accurate are two things that make WMC's blogging an effective method of providing an alternative view to damaging mainstream media and political ads.

=====Two Way Dialogue=====
Aside from accuracy and providing a plethora of information for their viewers, what makes WMC successful at changing the public sphere for the better is their encouragement of reader participation. WMC goes out of their way to inspire dialogue, discussion, and get the perspective of their readership. The tagline for their website is “Amplifying women's voices, changing the conversation”, and that seems to be what they are doing. At the end of every blog post or article, there is an invitation for the reader to post their own comments or contribute on the topic. In the side bar there are links to sign petitions and report sexist media that the reader has observed. Through the WMC's “Name it. Change it” campaign which is also linked through their site, readers are encouraged to contribute their thoughts on reported incidents of sexist language used towards political candidates, but also are invited to contribute their own experiences. This is something that Sullivan  describes as customary when working in the blogosphere &lt;ref name=&quot;blog&quot;/&gt;. Conversation and communication with one's readership is how a blog maintains success.

In his book, The Assault on Reason, Al Gore (2007) refers to the public sphere as a marketplace of ideas &lt;ref name=&quot;gore&quot;&gt;Gore, A. (2007). The assault on reason. Retrieved from http://www.amazon.com/The-Assault-Reason-Al-Gore/dp/1594201226&lt;/ref&gt;. This is something the WMC recognizes, and is trying to use for the benefit of women everywhere. Gore (2007) suggests in his book that one of the problems with the current media set up is the way it lacks voter participation &lt;ref name=&quot;gore&quot;/&gt;. Our current democratic system, thanks to media, leaves much to be desired because the public is merely fed information. They are expected to accept this passively, and they often do. Television and the internet often only offer one way communication and do not inspire dialogue between readers, or between readers and the author. By encouraging women to get involved and report violations of gender equality rules in the media and in politics, WMC hopes to counteract some of the damage done by the current powers who control the public sphere.

Gore has also attempted to create a similar atmosphere for conversation and debate among the public viewership with his television channel “Current TV”. The website for the program invites users to comment after viewing videos, reading blog posts, or reading articles in a way that resembles WMC's website &lt;ref name=”currenttv”&gt;(2012, ). Current tv: Official site. website: http://current.com/ &lt;/ref&gt;. The way to get through to the public, based on Gore's efforts and those of the WMC, appears to be to use the media's tools against itself. You should play videos, but let people respond. You should write articles, but invite open discussion in response. Make people aware of things they wouldn't be able to see by looking at Fox News or other mainstream outlets. Open the eyes of the public, and they may just start using their voices.

====Conclusion====
WMC understands the power that media holds and the damage it can do if that power is left unchecked. By way of their blog, media campaigns, and encouraging dialogue about media representations and political  WMC is doing their best to use the media's tools to raise awareness of issues the media creates or will not acknowledge. By raising awareness and encouraging readers to find their own voices, sign petitions against legislation, and share their own thoughts and experiences WMC calls readers to action for the benefit of the public sphere. By giving the public an opportunity to raise their voices, and to actually have a say in the government or what the media is releasing is necessary to return the public sphere to a marketplace of ideas where everyone has a say.

We developed our orbital infrastructure in earlier steps to avoid the overhead of a large gravity well.  With that in place we can now go to and from the Lunar surface relatively easily.  The advantages of using the Moon are that it is nearby and has very large available resources.  So once the cost and difficulty of reaching it are reduced, we want to develop it as the next step.

{{TOC right}}

===Development Concept===

We assume that thorough prospecting has been done via orbiting spacecraft and surface rovers before a surface location is selected for mining and development.  The Moon has a different origin than the Near Earth Objects and has undergone melting and separation, longer exposure time to the space environment, and extensive mixing from impacts.  So its composition will be different than the NEO population.  Certain locations are special, such as craters that could contain water ice or places in constant sunlight, both in the polar area.

We deliver a combination of robotic, automated, and remote controlled machines to the Lunar surface ahead of large numbers of humans to start preparing the site.  Once mining, chemical processing, and parts production are operating, and you have a stockpile built up, then you can set up habitats and start having people there in larger numbers.  You continue to use the machines in parallel to humans, but now they can be controlled locally rather than remotely.  Taking this kind of approach will leverage the limited early human population.  There might be as many as 50 to 100 machines per person.  

We don't know for sure what the best starter kit is for Lunar development, but as an example we will assume an Iron-based economy.  Whatever items cannot be made locally at any given time are brought from elsewhere, with an increasing amount of local production as the facilities develop.  Metzger et. al. &lt;ref&gt;Preprint obtained from author, Apr 2012, to appear in [http://scitation.aip.org/aso/ Journal of Aerospace Engineering]&lt;/ref&gt; have modeled bootstrapping industry on the Moon, and found 12 tons might be sufficient for a starter kit. Under a fairly wide range of assumptions, that starter kit could grow to a much larger installation.

Below we discuss three items for Lunar development in a general way: a Starter Kit, an Expansion Kit, and bulk delivery of materials from the Moon to Lunar Orbit. These are only some of the industrial infrastructure for the Moon, and does not include other end items you might want to build there.

===Starter Kit===

The starter kit includes the equipment to mine and process Lunar iron, and fabricate and assemble items from it.  This gives an immediate return on hardware delivered to the Moon.

====Iron Mining====

Iron-bearing meteorites have impacted the Lunar surface since Since it's origin. From Apollo mission rock samples we know around 0.5% of the broken material making up the Lunar surface, called the '''regolith''', is bits of iron &lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/full/1980LPSC...11.1697M Morris, '''Origins and size distribution of metallic iron particles in the Lunar Regolith''', 1980]&lt;/ref&gt;.  It is generally small particles attached to other minerals by '''melt glass''' formed during the impacts. This is in addition to 5-15% iron oxides in minerals, but metallic iron does not have to be chemically processed, which avoids complexity in a starter kit. All you need to extract the iron-bearing fraction is a magnet. So you send a solar-powered rover around the nearby lunar surface, sifting out the smaller rock particles, running them past a magnet, and saving the part the magnet attracts. Then carry that back to a central location and dump the collected iron enriched dust. Repeat as many times as needed.

====Iron Extraction====

The next machine has a large concentrating dish to focus sunlight, and some manipulator arms to smooth the ground and make slight depressions and grooves for molds. Spread your iron-enriched ore over them and focus the sunlight to melt it. This is essentially sand casting except the metal is melted in place rather than separately in a furnace and then poured into a mold. Iron is relatively dense, and will sink to the bottom of the mold, while the glassy and mineral parts will rise as a slag. It will end up as basic shapes like plates and bars, with slag stuck to it on both sides from melting.  To prevent the mold from melting, you can optionally select minerals with high melting points as the mold material.  The raw stock will need to be sand-blasted to clean off the slag.  Fortunately there is no shortage of mineral grains on the Lunar Surface to do that with.  You now have an inventory of iron stock to use for all types of construction and parts making.

====Part Fabrication====

Machine tools such as lathes and milling machines are designed to make metal parts from metal stock.  Modern ones are computer controlled, and are themselves mostly made out of metal.  Thus an initial set of machines supplied with raw stock can mostly make more machines.  Given plans for a wider variety of machines, the initial set can increase in size in complexity.  For example a forge press or rolling mill is useful for making some types of metal parts, but those are likely too heavy to bring to the Moon to start with.  If you have a supply of raw materials, you can build them locally. 

====Assembly====

Standard assembly methods like bolts and screws can use robotic equipment.  For some items that need to be pressure-tight processes like welding are preferred.

'''Welding''' - One process that may work on the Moon, since it is in vacuum, is to use articulating mirrors to direct a beam of concentrated sunlight at various angles. That could heat and weld parts to each other to make larger structures like habitats.  If that does not work, then standard methods like vacuum plasma arc welding can be used.

===Expansion Kit===

====Power and Heating====

'''Electric Power''' - Solar power is abundant on the Lunar surface.  While initial power devices will be brought from elsewhere, we can rapidly expand it using our metal supply. Since mass is not an issue for a stationary facility, you can deliver closed cycle generators based on a thermal cycle, and use concentrated sunlight to power it.  The mirrors can be made locally of sheet metal with an evaporated coating of aluminum to make them more reflective.  Later generators can be made entirely locally, but in the early stages making just reflectors is fairly simple.  To supply power during the Lunar night, you can take a container filled with Lunar rock and a little gas for heat transfer, and surround that with more rock and insulation.  Vacuum serves as a good insulator by itself.  During the day you heat the container with concentrated sunlight, and at night run the thermal generator from the stored heat.

'''Process Heating''' - Many industrial processes need heating in some form.  For this you can also use concentrated sunlight without an electrical generator.

====Chemical Processing====

Unprocessed Lunar rock can be used for things like shielding, and with melting can be cast into blocks for roads or landing pads, but for other elements and compounds some chemical processing will be needed, such as for reducing oxide minerals to metals and oxygen.  Some elements are rare in Lunar rock and would have to be brought from elsewhere.

====Shelter====

Some items need protection from daily temperature variations, radiation, meteorites, and human-caused hazards such as lander rocket exhaust.  Most of that can be met with a structural metal shelter covered with sufficient Lunar regolith either in natural form or sintered into blocks.

===Bulk Delivery===

A catapult system was mentioned earlier in the '''Space Elevator''' section as a method to deliver bulk Lunar basalt.  This might be used to make high strength fibers for the Lunar Skyhook.  With the Skyhook in place a bulk delivery method might not be needed any longer, but we will leave that choice to later analysis. Other bulk materials produced on the Moon could be delivered this way, but as a starting point for design, the calculations below assume basalt is the cargo.

'''Delivery Orbit''' - Any object thrown into an orbit from the surface will intersect the launch point one orbit later.  Therefore your cargo needs a propulsion unit to raise the orbit, or you need something already in orbit to gather the cargo and change its orbit.  One device in orbit is probably less expensive than one on every cargo, so for discussion we will assume a small Skyhook with a catcher device hanging down some number of kilometers from the main core.  The offset allows the catapult to throw slightly slower than orbit velocity to match trajectory with the catcher.  Missed catches will land somewhere else on the Moon instead of coming back to the launch site and doing damage.  An equatorial location allows launching at about 108 minute intervals.

'''Tip Velocity''' = 1680 m/s - We don't yet know how much less than orbit velocity we will need, so for simplicity we assume the catapult reaches full orbit velocity.

'''Cargo Mass''' = 20 kg - Using basalt fiber as the main cable material, the Lunar Skyhook would have a nominal mass ratio of 20:1.  If we want to deliver 10 ton payloads to the Lunar surface, that requires 200 tons of fiber.  Assume we lost 1/3 of the basalt to processing, so the starter mass is 300 tons of raw basalt.  We allow 10% extra time for maintenance and missed catches, so the average interval is 2 hours per cargo.  If the catapult launches 20 kg at a time, that will be 43.5 tons per year if it only operates during the Lunar day, so about 6.9 years to launch enough cargo for the Skyhook construction. Larger versions would work proportionately faster. 

'''Containers''' - Bulk Lunar rock will not hold together when tossed at high velocity.  Two options are iron containers from Lunar rock, and Kevlar bags which are delivered and recycled.

:'''''Iron Containers:''''' 

These would be made from local metallic iron, which could be used in orbit as another building material.  Iron also gives the opportunity to fine tune the trajectory after the catapult throws the container using magnetic coils.  Together with the catcher mechanically positioning itself during the 30-40 minute ballistic trajectory of the cargo, that should ensure a high percentage of catches.  Lunar regolith has a density of about 3 g/cc, therefore a container holding 20 kg will have a volume of 7 liters.  A cone 13 cm in radius and 42 cm tall has about this volume.  The reason for a cone shape is so there can be a single attach point to the catapult.  We restrict the container mass to 10% of the cargo, or 2 kg.  The load will be constant across the cylinder height, so thickness will vary to maintain the stress, and the bottom will be domed for optimum strength, so we can model the structure as a 50 cm tall cylinder with an area of 4000 cm^2. With iron density of 7.8 g/cc, that gives a wall thickness of 0.64 mm. The cross section area is 5 cm^2, and with a working stress of 125 MPa, allowed load is 62 kN.

:'''''Kevlar Containers:'''''

Kevlar is a high strength material used on Earth. Bags made of Kevlar cloth with a capacity for 7 liters each would be delivered to the Lunar surface.  A typical cloth ( 5 oz/yd^2, 650 lb/in strength ) of similar dimensions to the iron container would have a breaking strength of 21 kN, and a working strength of half that. We assume a 6 layer bag (or thicker cloth) to get the required strength, with steel wire mesh woven in for magnetic steering. Estimated mass is 0.45 kg/bag, or 2.25% of the cargo mass.  Without an initial Skyhook the bags would need to be delivered with a lander, along with the rest of the catapult system.  For 300 tons delivered, that would require 15,000 bags with a mass of 6.75 tons.

'''Radius''' = 1000 m - A force of 62 kN on a 22 kg loaded container implies a centrifugal acceleration of 2820 m/^2 ( 288 g's ).  With a tip velocity of 1680 m/s, the radius is then 1.0 km, and it makes 0.267 rotations/s ( 16 rpm ). For accuracy and stability, the structure will need to be something like a truss frame, so it will support itself when not rotating. Added tension cables take up the acceleration load at full speed since cables can withstand higher stress.

'''Arm Mass''' = 92 kg - We used a working length of 126.4 g-km for carbon fiber in the Space Elevator section. We have an average of 144 g's over 1 km in the centrifuge, which produces a mass ratio of 3.1, and thus a cable mass of 2.1 times the loaded container.  The centrifuge should be balanced so it does not move during operation, so a total of 4.2 times the container mass of 22 kg or 92 kg.  The balance arm should be shorter, and release un-contained counterweight rock at the same time as the loaded container, but in the opposite direction, and aimed to hit a hill or travel far away ballistically.

'''Power''' = 11.5 kW - A 22 kg container moving at 1680 m/s has a kinetic energy of 31 MJ.  If the catapult is operated once per 108 minutes when operating, it needs to supply 4.8 kW on average plus losses. This is doubled due to the counterweight rock.  Additional energy is needed to spin up and down the rotating arm.  If we use two catapults, the energy of one can be transferred to the other rather than wasting it as braking friction. The rotating arm has a mass of 4.2 times the thrown mass, and motor-generator conversions can be about 90% efficient.  Thus we lose an additional 42% in energy in conversion losses.  So the total average power supply needs to be 11.5 kW, and each motor-generator needs to transfer 30 kW when operating ( 40 hp ).  An off the shelf 40 hp electric motor has a mass of 250 kg.  Given the Lunar night, we need to double the solar array peak power to 23 KW.  Modern arrays have a power level of about 100 W/kg, so the solar array mass would be 230 kg.

'''System Mass Estimate''' - Besides the bare rotating arm and power supply, there will need to be anchor structures, robots to collect the raw materials and put it in containers, the fine tuning magnets downrange, and communications and other support equipment.  The total for this is unknown until more design work is done.  For now, we will assume each of the two centrifuges will mass 1.25 tons total and total support equipment, including power, will be an additional 2.5 tons, for a total of 5 tons.  Since the system can launch 168 times per lunar day, that means it can deliver 3.36 tons.  Mass payback therefore takes 1.5 lunar days (1.5 Earth months).

{{Haskell minitoc|chapter=Haskell Basics|noexercises=1}}

This chapter will be somewhat different from the surrounding ones. Think of it as an interlude, where the main goal is not to introduce new features, but to present advice for studying (and using!) Haskell. Here, we will discuss the importance of acquiring a vocabulary of functions and how this book, along with other resources, can help you with that. First, however, we need to make a few quick points about function composition.

== Function composition ==

Function composition is a really simple concept. It just means applying one function to a value and then applying another function to the result. Consider these two very simple functions:

{{HaskellExample|1=Simple functions|2=&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
f x = x + 3
square x = x^2
&lt;/source&gt;}}

We can compose them in two different ways, depending on which one we apply first:

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; square (f 1)
16
Prelude&gt; square (f 2)
25
Prelude&gt; f (square 1)
4
Prelude&gt; f (square 2)
7
}}

The parentheses around the inner function are necessary; otherwise, the interpreter would think that you were trying to get the value of &lt;code&gt;square f&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;f square&lt;/code&gt;; and both have no meaning.

The composition of two functions results in a function in its own right. If applying f and then square, or vice-versa, to a number were a frequent, meaningful or otherwise important operation in a program, a natural next step would be defining:

{{HaskellExample|1=Composed functions|2=&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
squareOfF x = square (f x)

fOfSquare x = f (square x)
&lt;/source&gt;}}

There is a second, nifty way of writing composed functions. It uses &lt;code&gt;(.)&lt;/code&gt;, the function composition operator, and is as simple as putting a period between the two functions:

{{HaskellExample|1=Composing functions with &lt;code&gt;(.)&lt;/code&gt;|2=&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
squareOfF x = (square . f) x

fOfSquare x = (f . square) x
&lt;/source&gt;}}

Note that functions are still applied from right to left, so that &lt;code&gt;g(f(x)) == (g . f) x&lt;/code&gt; &lt;ref&gt;&lt;code&gt;(.)&lt;/code&gt; is modelled after the mathematical operator &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt;, which works in the same way: &lt;math&gt;(g \circ f)(x) = g(f(x))&lt;/math&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;.

== The need for a vocabulary ==

Function composition allows us to define complicated functions using simpler ones as building blocks. One of the key qualities of Haskell is how simple it is to write composed functions, no matter if the base functions are written by ourselves or by someone else,&lt;ref&gt;Such ease is not only due to the bits of syntax we mentioned above, but mainly due to features we will explain and discuss in depth later in the book - in particular, higher-order functions.&lt;/ref&gt; and the extent that helps us in writing simple, elegant and expressive code.

In order to use function composition, we first need to have functions to compose. While naturally the functions we write ourselves will always be available, every installation of GHC comes with a vast assortment of libraries (that is, packaged code), which provide functions for various common tasks. For that reason, it is vital for ''effective'' Haskell programming to develop some familiarity with the essential libraries. At the very least, you should know how to find useful functions in the libraries when you need them.

We can look at this issue from a different perspective. We have gone through a substantial portion of the Haskell syntax already; and, by the time we are done with the upcoming [[../Recursion|Recursion]] chapter, we could, in principle, write pretty much any list manipulation program we want. However, writing full programs at this point would be terribly inefficient, mainly because we would end up rewriting large parts of the standard libraries. It is far easier to have the libraries deal as much as possible with trivial well-known problems while we dedicate our brain cells to solving the problems ''we'' are truly interested in. Furthermore, the functionality provided by libraries helps us in developing our own algorithms.&lt;ref&gt;One simple example is provided by functions like &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt; and the folds, which we will cover in the chapters on list processing just ahead. Another would be the various monad libraries, which will be studied in depth later on.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prelude and the libraries ==

Here are a few basic facts about Haskell libraries:

First and foremost, there is ''Prelude'', which is the core library loaded by default in every Haskell program. Alongside with the basic types, it provides a set of ubiquitous and extremely useful functions. We will refer to Prelude and its functions all the time throughout these introductory chapters.

Beyond Prelude, there is a set of core libraries, which provide a much wider range of tools. Although they are provided by default with GHC, they are not loaded automatically like Prelude. Instead, they are made available as ''modules'', which must be ''imported'' into your program. Later on, we will explain the minutiae of how modules work. For now, just know that your source file needs lines near the top to import any necessary modules. For example, the function &lt;code&gt;permutations&lt;/code&gt; is in the module &lt;code&gt;Data.List&lt;/code&gt;, and, to import that, add the line &lt;code&gt;import Data.List&lt;/code&gt; to the top of your .hs file. Here's how a full source file looks:

{{HaskellExample|1=Importing a module in a source file|2=&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
import Data.List

testPermutations = permutations &quot;Prelude&quot;
&lt;/source&gt;}}

For quick GHCi tests, just enter &lt;code&gt;:m +Data.List&lt;/code&gt; at the command line to load that module.

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
Prelude&gt; :m +Data.List
Prelude Data.List&gt; :t permutations
permutations :: [a] -&gt; [[a]]
}}

== One exhibit ==

Before continuing, let us see one (slightly histrionic, we admit) example of what familiarity with a few basic functions from Prelude can bring us.&lt;ref&gt;The example here is inspired by the [http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Simple_unix_tools Simple Unix tools] demo in the HaskellWiki.&lt;/ref&gt; Suppose we need a function which takes a string composed of words separated by spaces and returns that string with the order of the words reversed, so that &lt;code&gt;&quot;Mary had a little lamb&quot;&lt;/code&gt; becomes &lt;code&gt;&quot;lamb little a had Mary&quot;&lt;/code&gt;. Now, we ''can'' solve that problem using exclusively what we have seen so far about Haskell, plus a few insights that can be acquired by studying the Recursion chapter. Here is what it might look like. Don't stare at it for too long!

{{HaskellExample|1=There be dragons|2=&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
monsterRevWords :: String -&gt; String
monsterRevWords input = rejoinUnreversed (divideReversed input)
    where
    divideReversed s = go1 [] s
        where
        go1 divided [] = divided
        go1 [] (c:cs)
            | testSpace c = go1 [] cs
            | otherwise   = go1 [[]] (c:cs)
        go1 (w:ws) [c]
            | testSpace c = (w:ws)
            | otherwise   = ((c:w):ws)
        go1 (w:ws) (c:c':cs)
            | testSpace c =
                if testSpace c'
                    then go1 (w:ws) (c':cs)
                    else go1 ([c']:w:ws) cs
            | otherwise =
                if testSpace c'
                    then go1 ((c:w):ws) (c':cs)
                    else go1 ((c:w):ws) (c':cs)
    testSpace c = c == ' '
    rejoinUnreversed [] = []
    rejoinUnreversed [w] = reverseList w
    rejoinUnreversed strings = go2 (' ' : reverseList newFirstWord) (otherWords)
        where
        (newFirstWord : otherWords) = reverseList strings
        go2 rejoined ([]:[]) = rejoined
        go2 rejoined ([]:(w':ws')) = go2 (rejoined) ((' ':w'):ws')
        go2 rejoined ((c:cs):ws) = go2 (c:rejoined) (cs:ws)
    reverseList [] = []
    reverseList w = go3 [] w
        where
        go3 rev [] = rev
        go3 rev (c:cs) = go3 (c:rev) cs
&lt;/source&gt;}}

There are too many problems with this ''thing''; so let us consider just three of them:
* If we claimed that &lt;code&gt;monsterRevWords&lt;/code&gt; does what is expected, you could either take our word for it, test it exhaustively on all sorts of possible inputs or attempt to understand it and get an awful headache (please don't). 
* Furthermore, if we write a function this ugly and have to fix a bug or slightly modify it later on,&lt;ref&gt;''Co-author's note'': &quot;Later on? I wrote that half an hour ago and I'm not totally sure about how it works already...&quot;&lt;/ref&gt; we are set for an awful time. 
* Finally, there is at least one easy to spot potential problem: if you have another glance at the definition, about halfway down there is a &lt;code&gt;testSpace&lt;/code&gt; helper function which checks if a character is a space or not. The test, however, only includes the common space character (that is, &lt;code&gt;' '&lt;/code&gt;), and not other whitespace characters (tabs, newlines, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;A reliable way of checking whether a character is whitespace is with the &lt;code&gt;isSpace&lt;/code&gt; function, which is in the module &lt;code&gt;Data.Char&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;.

Instead of the junk above, we can do much better by using the following Prelude functions:
* &lt;code&gt;words&lt;/code&gt;, which reliably breaks down a string in whitespace delimited words, returning a list of strings;
* &lt;code&gt;reverse&lt;/code&gt;, which reverses a list (incidentally, that is exactly what the &lt;code&gt;reverseList&lt;/code&gt; above does); and
* &lt;code&gt;unwords&lt;/code&gt;, which does the opposite of &lt;code&gt;words&lt;/code&gt;;
then function composition means our problem is instantly solved.

{{HaskellExample|1=&lt;code&gt;revWords&lt;/code&gt; done the Haskell way|2=&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
revWords :: String -&gt; String
revWords input = (unwords . reverse . words) input
&lt;/source&gt;}}

That's short, simple, readable and, since Prelude is reliable, bug-free.&lt;ref&gt;In case you are wondering, there are lots of other functions, either in Prelude or in &lt;code&gt;Data.List&lt;/code&gt; which, in one way or another, would help to make &lt;code&gt;monsterRevWords&lt;/code&gt; somewhat saner - just to name a few: &lt;code&gt;(++)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;concat&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;groupBy&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;intersperse&lt;/code&gt;. There is no need for them in this case, though, since nothing compares to the one-liner above.&lt;/ref&gt; So, any time some program you are writing begins to look like &lt;code&gt;monsterRevWords&lt;/code&gt;, look around and reach for your toolbox - the libraries.

== Acquiring vocabulary ==

After the stern warnings above, you might expect us to continue with diving deep into the standard libraries. That is not the route we will follow, however - at least not in the first part of the book. The Beginner's Track is meant to cover most of the Haskell language functionality in a readable and reasonably compact account, and a linear, systematic study of the libraries would in all likelihood have us sacrificing either one attribute or the other. 

In any case, the libraries will remain close at hand as we advance in the course (so there's no need for you to pause your reading just to study the libraries on your own). Here are a few suggestions on resources you can use to learn about them. 

=== With this book ===

* Once we enter Elementary Haskell, you will notice several of the exercises - mainly, among those about list processing - involve writing equivalent definitions for Prelude functions. For each of these exercises you do, one more function will be added to your repertoire.
* Every now and then we will introduce more library functions; maybe within an example, or just with a mention in passing. Whenever we do so, take a minute to test the function and do some experiments. Remember to extend that habitual curiosity about types we mentioned in [[../Type basics|Type basics]] to the functions themselves.
* While the first few chapters are quite tightly-knit, later parts of the book are more independent — especially the third track, Haskell in Practice. There, among other things, you can find chapters on the [[../Hierarchical libraries|Hierarchical libraries]]; and most of their content can be understood soon after having completed Elementary Haskell.
* As we reach the later parts of the Beginner's track, the concepts we will discuss (monads in particular) will naturally lead to exploration of important parts of the core libraries.

=== Other resources ===

* First and foremost, there is the documentation. While it is probably too dry to be really useful right now, it will prove valuable soon enough. You can read the [http://www.haskell.org/onlinereport/standard-prelude.html Prelude specification] on-line as well as the [http://www.haskell.org/ghc/docs/latest/html/libraries/index.html documentation of the libraries bundled with GHC], with nice navigation and source code just one click away.
* [http://www.haskell.org/hoogle Hoogle] is a great way to search through the documentation. It is a Haskell search engine which covers the core libraries. You can search for everything from function names to type definitions and more.
* Beyond the libraries included with GHC, there is a large ecosystem of libraries, made available through [https://hackage.haskell.org/ Hackage] and installable with a tool called [http://www.haskell.org/cabal/users-guide/ cabal]. The Hackage site you can find documentation for the  libraries available through it. We will not venture outside of the core libraries in the Beginner's Track; however, you will certainly be drawn to Hackage once you begin your own projects. A second Haskell search engine is [http://holumbus.fh-wedel.de/hayoo/hayoo.html Hayoo!]; it covers all of Hackage.
* When appropriate, we will give pointers to other useful learning resources, specially when we move towards intermediate and advanced topics.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Opening notes ==

Nearly two years have passed, but the reorganization of the Beginner's track is finally taking a definite shape :) This particular chapter should have been Apfelmus' baby, as it was the focal point of his restructuring plans. While I followed the spirit of such plans, I am pretty sure he, with his straight-to-the-point approach, would not like so much the fluffy, dialogic form I adopted... Anyway, the final remarks about the remainder of the book might sound a bit hollow, because there is so much left to do in the Practical Haskell trail. The cheat sheet appendix (of which you can see [[Haskell/Experimental Modules/Cheat sheet prototype 1|some experiments from 2010]]) would be an useful development in the general direction of improving that situation. Finally, I must yet again credit Apfelmus, this time for providing inspiration for the &quot;One exhibit&quot; section through [http://www.haskell.org/pipermail/wikibook/2010-May/000063.html this message in the Wikibook mailing list]. I almost considered using his example, but instead constructed a similar one with less pre-requisites and more insanity. Nevertheless, it is appropriate to quote his example here.

P.S.: Oh, another thing. Good exercises involving library functions could do wonders in terms of making the approach proposed here work better. If you have an interesting idea, please don't shy away from adding it to the relevant chapter of the book. Perhaps even right here in &quot;Building vocabulary&quot; there could be a few simple exercises requiring light documentation research. (Or maybe these could go to the hierarchical libraries chapters.)

== Apfelmus' alternative example (Exhibit #2) == 

There's nothing wrong with pattern matching. If anything, the problem is
this: With pattern matching and recursion, you can define any function
on lists. But then, it is also tempting to do exactly that and forgo the
vocabulary of functions offered in the Prelude, at the detriment of good
Haskell style.

For instance, consider the following task: you are given a file that has
a number on each line and you have to add them all up. A direct,
recursive, and utterly unintelligible solution would be to go character
by character and accumulate the sum

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
example :: String -&gt; Int
example s = go 0 &quot;&quot; s
    where
    go sum 0      []     = sum
    go sum number (c:cs)
        | c == '\n'      = go (sum + read number) 0 cs
        | isDigit c      = go sum (number ++ [c]) cs
&lt;/source&gt;

whereas the proper Haskell way to think about this task is

&lt;source lang = &quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
example = sum . map read . lines
&lt;/source&gt;

== &quot;There be dragons&quot; example ==

Yes, I know I'm not supposed to stare at it (and I don't intend to run it!) but I noticed there is a then/else pair which does exactly the same stuff, no matter what the value of the &lt;tt&gt;testspace c' &lt;/tt&gt; condition.

      <text xml:space="preserve">FORTRAN (FORmula TRANslator) was designed by scientists and is oriented toward manipulating formulas for scientific, mathematical, and engineering applications. FORTRAN is a very efficient language for these types of applications and is still used for high-performance computing tasks, such as forecasting the weather. A related programming language released by Sun Microsystems is Fortress. Which is similar to FORTRAN, Fortress is designed for high-performance computing and some believe it will eventually replace FORTRAN. One advantage of Fortress for today’s computers is that is takes advantage of multi-core processors and computers with multiple processors, automatically assigning pieces of a job to different cores or processors and trying to store data where it will be conveniently near the processor that will need it.

      <comment>/* Bail Pending Appeal */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
Where a person is in custody and the police decide not to release the accused under a police-authorized mechanism, the accused must be brought before a judge to determine if they should be released on bail.

Bail is a form of contract between the crown and the surety, where the crown releases the accused in exchange for the guarantee that the accused will abide by the terms of release.&lt;ref&gt;Ewaschuk, Criminal Practice and Procedure in Canada at 6:0010 where the terms are violated the surety will incur a debt with the crown.&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 11(e) of the ''Charter of Rights and Freedoms'' states that &quot;Any person charged with an offence has the right ... not to be denied reasonable bail without just cause&quot;. This means that the accused cannot be denied bail without reason and only where necessary.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Hall, [2002] SCJ No. 65 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2002/2002scc64/2002scc64.html 2002 SCC 64]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Villota, 2002 CanLII 49650 (ON S.C.) [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2002/2002canlii49650/2002canlii49650.html 2002 CanLII 49650]&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Morales, [1992] SCJ No. 98 Lamer CJC&lt;bR&gt;R. v. Hall 2000 OJ No 3188 (ONCA)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Under s. 515(1), a judge or justice must release a person held in custody on an undertaking without conditions unless the Crown can show cause to do otherwise.

Under [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec522 s. 522] only a superior court justice may consider the release of someone charged with an offender under s. 469 (murder, treason, etc).

{{reflist|2}}
==Onus==
The '''burden of proof''' is presumed to be on the crown on a balance of probabilities.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Julian (1972) 20 CRNS 227 (NSSC)&lt;/ref&gt; 

That is, unless the charge falls within the offences listed in [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec515 s.515 (6)]:
* offences committed while at large on other indictable matters (s.515(6)(a)(i))
* offences related to criminal organizations
* offences related to terrorism
* certain offences under the Security of Information Act
* offences relating to weapons trafficking or importing
* certain offences that were committed with a firearm
* offences involving firearms, prohibited weapons, or similar, while under a weapons prohibition order
* offences while not ordinarily resident in Canada; (s.515(6)(b))
* breach of conditions under s.145(2) to (5) while released on conditions of bail;
* offences punishable by life imprisonment under the CDSA

For the purpose of reverse onus, &quot;indictable offences&quot; includes hybrid offences, but not those in which there was a summary election.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Cooper (2007) 256 NSR (2d) 200 (NSSC)&lt;br&gt;
R v Hopkins [2004] BCJ No 2273 (BCSC)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Release==
The release powers of a Justice is given in sections 515(1) and (2) which state:
{{quotation|
'''Order of release'''&lt;br&gt;
515. (1) Subject to this section, where an accused who is charged with an offence other than an offence listed in section 469 is taken before a justice, the justice shall, unless a plea of guilty by the accused is accepted, order, in respect of that offence, that the accused be released on his giving an undertaking without conditions, unless the prosecutor, having been given a reasonable opportunity to do so, shows cause, in respect of that offence, why the detention of the accused in custody is justified or why an order under any other provision of this section should be made and where the justice makes an order under any other provision of this section, the order shall refer only to the particular offence for which the accused was taken before the justice.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Release on undertaking with conditions, etc.'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) Where the justice does not make an order under subsection (1), he shall, unless the prosecutor shows cause why the detention of the accused is justified, order that the accused be released
:(a) on his giving an undertaking with such conditions as the justice directs;
:(b) on his entering into a recognizance before the justice, without sureties, in such amount and with such conditions, if any, as the justice directs but without deposit of money or other valuable security;
:(c) on his entering into a recognizance before the justice with sureties in such amount and with such conditions, if any, as the justice directs but without deposit of money or other valuable security;
:(d) with the consent of the prosecutor, on his entering into a recognizance before the justice, without sureties, in such amount and with such conditions, if any, as the justice directs and on his depositing with the justice such sum of money or other valuable security as the justice directs; or
:(e) if the accused is not ordinarily resident in the province in which the accused is in custody or does not ordinarily reside within two hundred kilometres of the place in which he is in custody, on his entering into a recognizance before the justice with or without sureties in such amount and with such conditions, if any, as the justice directs, and on his depositing with the justice such sum of money or other valuable security as the justice directs.
&lt;P&gt;...&lt;P&gt;
}}

It is not always necessary to have the surety to appear in court.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Brooks, [2001] Ont.SCJ; R. v. J.V. (2002] Ont.SCJ&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
===Conditions===

{{quotation|
515&lt;p&gt;...&lt;P&gt;
'''Conditions authorized'''&lt;br&gt;
(4) The justice may direct as conditions under subsection (2) that the accused shall do any one or more of the following things as specified in the order:
:(a) report at times to be stated in the order to a peace officer or other person designated in the order;
:(b) remain within a territorial jurisdiction specified in the order;
:(c) notify the peace officer or other person designated under paragraph (a) of any change in his address or his employment or occupation;
:(d) abstain from communicating, directly or indirectly, with any victim, witness or other person identified in the order, or refrain from going to any place specified in the order, except in accordance with the conditions specified in the order that the justice considers necessary;
:(e) where the accused is the holder of a passport, deposit his passport as specified in the order;
:(e.1) comply with any other condition specified in the order that the justice considers necessary to ensure the safety and security of any victim of or witness to the offence; and
:(f) comply with such other reasonable conditions specified in the order as the justice considers desirable.
&lt;P&gt;...&lt;P&gt;
}}

Under s. 515(4.1), the court shall order a firearm prohibition on persons released for certain charges including:
* offences where violence is used, threatened, or attemtped
* criminal harassment
* intimidation of a justice system participant
* terrorism offences
* certain firearms offences
* certain CDSA offences
* certain offences under Security of Information Act


Where the judge refuses to do so he must give reasons.(s. 515(4.12))

The court may order that that there be no contact with named individuals, if a person is ordered detained (s.515(12)) or remanded (s.516(2)). Note that these orders are not stand-alone orders and only last up until the next court appearance. Thus, it must be renewed at each time the matter is in court.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Brown 2000 NSCA 147 - re 515(12) orders&lt;br&gt;
R v Kalashnikoff [2004] OJ No 113 (ONSC) - re 516(2) orders&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Variation and Review of Conditions===
The terms of a release order can be varied according to s. 523 (2) of the Code:
{{quotation|
523&lt;p&gt;...&lt;P&gt;
'''Order vacating previous order for release or detention'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) Notwithstanding subsections (1) and (1.1),
:(a) the court, judge or justice before which or whom an accused is being tried, at any time,
:(b) the justice, on completion of the preliminary inquiry in relation to an offence for which an accused is ordered to stand trial, other than an offence listed in section 469, or
:(c) with the consent of the prosecutor and the accused or, where the accused or the prosecutor applies to vacate an order that would otherwise apply pursuant to subsection (1.1), without such consent, at any time
::(i) where the accused is charged with an offence other than an offence listed in section 469, the justice by whom an order was made under this Part or any other justice,
::(ii) where the accused is charged with an offence listed in section 469, a judge of or a judge presiding in a superior court of criminal jurisdiction for the province, or
::(iii) the court, judge or justice before which or whom an accused is to be tried,
may, on cause being shown, vacate any order previously made under this Part for the interim release or detention of the accused and make any other order provided for in this Part for the detention or release of the accused until his trial is completed that the court, judge or justice considers to be warranted. 
|[http://canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec523 CCC]
}}

This section has been interpreted by most courts as meaning that a provincial court judge cannot vary the conditions on demand without the consent of the crown.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Mukpo [http://canlii.ca/t/fqhf1 2012 NSSC 107] 
R. v. Arkison [1996] B.C.J. No. 2549&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Hill [http://www.canlii.org/en/ns/nspc/doc/2005/2005nspc50/2005nspc50.html 2005 NSPC 50]&lt;/ref&gt;
c.f. R. v. Greener [http://www.canlii.org/en/ns/nspc/doc/2003/2003nspc58/2003nspc58.html 2003 NSPC 58]&lt;/ref&gt;
A Superior Court judge, however, will have jurisdiction to change conditions on application.

See also 520, 521, 522, 524, 525.

{{reflist|2}}

===Rendering Surety===
Where a surety no longer wishes to be responsible as a surety for the accused, he may render surety under s. 766(1) and 767 to have the accused rendered into custody thus relieving him of his obligations. 

===Change of Surety===
Where a surety no longer wishes to be responsible as a surety for the accused and there is a suitable substitution available, the surety will render surety under s. 766(1) and 767, but rather than render the accused into custody, the court may substitute the previous surety with a new one under s. 767.1. The new surety is in place once he has signed the recognizance.

==Grounds of Denying Bail==

Section 515(10) of the ''Criminal Code'' provides that bail may be denied in three situations:
{{quotation|
:(a)  where the detention is necessary to ensure [the accused’s] attendance in court in order to be dealt with according to law;
:(b)  where the detention is necessary for the protection or safety of the public . . . including any substantial likelihood that the accused will, if released from custody, commit a criminal offence or interfere with the administration of justice; and
:(c)  on any other just cause being shown and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, where the detention is necessary in order to maintain confidence in the administration of justice, having regard to all the circumstances, including the apparent strength of the prosecution’s case, the gravity of the nature of the offence, the circumstances surrounding its commission and the potential for a lengthy term of imprisonment.
|[http://canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec515 CCC]}}

{{reflist|2}}
===Primary Grounds===
Under s.515(10)(a) bail can be denied &quot;where the detention is necessary to ensure [the accused’s] attendance in court&quot;. This ground addresses whether the accused is a flight risk. 

This can include factors such as:
* family or community roots in the jurisdiction
* citizenship / ownership of a passport
* current residence
* plans for release
* employment
* possibility of lengthy sentence
* history of flight
* criminal record for breaching court orders
* availability of sureties

{{reflist|2}}
===Secondary Grounds===
Under s. 515(10)(b), bail can be denied &quot;for the protection or safety of the public ... including any substantial likelihood that the accused will...commit a criminal offence or interfere with the administration of justice&quot;.

'''Substantial likelihood''' means &quot;substantial risk&quot;. It is not the same as proof beyond a reasonable doubt or probability. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Link [http://canlii.org/en/ab/abca/doc/1990/1990abca55/1990abca55.html 1990 ABCA 55]; c.f. Walsh 2000 PEISC&lt;/ref&gt;

Denial of bail can include factors such as:
* seriousness of the offence
* surrounding circumstances of the offence and offender
* accused's potential culpability
* degree of planning and deliberation
* involvement of firearms
* mental health issues / addiction issues
* likelihood of lengthy sentence 
* strength of the Crown's case
* risk or harm to victim
* accused's criminal record
* previous outstanding release conditions
* history of abiding by court orders and conditions
{{reflist|2}}

=== Tertiary Grounds===
Under 515(10)(c), bail can be revoked &quot;in order to maintain confidence in the administration of justice, having regard to all the circumstances, including the apparent strength of the prosecution’s case, the gravity of the nature of the offence, the circumstances surrounding its commission and the potential for a lengthy term of imprisonment.&quot;

In cases where the crime is heinous and the evidence overwhelming bail must be denied to preserve the public's confidence in the administration of justice.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Hall [2002] SCJ No 65 at para. 26&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{reflist|2}}

==Hearing==

===Adjourning Hearing===
On application of the prosecutor, a judge has the discretion to delay a bail hearing by up to three days without the consent of the accused. (s. 516)

When requested a judge &quot;is obliged to grant a reasonable opportunity&quot; for the crown to show cause.&lt;ref&gt;
R v CGF [2003] NSJ No 456 (NSCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
===Evidence===
A bail hearing is an informal process where the strict rules of evidence do not apply.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Kevork et a1 (1984), 12 C.C.C. (3d) 339 (Ont. H.C.J.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The exemptions to the rules of evidence are set out in s. 518:
{{quotation|
'''Inquiries to be made by justice and evidence'''&lt;br&gt;
518. (1) In any proceedings under section 515,
:(a) the justice may, subject to paragraph (b), make such inquiries, on oath or otherwise, of and concerning the accused as he considers desirable;
:(b) the accused shall not be examined by the justice or any other person except counsel for the accused respecting the offence with which the accused is charged, and no inquiry shall be made of the accused respecting that offence by way of cross-examination unless the accused has testified respecting the offence;
:(c) the prosecutor may, in addition to any other relevant evidence, lead evidence
::(i) to prove that the accused has previously been convicted of a criminal offence,
::(ii) to prove that the accused has been charged with and is awaiting trial for another criminal offence,
::(iii) to prove that the accused has previously committed an offence under section 145, or
::(iv) to show the circumstances of the alleged offence, particularly as they relate to the probability of conviction of the accused;
:(d) the justice may take into consideration any relevant matters agreed on by the prosecutor and the accused or his counsel;
:(d.1) the justice may receive evidence obtained as a result of an interception of a private communication under and within the meaning of Part VI, in writing, orally or in the form of a recording and, for the purposes of this section, subsection 189(5) does not apply to that evidence;
:(d.2) the justice shall take into consideration any evidence submitted regarding the need to ensure the safety or security of any victim of or witness to an offence; and
:(e) the justice may receive and base his decision on evidence considered credible or trustworthy by him in the circumstances of each case.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec518 CCC]
}}

The court is permitted to consider hearsay evidence.&lt;ref&gt;
Re Powers and the Queen (1972), 9 C.C.C. 533 (Ont. H-CJ.)&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Zeolkowsh (1989), 50 C.C.C. (3d) 566 (S.C.C.) at p. 569&lt;/ref&gt; This includes admissions and confessions by the accused, and does not require a voir dire for voluntariness.&lt;ref&gt;Bouffard v. R. (1979) 16 C.R (3d) 373 (Que. S.C.)&lt;/ref&gt;

A prior criminal record is admissible as well as any acquittals on similar charges.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Lanen (1976) 34 CRNS 399 (BCSC)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Breach of Release==
Where the accused is released on bail, and he fails to attend the judge may order a warrant under s.512(2) or 597.

Section 512(2) states:
{{quotation|
'''Certain actions not to preclude issue of warrant'''&lt;br&gt;
512. (1) A justice may, where the justice has reasonable and probable grounds to believe that it is necessary in the public interest to issue a summons or a warrant for the arrest of the accused, issue a summons or warrant, notwithstanding that
:(a) an appearance notice or a promise to appear or a recognizance entered into before an officer in charge or another peace officer has been confirmed or cancelled under subsection 508(1);
:(b) a summons has previously been issued under subsection 507(4); or
:(c) the accused has been released unconditionally or with the intention of compelling his appearance by way of summons.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Warrant in default of appearance'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) Where
:(a) service of a summons is proved and the accused fails to attend court in accordance with the summons,
:(b) an appearance notice or a promise to appear or a recognizance entered into before an officer in charge or another peace officer has been confirmed under subsection 508(1) and the accused fails to attend court in accordance therewith in order to be dealt with according to law, or
:(c) it appears that a summons cannot be served because the accused is evading service,
&lt;P&gt;
a justice may issue a warrant for the arrest of the accused.
&lt;P&gt;
R.S., 1985, c. C-46, s. 512; R.S., 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 82; 1997, c. 18, s. 58.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec512 CCC]
}}

{{quotation|
'''Bench warrant'''&lt;Br&gt;
597. (1) Where an indictment has been preferred against a person who is at large, and that person does not appear or remain in attendance for his trial, the court before which the accused should have appeared or remained in attendance may issue a warrant in Form 7 for his arrest.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Execution'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) A warrant issued under subsection (1) may be executed anywhere in Canada.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Interim release'''&lt;Br&gt;
(3) Where an accused is arrested under a warrant issued under subsection (1), a judge of the court that issued the warrant may order that the accused be released on his giving an undertaking that he will do any one or more of the following things as specified in the order, namely,
:(a) report at times to be stated in the order to a peace officer or other person designated in the order;
:(b) remain within a territorial jurisdiction specified in the order;
:(c) notify the peace officer or other person designated under paragraph (a) of any change in his address or his employment or occupation;
:(d) abstain from communicating with any witness or other person expressly named in the order except in accordance with such conditions specified in the order as the judge deems necessary;
:(e) where the accused is the holder of a passport, deposit his passport as specified in the order; and
:(f) comply with such other reasonable conditions specified in the order as the judge considers desirable.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Discretion to postpone execution'''&lt;br&gt;
(4) A judge who issues a warrant may specify in the warrant the period before which the warrant shall not be executed, to allow the accused to appear voluntarily before a judge having jurisdiction in the territorial division in which the warrant was issued.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Deemed execution of warrant'''&lt;Br&gt;
(5) Where the accused appears voluntarily for the offence in respect of which the accused is charged, the warrant is deemed to be executed.

}}

{{reflist|2}}
===Forfeiture of Bail===

Where an accused released on a recognizance is in breach of the order, the crown may seek forfeiture under s. 770 of the cash or property pledged as part of the recognizance.

Before the court can order forfeiture the Crown must establish that the failure to comply with the underlying recognizance must have delayed or defeated the ends of justice. (s. 770(1)(c))

Mere technical failures to attend is not sufficient to warrant the forfeiture.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v Taylor [2002] O.J. No. 4246 (Sup.Ct.J.)&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Nanooch, [http://canlii.ca/t/2185c 2008 ABQB 644] court should make explicit inquiry into reasons for being late and makign a finding that the lateness meant justice was delayed or defeated&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
==Revocation of Bail==
Where the accused in not in custody on pending charges, either by virtue of an appearance notice, promise to appear, summons, undertaking or recognizance, the court may order the accused to be taken into custody after trial.(s. 523)

Section 523 states:
{{quotation|
'''Period for which appearance notice, etc., continues in force'''&lt;br&gt;
523. (1) Where an accused, in respect of an offence with which he is charged, has not been taken into custody or has been released from custody under or by virtue of any provision of this Part, the appearance notice, promise to appear, summons, undertaking or recognizance issued to, given or entered into by the accused continues in force, subject to its terms, and applies in respect of any new information charging the same offence or an included offence that was received after the appearance notice, promise to appear, summons, undertaking or recognizance was issued, given or entered into,
:(a) where the accused was released from custody pursuant to an order of a judge made under subsection 522(3), until his trial is completed; or
:(b) in any other case,
::(i) until his trial is completed, and
::(ii) where the accused is, at his trial, determined to be guilty of the offence, until a sentence within the meaning of section 673 is imposed on the accused unless, at the time the accused is determined to be guilty, the court, judge or justice orders that the accused be taken into custody pending such sentence.
&lt;P&gt;...&lt;P&gt;
'''Order vacating previous order for release or detention'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) Notwithstanding subsections (1) and (1.1),
:(a) the court, judge or justice before which or whom an accused is being tried, at any time,
:(b) the justice, on completion of the preliminary inquiry in relation to an offence for which an accused is ordered to stand trial, other than an offence listed in section 469, or
:(c) with the consent of the prosecutor and the accused or, where the accused or the prosecutor applies to vacate an order that would otherwise apply pursuant to subsection (1.1), without such consent, at any time
::(i) where the accused is charged with an offence other than an offence listed in section 469, the justice by whom an order was made under this Part or any other justice,
::(ii) where the accused is charged with an offence listed in section 469, a judge of or a judge presiding in a superior court of criminal jurisdiction for the province, or
::(iii) the court, judge or justice before which or whom an accused is to be tried, may, on cause being shown, vacate any order previously made under this Part for the interim release or detention of the accused and make any other order provided for in this Part for the detention or release of the accused until his trial is completed that the court, judge or justice considers to be warranted.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Provisions applicable to proceedings under subsection (2)'''&lt;br&gt;
:(3) The provisions of sections 517, 518 and 519 apply, with such modifications as the circumstances require, in respect of any proceedings under subsection (2), except that subsection 518(2) does not apply in respect of an accused who is charged with an offence listed in section 469.

An application may be made to revoke bail under s. 523 after it has been granted pursuant to ss. 515 or 522 of the Code or after a bail review under s. 520 of the Code.

The loss of the presumption of innocence, by itself, is not reason to revoke bail.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Green, [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2006/2006canlii27306/2006canlii27306.html 2006 CanLII 27306] (ON S.C.) at para. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bail Pending Appeal==

{{quotation|
679. (3) In the case of an appeal referred to in paragraph (1)(a) or (c), the judge of the court of appeal may order that the appellant be released pending the determination of his appeal if the appellant establishes that
:(a) the appeal or application for leave to appeal is not frivolous;
:(b) he will surrender himself into custody in accordance with the terms of the order; and
:(c) his detention is not necessary in the public interest.

The third factor takes into account the appellant’s risk to reoffend, the strength of his case, the nature and circumstances of the offence, the circumstances of the appellant himself, delay and its impact, post-charge conduct, the possible terms of release, and the impact of release on the confidence of the public in the administration of justice.

Courts have considered bail in the following offences:
* Sexual assault &lt;ref&gt;R v Tcho, [http://canlii.ca/t/fnfqp 2011 SKCA 113] (released)&lt;/ref&gt;
*Drug trafficking

==Superior Court Bail Review==
The accused (s. 520) or the Crown (s. 521) may apply to have a superior court judge review an order of release or remand under s. 515 or 523. 

Once an application for review under s. 520 or 521 has been successful, the original bail instrument is terminated and a new order is in place. This new order cannot subsequently be reviewed under s. 520 or 521.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Smith, 2003 SKCA 8 citing R. v. Lahooti (1978), 38 C.C.C. (2d) 481 (Ont.H.C.J.) and R. v. Saracino (1989), 47 C.C.C. (3d) 185 (Ont.H.C.J.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court of Appeal Bail Review==

An accused can seek a review of the court's decision on bail under s. 680
{{quotation|
'''Review by court of appeal'''&lt;br&gt;
680. (1) A decision made by a judge under section 522 or subsection 524(4) or (5) or a decision made by a judge of the court of appeal under section 261 or 679 may, on the direction of the chief justice or acting chief justice of the court of appeal, be reviewed by that court and that court may, if it does not confirm the decision,
:(a) vary the decision; or
:(b) substitute such other decision as, in its opinion, should have been made.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Single judge acting'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) On consent of the parties, the powers of the court of appeal under subsection (1) may be exercised by a judge of that court.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Enforcement of decision'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) A decision as varied or substituted under this section shall have effect and may be enforced in all respects as though it were the decision originally made.
&lt;P&gt;
R.S., 1985, c. C-46, s. 680; R.S., 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 142; 1994, c. 44, s. 68.

|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec680 CCC]
}}

The test for leave to review bail requires that:&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Uppal, [http://canlii.ca/t/4q5p 2003 BCCA 571] (CanLII) at para. 17&lt;/ref&gt;
# there is a reasonable prospect of success on review; or
# the court, applying the law, could possibly conclude that the application for release should have been allowed (if bail was denied). 

This is a low standard.&lt;ref&gt;Uppal at para. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">=== Information Systems ===
	Information system is a collection of elements and procedures that interact to generate information needed by users in an organization. Information systems are usually computerized used to support a variety of activities. Businesses use information systems which are created and modified based on changes in environment or new feature the company may have to offer. Enterprise architecture is a comprehensive framework used to describe and manage an organizations business functions and systems. Allows managers to better organize and maximize the use of information technology, can be a complicated and time consuming process but can be a valuable tool once stable. Business intelligence is the process of gathering, storing, accessing, and analyzing data about a company in order to make better decisions. BI can help businesses manage inventory and increase sales at the same time. Data mart and data warehouse help BI collect data for companies. Data mart is a collection of data related to a particular subject or department. Data warehouse is a collection of data about the company and customers. Data mining is the use of intelligent software to analyze patterns and relationships between data, which can help improve sales by following customer sales and suggesting products they would be likely to purchase.
	
	Information systems can be used by many or as little as one individual. Enterprise system is a system used by the entire business. Inter-enterprise system is a system that links multiple enterprises, such as a business and its suppliers. Information systems are usually used by managers; they can be classified as a pyramid with the executive at the top with more authority, then middle manager in the center, then the operational manager greater in number and towards the bottom of the pyramid.

=== Types of Information Systems ===
•	Office and user productivity systems: increases productivity and facilitates communication in the office

•	Transaction processing systems: processes and records data created by a business such as payroll or accounts receivable

•	Decision making support systems: help individuals make decisions

•	Integrated enterprise systems: separate systems that work together with other systems

•	Design and manufacturing systems: improves productivity at the product design and manufacturing stage

•	Artificial intelligence systems: computers performing intelligently like a human, independently


== Decision Support System ==
Decision support systems assist decision makers gather a variety of information to be assessed for a solution needed. The variety of information that can be used include: inventory required to fill store, salaries to pay employees and stay within budget, or revenue that a company makes on different products.
{{BookCat}}


==Information System Users==

Information systems can be created specifically for one type of user or for a particular sector in an establishment and it can also be designed to be used by all members in an organization.  Information systems that are made to be operated by an entire institution are called, enterprise systems.  Some information systems are made to accommodate all existing levels in an organization, while other information systems are built to assist only managers by providing them with the information they need to make a decision.   There are four main categories when referring to internal organization information system users and it's called the management pyramid.  These users are categorized by the job they operate and the kind of decisions they make.  The management pyramid consists of, executive managers, middle managers, operational managers, and non-management workers.

Usages for logs:
* Allowing programs to indicate emergency situations to external programs which can then investigate and take action.
* Provide timestamped markers for performance analysis.
* Provide information about what is being processed for later forensic analysis.
* Timestamps for events.



Logging in programming is one of the areas where the code may literally have been written years before the generated information is needed, and where you have very little or no idea what you might be needing to know at that time.  If you could foresee it, you could have coded around it back then.   

There is a need for a wiki-based reference helping programmers to create better logs.  The focus will not be a comprehensive overview, but a &quot;Best practice&quot;-approach using slf4j and logback/java.util.logging.Logger depending on scenario.

===Contents===
==Quick start for the impatient==

# Download and unpack the latest release of SLF4J from http://slf4j.org/download.html
# Put slf4j-api-X.Y.Z.jar and slf4j-simple-X.Y.Z.jar on your classpath.
# Use &lt;code&gt;Logger log = LoggerFactory.getLogger(this.getClass())&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;log.info(&quot;At {} with {}&quot;, a, b);&lt;/code&gt; to log information.

((SAMPLE CODE))



==Logging: Why, How, What, Where?==


## SAMPLE Java program with print statements.

## Output from said java program.

One of the first things new Java programmers learn is to use &lt;code&gt;System.out.println(&quot;....&quot;)&lt;/code&gt; to see &quot;inside&quot; their program, and frequently this results in a lot of information being printed every time the program runs.  Some information is very important and require human action, and some are just trivial indications that a library is working, and some include a stack trace.  For advanced programs with multiple threads active, the individual messages may even be mixed together so that &quot;Message 1&quot; and &quot;Message 2&quot; turn into &quot;MMessagessag 1e 2&quot;.    Also you may need the log in a file and not System.out (which for some platforms are not even available).

## SAMPLE Java program as before but with slf4j statements.

## Resulting logfiles.


* [[/Why log in the first place?/]]


* [[/How to log?/]]




* [[/What to log?/]]



* [[/Where to put all the logged information?/]]

==Generating log entries==
* [[/What is SLF4J and why should it be used?/]]
* [[/Examples of typical log statements/]]
* [[/Using ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG, TRACE levels/]]
* [[/Improving stack traces/]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
A Peace Bond is a form of recognizance that a judge can order at the request of either Crown or Defence, or on the Court's own motion. The Peace Bond lasts for up to 12 months and may include conditions such as requiring the accused to &quot;keeping the peace&quot;; to refrain from contact or communication with a named party; not to possess any weapons or ammunition. 

The Peace Bond can be ordered at any point before or during the trial.

==Common Law==
The peace bond traces back to the English common law as a form of &quot;preventative justice&quot;. It &quot;empowers justices to place a person under bond where it appears the person may be a threat to peace, regardless of the fact the person has committed no offence.&quot;
&lt;ref&gt; Stevenson v. Saskatchewan (Minister of Justice), 61 Sask.R.91 (Q.B.) &lt;br&gt;
see also Mackenzie v. Martin, 1954 CanLII 10 (SCC), [1954] S.C.R. 361 at p.370&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

The common law peace bond still exists. It is not a criminal punishment that is extinguished by s. 9 of the Criminal Code and is affirmed by section 8(2)&lt;ref&gt;
8.(2) The criminal law of England that was in force in a province immediately before April 1, 1955 continues in force in the province except as altered, varied, modified or affected by this Act or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada.

Sureties to Keep the Peace
&lt;p&gt;
Where injury or damage feared&lt;br&gt;
810. (1) An information may be laid before a justice by or on behalf of any person who fears on reasonable grounds that another person will cause personal injury to him or her or to his or her spouse or common-law partner or child or will damage his or her property.
&lt;p&gt;
Duty of justice&lt;br&gt;
(2) A justice who receives an information under subsection (1) shall cause the parties to appear before him or before a summary conviction court having jurisdiction in the same territorial division.
&lt;p&gt;
Adjudication&lt;br&gt;
(3) The justice or the summary conviction court before which the parties appear may, if satisfied by the evidence adduced that the person on whose behalf the information was laid has reasonable grounds for his or her fears,

(a) order that the defendant enter into a recognizance, with or without sureties, to keep the peace and be of good behaviour for any period that does not exceed twelve months, and comply with such other reasonable conditions prescribed in the recognizance, including the conditions set out in subsections (3.1) and (3.2), as the court considers desirable for securing the good conduct of the defendant; or

(b) commit the defendant to prison for a term not exceeding twelve months if he or she fails or refuses to enter into the recognizance.
&lt;p&gt;
Conditions&lt;br&gt;
(3.1) Before making an order under subsection (3), the justice or the summary conviction court shall consider whether it is desirable, in the interests of the safety of the defendant or of any other person, to include as a condition of the recognizance that the defendant be prohibited from possessing any firearm, cross-bow, prohibited weapon, restricted weapon, prohibited device, ammunition, prohibited ammunition or explosive substance, or all such things, for any period specified in the recognizance and, where the justice or summary conviction court decides that it is so desirable, the justice or summary conviction court shall add such a condition to the recognizance.
&lt;p&gt;
Surrender, etc.&lt;br&gt;
(3.11) Where the justice or summary conviction court adds a condition described in subsection (3.1) to a recognizance order, the justice or summary conviction court shall specify in the order the manner and method by which

(a) the things referred to in that subsection that are in the possession of the accused shall be surrendered, disposed of, detained, stored or dealt with; and

(b) the authorizations, licences and registration certificates held by the person shall be surrendered.
&lt;p&gt;
Reasons&lt;br&gt;
(3.12) Where the justice or summary conviction court does not add a condition described in subsection (3.1) to a recognizance order, the justice or summary conviction court shall include in the record a statement of the reasons for not adding the condition.
&lt;p&gt;
Idem&lt;br&gt;
(3.2) Before making an order under subsection (3), the justice or the summary conviction court shall consider whether it is desirable, in the interests of the safety of the informant, of the person on whose behalf the information was laid or of that person’s spouse or common-law partner or child, as the case may be, to add either or both of the following conditions to the recognizance, namely, a condition
:(a) prohibiting the defendant from being at, or within a distance specified in the recognizance from, a place specified in the recognizance where the person on whose behalf the information was laid or that person’s spouse or common-law partner or child, as the case may be, is regularly found; and
:(b) prohibiting the defendant from communicating, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, with the person on whose behalf the information was laid or that person’s spouse or common-law partner or child, as the case may be.
&lt;p&gt;
Forms&lt;br&gt;
(4) A recognizance and committal to prison in default of recognizance under subsection (3) may be in Forms 32 and 23, respectively.
&lt;p&gt;
Modification of recognizance&lt;br&gt;
(4.1) The justice or the summary conviction court may, on application of the informant or the defendant, vary the conditions fixed in the recognizance.
&lt;p&gt;
Procedure&lt;br&gt;
(5) The provisions of this Part apply, with such modifications as the circumstances require, to proceedings under this section.
}}

A provinical court judge has a common law power to impose a 810 peace bond upon an accused post-trial. However, notice must be given to allow for an opportunity to either call evidence or make submissions. Further, there must be a factual basis to conclude that there is a future risk of a breach of the peace.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Wells, 2012 ABQB 77 &lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* Discretion of the Judge */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
An adjournment is re-scheduling of a court proceeding, be it arraignment, plea, trial, sentencing, or otherwise. 

The granting of an adjournments is at the discretion of the judge (e.g. see s.571 and 645; 669.1(2)), but in practice is a frequent occurrence.

===Types of Adjournments===
Any judge dealing with an indictable matter without a jury:
{{quotation|
'''Adjournment of non-jury trial'''&lt;br&gt;
571. A judge or provincial court judge acting under this Part [Pt. XIX — indictable offences — trial without jury] may from time to time adjourn a trial until it is finally terminated.
&lt;P&gt;
R.S.C. 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 203
}}

Adjournments of trials on indictable matters:
{{quotation|
'''Allowing time'''&lt;br&gt;
606. (3) An accused is not entitled as of right to have his trial postponed but the court may, if it considers that the accused should be allowed further time to plead, move to quash, or prepare for his defence or for any other reason, adjourn the trial to a later time in the session or sittings of the court, or to the next of any subsequent session or sittings of the court, on such terms as the court considers proper.
}}

Any judge dealing with an indictable matter with a jury:
{{quotation|
'''Trial continuous'''&lt;br&gt;
645. (1) The trial of an accused shall proceed continuously subject to adjournment by the court.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Adjournment'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) The judge may adjourn the trial from time to time in the same sittings.
}}

A Preliminary Inquiry Judge may adjourn under s.537:
{{quotation|
537. (1) A justice acting under this Part may
:(a) adjourn an inquiry from time to time and change the place of hearing, where it appears to be desirable to do so by reason of the absence of a witness, the inability of a witness who is ill to attend at the place where the justice usually sits or for any other sufficient reason;
}}

Any judge dealing with a summary matter:
{{quotation|
803. (1) The summary conviction court may, in its discretion, before or during the trial, adjourn the trial to a time and place to be appointed and stated in the presence of the parties or their counsel or agents.
}}

General adjournments:
{{quotation|
'''Adjournment'''&lt;br&gt;
669.1 (2) Any court, judge or provincial court judge having jurisdiction to try an accused or a defendant, or any clerk or other proper officer of the court, or in the case of an offence punishable on summary conviction, any justice, may, at any time before or after the plea of the accused or defendant is taken, adjourn the proceedings.
&lt;P&gt;
R.S.C. 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 137
}}

Where the accused has been misled or prejudiced by any issues found in the indictment or information, the accused may adjourn a matter. (see s.485, 547, and 601)

Where a party wishes to call an expert witness and did not give notice, the available remedy is an adjournment under 657.3 (5).

===Discretion of the Judge===
It is a discretionary decision on whether to grant an adjournment requested. The decision is reviewable on the circumstances of the particular case, including the ability and quality of the accused.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. White  [http://canlii.org/en/ab/abca/doc/2010/2010abca66/2010abca66.html 2010 ABCA 66]&lt;/ref&gt;
This exercise of discretion is afforded considerable deference.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Toor, 2001 ABCA 88 (CanLII) at para. 15 (&quot;[t]he granting of adjournments and the exercise of judicial discretion are generally afforded a considerable degree of deference, and the law is well established in the area.&quot;) &lt;/ref&gt;

A judge is typically not inclined to adjourn trial matters. The cost of resources to bring a matter to trial and the desire to bring a matter to a conclusion speaks to the judge's interest in having a matter proceed. This is balanced against the accused's right to a fair trial and right to be tried within a reasonable time.

Where the judge has grounds to believe that the request for an adjournment is a sham, the judge may refuse the adjournment.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Amos, [http://canlii.ca/t/frdtr 2012 ONCA 334]&lt;/ref&gt;

See a review of principles at R. v. White [http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abca/doc/2010/2010abca66/2010abca66.html#par17 2010 ABCA 66] at para 17.

{{reflist|2}}

===Lack of counsel===
The judge has discretion to adjourn a trial on request of the accused for reason that they are not represented by counsel. The judge must consider the accused constitutional right to a fair trial. However, the accused also has the right to represent himself. Further, the right to be represented by counsel must be exercised &quot;diligently and honestly&quot;, thus they may be refused if they have not acted honestly and diligently. The accused cannot be refused where the absence of counsel is not their fault.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Halnuck,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/ns/nsca/doc/1996/1996canlii5275/1996canlii5275.html 1996 CanLII 5275 (NS C.A.)]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Beals, (1993) 126 N.S.R. (2d) 130 (C.A.)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Marzocchi, [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2006/2006canlii13096/2006canlii13096.html 2006 CanLII 13096 (ON C.A.) ]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Bitternose,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/sk/skca/doc/2009/2009skca54/2009skca54.html 2009 SKCA 54]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Bissonette  [http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abca/doc/2003/2003abca93/2003abca93.html 2003 ABCA 93]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

However, an accused who chooses not to have counsel cannot appeal a conviction on the grounds of not having effective representation.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Harris, [http://canlii.ca/t/25cdz#par27 2009 SKCA 96 at 27]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Lack of Preparation===
It is usually expected that an adjournment will be granted where there is late arriving evidence.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Johnston, 1991 OntCA&lt;/ref&gt; 

Where a lawyer fails to properly prepare an adjournment is not required as there is a breach of their duty to the court and client.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. E.R.S. 1994 Atla.C.A.
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Missing witnesses===
In order to adjourn a trial matter on the grounds of missing witnesses the applicant must establish:&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. LeBlanc  [http://www.canlii.org/en/ns/nsca/doc/2005/2005nsca37/2005nsca37.html 2005 NSCA 37] -- no adjournment for crown in failing to subpeona witnesses&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Rose (D.A.) (1995), 140 N.S.R.(2d) 151 (SC) [http://www.canlii.org/en/ns/nssc/doc/1995/1995canlii4458/1995canlii4458.html 1995 CanLII 4458]&lt;br&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
#that the absent witnesses are material in the case; 
#that the party applying has not been guilty of laches or neglect in arranging for the attendance of the witnesses; and 
#that there is a reasonable expectation that the witnesses will attend court on the date sought by the party applying for the  adjournment.

The judge may also consider other relevant circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Dang,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abca/doc/2005/2005abca441/2005abca441.html 2005 ABCA 441] -- consequences of delay by adjournment&lt;br&gt;

= Slav Defence Exchange Variation =
===4. cxd5===
After this move, the tension in the center is relieved, often allowing black equality. Because of this, this variation often ends in a draw.

Black's only decent move is to complete the exchange of pawns with 4...cxd5. After the exchange, black will find it difficult to win unless white is overly ambitious.

End in the D14 exchange symmetrical is the same : the draw. Blacks and whites developing their pieces in the same way, exchanging them one after another.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== UDP ==
Unlike TCP, UDP doesn't establish a connection before sending data, it just sends. Because of this, UDP is called &quot;Connectionless&quot;. UDP packets are often called &quot;Datagrams&quot;. An example of UDP in action is the DNS service. DNS servers send and receive DNS requests using UDP.

=== Introduction ===
In this section we have to look at User Datagram protocol. It’s a transport layer protocol. This section will cover the UDP protocol, its header structure &amp; the way with which it establishes the network connection.

As shown in Figure 1,the User Datagram Protocol (UDP) is a transport layer protocol that supports Network Application. It layered on just below the ‘Session’ and sits above the IP(Internet Protocol) in open system interconnection model (OSI). This protocol is similar to TCP (transmission control protocol) that is used in client/ server programs like video conference systems expect UDP is connection less. 

[[Image:fig1_osilayer.jpg]]

'''Figure 1:UDP in OSI Layer Model'''

=== What is UDP? ===

[[Image:fig2_UDPwork.jpg]]

'''Figure 2:UDP''


UDP is a connectionless and unreliable transport protocol.The two ports serve to identify the end points within the source and destination machines. User Datagram Protocol is used, in place of TCP, when a reliable delivery is not required.However, UDP is never used to send important data such as web-pages, database information, etc. Streaming media such as video,audio and others use UDP because it offers speed. 

'''Why UDP is faster than TCP?'''

The reason UDP is faster than TCP is because there is no form of flow control. No error checking,error correction, or acknowledgment is done by UDP.UDP is only concerned with speed. So when, the data sent over the Internet is affected by collisions, and errors will be present. 
 


UDP packet's called as user datagrams with 8 bytes header. A format of user datagrams is shown in figur 3. In the user datagrams first 8 bytes contains header information and the remaining bytes contains data.

[[Image:fig3_udp_userdatagrams.jpg]]

'''Figure 3:UDP datagrams'''

''Source port number'': This is a port number used by source host,who is transferring data. It is 16 bit longs. So port numbers range between 0 to 65,535.

''Destination port number'': This is a port number used by Destination host, who is getting data. It is also 16 bits long and also same number of port range like source host. 

''length'': Length field is a 16 bits field. It contains the total length of the user datagram, header and data.  

''Checksum'': The UDP checksum is optional. It is used to detect error fro the data. If the field is zero then checksum is not calculated. And true calculated then field contains 1.

'''Characteristics of UDP'''

The characteristics of UDP are given below. 

•	End-to-end. UDP can identify a specific process running on a computer. 

•	Unreliable, connectionless delivery (e.g. USPS)::

UDP uses a connectionless communication setup. In this UDP does not need to establish a connection before sending data. Communication consists only of the data segments themselves    

•	Same best effort semantics as IP

•	No ack, no sequence, no flow control

•	Subject to loss, duplication, delay, out-of-order, or loss of connection

•	Fast, low overhead

	1.Suit for reliable, local network

	2.RTP(Real-Time Transport Protocol)

=== Use of ports in Communication ===
After receiving the data,computer must have some mechanism what to do with it.Consider that user has three application open say a web browser,a telnet session and FTP session.All three application are moving data over the network. So, there should be some mechanism for determining what piece of traffic is bound for which application by operating system.To handle this situation , network ports are used.Available port's range is 0 to 65535.In them 0 to 1023 are well-known ports, 1023 to 49151 are registered ports and 49152 to 65535 are dynamic ports.

'''Figure 4: Port'''

List of well-known ports used by UDP:

[[Image:fig5_udpport.jpg]]

'''Figure 5:List of ports used by UDP'''

=== UDP Header structure ===

It contains four section. Source port, Destination port, Length and Checksum.

[[Image:Header of UDP.jpg]]

'''Figure 6: UDP Header'''

'''Source port'''

Source port is an optional field. When used, it indicates the port of the sending process and may be assumed to be the port to which a reply should be addressed in the absence of any other information. If not used, a value of zero is inserted.

'''Destination port'''

It is the port number on which the data is being sent.

'''Length'''

It include the length of UDP Header and Data.

The length in octets of this user datagram, including this header and the data. The minimum value of the length is eight.

'''Checksum'''

The main purpose of checksum is error detection.It guarantees that message arrived at correct destination.To verify checksum,the receiver must extract this fields from IP Header .12-byte psuedo header is used to compute checksum.

'''Data'''

It is the application data.or Actual message.


'''Ethereal Capture'''

The UDP packet can be viewed using Ethereal capture. One such UDP packet is captured and shown below.

'''Figure 7: ethereal capture'''

=== Communication in UDP ===
In UDP connection,Client set unique source port number based on the program they started connection. UDP is not limited to 1-to-1 interaction. A 1-to-many interaction can be provided using broadcast or multi-cast addressing . A many-to-1 interaction can be provided by many clients communicating with a single server. A many-to-many interaction is just an extension of these techniques.

=== UDP Checksum and Pseudo-Header ===
The main purpose of UDP checksum is to detect errors in transmitted segment.

UDP Checksum is optional but it should always be turned on.

To calculate UDP checksum a &quot;pseudo header&quot; is added to the UDP header.
The field in the pseudo header are all taken from IP Header.
They are used on receiving system to make sure that IP datagram is being received by proper computer.
Generally , the pseudo-header includes:

[[Image:Psuedo Header1.jpg]]

Figure 8 : UDP Psuedo Header

IP Source Address	4 bytes

IP Destination Address	4 bytes

Protocol		2 bytes

UDP Length  		2 bytes

=== Checksum Calculation ===

'''Sender side :''' 

1. It treats segment contents as sequence of 16-bit integers.

2. All segments are added. Let's call it sum.

3. Checksum : 1's complement of  sum.(In 1's complement all 0s are converted into 1s and all 1s are converted into 0s).

4. Sender puts this checksum value in  UDP checksum field.

'''Receiver side :'''

1. Calculate checksum
   
2. All segments are added and then sum is added with sender's checksum.

3. Check that any 0 bit is presented in checksum. If receiver side checksum contains any 0 then error is detected. So the packet is discarded by receiver.  
   


Here we explaine a simple checksum calculation.
As an example, suppose that we have the  bitstream  0110011001100110 0110011001100110 0000111100001111: 

This bit stream is divided into segments of 16-bits integers.

So, it looks like this:

0110011001100110 (16-bit integer segment)

0101010101010101 

0000111100001111

The sum of first of these 16-bit words is: 

0110011001100110 

0101010101010101 

--------------------- 

1011101110111011

Adding the third word to the above sum gives 

1011101110111011 

0000111100001111 

--------------------- 

1100101011001010  (sum of all segments)

Now to calculate checksum 1's complement of sum is taken.
As I mentioned earlier , 1's complement is achieved by converting all 1s into 0s and all 0s into 1s.
So,the checksum at sender side is : 0011010100110101.

Now at the receiver side, again all segments are added . and sum is added with sender's checksum.

If no error than check of receiver would be : 1111111111111111.

If any 0 bit is presented in the header than there is an error in checksum.So,the packet is discarded.

You may wonder why UDP provides a checksum in the first place, as many link-layer protocols (including the popular Ethernet protocol) also provide error checking? The reason is that there is no guarantee that all the links between source and destination provide error checking  -- one of the links may use a protocol that does not provide error checking. Because IP is supposed to run over just about any layer-2 protocol, it is useful for the transport layer to provide error checking as a safety measure. Although UDP provides error checking, it does not do anything to recover from an error. Some implementations of UDP simply discard the damaged segment; others pass the damaged segment to the application with a warning.

=== Summary ===
UDP is a transport layer protocol. UDP is a connectionless and unreliable protocol. UDP does not do flow control, error control or retransmission of a bad segment. UDP is faster then TCP. UDP is commonly used for streaming audio and video . UDP never used for important documents like web-page, database information, etc. UDP transmits segments consisting of an 8-byte header. Its contains Source port, Destination port, UDP length and Checksum. UDP checksum used for detect “errors” in transmitted segment.

=== Exercise Questions ===
1.       Calculate UDP checksum of the following sequence:  11100110011001101101010101010101.

Answer : To calculate checksum follow the following steps:
        1. first of all divide the bit stream on to two parts of 16-bit each.
           So,the two bit stream will be  1110011001100110 and  1101010101010101.
       
        2. Add this two bit stream.So ,the addition will be 
   
               1 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0
               1 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1
              ----------------------------------
             '''1''' 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1  
               1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 0   
                          
        3. Now apply one's complement to this bit stream.one's complement is achieved by converting all 1s into 0s and all 0s into 1s.
           So, the checksum will be : '''0100010001000011'''.


2.     What is the advantage of keeping checksum field turned off and when it is appropriate to keep checksum field turned off?

Answer  :  
            By keeping checksum field turned off,this might save computational load and speed up data transfer.
            When we are transmitting data over wide area network(WAN) , it is not a good idea to keep checksum off.
            We can keep checksum turned off when we are transmitting data over a Local Area Network(LAN),because switching infrastructure   
            would catch transmission error in the Ethernet protocol's checksum

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Definition of Nursing===
According to the International Council of Nurses[[http://www.icn.ch/about-icn/icn-definition-of-nursing/]] Nursing encompasses autonomous and collaborative care of individuals of all ages, families, groups and communities, sick or well and in all settings. Nursing includes the promotion of health, prevention of illness, and the care of ill, disabled and dying people. Advocacy, promotion of a safe environment, research, participation in shaping health policy and in patient and health systems management, and education are also key nursing roles. 

===Evolution===
In Alesandro Manzoni's account of ''the black plague'', the parabolani were described as a group of knights and monks who found themselves immune to plague and responsible for the care of survivors. The knights templar  (an order of fighting monks involved in the crusades) have also been mentioned as the pre-cursors of nursing. The ministrations of religious figures in ancient times was piece-meal and restricted to a spiritual focus. Florence Nightingale is widely regarded as the mother of modern nursing. She abandoned her aristocratic heritage to embrace a patriotic fervor and is credited with applying statistics to petition the British parliament for infirm soldiers in the 1852 crimean war. Mary Secombe has recently found some notoriety as a contemporary of Nightingale and some authors ascribe the origins of nursing to Lutheran or Roman catholic origins. Victoire Larminier and other religious orders were practising modern nursing principles by the 1920's. [http://www.catholicnurses.org.uk/historyofnursing.html Nursing history in the church]

===Enlistment===
A census of nurses from the late 1800's records several hundred nurses in the fledgling colony of Australia including untrained child and aboriginal female employees who were defined as caring for the sick. The first attempt to regulate nursing occurred shortly afterwards and was established in each of the states by the outbreak of 1914 war in Europe. In 2012 the state nursing authorities were disbanded and regulation was federalized in Australia so licenses became the responsibility of the commonwealth.

{{TOC right}}

==Introduction==

In the previous part of the book we give an extended example of a program for Human Expansion.  The narrative there is intended to show why complex programs exist, how they are organized and designed, and how they evolve.  For that purpose, a summary of design studies and decisions based on them is sufficient.  In this fifth part of the book we include the design studies in their full detail.  This is to show by example how the analyses, calculations, and decisions are done.  We also include incomplete work-in-progress studies.  Readers are encouraged individually or in teams to add to and improve these studies.  This gains skill and experience applying the methods described earlier in the book, and in working in teams, which is how most real projects are carried out.  Contributions to studies can also serve as resume items when looking for paid work. which are too detailed or too incomplete to include in the main narrative of the book. Any added results from these studies will be incorporated into earlier parts of the book.  As an electronic book, it can be constantly improved, rather than the somewhat static condition of paper textbooks.

The list of studies below is organized first by level of study completion, then by expected order of use within the program.

==Full Studies==

We use the term &quot;full&quot; rather than &quot;completed&quot; because no engineering work is every truly complete.  As time passes, assumptions made in the study will be affected by real-world changes, and new technology and ideas will get developed.  As a consequence, the study could be updated or revised to reflect these changes.  For an actual engineering project, however, you must reach a conclusion or make a decision, and proceed to more detailed design or production.  This section includes studies which are sufficiently complete that such conclusions or decisions can be made from them.  At present (Oct 2012) none of the studies have reached that point.

==Studies in Work==

These are studies which have been started, but have not reached completed or full status.  They are given their own sections, with as many pages as needed by their length, and approximate completion status is noted here.

* '''[[Space_Transport_and_Engineering_Methods/Combined_Systems|Conceptual Design for Human Expansion]] (Status: approx 20%)''' - This study carries through a first stage analysis and design of the program as a whole.  The principal purposes are (1) to determine if such a program is desirable over existing programs, and (2) establish one or more baseline designs for the next stage of work if the program is found desirable.  Because this study looks at the whole program, it is the first one to be worked on.

* '''[[Seed_Factories/Notes|Seed Factory Concept Development]] (Status: approx 10%)''' - This study attempts to formulate concepts for a &quot;Seed Factory&quot;, a starter set of equipment that both outputs more equipment to expand itself and also useful products.  It is part of a separate Wikibook on that topic.

==Study Ideas==

These are ideas for future studies which have not been started yet.  They do not have their own section yet, but are merely described here.

===Starting Location Trade===

The two nearest objects in velocity terms beyond Earth orbit are the Moon and Near Earth Objects (NEOs).  If you want to obtain materials or set up production, the question is which to start with?  The options are Moon first, NEO first, or both in parallel.

'''Composition'''

The composition of the Moon and NEOs is different. The Moon does have some Carbon in it, around 100 parts per million.  Chondrite asteroids are approx 0.4% carbon (4000 ppm).  So given 40 time richer &quot;ore&quot;, and the ability to run your processing plant 100% of the time vs 50% on the Moon (lunar night), you likely want to mine an asteroid to get the carbon to *build* a space elevator.  Like for terrestrial mining, location of the mine and richness of the ore determine where you want to mine.

'''Access'''

==Discarded Studies==

Some studies will turn out to be unnecessary, merged with other studies, or otherwise determined to not be useful.  They are listed here to have a record of work done previously.  This is different than a completed design study for an option not chosen.  In that case the study was useful in making the choice among alternatives. 

No discarded studies are in this category yet.

Entire books have been written about getting to and developing Mars. The ones I will refer to as '''Flags and Footprints''' exploration missions are similar the Apollo missions to the Moon.  They go there, do a bit of exploring, and return, without a supporting infrastructure and leaving no improvements at the destination.  These are particularly expensive and wasteful.

The combined systems discussed in the previous sections are a different route to getting to Mars.  They build capabilities step by step, each one preparing for the next, and generally using machines to prepare the way for humans. In this section we will discuss the last steps to get to Mars, building on the prior technology from our combined system. Mars is the most nearly Earth-like planet we know of, so we will also mention some ideas for long term development.  They would get done, if ever, much later, when Mars and the Solar System are more fully developed.

==Early Development==

The early development would start with the Martian moons Phobos and Deimos, since they are easiest to reach, and progress down from there.

===Phobos and Deimos===

Conveniently Mars already has two fairly large asteroids in orbit (Phobos and Deimos), giving us a ready supply of materials. Phobos alone has a mass of about 10,000 gigatons, which is more than we would need for a very long time. The first step in development is to set up a base of operations on one of them.  This would do mining, processing, and construction of habitats. The composition of the Martian moons is not entirely clear yet&lt;ref&gt;[http://meetings.copernicus.org/epsc2009/abstracts/EPSC2009-723.pdf Rivkin et al '''MRO/CRISM Observations of Phobos and Deimos''' 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;, but they appear to be similar to CM type Chondrite asteroids and meteorites.  If any particular materials are not found in these satellites, they can be fetched from '''Near Mars Objects''', otherwise known as the '''Main Asteroid Belt''', which starts just outside Mars' orbit.  The velocity to reach them from the Martian satellites is fairly low.

Chondrites are known to contain a large amount of carbon, so the main goal of the Phobos base would be to provide cable and other materials for a Mars Skyhook.  Secondary goals are to provide fuel for landers and human control of surface operations before humans can be supported on the surface.  The short distance of the Mars satellites relative to Earth allow for real-time control.

===Mars Skyhooks===

There are two sizes of Martian Skyhooks that make sense to look at.  One set is capable of reaching from low Mars orbit (LMO) to Phobos orbit, and whatever suborbital velocity to Mars that produces. The other set would be capable of doing a full velocity transfer to the Martian surface.  The first could grow into the second over time, but we will look at them as specific design points. 

====LMO to Phobos Skyhooks====

'''Orbit Mechanics''' - The product of a planet's mass M and the universal gravitational constant G is called the '''Standard Gravitational Parameter''' or &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;. For Mars the value is &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; = GM = 42.837 x 10^12.  This value is useful for calculating circular orbit velocities by the formula

:&lt;math&gt;v_o \approx \sqrt{\frac{GM}{r}}&lt;/math&gt;

Knowing the average radius of Phobos from the center of Mars is 9,377 km, putting that into the formula in meters (9,377,000 since we must use all SI units and not multiples thereof), we can determine the orbit velocity of Phobos is 2137 m/s. Since Mars has an equatorial radius of 3,396 km, then Phobos is 5,981 km from the surface.  For elliptical transfer orbits, where r is the current radius from the body center, and a is the '''semi-major axis''', or half the long axis of the ellipse, the velocity is

::&lt;math&gt; v^2 = \mu \left( \frac{2}{r} - \frac{1}{a} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

If we want to  transfer from Phobos to 400 km above the Mars surface ( r = 3796 km ), then the velocities at the high and low points of the transfer orbit, and at the low orbit can be calculate as follows:

:* Transfer High point: r = 9,377,000 m ; a = half of high + low altitudes = 6,586,000 m ; from formula &lt;math&gt; v^2 = &lt;/math&gt; 2,632,300 m^2/s^2, and so v = 1622 m/s.
:* Transfer Low point: r = 3,796,000 m ; a is the same as previous = 6,586,000 m ; therefore &lt;math&gt; v^2 = &lt;/math&gt; = 16,065,000 m^2/s^2 and v = 4008 m/s.
:* 400 km Circular: r = a = 3,796,000 m ; v = 3,359 m/s.

The velocity difference from Phobos to the transfer orbit is 515 m/s, and from the transfer orbit to 400 km circular is 649 m/s.  These velocities are relatively small compared to the Lunar or Earth orbit Skyhooks we have looked at previously, so they would be relatively low mass ratio. Assuming the tips are at 1 gravity, the Phobos Skyhook would have a radius of 26.5 km, and the LMO one would be 42 km.  Phobos is tidally locked to Mars, always keeping one face to the planet, but it is not locked in rotation about the Mars-pointing axis, and tidal variations from the sun and slight orbit eccentricity cause it to wobble.  Thus the Phobos Skyhook should probably not be attached to Phobos directly, but placed nearby.  

Both Skyhooks will have low mass ratios because of their low tip velocities.  Therefore they would shift their own orbits by a large amount when transferring cargo.  The solution is to anchor both of them with a sufficient amount of ballast mass from Phobos at their center points.  The LMO Skyhook can drop cargo at 3,359 - 649 = 2,710 m/s.  Mars' equatorial rotation is 241 m/s, so the relative velocity to the surface will be 2,469 m/s.  To reach Mars escape from Phobos requires adding 884 m/s.  Since our Phobos Skyhook can add 514 m/s, that leaves 370 m/s to be done by other means.

A &quot;Flags and Footprints&quot; type mission would require no propulsion in theory to land on Mars, if it uses all aerodynamic braking.  It would need 5 km/s of propulsion to reach Mars escape velocity on the return trip.  With a base at Phobos and the transfer Skyhooks, no propulsion is needed is needed to land either. The LMO Skyhook drops the vehicle about 20% below orbit velocity and re-entry will be automatic.  The return propulsion would require about half as much velocity to reach orbit - 2.47 km/s.  With a permanent habitat at Phobos, there is no need to escape from Mars, but if you choose to do so, it would require 2.84 km/s.  Assuming a chemical rocket for both with an exhaust velocity of 3,500 m/s, the mass ratio will be 4.17 without the Skyhooks, giving a cargo of 14% if the vehicle hardware is 10%.  With the Skyhooks, the mass ratio is 2.02, and landed cargo is 39.4%.  So the Skyhooks allow 2.8 times as much payload per trip.

====LMO to Surface Skyhook====

A full orbit to ground Skyhook will likely not make economic sense until traffic grows to a higher level, but let us take a look at a possible design.  Start by assuming a 1000 km high orbit.  That will have a radius of 4,396,000 m. From the above formula we calculate the orbit velocity is 3122 m/s. Subtracting 241 m/s for the rotation of Mars gives a relative velocity of 2881 m/s.  If the tip is at 1 gravity centrifugal acceleration, then the Skyhook radius will be 846 km, and the tip will become motionless when the Skyhook is vertical 154 km above Mars mean surface level.  That should be high enough to avoid significant atmosphere friction. The Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft used a no-drag holding orbit at around 175 km lowest point, and active aerobraking between 120 and 135 km. It did so when moving between circular and escape orbit velocities of 3,500 to 5,000 m/s.  So the Skyhook with near zero velocity at the lowest point should not see much drag.

Pavonis Mons is a 14 km tall mountain on the Martian Equator.  So a vehicle wanting to reach the Skyhook from there would need to climb 140 km vertically.  This requires a vertical velocity of 1,020 m/s plus about 12% gravity loss for a total velocity of 1145 m/s. This might be reduced if the Skyhook reached a lower altitude, but drag must be carefully looked at so the Skyhook is not in danger of de-orbiting itself. Without a Skyhook we found in the previous section we needed 5.4 units of fuel for each unit of payload returned from Mars surface to Mars escape.  Escape velocity is 1.41 times circular orbit velocity, and this Skyhook has a release velocity of 1.92 times orbit velocity at the highest point, so well above escape velocity.  Thus with this system the mass ratio becomes 1.387, and fuel used is 28% of takeoff mass, or 45% of cargo mass.  Therefore it uses 12 times less fuel than without a Skyhook.

The working length we previously used for Carbon fiber is 126.4 g-km.  Acceleration in the Skyhook varies smoothly from 0 at the center to 1.0 gravities at the tip.  With an average of 0.5 gravities times a radius of 846 km the requirement is 423 g-km.  Therefore the mass ratio of the cable is 28.4 times it's load per arm, or 56.8 for both arms.  That is heavy enough that it may not need ballast mass at the center to keep from shifting it's orbit too much in operation.  It will still need propulsion to maintain orbit when traffic going up and down are not in balance. Since the Skyhook saves 4.95 units of fuel on the Martian surface for each unit of return cargo, in theory it pays for itself in fuel savings in under 12 flights.  In practice it will take a detailed design to find out what the system mass and payback times in terms of mass and cost will be. 

===Mars Surface Systems===

====Construction====

Earth-moving equipment will be needed for a number of purposes. The Mars surface is not protected from radiation like the Earth is, so long term habitats would need to be protected by a layer of soil.  Landing areas will need to be flattened, and protective berms built around them so exhaust plumes don't sandblast nearby equipment.  Once cargoes are delivered to the surface, they will need to be moved, lifted, and assembled, so devices to do those tasks will be needed.  Most of the site preparation will likely be done by remote controlled machines.

====Power Supply====

Solar panels are a viable power supply on the Martian surface.  It is rarely cloudy, aside from dust storms, and the atmosphere is thin, which partially compensates for the greater distance from the Sun.  When larger amounts of power are needed, then radio-isotope or reactor devices can be added.

====On-Site Propellant Manufacture====

Producing propellant on the surface of Mars has been studied extensively, since it lowers the mass brought from Earth for a &quot;Flags and Footprints&quot; mission. If we already have a robust orbital mining and processing capability and Skyhooks in place to deliver cargo, there may not be much benefit in early production of fuel locally vs delivery.  The economics of doing so will need to be examined.  For portable power, such as in moving vehicles, and for rocket propellant to reach a Skyhook on a return mission, an Oxygen/Methane fuel mix is a reasonable combination.  Once sufficient need for fuel exists, producing it locally will make more sense

====Linear Accelerator====

Pavonis Mons, which is located on the Martian Equator, has a slope about 175 km long, which rises about 6.5 km.  If large amounts of cargo need to be delivered from Mars, a gas or electromagnetic accelerator can be used here.  If the full slope is used, orbital velocity can be reached with human-tolerable accelerations (3.6 gravities).  This would not be an early system, since sufficient traffic is needed to justify such a large installation.  Another option is a centrifugal catapult on top of the mountain for early cargo launch.

It is quite feasible to build a rotating space elevator (Rotovator) in orbit, coupled to a linear accelerator on Pavonis Mons ( http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/12/Pavonis_mons_topo.jpg ).  You have 60-120 km of ramp space, and no atmosphere to speak of, so at 3 g's and 60 km you can reach half of Mars orbit velocity, and the Rotovator provide the rest.

==Long Term Development==

Often the phrase &quot;Terraforming Mars&quot; has been used in the past.  This is not a good phrase because it means &quot;Make Mars like Earth&quot;.  Because of orbit and mass differences, we cannot make Mars just like Earth, nor do I think that should be the goal.  I prefer the word &quot;humanize&quot;, meaning making it more suitable for humans.  It may also mean modifying humans to better suit the Mars environment (like the lower gravity).  Large scale changes to Mars should be delayed till after we have a firm idea if there is any native life on the planet, and even then done with due consideration and forethought.  They should also be delayed until there are enough people on Mars to justify the large-scale projects.  So what follows is more to answer what is possible from a technical point of view, and less to say &quot;I urge you to do all these&quot;.

===Magnetosphere===

Mars lacks a strong magnetosphere - a magnetic field around the planet that traps and diverts charged particles from space.  The Earth has one due to the magnetic field generated by our planet's core.  A strong magnetosphere protects the atmosphere from being slowly stripped off as solar wind and other particles hit the upper atmosphere.  Short of stirring up the planet's core, there may be some other ways to generate  a field.  The practicality of any of them is yet to be determined:

* Run one or more superconducting cables around lines of latitude, which, like any current-carrying wires, will generate a field
* Place some number of iron-nickel asteroids in Mars orbit and magnetize them, and point their fields in the same direction.
* Mars is red because there is a lot of iron oxide on it's surface.  Extract the iron, and magnetize it.  You might be able to use the iron for other purposes at the same time as it being a magnet.  

Magnets to make the magnetic field have fewer ways to break than superconductors, but if the superconductors work 99% of the time the other 1% doesn't make much difference to long term atmosphere loss.  Some leakage of the atmosphere will still happen because Mars is a smaller planet than the Earth, so it is easier for atoms to escape.

===Greenhouses===

If you want to eliminate leakage, and bring up the pressure to breathable levels without importing a planet's worth of atmosphere, you can use greenhouse domes.  If you really need the space, you can extend the domes to cover the entire planet bit by bit.  To create Earth sea level pressure on Mars, a pressure balanced dome would consist of 10 meter thick quartz, glass, or equivalent, which you extract from Mars surface material.  Lighter domes tend to float up, as the internal pressure is higher than the surrounding air.  In that case they need to be tied down so they don't float away.  A very large or planetary dome doesn't need much to hold it up, just some towers or cables to keep it from moving sideways.

You can design the clear material like armored glass to be resist damage, and ten meters of anything is pretty hard to break.  But anything can be broken, so a lot of thought needs to go into how to deal with damage.  As a greenhouse, you can take advantage of the &quot;greenhouse effect&quot;, which is the trapping of infrared heat radiated back from the ground.  You can specifically select the glass type or add coatings to trap infrared.  You also want to block Solar UV radiation, which is not blocked by the Martian atmosphere. On Earth the greenhouse effect is a problem, since we don't want the planet warmer than it already is.  On Mars it's a solution, since it's too cold for us there at the moment.

===Full Atmosphere===

If you find living under a dome objectionable, you would need to provide a full atmosphere at a breathable level.  That is a very big job because planets are large.  On Mars you need to provide 25 tons of atmosphere for each and every square meter of the planet, or 3.6 million billion tons total.  That's to provide one Earth atmosphere pressure.  If you are satisfied with less oxygen (similar to mountains on Earth), and a different mix for the rest of the air, you can get by with somewhat less.  Despite it's distance, the easiest place to get enough nitrogen might be the Kuiper belt, which is outside Neptune's orbit and which Pluto is a part of.  You could use a &quot;reverse gravity assist&quot; from Neptune to drop the material into the inner solar system.  Nitrogen is rather scarce in the inner solar system, and getting it from anyplace with a deep gravity well (like Earth) takes a lot of work.  Some of the outer moons might have enough ammonia (NH3).

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Age calculation ==
Sometimes you may want to calculate the age of a StudySubject, for example at the date on which the Informed Consent is signed.
You can do this by using the following script, which uses three CRF-items:
* date of birth, DateOfBirth, 
* an other date, OtherDate, such as the date of signing the informed consent and
* the field that will hold the calculated age, CalculatedAge.

== Identifying the three items ==
The jscript uses three variables it reads from the CRF-items, but before it can do that, we must label them in the CRF. We do this by using the &amp;lt;spanid=xxx&amp;gt;-tag.
We put these labels in either the left- or the right-item-text.
&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Calcage.png|none|thumbs||labeling in the CRF]]
&lt;br&gt;

== the script ==
Here is the script and you can put it for example in the instructions column of the section with the items.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;jquery&quot;&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;script lang=&quot;Javascript&quot;&gt;
   $.noConflict();
   jQuery(document).ready(function($){
      var dobField = $(&quot;#DateOfBirth&quot;).parent().parent().find(&quot;input&quot;);
      var signField = $(&quot;#OtherDate&quot;).parent().parent().find(&quot;input&quot;);
      var ageField = $(&quot;#CalculatedAge&quot;).parent().parent().find(&quot;input&quot;);
      ageField.attr(&quot;readonly&quot;, true);
 
      var months = [&quot;jan&quot;, &quot;feb&quot;, &quot;mar&quot;, &quot;apr&quot;, &quot;may&quot;, &quot;jun&quot;, &quot;jul&quot;, &quot;aug&quot;, &quot;sep&quot;, &quot;oct&quot;, &quot;nov&quot;, &quot;dec&quot;];

      function calcYearsBetween(startDate, endDate) {
         var years = (endDate.getFullYear() - startDate.getFullYear());
         if (endDate.getMonth() &lt; startDate.getMonth() || endDate.getMonth() == startDate.getMonth() &amp;&amp; endDate.getDate() &lt; startDate.getDate()) years--;
         return years;
      }
 
      function parseDate(input){
         var parts = input.split(&quot;-&quot;);
         var myDate = new Date();
         myDate.setFullYear(parts[2]);
         myDate.setMonth(months.indexOf(parts[1].toLowerCase()));
         myDate.setDate(parts[0]);
         return myDate;
      }
 
      function yearsBetween(){
         var dob = dobField.val();
         var sign = signField.val();
         var age=&quot;&quot;;
         var curAge = ageField.val();
         if(dob!==&quot;&quot; &amp;&amp; sign!==&quot;&quot;){
            age = String(calcYearsBetween(parseDate(dob), parseDate(sign)));
         }
         if(curAge!==age){
            ageField.val(age);
            ageField.change();
         }
      }
      dobField.blur(function(){
         yearsBetween();
      });
      signField.blur(function(){
         yearsBetween();
      });
      $(&quot;#srl&quot;).on(&quot;focus&quot;, function () { 
         yearsBetween();
      });
      $(&quot;#srh&quot;).on(&quot;focus&quot;, function () { 
         yearsBetween();
      });
});
&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

== How it works ==
The code begins by including jQuery 1.9.1. You could also point to the one OpenClinica provides.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;jquery&quot;&gt;
&lt;script src=&quot;//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.1/jquery.min.js&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Furthermore, to prevent a possible conflict with OpenClinica's code, we add the noConflict statement:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;jquery&quot;&gt;
$.noConflict();
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The script takes the two dates and creates two date objects, based on the day, month and year. The months are compared with the array of available months, which is declared in the start of the script. As you can see these are given in the English notation, so change these abbreviations if your users have another browser language. The script converts the given name to lowercase and then finds the ordinal number of the month and uses the number to set the month: &lt;br/&gt;
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;jquery&quot;&gt;
myDate.setMonth(months.indexOf(parts[1].toLowerCase()));
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

It then calculates the age by subtracting the years and comparing the months and if necessary days: 
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;jquery&quot;&gt;
function calcYearsBetween(startDate, endDate) {
   var years = (endDate.getFullYear() - startDate.getFullYear());
   if (endDate.getMonth() &lt; startDate.getMonth() || endDate.getMonth() == startDate.getMonth() &amp;&amp; endDate.getDate() &lt; startDate.getDate()) years--;
   return years;
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

Now we have the age, but we must transfer it to our field, but only if the age has really changed. Furthermore, if the value did change, we call the field's change method, to ensure OpenClinica writes the value to the database:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;jquery&quot;&gt;
if(curAge!==age){
   ageField.val(age);
   ageField.change();
}
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

The age is calculated when we leave the date of birth field, the sign field, or when we press one of the two save buttons, called &quot;srh&quot; and &quot;srl&quot;:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;jquery&quot;&gt;
dobField.blur(function(){
   yearsBetween();
});
signField.blur(function(){
   yearsBetween();
});
$(&quot;#srl&quot;).on(&quot;focus&quot;, function () { 
   yearsBetween();
});
$(&quot;#srh&quot;).on(&quot;focus&quot;, function () { 
   yearsBetween();
});
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== The age ==
{{TOC right}}
To understand the Templars one must understand the context that prompted the creation of the order. The age where the events took place is commonly referred as the '''[[w:High Middle Ages|High Middle Ages]]''' the period of European history in the 11th, 12th, and 13th centuries (AD 1000&amp;ndash;1300). The High Middle Ages were preceded by the [[w:Early Middle Ages|Early Middle Ages]] and followed by the [[w:Late Middle Ages|Late Middle Ages]], which by convention ends around [[w:1500|1500]].

The key historical trend of the High Middle Ages was the rapidly increasing population of Europe, which brought about great social and political change from the preceding era.  By 1250, some scholars say, the continent became overpopulated, reaching levels it would not see again in some areas until the [[w:19th century|19th century]]. This trend was checked in the Late Middle Ages by a series of calamities, notably the [[w:Black Death|Black Death]] but also including numerous wars and economic stagnation.

From about the year [[w:1000|1000]] onwards, Western Europe saw the last of the barbarian invasions and became more politically organized. The [[w:Viking|Viking]]s had settled in the [[w:British Isles|British Isles]], [[w:France|France]] and elsewhere, whilst Norse Christian kingdoms were developing in their [[w:Scandinavia|Scandinavia]]n homelands. The [[w:Magyars|Magyars]] had ceased their expansion in the 10th century, and by the year 1000, a Christian [[w:Kingdom of Hungary|Kingdom of Hungary]] was recognized in central Europe. With the brief exception of the [[w:Mongol|Mongol]] incursions, major barbarian invasions ceased.

In the 11th century, populations in the [[w:Alps|Alps]] began to settle new lands, some of which had reverted to wilderness after the end of the [[w:Roman Empire|Roman Empire]]. In what is known as the &quot;great clearances,&quot; vast forests and marshes of Europe were cleared and cultivated. At the same time settlements moved beyond the traditional boundaries of the [[w:Frankish Empire|Frankish Empire]] to new frontiers in eastern Europe, beyond the [[w:Elbe River|Elbe River]], tripling the size of Germany in the process. Crusaders founded European colonies in the [[w:Levant|Levant]], Spain conquered from the Moors, and the [[w:Normans|Normans]] colonized southern Italy, all part of the major population increase and resettlement pattern.  

The High Middle Ages produced many different forms of intellectual, spiritual and artistic works. This age saw the rise of modern nation-states in [[w:Western Europe|Western Europe]] and the ascent of the great Italian [[w:city-state|city-state]]s. The still-powerful [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Church]] called armies from across Europe to a series of [[w:Crusades|Crusades]] against the [[w:Seljuk Turks|Seljuk Turks]], who occupied the [[w:Holy Land|Holy Land]]. The rediscovery of the works of [[w:Aristotle|Aristotle]] led [[w:Thomas Aquinas|Thomas Aquinas]] and other thinkers to develop the philosophy of [[w:Scholasticism|Scholasticism]]. In architecture, many of the most notable Gothic cathedrals were built or completed during this era.

=== Social Structure ===
The social structure between the 9th and 15th centuries in Europe, was mostly based in a system for structuring society around the relationships derived from the holding of land in exchange for service or labor, defined as [[w:Feudalism|Feudalism]].

The term &quot;feudal&quot; or &quot;feodal&quot; is derived from the medieval [[w:Latin|Latin]] word feodum. It seems that the strongest theory is that the social structure and term evolved from Roman practices, taking in consideration that Rome's power and culture had a major impact in the continent. The basic pillar of power and economic structure of the Roman society was the [[w:Roman Villa|Roman villa]]. Roman writers refer with satisfaction to the self-sufficiency of their villas, where they drank their own wine and pressed their own oil, a commonly used  [[w:Literary topos|literary ''topos'']]. An ideal Roman citizen was the independent farmer tilling his own land, and the agricultural writers wanted to give their readers a chance to link  themselves with their ancestors through this image of self-sufficient villas. The truth was not too far from it, either, while even the profit-oriented ''[[w:latifundia|latifundia]]'' probably grew enough of all the basic foodstuffs to provide for their own consumption. One must also consider that ownership of land (and state taxation) had been one of the major motivators for Rome expansionism.

Another clue is given by the word domicile. The domain of the ''[[w:dominus|dominus]]'' (the Latin word for [[w:master (form of address)|master]] and [[w:owner|owner]]). It was a [[w:title|title]] of [[w:sovereignty|sovereignty]] the term under the [[w:Roman Republic|Roman Republic]] had all the associations of the [[w:Greek language|Greek]] ''[[w:Tyrannos|Tyrannos]]''; refused during the early [[w:principate|principate]], it finally became an official title of the [[w:Roman Emperor|Roman Emperor]]s under [[w:Diocletian|Diocletian]] (this is where the term ''[[w:dominate|dominate]]'', used to describe a political system of [[w:Roman Empire|Roman Empire]] in 284-476, is derived from).

It is interesting to note the meaning and concept behind he word spread and evolved. For instance Dominus, in the [[w:French language|French language]] is  equivalent of being &quot;sieur&quot;, was the Latin title of the [[w:feudal|feudal]], superior and [[w:mesne|mesne]], [[w:lord|lord]]s, and later also an [[w:ecclesiastical|ecclesiastical]] and [[w:academic|academic]]al title. It is also origin of the [[w:English language|English]] &quot;sir&quot; [[w:Prefix (linguistics)|prefix]]. The shortened form &quot;dom&quot; is still used as a prefix of honor for ecclesiastics of the [[w:Catholic Church|Catholic Church]]. The English [[w:colloquial|colloquial]] use of &quot;don&quot; for a fellow or [[w:tutor|tutor]] of a [[w:college|college]] at a university is derived either from an application of the Spanish title to one having authority or position, or from the academical use of dominus. The earliest use of the word in this sense appears, according to the [[w:New English Dictionary|New English Dictionary]], in Souths Sermons (1660). An English corruption, &quot;dan&quot;, was in early use as a title of respect, equivalent to master.

The [[w:Spanish language|Spanish]] form &quot;[[w:Don_(honorific)|Don]]&quot; is also a title, formerly applicable only to the [[w:nobility|nobility]], and now one of courtesy and respect applied to any member of the better classes. The [[w:grammatical gender|feminine]] form &quot;doña&quot; is similarly applied to a lady. Much like in the [[w:Portugués|Portuguese language]] the title &quot;Dom&quot; is also an [[w:honorific|honorific]], and formerly used by members of the [[w:Royal family|blood royal]] and others on whom it has been conferred by the [[w:Monarch|sovereign]]. The Spanish &quot;doña&quot; is also present as &quot;dona&quot;.

In Italian, the title [[w:Don_(honorific)|Don]] or [[w:Donna|Donna]] is also reserved for diocesan catholic clergymen, former nobles and persons of distinction in Southern Italy. In [[w:Romanian language|Romanian]], the word &quot;domn&quot; (feminine &quot;doamna&quot;) is both a title of the medieval rulers, and a mark of honor.

It is then here we find the roots for the Feudalism system, based not only on Roman culture but dependent on Roman law, even in the evolution and refinement on the separate social casts as they had been first [[w:Ancient Greece#Social structure|established by the Greeks]]. It is also interesting to note that seemingly insulated cultures have evolved similar social structures, from the Mayan, in the kingdoms of China and in [[Ohio 7th Grade World History/Japanese Feudalism|Japan]]. 

At the bottom the '''serf''', this class has its origins in the the 2nd century AD in the way the Roman ''latifundia'' had displaced the small farms as the agricultural foundation of the Roman Empire. This effect contributed to the destabilizing of Roman society as well. As the small farms of the Roman peasantry were bought up by the wealthy and their vast supply of slaves, the landless peasantry were forced to idle and squat around the city of Rome, relying greatly on handouts. This new landless class, incapable of self sustain itself as we discussed earlier was one of the motives for the Roman expansionism. Services to the state were often recompensed with land, especially to the military service man.

And so the social pyramid stats to form, above the serf we have the '''Nobility'''. Every Noble starts by belonging to a feudal lord (owner of land) family, often they may have royal blood, nobility is attributed by the state in continuation with the practice by the Romans, were service is rewarded by land an position. Since most borders have now been established, the possession and control of land and people to toil and defend it becomes the cornerstone of power. The abundance of serfs makes past practices of slavery rare, serfs allegiance becomes as important as the recognition and hereditary rights (again in line with previous Roman practices). Religion was used not only as social agglutinator but as a justification for to right of rule, and so the Chuch becomes important validating the rulers of all kingdoms in Christianhood.  

The evolution of states in most of Europe after the fall of Rome, started after the fragmentation of the empire. The Church become the only link and keeper of knowledge and culture, the only light during [[w:Dark Ages (historiography)|The Dark Ages]] after the extinguishing of the &quot;light of Rome&quot;.

The Church that had in itself a very stratified hierarchical system, that replicated (even if with more freedom) the economic strata of those who joined the service of the Church in the preservation of knowledge, culture and the rule of law. It comes to represent of the Christian God will on Earth, and the ultimate seat of power. And so at the top we have the '''Clergy''', that are the ultimate guarantees of social order and serve as the power not only behind each monarch but each citizen.

=== The Rise of Chivalry ===
Household heavy cavalry ([[w:knight|knight]]s) became common in the 11th century across Europe, and tournaments were invented. Although the heavy capital investment in horse and armor was a barrier to entry, knighthood became known as a way for serfs to earn their freedom. In the 12th century, the [[w:Cluny|Cluny]] monks promoted ethical warfare and inspired the formation of orders of chivalry, such as the Templar Knights. Inherited titles of nobility were established during this period. In 13th-century Germany, knighthood became another inheritable title, although one of the less prestigious, and the trend spread to other countries.

It was with the religious military orders, that the fusion of the religious and the military spirit was realized, that chivalry reached its apogee. It was at this apogee that the secular brotherhood was created.

{{TODO|Verify the claim made about the Cluny monks.}}

=== Religion ===
==== The Church ====
The [[w:East-West Schism|East-West Schism]] of [[w:1054|1054]] formally separated the Christian church into two parts: [[Roman Catholicism|Western Catholicism]] in Western Europe and [[w:Eastern Orthodoxy|Eastern Orthodoxy]] in the east. It occurred when [[w:Pope Leo IX|Pope Leo IX]] and Patriarch Michael I excommunicated each other, mainly over disputes as to the existence of papal authority over the four Eastern [[w:patriarch|patriarch]]s.

===== Mendicant orders =====
* [[w:Franciscan|Franciscan]]s (Friars Minor, commonly known as the Grey Friars), founded 1209
* [[w:Carmelite|Carmelite]]s, (Hermits of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Carmel, commonly known as the White Friars), founded 1206&amp;ndash;1214
* Dominicans (Order of Preachers, commonly called the Black Friars), founded 1215
* [[w:Augustinians|Augustinians]] (Hermits of St. Augustine, commonly called the austin Friars), founded 1256

{{NOTE|The [[w:Mendicant order|Mendicant order]]s did only rise into relevance during the 13th century.}}

===== Military orders =====
The Roman Catholic Christian '''[[w:military order|military orders]]''', society of knights, are intrinsically connected with the [[w:Crusades|Crusades]] (the protection and expansion of the Roman Catholic Christian faith). The main goal of their creation was to answer the military structure requirements of the time as well with the maintaining of a distinction in regards to ranking of those from noble families called into the service of the Church. They first appeared following the [[w:First Crusade|First Crusade]] in response to the Islamic conquest of the former Byzantine Christian Holy Land. They evolved to propagating or defending the [[w:faith|faith]] and guarantee access to [[w:Holy Land|Holy Land]]. Military actions were mostly against [[Islam]]ic forces or in the suppression of heretics. Many orders later became [[w:secularization|secularized]].

{{NOTE|The Cathars heretics suppression should be noted as it will becomes relevant in future events.}}  

The foundation of the [[w:Knights Templar|Templars]] in 1118 provided the first in a series of tightly organized military forces which protected the Christian lands in [[w:Outremer|Outremer]]. Fighting invading Muslims in the [[w:Iberian Peninsula|Iberian Peninsula]] ([[w:Reconquista|Reconquista]]).   

Because of the necessity to have a [[w:standing army|standing army]], the military orders were created, being adopted as the fourth [[w:monasticism|monastic]] [[w:Religious vows|vow]].

The principal feature of the military order is the combination of military and [[w:Consecrated life|religious]] ways of life. Some of them, like the [[w:Knights of St John|Knights of St John]] and the [[w:Knights of Saint Thomas|Knights of Saint Thomas]], also cared for the sick and poor. However, they were not purely male institutions, as [[w:nun|nun]]s could attach themselves as [[w:convent|convent]]s of the orders. One significant feature of the military orders is that [[w:Catholic Church hierarchy|clerical]] brothers could be, and indeed often were, subordinate to non-ordained brethren.

In 1818 [[w:Joseph von Hammer|Joseph von Hammer]] compared the Catholic military orders, in particular the Templars, with certain Islamic models such as the [[w:Shia Islam|Shiite]] sect of [[w:Hashshashin|Assassins]]. In 1820 [[w:José Antonio Conde|José Antonio Conde]] has suggested they were modeled on the [[w:ribat|ribat]], a fortified religious institution which brought together a religious way of life with fighting the enemies of Islam. However popular such views may have become, others have criticized this view suggesting there were no such ribats around the [[w:Outremer|Outremer]] until after the military orders had been founded. Yet the innovation of the role and function of the military orders has sometimes been obscured by the concentration on their military exploits in [[w:Syria|Syria]], the [[w:Holy Land|Holy Land]], [[w:Prussia (Baltic)|Prussia]], and [[w:Livonia|Livonia]]. In fact they had extensive holdings and staff throughout [[w:Western Europe|Western Europe]]. The majority were laymen. They provided a conduit for cultural and technical innovation, for example the introduction of [[w:fulling|fulling]] into England by the Knights of St John, or the banking facilities of the Templars.

====== List of military orders ======
This list is intended to be comprehensive. The orders are listed chronologically according to their dates of foundation (in parentheses), which are sometimes approximate, and may in significance vary from case to case, the foundation of an order, its ecclesiastical approval, and its militarization occurring at times on different dates.

{{NOTE|This is a comprehensive listing, it goes beyond the time period relevant to the subject matter of the book. When examining the list it is important not only the dates and the terminus of the practice, but also where and the reasons why they were created. The orders names provide a good clue to the first.}}

===== Golden age of monasticism =====
The late 11th century/early-mid 12th century was the height of the golden age of [[w:Christian monasticism|Christian monasticism]] (8th-12th centuries).
*[[w:Benedictine Order|Benedictine Order]] - black robed monks
*[[w:Cistercian Order|Cistercian Order]] - white robed monks
**[[w:Bernard of Clairvaux|Bernard of Clairvaux]]

==== Heretical movements ====
[[w:Heresy|Heresy]] existed in Europe before the 11th century but only in small numbers and of local character: a rogue priest, or a village returning to pagan traditions; but beginning in the 11th century mass-movement heresies appeared. The roots of this can be found with the rise of urban cities, free merchants and a new money-based economy. The rural values of monasticism held little appeal to urban people who began to form sects more in tune with urban culture. The first heretical movements originated in the newly urbanized areas such as southern France and northern Italy. They were mass movements on a scale the Church had never seen before, and the response was one of elimination for some, such as the Cathars, and the acceptance and integration of others, such as St. Francis, the son of an urban merchant who renounced money.

===== Cathars =====
[[Image:cathars_expelled.JPG|thumb|right|250px|Cathars being expelled from [[w:Carcassone|Carcassone]] in [[w:1209|1209]].]]

The [[w:Cathars|Cathars]] formed the '''Catharism''' movement with Gnostic elements that originated around the middle of the [[w:10th century|10th century]], branded by the contemporary [[Roman Catholic Church]] as heretical. It existed throughout much of [[w:Western Europe|Western Europe]], but its home was in [[w:Languedoc|Languedoc]] and surrounding areas in southern [[w:France|France]].

The name ''Cathar'' most likely originated from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''catharos'', &quot;the pure ones&quot;. One of the first recorded uses is Eckbert von Schönau who wrote on heretics from Cologne in 1181: &quot;Hos nostra germania catharos appellat.&quot;

The Cathars are also called '''Albigensians'''. This name originates from the end of the [[w:12th century|12th century]], and was used by the chronicler [[w:Geoffroy du Breuil of Vigeois|Geoffroy du Breuil of Vigeois]] in [[w:1181|1181]]. The name refers to the southern town of [[w:Albi|Albi]] (the ancient Albiga). The designation is hardly exact, for the centre was at [[w:Toulouse|Toulouse]] and in the neighbouring districts.

The [[w:Albigensians|Albigensians]] were strong in southern France, northern Italy, and the southwestern [[w:Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Empire]].
*Dualists believed that historical events were the result of struggle between a good force and an evil force and that evil ruled the world, but could be controlled or defeated through [[w:asceticism|asceticism]] and good works.
*[[w:Albigensian Crusade|Albigensian Crusade]], Simon de Montfort, [[w:Montségur|Montségur]], [[w:Quéribus|Quéribus]]

===== Waldensians =====
[[w:Peter Waldo|Peter Waldo]] of [[w:Lyon|Lyon]] was a wealthy merchant who gave up his wealth around [[w:1175|1175]] and became a preacher. He founded the [[w:Waldensians|Waldensians]] which became a Christian sect believing that all religious practices should have scriptural basis.

=== Literature  and art ===
At this time [[w:Medieval literature|Medieval literature]] included a variety of cultures that influenced the literature of the High Middle Ages, one of the strongest among them being Christianity.  The connection to Christianity was greatest in [[w:Latin literature|Latin literature]], which influenced the [[w:vernacular|vernacular]] languages in the literary cycle of the [[w:Matter of Rome|Matter of Rome]]. Other literary cycles, or interrelated groups of stories, included the [[w:Matter of France|Matter of France]] (stories about [[w:Charlemagne|Charlemagne]] and his court), the [[w:Acritic songs|Acritic songs]] dealing with the chivalry of Byzantium's frontiersmen, and perhaps the best known cycle, the [[w:Matter of Britain|Matter of Britain]], which featured tales about [[w:King Arthur|King Arthur]], his court, and related stories from [[w:Brittany|Brittany]], [[w:Cornwall|Cornwall]], [[w:Wales|Wales]] and [[w:Ireland|Ireland]]. There was also a quantity of poetry and historical writings which were written during this period, such as ''[[w:Historia Regum Britanniae|Historia Regum Britanniae]]'' by [[w:Geoffrey of Monmouth|Geoffrey of Monmouth]].

Southern France gave birth to [[w:Provençal literature|Provençal literature]], which is best known for [[w:troubador|troubador]]s who sang of [[w:courtly love|courtly love]].  It included elements from Latin literature and Arab-influenced [[w:Spain|Spain]] and [[w:North Africa|North Africa]]. Later its influence spread to several cultures in Western Europe, Portugal, the Minnesänger in Germany, Sicily and Northern Italy, later giving birth to the Italian Dolce Stil Nuovo of Petrarca and Dante, who wrote the most important poem of the time, the ''[[w:Divine Comedy|Divine Comedy]]''.

[[w:Medieval art|Medieval art]] at this age included these major periods or movements:
*[[w:Romanesque art|Romanesque art]] - traditions from the Classical world (not to be confused with [[w:Romanesque architecture|Romanesque architecture]])
*[[w:Gothic art|Gothic art]] - Germanic traditions (not to be confused with [[w:Gothic architecture|Gothic architecture]]).
*[[w:Byzantine art|Byzantine art]] - Byzantine traditions.
*[[w:Christian art|Christian art]]
*[[w:Anglo-Saxon art|Anglo-Saxon art]]
*[[w:Jewish art|Jewish art]] - for example in the areas of specialty such as [[w:Illuminated manuscripts|Illuminated manuscripts]].

=== Technology ===
[[Image:Hugh_specs.jpg|frame|right|Detail of a portrait of Hugh de Provence, painted by Tomasso da Modena in 1352]]
During the 12th and 13th century in Europe there was a radical change in the rate of new inventions, innovations in the ways of managing traditional means of production, and economic growth. In less than a century there were more inventions developed and applied usefully than in the previous thousand years of human history all over the globe. The period saw major [[technology|technological]] advances, including the adoption or invention of [[printing]], [[w:gunpowder|gunpowder]], the [[w:astrolabe|astrolabe]], [[w:spectacles|spectacles]], a better [[w:clock|clock]], and greatly improved [[w:ship|ship]]s.  The latter two advances made possible the dawn of the [[w:Age of Exploration|Age of Exploration]].

[[w:Alfred Crosby|Alfred Crosby]] described some of this technological revolution in ''The Measure of Reality : Quantification in Western Europe, 1250-1600'' and other major historians of technology have also noted it.

* The earliest written record of a [[w:windmill|windmill]] is from [[w:Yorkshire|Yorkshire]], [[w:England|England]],  dated [[w:1185|1185]].
* [[w:Paper|Paper]] manufacture began in [[w:Italy|Italy]] around [[w:1270|1270]].
* The [[w:spinning wheel|spinning wheel]] was brought to [[w:Europe|Europe]] (probably from [[w:India|India]]) in the 13th century.
* The [[w:magnetic|magnetic]] [[w:compass|compass]] aided navigation, first reaching Europe some time in the late 12th century.
* [[w:Eyeglasses|Eyeglasses]] were invented in [[w:Italy|Italy]] in the late [[w:1280|1280]]s.
* The [[w:astrolabe|astrolabe]] returned to Europe via Islamic Spain.
* [[w:Leonardo of Pisa|Leonardo of Pisa]] introduces Arabic numerals to Europe with his book [[w:Liber Abaci|Liber Abaci]] in [[w:1202|1202]].
* The West's oldest known depiction of a stern-mounted [[w:rudder|rudder]] can be found on church carvings dating to around [[w:1180|1180]].

=== The Known World ===

==== Climate and agriculture ====
The [[w:Medieval Warm Period|Medieval Warm Period]], the period from 10th century to about the [[w:14th century|14th century]] in [[w:Europe|Europe]], was a relatively warm and gentle interval ended by the generally colder [[w:Little Ice Age|Little Ice Age]].  Farmers grew [[w:wheat|wheat]] well north into [[w:Scandinavia|Scandinavia]], and [[wine]] grapes in northern [[w:England|England]], although the maximum expansion of vineyards appears to occur within the Little Ice Age period. This protection from [[w:famine|famine]] allowed Europe's population to increase, despite the famine in [[w:1315|1315]] that killed 1.5 million people. This increased population contributed to the founding of new towns and an increase in industrial and economic activity during the period. Food production also increased during this time as new ways of farming were introduced, including the use of a heavier plow, horses instead of oxen, and a three-field system that allowed the cultivation of a greater variety of crops than the earlier two-field system - notably legumes, the growth of which prevented the depletion of important nitrogen from the soil.

==== Trade and commerce ====
In Northern Europe, the [[w:Hanseatic League|Hanseatic League]] was founded in the 12th century, with the foundation of the city of [[w:Lübeck|Lübeck]] in [[w:1158|1158]]–[[w:1159|1159]]. Many northern cities of the Holy Roman Empire became hanseatic cities, including [[w:Amsterdam|Amsterdam]], [[w:Cologne|Cologne]], Bremen, [[w:Hannover|Hannover]] and [[w:Berlin|Berlin]]. Hanseatic cities outside the Holy Roman Empire were, for instance, [[w:Bruges|Bruges]] and the Polish city of [[w:Gdańsk|Gdańsk]] (Danzig). In [[w:Bergen, Norway|Bergen, Norway]] and Novgorod, Russia the league had factories and middlemen. In this period the Germans started colonizing Eastern Europe beyond the Empire, into [[w:Prussia|Prussia]] and [[w:Silesia|Silesia]].

Westerners became more aware of the Far East, works like the presumably documented voyage of [[w:Marco Polo|Marco Polo]] in ''[[w:Il Milione|Il Milione]]'' is an example. Followed by numerous Christian missionaries to the East, such as [[w:William of Rubruck|William of Rubruck]], [[w:Giovanni da Pian del Carpini|Giovanni da Pian del Carpini]], [[w:Andrew of Longjumeau|Andrew of Longjumeau]], [[w:Odoric of Pordenone|Odoric of Pordenone]], [[w:Giovanni de Marignolli|Giovanni de Marignolli]], [[w:Giovanni di Monte Corvino|Giovanni di Monte Corvino]], and other travellers such as [[w:Niccolo Da Conti|Niccolo Da Conti]].

==== Southern Europe ====
[[Image:Europe map 1092.PNG|thumb|Map of Europe in 1092]]
Much of the [[w:Iberian peninsula|Iberian peninsula]], had been occupied by the [[w:Moors|Moors]] after [[w:711|711]], although the northernmost portion was divided between several [[w:Spain in the Middle Ages|Christian states]]. In the 11th century, and again in the thirteenth, a coalition of Christian kings under the leadership of Castile drove the Muslims from central and most of southern Spain. The [[w:County of Portugal|County of Portugal]] ceased to be a vassal of the [[w:Kingdom of Asturias|Kingdom of Asturias]] in 868. Spain started to be defined by the marriage in 1469 of future Queen Isabella and future King Ferdinand, joined together the royal houses of the Kingdom of Castile and the Kingdom of Aragon, but was only recognized in 1479 upon they ascendancy to their thrones.

In [[w:Italy in the Middle Ages|Italy in the Middle Ages]], independent city states grew affluent on the eastern trade. These were in particular the thalassocracies of [[w:Pisa|Pisa]], [[w:Amalfi|Amalfi]], [[w:Genoa|Genoa]] and [[w:Venice|Venice]].

{{NOTE|The kigdom of Portugal as we will see, became of singular importance to the Templars. It is not without significance that King Afonso I of Portugal, the First King of Portugal (1139–1185) was a Templar Brother (13.03.1129). Portugal's existence is in large part due to the Crusaders involvement in the Reconquista, but especially the Templars. Something that was recognized by the crown in its actions in behalf of the Order in its time of need. Portugal also adopted some Templar symbols. All the Portuguese caravels, used in their voyages of exploration were adorned in their sails with the cross of the Order. Even today the Order of Christ is rememberer as a merit reward awarded by the Portuguese government.}}

==== Eastern Europe ====
The High Middle Ages saw the height and decline of the Slavic state of [[w:Kievan Rus'|Kievan Rus']] and the emergence of Poland. Later, the [[w:Mongol|Mongol]] invasion in the 13th century had great impact on [[w:Eastern Europe|Eastern Europe]], as many countries of that region were invaded, pillaged, conquered and vassalized.

During the first half of this period (c.1025-1185) the [[w:Byzantine Empire|Byzantine Empire]] dominated the Balkans south of the Danube, and under the Comnenian emperors there was a revival of prosperity and urbanization; however, the unity of the region came to an end with a successful Bulgarian rebellion in [[w:1185|1185]], and henceforth the region was divided between the Byzantines in [[w:Greece|Greece]], Macedonia and [[w:Thrace|Thrace]], and the [[w:Serbians|Serbians]] and [[w:Bulgarians|Bulgarians]] to the north. The Eastern and Western churches had formally split in the [[w:11th century|11th century]], and despite occasional periods of co-operation during the twelfth century, in 1204 the [[w:Fourth Crusade|Fourth Crusade]] used treachery to capture [[w:Constantinople|Constantinople]]. This severely damaged the Byzantines, and their power was ultimately usurped by the [[w:Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Empire]] in the 15th century.

==== Scandinavia ====
From the mid-tenth to the mid-eleventh centuries, the [[w:Scandinavia|Scandinavia]]n kingdoms were unified and Christianized, resulting in an end to [[w:Viking|Viking]] raids, and greater involvement in European politics. King Cnut of [[w:Denmark|Denmark]] ruled over both England and [[w:Norway|Norway]]. After Cnut’s death in [[w:1035|1035]], England and Norway were lost, and with the defeat of Valdemar II in [[w:1227|1227]], Danish predominance in the region came to an end. Meanwhile, Norway extended its Atlantic possessions, ranging from [[w:Greenland|Greenland]] to the [[w:Isle of Man|Isle of Man]], while [[w:Sweden|Sweden]], under [[w:Birger jarl|Birger jarl]], built up a power base in the [[w:Baltic Sea|Baltic Sea]].

==== France and Germany ====
By the time of the High Middle Ages, the [[w:Carolingian Empire|Carolingian Empire]] had been divided and replaced by separate successor kingdoms called [[w:France in the Middle Ages|France]] and [[w:Germany in the Middle Ages|Germany]], although not with their modern boundaries. Germany was under the banner of the [[w:Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman Empire]], which reached its high-water mark of unity and political power.

==== Britain ====
[[Image:Bayeuxtap1.jpg|right|thumb|250px|[[w:Bayeux Tapestry|Bayeux Tapestry]] depicting the [[w:Battle of Hastings|Battle of Hastings]] during the Norman invasion of England]]
In [[w:Britain in the Middle Ages|Britain]] and [[w:Scotland in the High Middle Ages|Scotland]], the [[w:Norman Conquest|Norman Conquest]] of [[w:1066|1066]] resulted in a kingdom ruled by a [[French language|French]]-speaking nobility. The Normans invaded Ireland in force in [[w:1169|1169]] and soon established themselves throughout most of the country, though their stronghold was the southeast. Likewise, [[w:Scotland|Scotland]] and [[w:Wales|Wales]] were subdued to vassalage at about the same time, though Scotland later regained her independence. The [[w:Exchequer|Exchequer]] was founded in the 12th century under King Henry I, and the first [[w:parliament|parliament]]s were convened. In [[w:1215|1215]], after the loss of [[w:Normandy|Normandy]], King John signed the [[w:Magna Carta|Magna Carta]] into law, which limited the power of English monarchs.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;big&gt;'''Chloroma'''&lt;/big&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Also called '''Granulocytic sarcoma'''.

==Background==
References: &lt;ref name=&quot;Bakst&quot;&gt;PMID 21962486 Bakst 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

*A chloroma is a rare, extramedullary tumor of immature myeloid cells.
*Name &quot;chloroma&quot; coined in 1853 by King because of its green color (&quot;A case of chloroma&quot; Monthly J Med 1853;18:97)
*Green color caused by the presence of myeloperoxidase.
*The term &quot;granulocytic sarcoma&quot; was used by Rappaport to describe tumors of granulocytic origina. However, the term is now used more generally and applied to any tumor related to acute nonlymphocytic leukemia or myelodysplastic syndrome.

==Epidemiology==
References: &lt;ref name=&quot;Bakst&quot;/&gt;
*Most frequently develop in the setting of AML but can occur with CML and MDS. 
*Incidence of 2.5-9.1% in AML.
*Most common locations: skin, soft tissue, bone, periosteum, lymph nodes.

==Treatment==
*'''MSKCC; 2012''' (1990-2010) PMID 21962486 -- &quot;Radiation therapy for chloroma (granulocytic sarcoma).&quot; (Bakst R, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 2012 Apr 1;82(5):1816-22.)
**Retrospective. 38 pts; 22 treated with RT, 16 without. RT median dose 20 Gy at 2 Gy/fx. 
**For RT pts: LC 97%. PFS (for overall disease) 39% and OS 43% at 5 yrs. 4 pts developed chloromas at other sites.
**Conclusion: RT resulted in excellent local control and palliation of symptoms. Propose using 24 Gy in 12 fractions. 

*'''Stanford; 1983''' (1968-1980) PMID 6575971 -- &quot;Extramedullary lesions in non-lymphocytic leukemia: results of radiation therapy.&quot; (Chak LY, Int J Radiat Oncol Biol Phys. 1983 Aug;9(8):1173-6.)
**33 pts, undergoing 54 courses of RT for symptomatic extramedullary involvement of non-lymphocytic leukemia, including 23 cases of granulocytic sarcoma.  A dose response was seen at &gt; 2000 rad and &gt; 3000 rad.
**Conclusion: suggest 3000 rad in 15 fractions.

      <comment>comment on source example syntax</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">See also: [[Haskell/To do]].

== General ==

* Deliberate on what to do about chapter/section/unit/track/book/tome/testament/... terminology.

:I think: each URL is a chapter in this case, it's ok that some are short. There are the main tracks. Each track has sections (e.g. Elementary, Intermediate are ''sections'' in the beginning track)[[User:Backfromquadrangle|Backfromquadrangle]] ([[User talk:Backfromquadrangle|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Backfromquadrangle|contribs]]) 19:07, 14 May 2014 (UTC)

== Formatting ==

* Should example templates be retained, or is it better to use source tags alone?
:Better to use source tags that have syntax highlighting. Indentation is another matter, as overall the Wikibook could use more whitespace to signify things and make it more visually appealing.[[User:Backfromquadrangle|Backfromquadrangle]] ([[User talk:Backfromquadrangle|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Backfromquadrangle|contribs]]) 19:09, 14 May 2014 (UTC)

* Change all ../ links to Haskell/ (for the benefit of the print version).

== Basics ==

* Prelude cheat sheets (adjusting the templates, choosing priorities, actually doing them).

* Working with lists (study feasibility of the comprehension-based approach, attempt a draft. If it fails, consider removing the red link). {{not done}}

== Elementary ==

* Control structures (evaluate renaming).

* Using GHCi effectively (including less obvious things).

== Intermediate ==

* Modules (some reordering, a proper introduction pointing to Haskell in Practice). {{done}}
** Moving &quot;Standalone programs&quot; to the Beginner's Track helps a lot.

* Indentation (some refactoring; consider fusing it with some other page or moving to Elementary Haskell).

* More on datatypes (consider moving the Enumerations section to the Enum class discussion, and the implications of doing so).

* Other data structures (placement feels a bit random ATM. Decide what to do with the catamorphisms).
** It is just silly that we do not say a word here about Data.Map, Data.Array, Data.Sequence...

* Class declarations / Classes and types (fuse both, prune redundancies, refactor for clarity). {{done}}
** Possibly discuss newtype here. {{not done}} - Better done with proper context (as of now, in the chapter on the State monad).

* Applied classes (new page, displaying actual instance implementation while introducing Functors). {{done}}

* Number classes (potential new page - can it stand on its own, or is it better left to a cheat sheet of some sort?) 

* Derived classes (potential new page - without thinking too much it could make sense to factor it away from Class declarations).

== Monads ==

* General structure
** Understanding monads
** Maybe
** List
** do notation
** State
** IO
** MonadPlus
** Writer
** Monad transformers
** Reader (or: using a simple monad to speak of complex stuff)
** Practical monads


* Foreword (potential, but unlikely, new page). {{not done}}

* Understanding monads (remove the foreword and other fluffier passages). {{done}}
** Tone down a bit the allusions to monoids. {{done}}
** Recreate the foreword in a ''very'' brief, meta-book, non-scary version (&quot;monads are abstract, but not otherwordly&quot;, &quot;we will adopt a cut-to-the-chase approach in this introduction, and then sweeten it with a lot examples).
** Add remarks on how the chapters on specific monads are semi-optional (&quot;you will notice that among the following chapters some are about general topics while others are dedicated to specific monads&quot;, &quot;you don't need to go through the specific-monad chapters following the TOC systematically, though it would be sane to spend some time on IO and State due to useful library functions shown in action therein, and also to have at least a glance at the others&quot;). {{not done}} - We introduce important practices through the concrete monad chapters, so they are not really optional (the order doesn't matter much though).
** Incorporate the links from [[Haskell/Advanced monads]].

* Understanding monads subpages about State, Maybe, etc. (try to find a way to integrate them to the main TOC). {{done}}
** ./Reader, ./Writer, perhaps ./Error too.

* State
** Fix and transfer the exercises from the main page to ./State .
** Incorporate those nice pictures to the discussion of the State bind and return.

* IO
** Introduce monadic &quot;control structures&quot; in ./IO {{done}}

* List
** Add one or two lines explaining what guard does a little better in ./List. {{done}}
** Pick a simpler example for the list comprehensions part, possibly one with just two lists and no guard. {{done}}

* do notation (a bit redundant, but probably should be kept anyway). {{done}} - Cleaned up.
** Add a brief foreword alluding to IO actions of Haskell Basics, as a teaser for the chapter on IO. {{done}}

* Advanced monads (merge it completely into the Understanding monads subpages). {{done}}
** Decide what to do with the part on State (thus far, ignored).

* Additive monads (try to find a more natural way to talk about monoids). {{done}}
** Fix small details - the usage of newtype, the exercises formatting, the external links.
** Review the code samples in the comprehensions section.

* Monadic parser combinators (I know parsers are important, but once finished will this really belong here?) {{done}} - Now in limbo.

* Monad transformers (this is a key one. Could it be made more accessible?) {{done}}
** Explain what the Identity monad is at some point. {{done}}
** How to tackle commutativity?

* Value recursion (this seems out of place, move to advanced). {{done}}

* Practical monads (I find this one slightly baffling, but it seems all right to have it here - cf. my proposed chapter on Functors).
** The structure of the lv. 2 headers can stay the way it is now, only the contents would need to be adjusted.
** Parsers: move the WYAS import to the Practical Track (perhaps merging it with the independent ParseExps tutorial there). Retain only a few general considerations (expanding on a bit on the points raised in MonadPlus, following part of that Functional Pearls paper), plus the links and the pointers to the Practical Track of course.
** PMD: show how monads are general enough that even a dummy monad like Identity can be turned into something sensible with a few tweaks.
** Statefulness and concurrency: polish the example, and talk a bit more about concurrency so that it doesn't feel scary.

== Advanced ==

* Arrows (replace with [[Haskell/StephensArrowTutorial]].) {{done}}

* Monoids (de-stubify) {{done}}
:: Expand some (all?) of the examples further.
:: Add exercises and solutions.
:: Could the bits about Foldable and Traversable become a new chapter?

== Libraries Reference ==

* Data.List (switch the focus to the functions not in Prelude).

* Data.Map (maybe include a nod to packages such as hashmap).

* Control.Monad (this is sorely missed).

* bytestring (could be useful).

== General Practices ==

* cabal and hackage (pointers on how to install packages, etc. Not sure whether here is the proper place for it, but important anyway).</text>

===== EMATALA =====
EMATALA is the Federal Emergency Medical Treatment and Labor Act, also known as COBRA.  EMATALA is a statute which governs when and how a patient must be:
# examined and offered treatment or
# transferred from one hospital to another when he is in an unstable medical condition.

EMTALA applies only to &quot;participating hospitals&quot; under Medicare i.e., to hospitals which have entered into &quot;provider agreements&quot; under which they will accept payment from the Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) under the Medicare program for services provided to beneficiaries of that program.  In practical terms, this means that it applies to virtually all hospitals in the U.S., with the exception of the Shriners' Hospital for Crippled Children and many military hospitals.  Its provisions apply to all patients, and not just to Medicare patients.

;When is a patient considered stabalized?
# (for emergency medical conditions) that no material deterioration of the patient's condition is likely to result from the transfer or is likely to occur during the transfer;
# (for patients in active labor) the infant and the placenta have been delivered.

The partial pressure of an ideal gas in a mixture is equal to the pressure it would exert if it occupied the same volume alone at the same temperature. This is because ideal gas molecules are so far apart that they don't interfere with each other at all. Actual real-world gases come very close to this ideal.

A consequence of this is that the total pressure of a mixture of ideal gases is equal to the sum of the partial pressures of the individual gases in the mixture as stated by Dalton's law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dbhs.wvusd.k12.ca.us/webdocs/GasLaw/Gas-Dalton.html Dalton's Law of Partial Pressures]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, given an ideal gas mixture of nitrogen (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and  ammonia (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;):

:&lt;math&gt;P = P_{{\mathrm{N}}_2} + P_{{\mathrm{H}}_2} + P_{{\mathrm{NH}}_3}&lt;/math&gt;

I started working on the EMATALA section, it could be smoother.  I am really new to how this works so feel free to edit my stuff to sound better or be formatted better.

With a network of systems developed around Earth and the Moon, the next step is to extend the network out to Mars and the Main Asteroid Belt. A similar process of setting up seed factories and adding facilities is followed as before.

{{TOC right}}

===System Concept===

The system concept has the following main parts:

* Use free flying electric thruster powered vehicles to reach new locations that have useful resources.
* Set up seed factories in each location to build up industrial capacity, including more ships and seed factories for the next location.
* Produce fuel, life support supplies, and habitats at each location so they can be occupied permanently.
* Build more Skyhooks to provide fast velocity changes, but get the benefit of electric propulsion efficiency.


===High Earth Orbit Skyhook===

In a previous step we defined a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) Skyhook with a tip velocity of 2400 m/s.  Since it's orbit velocity is 7474 m/s, at the top of it's rotation it could release a cargo at a total of 9,874 m/s. At an altitude of 1,226 km, or a radius of 7,604 km from the Earth's center, with a Standard gravitational parameter of 398.6 x 10^12, we get an escape velocity of 10,239 m/s.  Thus our LEO Skyhook is only 365 m/s short of reaching escape velocity.  The LEO Skyhook can thus deliver cargo to an elliptical transfer orbit with a semi-major axis of the orbit of 54,278 km, and thus a high point of 100,952 km.

A circular orbit at that altitude has a velocity of 1,987 m/s, and the transfer orbit arrives at 743 m/s.  The difference is 1,244 m/s.  A tip velocity of 1,500 m/s or more would allow injection to Mars and Main Asteroid Belt transfer orbits, and any closer transfer orbits to the Moon and low inclination Near Earth Asteroids.  A High Earth Orbit (HEO) Skyhook can therefore serve as a launch platform to any desired inner Solar System destination orbit by selecting the radius, and thus velocity, and the time, which gives the direction, of release.  This location is outside of the Earth's radiation belts, but it is also unprotected by the Earth's magnetosphere from solar and cosmic radiation.  So human habitats will need radiation shielding.  Such a high orbit is relatively easy to reach from the Moon or NEO's, so bulk matter for shielding will likely be brought from one of those sources.

The construction sequence would start with fetching Near Earth Orbit asteroid material and placing it in High orbit, and delivering equipment from Earth.  Once a processing plant, factory, and habitat are set up, carbon from carbonaceous asteroids is used to make carbon fiber for the Skyhook.  Initial velocity capacity would not be as high, and so more vehicle propulsion would be needed, but as the Skyhook grows, it can reach a wider range of orbits.  Momentum changes are not free, so a substantial power supply and thruster set will be needed at the Skyhook.  But since those do not have to be carried along with the vehicles who are getting their orbit changed, the propulsion can be as large and heavy as needed.


===Inclination Stations===

Near Earth Objects have a limited range of Solar orbit velocities in the ecliptic plane by definition.  They also have a range of orbit inclinations, which results in a velocity component when crossing the ecliptic.  The '''Inclination Station''' is a second Skyhook located in the vicinity of Earth, such as at one of the Lunar Lagrange points, and oriented perpendicular to the ecliptic plane.  Therefore it can deliver cargo to and from inclined orbits to reach NEOs with less fuel and mission time, while the first HEO Skyhook operates in the ecliptic plane to reach Mars and the main Asteroid Belt.  Additionally, flybys of planets can be used to further change orbit inclinations and reach other groups of asteroids.  The Station itself will react to the average of cargo orbit changes.  It will therefore need some propulsion to maintain position, but that will use less fuel than each vehicle doing it's own orbit maneuvers separately.

Given sufficient traffic, it may make sense to have other Inclination Stations set up at different tilts to generate different combinations of ecliptic plane and inclination velocity changes. The velocity difference between the various high orbit Skyhooks will be very low, and release from less than their full radius will be sufficient to get between them.  Since trip times between them will be short, the first one can have the bulk of the habitat and production facilities.  The later ones can serve mostly as transit hubs, and not be as built up.


===Transfer Habitats===

Transfer orbits to NEOs or Mars will require trip times measured in months.  For human passengers there is the risk of exposure to radiation, and also a need for food and life support.  If you expect to make multiple trips, it makes sense to have habitats permanently in transfer orbits to those destinations.  Then the mass of the shielding and greenhouses does not matter that much, as they are not moving once set up.  The passengers would use a small vehicle between the HEO Skyhook and the Transfer Habitat when it passes near Earth, then ride in the habitat until it is near the destination, and then again use a small vehicle for arrival.  Since only the passengers and cargo need to change velocity  the total mass transferred per mission is greatly reduced.

All objects in the Solar System are in motion relative to each other, and transfer orbits only line up properly when, for example, the Earth and Mars are in the right relative positions.  Thus a network of multiple Transfer Habitats in different orbits will be needed to deliver passengers and cargo to the right destinations at the right time.  The source materials to build the Habitats would come mostly from whichever asteroids are already in the closest orbits.  Depending on size, the NEO would be mined for materials, or if small, moved entire to the desired transfer orbit.

Optionally a transfer habitat would have a Skyhook attached to it to enable added delta-V for arriving or departing vehicles.  This also provides an artificial gravity environment for the habitat.  If that is not provided, then part of the habitat would be rotating to create artificial gravity.  Whether to use a Skyhook or not will take more detailed analysis of the complete transportation network.

When the habitats are not ferrying passengers to Mars, they are exploiting '''Near Habitat Asteroids'''. Just like there is a set of asteroids whose orbits are &quot;Near Earth&quot;, and so easy to reach for mining purposes, there will be a different set which are close to any given Transfer Habitat orbit. So you can busy yourself producing fuel, setting up manufacturing, and eventually have a space city there, just one that happens to get close to Mars periodically. When it does, you drop off humans and accumulated hardware at Phobos, where you are also building up facilities, and thence onward to Mars itself. 

====Orbit Characteristics====

Since we are starting from Earth, we want the Habitat to pass by Earth on a regular basis.  If we set the orbit period to be 1.50 years, it will do so every second orbit.  The orbit will be an ellipse, and the long axis will be 2.62 AU.  If the near point of the orbit is at Earth (1.00 AU), then the far point will be 1.62 AU, which is slightly past the average distance of Mars (1.52 AU).  A velocity change of 3,340 m/s beyond Earth orbit is required to reach this orbit. This comes from a combination of the HEO Skyhook, Lunar gravity assist, propulsion on the transfer vehicle carrying crew and cargo between points, and possibly a Skyhook at the Transfer Habitat.  The Habitat will align with Mars once every 7.5 years, and a velocity change of 4,440 m/s is needed at that end to match orbit.  Again this would use a combination of propulsion, including Mars gravity assist. On early trips the transfer vehicle would need to do more work, but later a Mars orbit Skyhook can take up more of the velocity changes.

Since once per 7.5 years is not very often, you can place multiple habitats in a given orbit track, and use multiple orbit tracks spaced equally around the Earth's orbit at their near points.  This will give more frequent opportunities to go back and forth from Earth to Mars. For 80% of their orbit cycle the habitats would would be doing mining and construction around the habitat, accessing asteroids in nearby orbits.  The other 20% of the time they would also be carrying passengers and cargo for the trips to and from Mars, when they happen to line up.  There may be a better arrangement of orbits and habitats to increase the fraction of time they can be used as a ferry service.

      <comment>/* Some Options to Go For When Seeking Medical Help in the Late Hours */ new section</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== The Advantages of After Hours Clinics ==

Medical practices have a huge role to play in treating their patients, even when the practice closes for the day. Injuries and illnesses can happen any time, and people may require a Perth after hours doctor. Patients cannot wait for days, let alone months, just to get a checkup; what they need is to go to a GP after hours clinic.

Sometimes there are instances when private practice can offer better and faster health care services as compared to the overcrowded hospital ER, which are commonly known to charge higher rates. The same medical treatment is given to people who are ill during those late hours. Being able to give them that same care means that patients are important to every after hours GP Perth/Northbridge doctor, and that says a lot! 

While they trust professionals to help them get better, some patients trust their own physicians more. In fact, a survey of patients have found that patient satisfaction with [http://northbridgemedical.com.au/ after hours GP] care was higher for the people who sought help from their family physician than those who went to a walk-in clinic, ER, or made use of a telephone consultation service. 

Looking for GP after hours clinic may be a bit challenging since a lot of them close by late afternoon. Also, not many after hours GP are available in various locations, and that is why people resort to going to emergency departments when seeking urgent care in the late hours. Luckily, there are some prominent after hours GP clinics in Western Australia. 

After hours GP Perth/Northbridge normally are open until five in the afternoon or seven in the evening. Others, such as Northbridge Medical Center, offer after hours GP health care services to patients from five thirty in the afternoon ‘til nine in the evening, from Mondays to Fridays. On weekends, they open from eight in the morning until nine in the evening. If that is not convenient enough for patients, this Northbridge after hours GP has reduced waiting hours and timely appointments. 

Northbridge after hours GP proffers the same services as those normal hours medical centers. Practitioners prescribe patients with medications, give injections, do stitching and splinting, as well as advise receiving IV fluids. They even do strep tests, blood tests, x-rays, and urine tests at the center. 

Finally, what is great about after hours GP Perth/Northbridge clinics like Northbridge Medical is that they treat young, adult, and old patients. Practitioners are trained and highly experienced in treating different kinds of sick people and in fields of urgent and emergency care. Clearly, it is the safest and most suitable facility to depend on when suffering from an illness or injury in the late hours.

== Some Options to Go For When Seeking Medical Help in the Late Hours ==

Basically, doctors work almost twenty four hours a day, but sometimes it seems that you find it hard to contact ones that work after hours. You will need a bit of luck to look for a general practitioner at six in the evening or later than that. If ever you do find a GP that late, the waiting hours are usually longer and the fees are higher. When you seek immediate medical attention, you have to call an ambulance and head to the emergency department. Yet, when your medical problem is less complicated than the latter, contacting a doctor during late hours may be a little tricky. 

At this point, not only are you distressed with the fact that you have recently been injured or dealing with a condition, but you also become stressed out that no doctor may be available to help you relieve you of your condition. So, how do you get hold of a doctor when you are suffering at such an inappropriate or inconvenient time? Read on to find out.

One option is to seek medical assistance from a family member or a good friend who is a doctor. However, it is not all the time that they will be there to help you, as they too have other priorities to attend to, particularly during the wee hours of the night. So, only contact them when you really need to. 

All general practitioners have an obligation to provide medical care after hours. There are instances when they are on-call and cannot be in two places at the same time. This then calls for making use of a locum service, a kind of medical assistance that is led by a locum doctor who plays the role of the main doctor in the event of his absence. 

Locum services offerprimary care that allow house calls, even after hours. Like majority of afterhours assistances, it is also a mixed billing service and has waiting hours. The difference between the two is that you only have to wait in your own home for the locum doctor to drop by and check on you. This, in particular, is valuable if you are feeling awfully under the weather, or if you are stuck at home taking care of your kids. 

Locum assistances will phone your regular doctor in order for them to be aware what your condition is. Even if you are not sure about the gravity of your illness, you can always rely on a locum doctor to aid you in such times. If your state becomes worse, it is best to not wait for the locum doctor and just call an ambulance as quickly as possible.

If you are unable to get in touch with any of the mentioned professionals, you may have to go to a GPafter hours clinic.

A GPafter hours clinic, such as Northbridge Medical Centre in Australia, is open until the late hours. While normally, GP clinics are open from 9:00am to 5:00pm, Northbridge Medical Centre is also open from 5:30pm to 9:00pm, Mondays to Fridays, and 8:00am to 9:00pm, Saturdays and Sundays. Clearly, this medical institution has better service hours than other after hours GP Perth/Northbridge. 

Northbridge [http://northbridgemedical.com.au/ after hours GP] like Northbridge Medical Centre are a great solution to any primary care medical concerns such as colds, flu, sprains, grazes and cuts, and various illnesses common in children. The system as to how clinics entertain and treat patients varies, but the most common thing that happens is you, the patient, attend and wait until your name is called. The wait will be a little longer than a regular doctor’s appointment, but not longer than waiting at the hospital emergency department. 

In essence, there are important cases when you will need a Northbridge or Perth after hours doctor, and you can be sure that they deliver the same fast and successful services as any regular doctor working during the day.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Traditional Categories==
Statements that fall within the traditional categories of hearsay are presumptively admissible. They can nevertheless be challenged under the principles of necessity and reliability.
&lt;ref&gt;
R v Starr [2000] [http://canlii.ca/t/525l 2 SCR 144] &lt;br&gt;
R v Mapara 2005 SCC 23 [http://canlii.ca/t/1k7h2]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditional categories of exceptions consist of the following:
# Where the statement is an '''admission by an accused person'''
# When the statement is made '''against the declarator's interest'''
# When it is made in the course of the '''declarator's duty'''
# When the statement is part of a public or '''governmental document'''
# '''Dying declaration'''
# Statements made when the declarator was in a state of shock or surprise ('''Res Gestae''')
# Statements describing the '''declarator's physical or psychological condition'''
# '''Sworn testimony''' from a previous hearing
# '''Past recollection recorded'''
# Statement conveys '''&quot;state of mind&quot;'''
# Statement conveys '''&quot;present intentions&quot;'''
# '''Statutory exceptions'''
# Statement is part of the '''narrative''' of the evidence


{{Reflist|2}}
==Admissions of the Accused==
Generally, admission include “any statement made by a declarant and tendered as evidence at trial by the opposing party.”&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Violette, [2008]  B.C.J. No. 2781(S.C.) at 63&lt;/ref&gt;

Any admission by an accused is admissible as provided that its probative value outweighs its prejudicial effect. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Terry, [1996] S.C.J. No. 62 at 28&lt;/ref&gt;

Admission made by the accused as well as statements adopted by the accused in an intercepted communication is admissible as a hearsay exception.&lt;ref&gt;R v Violette  [2008]  B.C.J. No. 2781(S.C.) at 65&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

==Statement made against the declarator's interest==

==Adoptive Admissions==

A categorical exception to the hearsay rule is where the accused adopts a hearsay statement by words, conduct, action or demeanor.&lt;ref&gt;R v Stein, [1928] SCR 553 at 558 (“It is only when the accused by &quot;word or conduct, action or demeanour&quot; has accepted what they contain, and to the extent that he does so, that statements made by other persons in his presence have any evidentiary value …”)&lt;/ref&gt;

The exception involves two elements:&lt;ref&gt;R v Dimetro (1945), 85 CCC 135 at para 4 (Ont CA)&lt;/ref&gt;
# whether there is “evidence from which the Court could reasonably infer that the accused by their behaviour acknowledged their guilt?” &lt;ref&gt; See also R v Warner 1994 CanLII 842 (ON CA), (1994), 21 O.R. (3d) 136 at 144-145(Ont CA)&lt;/ref&gt;
# whether such an inference should be drawn? 

The inference should only be drawn where it is a sufficient “foundation” to so as to reasonably infer that the accused intended to accept “the statement as to make it in whole or in part his own”
&lt;ref&gt;R v Harrison, [1946] 3 DLR 690, 62 BCR 420 at 430 (BCCA)&lt;/reF&gt; 

A speculative interference based on ambiguous conduct is not sufficient to fit the exception. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Briscoe, [http://canlii.ca/t/fqfhw 2012 ABQB 158], a nod in response to an utterance of “I helped with [a murder]”&lt;/ref&gt;

A foundation requires at a minimum that:&lt;ref&gt;R v Tanasichuk, 2007 NBCA 76 at para 110&lt;/ref&gt;:
#  the statement must have been made in the accused’s presence, in circumstances such that the accused would be expected to respond;
#  the accused’s failure to respond could reasonably lead to the inference that, by his silence, the accused adopted the statement; and
# the probative value of the evidence outweighs its prejudicial effect.

Mere presence of the accused at the time of the statement is not sufficient to prove an adoption of the statement.&lt;ref&gt;R v Dubois, (1986), 27 CCC (3d) 325 at 341-342 (Ont CA)&lt;/ref&gt;

Instructions to the jury on the issue of whether the accused agreed to the statement should include informing the jury the following:&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Tanasichuk, [http://canlii.ca/t/1tg0f 2007 NBCA 76] (CanLII)
&lt;/ref&gt;
# whether the accused, by his conduct, adopted the statements made in his presence and only to the extent that they were adopted should the jury accept them as true;
# consider all of the circumstances under which the statement was made
# “if in their view the accused did not assent [...] to the correctness of the statements made in his presence, these statements would have no evidentiary value [...] and should be entirely disregarded”

{{Reflist|2}}

==Past Recollection Recorded==
Where a witness has testified that he cannot recall core details of a statements made but that she told the truth whenever speaking to them.  The Court may admit the notes or document if it is satisfied that they meet the Wigmore criteria:
&lt;ref&gt;
adopted in R. v. Fliss 2002 SCC 16 at 244 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2002/2002scc16/2002scc16.html#par63]&lt;br&gt;
see also: R. v. Pilarinos, [2002] B.C.J. No. 1153 (BCSC) at paras. 7 – 12 [http://canlii.ca/t/5kdt#par7] &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Meddoui, 1990 CanLII 2592 (AB CA)[http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abca/doc/1990/1990canlii2592/1990canlii2592.html]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Wilks, 2005 MBCA 99 [http://www.canlii.org/en/mb/mbca/doc/2005/2005mbca99/2005mbca99.html]&lt;br&gt;
c.f. [[Canadian_Criminal_Evidence/Testimonial_evidence#Present_Memory_Revived|present memory revived]]
&lt;/ref&gt;
:
#the past recollection must have been recorded in some reliable way;
#at the time, it must have been sufficiently fresh and vivid to be probably accurate;
#the witness must be able now to assert that the record accurately represented his knowledge and recollection at the time.  The usual phrase requires the witness to affirm that he “knew it to be true at the time”; and
#the original record itself must be used, if it is procurable.

In practice counsel should establish:&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. McCarroll, [http://canlii.ca/t/217d7 2008 ONCA 715] - sets out four key critera(CanLII)&lt;/ref&gt;
:1) that the witnesses memory is exhausted and cannot answer the question;
:2) that a record was made by the witness or on behalf of the witness;
:3) the record was made near the time that the information was learned;
:4) the information was fresh in their mind at the time;
:5) the information was recorded from what they knew at the time and was done as accurately as possible.

Counsel can then asks the record to be put in as an exhibit.

An example would be where asking a witness to recall a licence plate number that they observed and wrote down in a statement. This statement or note would have been made at a time when the information was fresh in their mind and they made an effort to be accurate. 

The witness will be asked about whether they recall the licence plate number. Often they will not recall the number by heart, this will prompt a request to introduce past recollection recorded. Counsel should go through questions establishing the lack of memory; the existance of the record; the circumstances of its creation; and the accuracy of its contents.

{{Reflist|2}}

==State of mind==

A statement of a declarant can be adduced into evidence as a hearsay exception where it explicitly declares the state of mind of the declarant. 
&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Candir, 2009 ONCA 915, at para. 56 [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2009/2009onca915/2009onca915.html#para56]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. P.(R.), (1990), 58 C.C.C. (3d) 334 (Ont. H.C.J.) para. 16&lt;/ref&gt;
Where the declaration can infer the state of mind, it is also admissible but not as a hearsay exception, but rather as circumstantial evidence inferring the state of mind.&lt;ref&gt;supra.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

== Spontaneous utterances / res gestae == 
Spontaneous or excited utterances are a class of exception to the hearsay rule. An utterance falls in this category where the evidence can characterize it as being a spontaneous exclamation made without premeditation or artifice and before the speaker had time to concoct something.&lt;ref&gt;
See R. v. Schwartz (1978) NSR (2d) 335 at para. 15&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Magloir 2003 NSCA 74&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Slugoski, [1985] BCJ 1835&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Khan, (1988), 42 C.C.C. (3d) 197 at p. 207, aff'd on other grounds 1990 CanLII 77 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 531&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been characterized as words that are contemporanous with some action. Statements are admitted at times as &quot;words brigaded to action&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Ly (1996), 193 A.R. 149; [1996] A.J. No. 1089 (C.A.) at para. 3&lt;/ref&gt;

Requirements to the exception usually include:&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Hamilton, 2011 NSSC 305 at para. 20&lt;/ref&gt;
# utterance made soon after underlying offence
# speaker was in state of upset or trauma
# enough probative value to outweigh any prejudice

The utterance does not need to be strictly contemporaneous &quot;so long as the stress or pressure created by it is ongoing&quot;.&lt;Ref&gt;See R. v. Khan, (1988), 42 C.C.C. (3d) 197 at p. 207, aff'd on other grounds 1990 CanLII 77 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 531 &lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

==Co-Conspirators==
The co-conspirators' exception to hearsay permits the admission of out-of-court statements made by a co-conspirator.

The Crown must prove:
# that there was a conspiracy
# that the accused was a member of the conspiracy
# the utterance was in furtherance of the conspiracy.
&lt;ref&gt;See R. v. Carter, [http://canlii.ca/t/1z1c7 1982 CanLII 35] (SCC), [1982] 1 S.C.R. 938
R. v. Mapara, [http://canlii.ca/t/1k7h2 2005 SCC 23] (CanLII), [2005] 1 SCR 358 at para. 8 (“Statements made by a person engaged in an unlawful conspiracy are receivable as admissions as against all those acting in concert if the declarations were made while the conspiracy was ongoing and were made towards the accomplishment of the common object” &lt;/ref&gt;

This exception is not limited or obsolete despite the overlap with the principled approach.&lt;ref&gt;
Mapara
&lt;/ref&gt;

The availability of the co-conspirator is not determinative of whether the exception applies.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. N.Y., [http://canlii.ca/t/ftlsv 2012 ONCA 745] (CanLII)
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dying declaration==

==Declarator's Physical or Psychological Condition==

==Sworn testimony from Previous Hearing==

==Present and Future Intentions==
Similar to state of mind exception, it is permissible to admit statements of a witnesses' future intentions.&lt;ref&gt; Chang 2003 173 CCC 3d 397&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Course of the Declarator's Duty==

==Public or Governmental Document==

See [[Canadian Criminal Evidence/Documentary_evidence#Admissibility_of_Specific_Types_of_Documents]]

==Business Records==
A record is admissible as hearsay where it is a business record. A business record is a record that is required to kept accurate as part of the normal course of business. The document can be admitted under the Canada Evidence Act or common law.

See [[Canadian Criminal Evidence/Documentary_evidence#Business_Records]] -- R v Wilcox [http://canlii.ca/t/4v77 2001 NSCA 45]

==Documents in Possession==
Documents that are found to be in actual or constructive possession of the accused may be admitted as hearsay. The documents can be used to show knowledge, participation, or state of mind. &lt;ref&gt;See R v Wood [http://canlii.ca/t/4v70#par30 2001 NSCA 38 at 30]&lt;/ref&gt;

Documents in possession are admissible for the truth of its contents where the accused has shown “recognition, adoption or acting upon the documents“&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. McCullough, 2001 SKQB 449&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}
==Narrative==
Strictly speaking, narrative is not a traditional hearsay exception, and is not fully hearsay at all since it is not being proffered for the truth of its contents.

It is admissible on the basis that it provides context and greater understanding to the trier of fact of the details of the investigation. It is often useful in sexual assault cases in order to determine credibility.
 
See R v Assoun, [http://canlii.ca/t/1n38p 2006 NSCA 47]

In the context of recorded phone calls, the “nature of the business” of the calls is not hearsay.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Williams, [2009] B.C.J. No. 1518&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}
==Preliminary Inquiry / Trial evidence ==
Under s. 715 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec715], evidence from either a previous trial or preliminary inquiry may be admitted into evidence where the witness refuses to testify, is dead, is physically or mentally ill, or is out of the country.&lt;ref&gt;See also R. v. Potvin, [1989] 1 SCR 525&lt;/ref&gt;

It must be proven that the evidence was taken in front of the accused. If so, it is admissible unless the accused didn't have full opportunity to cross examine.&lt;Ref&gt;see s. 715&lt;/ref&gt; There is an exception to this rule under s.715(2.1), where the accused was excused under s. 537(1)(j.1)

See R v Alcantara, 2012 ABQB 219&lt;ref&gt;prelim evidence was admitted&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}
==Video Statement of Under 18 Year Old==
Witnesses under the age of 18 who give video-taped statements shortly after the alleged incident may have their statements put in for the truth of their contents under s. 715.1 where the witness is able to adopt the statement in court. Once a video statement is admitted under s.715.1, the absence of the ability to cross-examine the witness only goes to the weight of the evidence and cannot be used to argue its admissibility.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. R.G.B., 2012 MBCA 5 at 42&lt;/reF&gt;

Section 715.1 states:
{{Quotation|
'''Evidence of victim or witness under 18'''&lt;br&gt;
715.1 (1) In any proceeding against an accused in which a victim or other witness was under the age of eighteen years at the time the offence is alleged to have been committed, a video recording made within a reasonable time after the alleged offence, in which the victim or witness describes the acts complained of, is admissible in evidence if the victim or witness, while testifying, adopts the contents of the video recording, unless the presiding judge or justice is of the opinion that admission of the video recording in evidence would interfere with the proper administration of justice.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Order prohibiting use'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) The presiding judge or justice may prohibit any other use of a video recording referred to in subsection (1).
&lt;P&gt;

#The form of questions used by any other person appearing in the videotaped statement;
#any interest of anyone participating in the making of the statement;
#the quality of the video and audio reproduction;
#the presence or absence of inadmissible evidence in the statement;
#the ability to eliminate inappropriate material by editing the tape;
#whether other out‑of‑court statements by the complainant have been entered;
#whether any visual information in the statement might tend to prejudice the accused (for example, unrelated injuries visible on the victim);
#whether the prosecution has been allowed to use any other method to facilitate the giving of evidence by the complainant;
#whether the trial is one by judge alone or by a jury; and
#the amount of time which has passed since the making of the tape and the present ability of the witness to effectively relate to the events described.

==Voluminous Document Exception==
An exception to hearsay is the &quot;voluminous document exception&quot; first outlined by Wigmore.

According to Wigmore, the exception applies where:&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Agyei, [2007] O.J. No. 3914 at para 26&lt;/ref&gt;
#there are a very large number of detailed business records that would be impractical to present to the court;
#a competent witness has examined the documents and summarized them; and 
# the documents have been made available to the other side.

Where the criteria are met, the summary can be admitted without putting in the original records as evidence.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Lee, [http://canlii.ca/t/2fk72 2011 NSPC 5] (CanLII) at 20
&lt;/ref&gt;
The exception is not applicable where the work product &quot;involve[s] interpretations that may be the subject of legitimate debate&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
Lee at 19-20&lt;br&gt;
R. v. George, [1993] A.J. No. 798 (Alta. P.C.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">
==General Principles==
The principled approach is founded on the premise that if a statement is '''necessary''' to a hearing&lt;ref&gt;R v Khan, at para. 29&lt;/ref&gt;, and it is '''reliable'''&lt;ref&gt;R v Khan, at para 30&lt;/ref&gt;, it should be admitted even if it is hearsay.

When considering a prior inconsistent statment the court must begin by presuming that the statment is inadmissible for the truth of its contents unless it has been established there is sufficient indicia of trustworthiness.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Blackman, [http://canlii.ca/t/1z1bv 2008 SCC 37]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Before hearsay evidence can be admissible under the principled exception it must be relevant&lt;Ref&gt;R v Underwood 2002 ABCA 310 at para 19&lt;/ref&gt; and has been determined whether it already fits in a traditional exception.&lt;ref&gt;R v Starr, 2000 SCC 40 at para. 212-214&lt;/ref&gt;

Even when the hearsay evidence is reliable and necessary, there is still a discretionary ability to exclude the evidence where the prejudicial effect outweighs the probative value.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Smith at para 45&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Procedure==
R. v. Woodard, [http://canlii.ca/t/23cvr 2009 MBCA 42] summarized procedure for the admission of evidence under the principled approach to hearsay as follows at 46: 
{{quotation| 
(1)        The first matter to determine before embarking on a hearsay admissibility inquiry is whether the proposed evidence is hearsay. An out-of-court statement will be hearsay when: (1) it is adduced to prove the truth of its contents (the purpose); and (2) there is limited or no opportunity for a contemporaneous cross-examination of the declarant (the concern) (see Khelawon, at paras. 56-58).&lt;P&gt;
 
(2)        Once the proposed evidence is identified as hearsay, it is presumptively inadmissible, unless it falls under a traditional common law exception to the hearsay rule or is admitted under the principled approach to the hearsay rule (see Khelawon, at paras. 56, 59, and Couture, at para. 78).
 &lt;P&gt;
(3)        Whether the hearsay meets the necessity and threshold reliability criteria under the principled approach will be determined on a voir dire. The onus is on the person who seeks to adduce the evidence to establish these criteria on a balance of probabilities (see Khelawon, at para. 47).
 &lt;P&gt;
(4)        If the proponent of the evidence cannot meet the twin criteria of necessity and reliability, the general exclusionary rule prevails. The trial judge's function (as gatekeeper) is to guard against the admission of hearsay evidence which is unnecessary in the context of the issue to be decided, or the reliability of which is neither readily apparent from the trustworthiness of its contents, nor capable of being meaningfully tested by the ultimate trier of fact (see Khelawon, at paras. 2-3).
 &lt;P&gt;
(5)        The criterion of necessity is founded on society's interest in getting at the truth and is intended to ensure that the evidence presented to the court be in the best available form, usually by calling the maker of the statement as a witness. If that is not possible, it may be that if the evidence is to be adduced at all, it can only be presented in its hearsay form (see Khelawon, at para. 49, and Couture, at para. 79).
 &lt;P&gt;
(6)        The criterion of threshold reliability is about ensuring the integrity of the trial process and is usually met: (1) by showing that sufficient trust can be put in the truth and accuracy of the statements because of the way in which they came about; or (2) by showing that, in the circumstances, the ultimate trier of fact will be in a position to sufficiently assess their worth. The two ways of demonstrating threshold reliability are not mutually exclusive. In cases where the declarant is available to be cross-examined, the focus will necessarily be on the latter way (see Khelawon, at paras. 49, 61-63, Couture, at para. 80, Devine, at para. 23, and Blackman, at para. 35).
 &lt;P&gt;
(7)        A distinction must be made between &quot;ultimate reliability&quot; and &quot;threshold reliability.&quot; Only the latter is inquired into on the admissibility voir dire. The failure to respect this distinction would not only result in the undue prolongation of admissibility hearings, it would distort the fact-finding process. Whether the evidence is relied upon to decide the issues in the case is a matter reserved for the ultimate trier of fact to decide in the context of the entirety of the evidence (see Khelawon, at paras. 3, 50).
 &lt;P&gt;
(8)        Relevant factors to be considered cannot invariably be categorized as relating either to threshold or ultimate reliability. Rather, the relevance of any particular factor will depend on the particular dangers arising from the hearsay nature of the statement and the available means, if any, of overcoming them (see Khelawon, at para. 55).
 &lt;P&gt;
(9)        Although there are no hard and fast rules about the manner of conducting the hearsay admissibility inquiry, there are good reasons to look first at whether there are adequate substitutes that give the trier of fact a sufficient basis to assess the statement's truth and accuracy. Whenever the threshold reliability requirement is met on this basis, there is no need to inquire further into the likely truth of the statement (see Couture, at paras. 87-88).
 &lt;P&gt;
(10)      Even if the two criteria are met, the trial judge has the discretion to exclude hearsay evidence where its probative value is outweighed by its prejudicial effect (see Khelawon, at para. 49).

}}

A KGB application is typically one made by the Crown, but may also be made by the defence. The defence is permitted to apply to put a previous inconsistent statement into evidence for the truth of its contents.&lt;REf&gt;
See R. v. Brisco, [2007] A.J. No. 208 and R. v. Eisenhauer, [1998] S.C.C.A. No. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

Before a KGB application can be undertaken the court must first be satisfied on a threshold that the prior inconsistent statement is the sole evidence of the witness&lt;ReF&gt;R v KGB at para. 74&lt;/ref&gt; and that the statement is consistent with the evidence in court.


{{reflist|2}}

==Necessary==
Necessity must be in relation to a particular goal. The court should consider whether that goal can be achieved by other evidence that would otherwise be more reliable.&lt;ref&gt;see eg. R. v. Abel, [http://canlii.ca/t/fq2cl 2011 NLTD 173] at 117&lt;/ref&gt; If the exists other avenues of proving the fact sought then the exception will not apply.

In the context of a recanting witness, necessity concerns the unavailability of the statment and not the witness.&lt;Ref&gt;See R. v. Devine, [http://canlii.ca/t/1xdt6 2008 SCC 36] at para 16&lt;br&gt;
R. v. U.(F.J.), [http://canlii.ca/t/1frhp 1995 CanLII 74] (SCC), [1995] 3 S.C.R. 764&lt;br&gt; 
see also R. v. De Elespp [2002] A.J. No. 6702 at para 37 and 108&lt;Br&gt; 
R v.  Rombough [2006] A.J. No 1768 at para. 36 &lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Biscette [1995] A.J. No. 557 &lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Clarke (Ont. Ct. (Gen. Div.)) [1991] O.J. No. 997 at para F
&lt;/ref&gt;
It generally always made out when there is a recantation.&lt;Ref&gt;R v U(FJ) &lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}

===Dead witnesses===
Death of the witness is typically sufficient to establish necessity so long as the witness was the only source of information contained within the statement.&lt;ref&gt;
e.g. R v Taylor, 2012 ONCA 809 &lt;/ref&gt;

===Missing witnesses===

===Witness refuses to testify===
A witness who refuses to testify when all efforts to obtain that testimony have been taken to no avail will typically satisfy the requirement of necessity.
&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Lavery, [1995] B.C.J. No.2713 (S.C.), at para. 9; &lt;br&gt;
R. v. C.C.B., [1999] S.J. No. 672 (P.C.), at paras. 5 - 9, and 23 - 31&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Goodstoney, 2005 ABQB 128&lt;br&gt;
R v Gardipy, [http://canlii.ca/t/frkpn 2012 SKCA 58] at 19&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; There is no onus on the Crown to prove why the complainant failed to testify.&lt;ref&gt;supra&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}

===Child witnesses===
Where the experience testifying may be so traumatic at to prevent a chlid from testifying, the requirement of necessity will be satisfied.&lt;reF&gt; R. v. Rockey, [1996] 3 SCR 829 at 846;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/reF&gt;

While in some limited cases the court may have the child testify within the voir dire to support the reliability of the statment. More often, the statement will be admitted without oral evidence and the lack of cross examination will go to the weight of the prior statement.&lt;ref&gt;Sopinka, The Law of Evidence in Canada, 2nd edition, at ss.6.55&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}

==Reliability==
As always, the focus of analysis is to be on the hearsay dangers.&lt;ref&gt;R v MNP, [http://canlii.ca/t/fqgj5#par14 2012 MBQB 70 at 14]&lt;/ref&gt;
The primary danger of concern is the inability to cross-examine.&lt;ref&gt;R v Smith at 29&lt;/ref&gt; The court must be satisfied that the statement is sufficiently reliable to be considered as evidence.   The judge must determine whether the statement shows sufficient reliability to afford a satisfactory basis for evaluating the truth of the statement.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Hawkins [http://canlii.ca/t/1fr51 1996 CanLII 154] (S.C.C.), (1996) 2 C.R. (5th) 245 (S.C.C.)&lt;/ref&gt; The criteria of reliability deals with threshold reliability, not ultimate reliability to establish some fact.

There are two manners in which relability can be established: 1) by detailing the circumstances in which the statement was taken; or 2) “by showing that, in all of the circumstances, the ultimate trier of fact will be in a position to sufficiently assess the worth of the statement.&lt;ref&gt;See R v Blackman, [http://canlii.ca/t/1z1bv 2008 SCC 37] at 35&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Wilcox, 2001 NSCA 45 at 66&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the circumstances of the statement &quot;substantially negates&quot; the possibility that the declarant was untruthful or mistaken, then the statement is reliable.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Nguyen 2001 ABCA 98 at para. 26 citing R Smith, at para. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

===Factors===
Factors include:&lt;ref&gt;Morehouse, [2004] A.J. No. 12 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abqb/doc/2004/2004abqb97/2004abqb97.html 2004 ABQB 97] at para. 53&lt;br&gt; 
R v Finta [http://canlii.ca/t/1npnp 1992 CanLII 2783] ONCA aff’d at [1994] 1 SCR 701&lt;br&gt;
R v Nguyen [http://canlii.ca/t/5rkq 2001 ABCA 98]&lt;/reF&gt;
# solemnity of the occasion&lt;ref&gt;Finta&lt;/ref&gt;
# the declarant’s adverse interest&lt;ref&gt;Finta&lt;/ref&gt;
# the declarant had particular means of knowledge of events described&lt;ref&gt;Finta&lt;/ref&gt;
# the statement distinguishes between first and second hand knowledge&lt;ref&gt;Finta&lt;/ref&gt;
# the statement was officially recorded and preserved&lt;ref&gt;Finta&lt;/ref&gt;
# the absence of a reason and/or motive to fabricate the statement ('''non-fabrication''')&lt;ref&gt;Morehouse&lt;/ref&gt;
# the timing of the statement in relation to the event spoken of ('''contemporaneity/remoteness''')&lt;ref&gt;Morehouse; Nguyen at 44, ibid&lt;/ref&gt;
# the demeanour of the declarant at the time of the making of the statement ('''demeanour''')&lt;ref&gt;Morehouse; Nguyen&lt;/ref&gt;
# the spontaneity of the statement ('''spontaneity''')&lt;ref&gt;Morehouse; Nguyen, ibid&lt;/ref&gt;
# the relationship between the declarant and the witness ('''relationship''')&lt;ref&gt;Morehouse&lt;/ref&gt;
# the detail given in the statement ('''detail''');&lt;ref&gt;Morehouse&lt;/ref&gt;
# whether the declarant could be mistaken ('''mistake'''); &lt;ref&gt;Morehouse&lt;/ref&gt;
# motive of the declarant ('''motive''')&lt;ref&gt;Nguyen, ibid&lt;/ref&gt;
# conduct of declarant&lt;ref&gt;Nguyen, ibid&lt;/ref&gt;
# whether the statement was recorded&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Burke,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2010/2010onsc6530/2010onsc6530.html 2010 ONSC 6530]&lt;/ref&gt; and
# “other”, including an “accurate record” - because it is clear from the cases that the list of factors is not closed and others may be added as appropriate to the particular circumstance.

Factors '''not''' to be considered in determining threshold admissibility:&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Goodstoney, [http://canlii.ca/t/1jvpb 2005 ABQB 128] at para 18&lt;/ref&gt;
#reliability or credibility of the declarant;
#general reputation of the declarant for truthfulness;
#prior or subsequent statements, consistent or not; and

#**In particular, the bar that Starr erected on the use of corroborative evidence in the threshold reliability assessment no longer applies. Instead of categorizing reliability factors into discreet, non-mutually exclusive threshold and ultimate stages, courts should now &quot;adopt a more functional approach... and focus on the particular dangers raised by the hearsay evidence sought to be introduced and on those attributes or circumstances relied upon by the proponent to overcome those dangers&quot;.[4] In effect, trial judges may now consider evidence going beyond the circumstances under which the statement was made at the threshold reliability stage, which includes corroborative and/or conflicting evidence.

A videotaped statement can often be admitted where the declarant is available for cross-examination as there are often sufficient tools to assess the weight of the statement. &lt;Ref&gt;R. v. M.N.P., [http://canlii.ca/t/fqgj5 2012 MBQB 70] &lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Presence of an Oath, Affirmation or Warning===
Where there is no oath, other evidence may substitute for it. This may include evidence from which it can be inferred from when the statement was made, the apparent solemnity of the location and occasion of the statement, an understanding of the importance to tell the truth.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Trieu 2005 CanLII 7884 (ON CA), (2005), 195 C.C.C. (3d) 373 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Opportunity for Cross-Examination===
The opportunity for Cross-examination &quot;alone provides significant indications of reliability&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
U(FJ) at p. 119&lt;/ref&gt; and so could provide &quot;an adequate assurance of threshold reliability to allow substantive admission of prior inconsistent statements&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;

The effectiveness of cross-examination as a sign of reliability &quot;depends on the nature of of the recantation of the witness.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
R v H(S), 14 C.R. (5th) 80, 37 W.C.B. (2d) 362 citing R. v. Conway, [http://canlii.ca/t/4rfx 1997 CanLII 2726] (ON CA), (1997), 36 O.R. (3d) 579, 121 C.C.C. (3d) 397 and R. v. Tat (1997), 117 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt; So where there is a mere denial or absence of memory of the prior statement, cross-examination would have less importance. 

{{reflist|2}}

===Corroboration===
It is important to remember that &quot;repeating a story to others doesn't make it reliable&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; 
R v H(S), (1998) 14 C.R. (5th) 80, 37 W.C.B. (2d) 362 at para. 32&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Special Types of Witnesses===
Elderly or infirm witnesses are classes of witnesses who present risk of being deceased by the time a trial comes about. 

For both of them their reliability can be established with evidence of their fitness at the time the statement was given, such as:
* medical evidence of any psychological reports regarding capacity&lt;ref&gt;R v Taylor [http://canlii.ca/t/ftvcw 2012 ONCA 809] at para. 11&lt;/ref&gt;
* any prescriptions being taken as well as their effect upon their capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor at para. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

A ''Voir Dire'' is in-trial hearing that is considered a separate hearing from the trial itself. It is known as a &quot;trial within a trial&quot; and designed to determine an issue separate from the of procedure or admissibility of evidence.

Procedurally, a voir dire for the validity of a warrant should proceed as follows:&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Wilson, [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/2011/2011bcca252/2011bcca252.html#par69 2011 BCCA 252] at para 69&lt;/ref&gt;
:(a)      The trial judge should determine whether a voir dire is necessary and, if so, whether the calling of evidence should be permitted;
:(b)      If the judge accedes to the request to hold a voir dire and the accused wishes to cross-examine the informant, then the accused must obtain leave of the judge to do so. If the judge grants leave, then he or she can limit the scope of the cross-examination;
:(c)        Cross-examination should proceed to the extent permitted by the order granting leave;
:(d)      Re-examination, if any, should follow the cross-examination; and
:(e)      The trial judge should determine whether the record as amplified on the review could support the issuance of the warrant.

The failure of holding a voir dire to determine if potentially inadmissible evidence should be heard will not not always be fatal to the trial. Where the evidence is still tested and there is no prejudice to the accused to may still be valid. The court must consider whether the process was followed that served the same purpose as the voir dire.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. D.A.R., [http://canlii.ca/t/fqnc4 2012 NSCA 31] (CanLII)
&lt;/ref&gt;

There seems to be some ability to make a motion for &quot;non-suit or directed verdict&quot; motion by the responding party to a voir dire application.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Gartland, 1981 CarswellOnt 1845, 7 W.C.B. 110 at para. 26 (the accused person must be afforded &quot;every essential procedural step and safeguard available to him on his trial on the merits of the substantive offence, in so far as it can be applicable...&quot;) cited also in R v T.(B.) [http://canlii.ca/t/frx58 2012 NSPC 59]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evidence===
The evidence heard in a voir dire can become evidence of the trial proper where it has been found admissible in the voir dire and both parties consent.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Jir,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/2010/2010bcca497/2010bcca497.html#par10 2010 BCCA 497 at para. 10]; 
R. v. Ballendine,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/2011/2011bcca221/2011bcca221.html#par84 2011 BCCA 221 at para. 84]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Charter applications require a factual record. They cannot be argued in a vacuum.&lt;ref&gt;
See MacKay v. Manitoba, 1989 CanLII 26 (SCC), [1989] 2 S.C.R. 357&lt;br&gt; 
Danson v. Ontario, 1990 CanLII 93 (SCC), [1990] 2 S.C.R. 1086&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Affidavits that are based on hearsay should be given little weight and generally should not be considered admissible as evidence on a Charter application.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Darrach, 2000 SCC 46, [2000] 2 SCR 443&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Harris, [http://canlii.ca/t/6k4j 1994 CanLII 2986] (ONCA)&lt;br&gt;
R v Herter, [http://canlii.ca/t/256c7 2009 ONCJ 378] at para. 1&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Re-opening Motions or Applications==
A motion, application or appeal that has not been decided on its merits can be re-opened at the discretion of the court. The applicant has a &quot;heavy onus&quot; to show that it is in the &quot;interests of justice&quot; to reopen the matter.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Blaker 1983 CanLII 308 (BC CA), (1983), 6 C.C.C. (3d) 385 at 392, 393&lt;/ref&gt;

Factors to consider include:&lt;ref&gt;R. v. T.L.C., 2012 BCCA 131 at 26&lt;/ref&gt;
#the length of delay between the dismissal and the application for reinstatement, and the adequacy of the explanation offered for that delay;&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Findlay (1996), 79 B.C.A.C. 106 at para. 13&lt;/ref&gt;
#whether the Appellant contributed to the delay;&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Blaker at p. 393&lt;/ref&gt;
#whether the Appellant had a bona fide intention to pursue the appeal throughout the proceedings;&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Clymore, 1999 BCCA 225, 134 C.C.C. (3d) 476 at para. 14&lt;/ref&gt;
#whether the initial Order was made in error, or the Court was operating under some misunderstanding of the material facts;&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Henry (1997), 100 B.C.A.C. 183 at para. 18&lt;/ref&gt;
#the effect reinstatement would have on public confidence in the administration of justice;&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Clymore at para. 16&lt;/ref&gt;
#the seriousness of the charges&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Blaker at p. 392&lt;/ref&gt;
#the merit of the appeal&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Blaker at p. 392; R. v. Clymore at para. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charter Motions==
A Charter motion is a defence application alleging a breach of a provision of the Charter. 

In certain circumstances, trial judges may be permitted to raise a charter issue on behalf of the accused, particularly where they are self-represented.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Travers 2001 NSCA 71&lt;/ref&gt;
However, interference of the judge may amount to reasonable apprehension of bias.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Youngpine 2009 ABCA 89&lt;/ref&gt;

A Charter application must be heard by a &quot;court of competent jurisdiction&quot;. This is a court that has jurisdiction over the subject matter, the person and the remedy.&lt;ref&gt;R v Hynes 2001 SCC 82&lt;/ref&gt; This will generally be the trial judge.&lt;ref&gt;R v Rahey [1987] 1 SCR 588&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Burden and Standard of Proof===
The burden of proving a violation of any constitutional right is upon the applicant.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Collins, 1987 CanLII 84 at&lt;/ref&gt; The evidence must be &quot;sufficiently clear, convincing and cogent&quot; to establish the breach on a balance of probabilities.&lt;ref&gt;F.H. V. McDougall, [http://canlii.ca/t/20xm8 2008 SCC 53] at 46&lt;/ref&gt;

If the evidence is not sufficiently persuasive one way or another, the court must find there was no Charter violation.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Hardenstine, 2010 BCSC 899 (CanLII), 2010 BCSC 899, paras. 27, 34, referring to R. v. Collins 1987 CanLII 84 (SCC), (1987), 33 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Standing===
A person must have personal Charter-protected rights to make a claim of a violation under the Charter and seek a remedy under s. 24(2) of the Charter. 

There is no rule of automatic standing in challenging a search. Only a party who can establish a personal right to privacy (i.e. a &quot;reasonable expectation of privacy&quot;) can challenge a search.&lt;ref&gt;
e.g. R. v. Fankhanel, [http://canlii.ca/t/2bqs6 1999 CanLII 19075] (AB QB) at para. 12 citing R. v. Edwards (1996), 104 C.C.C.(3d) 137 (S.C.C.)&lt;/ref&gt;

An accused is not entitled to rely on a possible violation of the Charter rights of a co-accused.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Sandhu, (1993) 28 B.C.A.C. 203 (BCCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, where the accused is a passenger of the vehicle, the accused will not have standing to bring a Charter application as there is no privacy interest as a passenger, at least so diminished as to not have any Charter protection.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Ramos, [http://canlii.ca/t/flmzz 2011 SKCA 63] (CanLII), 371 Sask. R. 308&lt;/ref&gt;

A child under the age of 12 cannot be charged with an offence &lt;ref&gt;YCJA s.2 defines &quot;young person&quot; as age 12 to 18&lt;/ref&gt;and so they do not have standing to make any claim for a breach of s.8 Charter rights.

In section 8 Charter applications, standing exists where it has been established that the accused had a [[Canadian Criminal Procedure and Practice/Search and Seizure/Reasonable Expectation of Privacy|Reasonable Expectation of Privacy]] to the target of the search. 

{{reflist|2}}

===Notice===
An Accused must prove a Charter violation through conducting a ''voir dire''. Notice must give notice of a Charter application or else the application can be rejected without hearing evidence.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Hamill (1984) 13 CCC 338 (BCCA)&lt;Br&gt; 
R. v. Kutynek&lt;Br&gt;  
R. v. Kutynec [1992] O.J. No. 347 at 16&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Vukelich (1996), 108 CCC 193 (BCCA) [http://canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/1996/1996canlii1005/1996canlii1005.html 1996 CanLII 1005]&lt;/ref&gt; Notice must outline some facts, sometimes with a supporting affidavit. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Vukelich, supra, at para 17; R. v. Pires, 2005 SCC at para. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no &quot;absolute entitlement to an evidentiary hearing&quot;, rather there must be a &quot;factual and legal basis&quot; for any motion.&lt;ref&gt;﻿R. v. Clancey [1992] OJ 3968 (Ont CJ (Gen Div))&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a duty upon defence to raise any Charter issues before trial.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Kovac [1998] O.J. No. 2347 (Ont. C.J.) at p.9 &lt;/ref&gt;

Verbal notice on the day of trial can be found insufficient notice.&lt;ref&gt;
e.g. R. v. Mide [1998] A.J. No. 1384 (Alta. P.C.) &lt;/ref&gt;

A threshold examination must be made to determine if on a balance of probabilities that the accused may be entitled to a Charter remedy and that the right was asserted as reasonably early as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Vukelich, supra&lt;/ref&gt; Where there is no timely notice, the Court may refuse an application.&lt;ref&gt;see Kutynec at para 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial judge had discretion to refuse to hear any motions with no notice or insufficient notice. The Court must balance the efficient use of court resources with the determination of court matters.
&lt;ref&gt;﻿R. v. Loveman (1992) 71 CCC (3d) 123&lt;/ref&gt;

See also: R. v. Wilson  [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/2011/2011bcca252/2011bcca252.html 2011 BCCA 252]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Ahmed-Kadir and McFadyen, [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcpc/doc/2011/2011bcpc250/2011bcpc250.html 2011 BCPC 250 ]

Failure to comply with rules of motion is not always fatal to the motion.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Tillotson,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2011/2011onsc3390/2011onsc3390.html 2011 ONSC 3390]&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the court rules have not been complied with, the court “has wide discretion in respect of procedure to facilitate a fair and expeditious determination of Charter issues”&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Blom 2002 CanLII 45026 (ON CA), (2002), 61 O.R. (3d) 51 (C.A.) at 21 and 22&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, even a late request for a Charter application can still be heard by the court.

The court may refuse to hear a Charter application where no notice is given.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Rambissoon [2012] OJ 2305 (SCJ)&lt;/ref&gt;

The right to make full answer and defence does not include right to trial by ambush.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Darrach, 2000 SCC 46 at para. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the crown may not know the whole charter evidence before the motion, they are entitled to call evidence after hearing from the defence.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Deveau [http://canlii.ca/t/fn55t 2011 NSCA 85] &lt;/ref&gt;

Where insufficient notice is given on a constitutional challenge the court may refuse to entertain the argument.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Purtill [2012] OJ 2769 (SCJ)&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a Charter issue is raised after the Crown's case, it cannot be based on the lack of evidence on the particular issue. By requiring the crown to present evidence supporting non-existent Charter motion is tantamount to shifting the burden on the crown to prove the absence of a breach.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Furlong [http://canlii.ca/t/frldw 2012 NLCA 29] &lt;/ref&gt;

The defence should not generally be permitted to raise a Charter motion at any point after the close of the Crown's case.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Chamberlain (1994), 30 C.R. (4th) 275 (Ont. C.A.) - judge was correct in exercising discretion to refuse to hear application &lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Dwernychuk (1992), 77 C.C.C. (3d) 385 (Alta. C.A.) &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

It is in the ultimate discretion of the trial judge to decide whether to permit a late Charter application.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Habhab [1997] A.J. No. 175 (Alta P.C.) p. 9-10&lt;br&gt; 
&lt;/ref&gt;

The defence cannot object to the admission of evidence on the basis of a Charter violation where it is first raised in closing.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Kovac [1998] OJ 2347 (Gen. Div.)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Nagda [2000] O.J. No. 5694 (Ont. C.J.) - Charter raised 10 months after trial, but before closing submission&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to trial, the court may make inquiries into what Charter issues to be presented at trial.
&lt;ref&gt;﻿R v. Yorke (1992) 115 NSR (2d) (NSCA) (&quot;﻿It is basic to any adversarial system that a litigant applying for curial relief advise the court and the opponent of the application&quot;)&lt;br&gt;

An accused may raise a new issue on appeal only with leave of the court.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Aisthorpe, [http://canlii.ca/t/1nzlk 2006 NLCA 40] 
&lt;/ref&gt;

Even where leave is not requested, particularly where the accused is self-represented on appeal, the court may still consider whether to grant leave.&lt;ref&gt;

      <comment>/* Excluding Public from Court */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Excluding witnesses==
Before the commencement of trial it is normally expected that all prospective witnesses will be excluded from the courtroom. This will usually be on the motion of one of the parties or the court itself.

The reason for excluding witnesses is because a witnesses ability to hear the evidence of other witnesses before testifying can negatively affect the credibility of the witness.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Smuk (1971), 3 CCC (2d) 457 (BCCA)
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public and Media Ban==
There are several types of publication ban permitted under the criminal code:
* An order restricting the publication of information identifying complainants of sexual offences [ [http://canlii.ca/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec486.4 s.486.4] ]
* An order restricting publication of information identifying victims and witnesses [ [http://canlii.ca/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec486.5 s.486.5(1)] ]
* An order restricting publication of information identifying a justice system participant [ s.486.5(2) ]

Under s. 486.6, anyone who violates  any of these orders (s. 486.4(1), (2) or (3) or 486.5(1) or (2)) can be liable for a summary conviction offence.

===General Publication Ban (s. 486(1),(2))===
Section 486.5(1) provides the court with the authority to make an order &quot;directing that any information that could identify the victim or witness shall not be published in any document or broadcast or transmitted in any way if the judge or justice is satisfied that the order is necessary for the proper administration of justice.&quot;

While section 486.5(2) provides the authority to make an order to not reveal &quot;information that could identify the justice system participant&quot;. 

This can be applied for by a prosecutor, a victim or a witness, a judge or justice. (s. 486.5(1))

Under s.486.5(4), the application must be made in writing and notice must be given to the prosecutor, accused, or any other person affected by the order that the judge specifies. The application itself as well as the contents of a hearing on the application cannot be published.(s. 486.5(6), (9))

The order shall only be made where the applicant establishes that the order is &quot;necessary for the proper administration of justice&quot;. (s. 486(1), (2), (5))

The factors that must be considered to decide whether to proceed are set out in s. 486.5(7):
:(a) the right to a fair and public hearing;
:(b) whether there is a real and substantial risk that the victim, witness or justice system participant would suffer significant harm if their identity were disclosed;
:(c) whether the victim, witness or justice system participant needs the order for their security or to protect them from intimidation or retaliation;
:(d) society’s interest in encouraging the reporting of offences and the participation of victims, witnesses and justice system participants in the criminal justice process;
:(e) whether effective alternatives are available to protect the identity of the victim, witness or justice system participant;
:(f) the salutary and deleterious effects of the proposed order;
:(g) the impact of the proposed order on the freedom of expression of those affected by it; and
:(h) any other factor that the judge or justice considers relevant.

===Sexual Offence Publication Ban===
Under s. 486.4 (1), the court may make an order &quot;directing that any information that could identify the complainant or a witness&quot; not be published, broadcast or transmitted for any sexual offences (as listed in s. 486.4(1)(a)).

Any complainant or witness under the age of 18 years old must be notified of their right to make an application for an order, and if requested by the complainant, prosecutor or witness under 18 years of age, the judge must made the order. (s. 486.4(2))

Similarly, under 486.4(3), for charges under 163.1, the court must make an order in relation to any person who comprises the subject of child pornographic materials.

{{Reflist|2}}

===Jury Identification Ban===
Under 631(6), the court or crown may order a publication ban on any information that may tend to identify jury members where it &quot;is necessary for the proper administration of justice&quot;.

==Public Access to Evidence==
A judge should only refuse a request from the media to access evidence from a preliminary inquiry after the conclusion of trial where:
#such an order is necessary to prevent a serious risk to the proper administration of justice because reasonably alternative measures will not prevent the risk; and
# the salutary effects of the ban outweigh the deleterious effects on the rights and interests of the parties and the public, including the effects on the right to free expression, the right of the accused to a fair and public trial, and the efficacy of the administration of justice.

The judge must rely on actual evidence and not simply judicial common sense and logic alone.&lt;ref&gt;
CTV Television Inc. v. R. et al., [http://canlii.ca/t/1q0cx 2006 MBCA 132] (CanLII)
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Excluding Public from Court==
Section 486 sets out the basic premise that all criminal proceedings are held in open court but persons can be excluded where it is &quot;in the interest of public morals, the maintenance of order, the proper administration of justice&quot; or injury to international relations or national defence/security.
 
{{quotation|
'''Exclusion of public in certain cases'''&lt;br&gt;
486. (1) Any proceedings against an accused shall be held in open court, but the presiding judge or justice may order the exclusion of all or any members of the public from the court room for all or part of the proceedings if the judge or justice is of the opinion that such an order is in the interest of public morals, the maintenance of order or the proper administration of justice or is necessary to prevent injury to international relations or national defence or national security.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Protection of witnesses under 18 and justice system participants'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) For the purposes of subsection (1), the “proper administration of justice” includes ensuring that
:(a) the interests of witnesses under the age of eighteen years are safeguarded in all proceedings; and
:(b) justice system participants who are involved in the proceedings are protected.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Reasons to be stated'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) If an accused is charged with an offence under section 151, 152, 153, 153.1, 155 or 159, subsection 160(2) or (3) or section 163.1, 170, 171, 171.1, 172, 172.1, 172.2, 173, 212, 271, 272, 273, 279.01, 279.011, 279.02 or 279.03 and the prosecutor or the accused applies for an order under subsection (1), the judge or justice shall, if no such order is made, state, by reference to the circumstances of the case, the reason for not making an order.

C-46, s. 486; R.S., 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 203, c. 19 (3rd Supp.), s. 14, c. 23 (4th Supp.), s. 1; 1992, c. 1, s. 60(F), c. 21, s. 9; 1993, c. 45, s. 7; 1997, c. 16, s. 6; 1999, c. 25, s. 2(Preamble); 2001, c. 32, s. 29, c. 41, ss. 16, 34, 133; 2002, c. 13, s. 20; 2005, c. 32, s. 15, c. 43, ss. 4, 8; 2010, c. 3, s. 4; 2012, c. 1, s. 28.

The crown can withdraw a charge at any time prior to plea. Otherwise, it must be with leave of the court and will sometimes require  consent of defence. There is a limited exception for abuse of process.

When an election to Superior Court court has been made, the charge can be withdrawn up until a preliminary inquiry is complete.

==Dismissal for Want of Prosecution==
A judge may make an order dismissing charges for &quot;want of prosecution&quot; resulting in the cessation of the proceedings.

The order can be made at any point up until the commencement of trial.

An applicant can make a motion seeking the dismissal of the charges. Typically, this will arise where a matter cannot proceed any further such as where:
# the judge has refused to adjourn a matter
# the Crown elects to &quot;offer no evidence&quot;  
# the crown has failed to attend or is otherwise incapable of moving a prosecution forward

The authority to dismiss charges is discretionary.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Fletcher and Smith 1990 CanLII 2507 (NS CA), (1990), 99 N.S.R. (2d) 258 at p. 260, para. 7
&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A judge cannot make a order a dismissal for want of prosecution where the prosecutor is late in attending court.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Moreland, 1994 CanLII 1016 (BC SC)&lt;/ref&gt; And particularly where a guilty plea has already been entered.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Siciliano, 2012 ONCA 168&lt;/ref&gt;

A charge that is dismissed for want of prosecution may be recommenced with the laying of a new information or direct indictment only with written consent of the Attorney General or Deputy Attorney General ([http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec485.1 485.1]).

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Stay of Proceedings by Crown==
Under s. 579 the Crown may direct that a proceedings be stayed.
{{quotation|
'''Attorney General may direct stay'''&lt;br&gt;
579. (1) The Attorney General or counsel instructed by him for that purpose may, at any time after any proceedings in relation to an accused or a defendant are commenced and before judgment, direct the clerk or other proper officer of the court to make an entry on the record that the proceedings are stayed by his direction, and such entry shall be made forthwith thereafter, whereupon the proceedings shall be stayed accordingly and any recognizance relating to the proceedings is vacated.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec579 CCC]
}}

This is a right of the crown on the basis that all criminal proceedings are on behalf of the queen.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Cooke, Dingman and Whitton (1948), 91 C.C.C. 310 &lt;/ref&gt;

This form of stay is separate and apart from a judicial stay of proceedings.

{{Reflist|2}}
==Judicial Stay of Proceedings==
Courts have jurisdiction to stay criminal proceedings under s. 24(1) where putting a person on trial would amount to an &quot;abuse of process&quot; and violate the &quot;principles of fundamental justice&quot; under s. 7.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Jewitt [1985] 2 SCR 128&lt;br&gt; 
R v Kalanj [1989] 1 SCR 1594&lt;Br&gt;
R v Power [1994] 1 SCR 601&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; The principle of abuse of process arises from the common law.&lt;ref&gt;
R v O'Connor [1995] 4 SCR 411&lt;/ref&gt; It is now superceeded by the Charter.&lt;ref&gt;
e.g. R v Regan [2002] 1 SCR 297&lt;/ref&gt;

A Stay of Proceedings is the most drastic of remedies available to a court. As the Supreme Court of Canada stated:
:Charges that are stayed may never be prosecuted; an alleged victim will never get his or her day in-Court; society will never have the matter resolved by a trier of fact. For these reasons, a stay is reserved for only those cases of abuse where a very high threshold is met: &quot;the threshold for obtaining a stay of proceedings remains, under the Charter as under the common law doctrine of abuse of process, the 'clearest of cases'&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. O'Connor, [1995] 4 S.C.R. 411 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1995/1995canlii51/1995canlii51.html]&lt;br&gt;
see Carosella, 1997 CanLII 402 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 80 &lt;br&gt;
R. v. La, 1997 CanLII 309 (SCC), [1997] 2 S.C.R. 680&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Regan, 2002 SCC 12, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 297; and R. v. Taillefer&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Duguay, 2003 SCC 70, [2003] 3 S.C.R. 307&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

A stay of proceedings is considered the “ultimate remedy” that is abosultely final, preventing the court from ever adjudicating the matter.&lt;Ref&gt;
Canada (Minister of Citizenship &amp; Immigration) v. Tobiass,1997 CanLII 322 (SCC), [1997] 3 SCR 391, 118 CCC (3d) 443 at para 86.&lt;/reF&gt;

Consequently, there is a high threshold on a stay of proceedings. It is only permissible in the “clearest of cases”.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Regan, 2002 SCC 12 (CanLII), 2002 SCC 12, [2002] 1 SCR 297 at para 53&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

A clearest of case is one in which the integrity of the justice system is implicated.&lt;ref&gt; 
R. v. Antinello, (1995), 165 AR 122, 97 CCC (3d) 126 (CA)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Curragh, 1997 CanLII 381 (SCC), [1997] 1 SCR 537, 113 CCC (3d) 481&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Spence, 2011 ONSC 2406, 85 CR (6th) 72&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Bjelland, 2009 SCC 38, [2009] 2 SCR 651&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. R.P.S, 2010 ABQB 418, 503 AR 233&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Robinson, 1999 ABCA 367, 250 AR 201&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Latimer, 1997 CanLII 405 (SCC), [1997] 1 SCR 217, 112 CCC (3d) 193&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Gangl, 2011 ABCA 357&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

If the Crown enters a stay of proceedings on their own is part of the Crown's royal prerogative which is not reviewable by the court. 

{{reflist|2}}

==Abuse of Process==
The test was set out as follows:
:&quot;Regardless of whether the abuse causes prejudice to the accused, because of an unfair trial, or to the integrity of the justice system, a stay of proceedings will only be appropriate when two criteria are met:
::(1)  the prejudice caused by the abuse in question will be manifested, perpetuated or aggravated through the conduct of the trial, or by its outcome; and
::(2)   no other remedy is reasonably capable of removing that prejudice.&lt;ref&gt;
RR. v. Regan, 2002 SCC 12, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 297 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2002/2002scc12/2002scc12.html]
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
===Police Misconduct===
Police misconduct towards an accused in certain cases can lead to a stay of proceedings on the basis of abuse of process under the residual category.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Ahmed, [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2011/2011onsc2551/2011onsc2551.html 2011 ONSC 2551]: obstruction charge stayed&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Maskell, [http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abpc/doc/2011/2011abpc176/2011abpc176.html 2011 ABPC 176]: impaired charges stayed&lt;/ref&gt;

It has applied where police have given false evidence&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Spagnoli and Shore, [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2011/2011onsc4843/2011onsc4843.html 2011 ONSC 4843] -- falsified anonymous source information&lt;/ref&gt;

The police are entitled to use &quot;lawful stratagems, even amounting to reasonable trickery, to gather evidence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; R. v Grandinetti, [http://canlii.ca/t/4pvr 2003 ABCA 307] at paras. 36-42&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been successfully argued that a video camera filming an accused in lockup using the toilet is a violation of s. 8 resulting in a stay of proceedings.&lt;REf&gt; 
R. v. Mok, 2012 ONCJ 291&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Prosecutorial Misconduct===

See: Nixon, [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2011/2011scc34/2011scc34.html 2011 SCC 34 ]

===Lost evidence===

Not every case loss of evidence will infringe the accused’s right to make full answer and defence.  “Owing to the frailties of human nature, evidence will occasionally be lost” &lt;ref&gt;R. v. La, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fr18 1997 CanLII 309] (SCC), [1997] 2 SCR 680, at para. 20&lt;/ref&gt;.  The Crown must explain the loss and satisfy the trial judge that it was not due to unacceptable negligence or an abuse of process.  If satisfactorily explained, the onus is on the accused to “establish actual prejudice to his or her right to make full answer and defence” &lt;ref&gt;La at para. 25&lt;/ref&gt;.  The principal consideration, in the explanation, “is whether the Crown or the police (as the case may be) took reasonable steps in the circumstances to preserve the evidence” &lt;ref&gt;La at para. 21&lt;br&gt;
and see R. v. Kociuk (R.J.), [http://www.canlii.org/en/mb/mbca/doc/2011/2011mbca85/2011mbca85.html 2011 MBCA 85 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Delay===
* [[Canadian Criminal Procedure and Practice/Delay of Proceedings]]

===Arbitrary Detention===
See [[Canadian Criminal Procedure and Practice/Arrest_and_Detention/Arrest_Procedure#Terms of Custody]] for details on detention procedure.

For a stay of proceedings to be made due to a breach of s.9 during detention post-arrest, there must be some connection between the charges and the breach.
&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Salisbury, [http://canlii.ca/t/fl6mt 2011 SKQB 153] at 11 (&quot; It is accepted that there was a breach of s. 9 of the Charter. However, it occurred after the commission of the offences and after the investigation had been completed. There was no connection between the breach and the charges. &quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==About BrianJMcShane==
Forgive the formality of a middle inital. It seems another user has my name already registered. I am a current student of RMU's Professional and Technical Writing program. I graduated from Ocean County College (NJ) in 2009 with an associate's degree in Liberal Arts. This degree program is an attempt to reconcile interests between writing and literature and technical things like computers and coding. 
==On Writing==
While the ultimate dream is to write independently AND lucratively, necessity dictates some kind of degree in the likely event this does not go as planned. School seems a likelier candidate than lottery tickets.
==On Technology==
Despite being woefully out of practice, I spent two years in high school coding. I learned QBASIC, C++, and HTML. I can write code but cannot do math. Go figure...
==Other Plans==
I have played guitar since I was thirteen. I have been in two &quot;steady&quot; bands since then: once as a bass player and another as a keyboard player. One day I'd like to play my actual instrument in a band, rather than &quot;faking&quot; another one.</text>

I am a fairly experienced Wikipedian, and I have been editing Wikibooks for a few days. I am in the middle of writing a Wikibook called ''[[Geography of France]]''. I have made some minor edits on other books and have been irritated by the pending changes thing (I'm glad the English Wikipedia got rid of that). Anyway, as you can see from [[w:Special:Contributions/Liam987|my Wikipedia contributions]] I am not a vandal, and I am familiar with the WikiMedia interface and I understand the style of Wikibooks, so I would like the Reveiwer privilege sooner than I would normally get it. Thanks, [[User:Liam987|'''&lt;span style=&quot;color:#1c3f94 &quot;&gt;Liam987]]&lt;/span&gt;([[User talk:Liam987|&lt;span style=&quot;color:#808000;&quot;&gt;'''talk'''&lt;/span&gt;]])''' 18:37, 19 March 2012 (UTC)

: {{comment}} Except on Wikijunior, the general public sees by default the current draft, '''not''' the most recent reviewed revision; that is, pending changes are visible by default.  It's not like edits won't be &quot;published&quot; until sighted.  So pending changes are a pretty trivial irritation.

: Understanding how Wikibooks differs from Wikipedia calls for a period of acclimation; and automatic promotion really doesn't take all that long for an active contributor  (about a month) &amp;mdash; assuming they meet the [[WB:Reviewers#Automatic criteria|criteria]], which do include some things it's possible to screw up on, like failing to have an email set and confirmed in [[Special:Preferences]], or using mostly blank edit summaries on one's edits.

: It isn't apparent there's cause here to subvert the reasonable and non-onerous autopromotion mechanism.  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 15:20, 20 March 2012 (UTC)
::{{comment}}This is all that's stopping me asking for reviewer - there's a bit of a backlog of my changes unreviewed and if they were hidden be default that would be a shame.

It is too early to make definite plans for development beyond Mars, but we can list some of the options in this last step.  These are approximately in order of distance and difficulty, but there is no requirement to do them in any particular order.

===Main Belt Asteroids===

Development of the Main Belt between Mars and Jupiter is an extension of development in the Near Earth and Earth/Mars transfer regions.  Because all three regions have a range of eccentricities and inclinations there is no distinct boundary between them, but we arbitrarily assign the area between Mars and Jupiter as the Main Belt, and Jupiter's orbit and beyond as the Outer Solar System region.

The largest Main Belt object is the dwarf planet '''[[w:Ceres (dwarf planet)|1 Ceres]]'''.  Equatorial orbit velocity is 359 m/s, and equatorial rotation velocity is 94 m/s.  Thus to reach orbit requires 265 m/s net. This velocity can be reached by a mild steel centrifuge and easily by any advanced material.  Therefore cargo delivery from any other Main Belt asteroid, all of which are smaller than Ceres, does not require any rocket propulsion.  A 1.0 gravity Skyhook would be 7 km in radius and allow crew and equipment to be landed and take off at low acceleration, and a cost of 0.5% of net mass flow in reaction mass to maintain orbit.  

For smaller asteroids staying on the surface will be more of a problem than getting on and off.  For example, the 35th largest asteroid by diameter is '''[[w: 9 Metis|9 Metis]]''', which has an equatorial radius of 170 km and a mass of 1.47 x 10^19 kg.  This gives a surface gravity of 0.034 m/s^2 (0.34% of Earth).  The rotation period is 5.08 hours, which give a rotation velocity of 58.4 m/s and a centrifugal acceleration at the equator of 0.020 m/s^2.  So the net apparent gravity is only 0.014 m/s.  Indeed, the orbital velocity is 76.0 m/s, so it only takes 17.6 m/s ( 39 mph ) added velocity to reach orbit.  Therefore humans or low speed machinery can toss things into orbit, and a firm anchoring method will be needed to not do it accidentally.

===Outer Moons and Minor Planets===

===Kuiper Belt===

===Gas Giants===

===Oort Cloud and Beyond===

====Slow Interstellar====

People assume that a &quot;starship&quot; will be a metal can with big engines on the back.  Imagine colonizing a long period comet, one of the ones that came from the Oort cloud, and is heading back out there.  Comets are made of a mix of ices (water, methane, ammonia, CO2, etc) and rocky materials.  If there is not enough metals, get one of the metallic asteroids to match orbits with it.  Then build your colony out of the materials there.  Comets range in size up to 50 km in diameter, so there is plenty of stuff to build with.

The Oort cloud is many times the distance of the Earth from the Sun, and the velocity needed to get the comet to leave the Sun and head for another star is very small.  All the ices have some amount of hydrogen, and thus deuterium, which means if you know how to build fusion reactors, you have power for a long long time.  It will be a long trip, but you have a whole city worth of space to play in, with occasional side trips to other comets in the Oort cloud.

There are an estimated trillion comets out there, some will be along your route, more or less.  The average spacing is something like 6 AU, about the distance to Jupiter.  So you can in theory seed other comets as you pass by with new colonies.  If some people feel like it, they could head back to the Sun, the velocities are low enough to do that.

The requirements for this kind of slow star travel are fusion power, and knowing how to build permanent habitats in space.

==Terms of Probation==

===Compulsory terms===
'''Compulsory terms''' of probation are listed at s. 732.1 (2):
{{quotation|
* keep the peace and be of good behaviour;
* appear before the court when required to do so by the court; and
* notify the court or the probation officer in advance of any change of name or address, and promptly notify the court or the probation officer of any change of employment or occupation.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec732.1 CCC]
}}

===Optional terms===
'''Optional terms''' of probation are listed at s. 732.1 (3):
{{quotation|
:(a) report to a probation officer
::(i) within two working days, or such longer period as the court directs, after the making of the probation order, and
::(ii) thereafter, when required by the probation officer and in the manner directed by the probation officer;
:(b) remain within the jurisdiction of the court unless written permission to go outside that jurisdiction is obtained from the court or the probation officer;
:(c) abstain from
::(i) the consumption of alcohol or other intoxicating substances, or
::(ii) the consumption of drugs except in accordance with a medical prescription;
:(d) abstain from owning, possessing or carrying a weapon;
:(e) provide for the support or care of dependants;
:(f) perform up to 240 hours of community service over a period not exceeding eighteen months;
:(g) if the offender agrees, and subject to the program director’s acceptance of the offender, participate actively in a treatment program approved by the province;
:(g.1) where the lieutenant governor in council of the province in which the probation order is made has established a program for curative treatment in relation to the consumption of alcohol or drugs, attend at a treatment facility, designated by the lieutenant governor in council of the province, for assessment and curative treatment in relation to the consumption by the offender of alcohol or drugs that is recommended pursuant to the program;
:(g.2) where the lieutenant governor in council of the province in which the probation order is made has established a program governing the use of an alcohol ignition interlock device by an offender and if the offender agrees to participate in the program, comply with the program; and
:(h) comply with such other reasonable conditions as the court considers desirable, subject to any regulations made under subsection 738(2), for protecting society and for facilitating the offender’s successful reintegration into the community.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec732.1 CCC]

The primary goal of these conditions is rehabilitation and reintegration.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Kootenay [http://canlii.ca/t/1mcwg 2000 ABCA 289], (2000), 271 A.R. 156, 2000 ABCA 289 at paras. 13-14&lt;/ref&gt;
Punishment is not a dominant purpose.&lt;ref&gt;R v Taylor at p. 394&lt;/ref&gt;

These goals concern the future behaviour of the offender, and are not shaped by the seriousness of the offence or degree of culpability.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Kootenay, 2000 ABCA 289&lt;Br&gt; 
R. v. Taylor [http://canlii.ca/t/1mcwg 1997 CanLII 9813] (SK CA), (1997), 122 C.C.C. (3d) 376 at 394 (Sask. C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to impose optional terms, it must be established that the conditions are reasonable desirable for &quot;protecting society and facilitating the offender's successful reintegration into the community&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Coombs, [http://canlii.ca/t/1hq6d 2004 ABQB 621], 369 A.R. 215 at para. 35 (Q.B.)
&lt;/ref&gt;

The conditions do not require a connection between the offence and the offender's past history.&lt;Ref&gt;

'''Community Service'''&lt;br&gt;
The judge may impose a requirement to complete up to 250 hours of community service under s.732.1(3)(f) and (h). It must be completed within 1 year.

'''Sexual Behaviour Assessment'''&lt;br&gt;
Certain jurisdictions have services through the local hospital that include sexual behaviour assessment. This typically includes phallometric testing.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
The assessment is intended to assist with risk assessment, determine whether there should be a s.161 order, and what treatment if any can be required. 

The assessment will either be included as part of a probationary order or else as part of an order for a pre-sentence report prior to sentencing.&lt;ref&gt;

==When Probation can be Ordered==

A period of probation cannot be greater than three years.

Probation can be attached to any jail sentence equal or less than 2 years. The length of sentence is considered going forward from the date of sentence and not the global sentence before subtracting remand credit.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Mathieu, 2008 SCC 21 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2008/2008scc21/2008scc21.html], R. v. Goeujon 2006 BCCA 261 [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/2006/2006bcca261/2006bcca261.html] &lt;/ref&gt;

Probation should not be imposed where it is impractical to make use of probation.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Cameron, 2011 ABCA 311 - Probation was removed from sentence on appeal where the offender was working in remote area far from any probation office&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
==Suspending of Sentence==
Under s. 731(1)(a), court may order that the sentence be suspended and the offender be placed on a period of probation:
{{Quotation|
'''Making of probation order'''&lt;br&gt;
731. (1) Where a person is convicted of an offence, a court may, having regard to the age and character of the offender, the nature of the offence and the circumstances surrounding its commission,
:(a) if no minimum punishment is prescribed by law, suspend the passing of sentence and direct that the offender be released on the conditions prescribed in a probation order;...

'''When alternative measures may be used'''&lt;br&gt;
717. (1) Alternative measures may be used to deal with a person alleged to have committed an offence only if it is not inconsistent with the protection of society and the following conditions are met:
:(a) the measures are part of a program of alternative measures authorized by the Attorney General or the Attorney General’s delegate or authorized by a person, or a person within a class of persons, designated by the lieutenant governor in council of a province;
:(b) the person who is considering whether to use the measures is satisfied that they would be appropriate, having regard to the needs of the person alleged to have committed the offence and the interests of society and of the victim;
:(c) the person, having been informed of the alternative measures, fully and freely consents to participate therein;
:(d) the person has, before consenting to participate in the alternative measures, been advised of the right to be represented by counsel;
:(e) the person accepts responsibility for the act or omission that forms the basis of the offence that the person is alleged to have committed;
:(f) there is, in the opinion of the Attorney General or the Attorney General’s agent, sufficient evidence to proceed with the prosecution of the offence; and
:(g) the prosecution of the offence is not in any way barred at law.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Restriction on use'''&lt;Br&gt;
(2) Alternative measures shall not be used to deal with a person alleged to have committed an offence if the person
:(a) denies participation or involvement in the commission of the offence; or
:(b) expresses the wish to have any charge against the person dealt with by the court.
&lt;p&gt;
'''Admissions not admissible in evidence'''&lt;Br&gt;
(3) No admission, confession or statement accepting responsibility for a given act or omission made by a person alleged to have committed an offence as a condition of the person being dealt with by alternative measures is admissible in evidence against that person in any civil or criminal proceedings.
&lt;P&gt;
'''No bar to proceedings'''&lt;br&gt;
(4) The use of alternative measures in respect of a person alleged to have committed an offence is not a bar to proceedings against the person under this Act, but, if a charge is laid against that person in respect of that offence,
:(a) where the court is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the person has totally complied with the terms and conditions of the alternative measures, the court shall dismiss the charge; and
:(b) where the court is satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the person has partially complied with the terms and conditions of the alternative measures, the court may dismiss the charge if, in the opinion of the court, the prosecution of the charge would be unfair, having regard to the circumstances and that person’s performance with respect to the alternative measures.

}}

The criminal code permits the provincial government to deal with certain criminal charges outside of the court system. This is usually in the form of diversionary programming available to first-time offenders of minor offences where the accused is prepared to accept responsibility.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
Fines are a form of financial punishment available as a sentencing option for a judge.&lt;Ref&gt;s. 734; 716&lt;/ref&gt; A fine is available where the court believes that the accused is &quot;able to pay&quot; the fine&lt;ref&gt; 734(2)&lt;/ref&gt; and where a pecuniary punishment is considered proportionate to the offence and offender. This focus on ability to pay, found in s. 734(2), prevents &quot;offenders from being fined amounts that they are truly unable to pay, and to correspondingly reduce the number of offenders who are incarcerated in default of payment.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Topp, 2011 SCC 43&lt;/ref&gt;

The burden is upon the party seeking the fine to prove that the offender has the ability to pay on a balance of probabilities.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Topp&lt;/ref&gt; The party does not need to identify or locate the specific assets available, rather &quot;may rely on indirect evidence&quot; to prove an ability to pay.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Topp&lt;/ref&gt;

Absent evidence to the contrary, the court may infer an ability to pay where the offender has been in &quot;receipt of illegally-obtained funds&quot;. This must take into account the  &quot;amount of funds acquired&quot; and &quot;the length of time that has passed between the acquisition of the funds and the imposition of sentence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
R v Topp&lt;/ref&gt;

To issue a fine a judge must order:
# an amount to be paid
# the mode of payment
# the time(s) that the fine should be paid

The judge may add further requirements as seen fit.

If the offender fails to pay, it is on the offender to show proof that they are unable to pay in the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Desjardins, 1996 NBCA; see also R. v. Wu, [2003] 3 SCR 530&lt;/ref&gt;

==Default==
Where an offender has a fine imposed by the court, the court may order that a period of jail time in default may be substituted for the fine:
{{quotation|
734. &lt;P&gt;...&lt;P&gt;
'''Meaning of default of payment'''&lt;Br&gt;
(3) For the purposes of this section and sections 734.1 to 737, a person is in default of payment of a fine if the fine has not been paid in full by the time set out in the order made under section 734.1.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Imprisonment in default of payment'''&lt;br&gt;
(4) Where an offender is fined under this section, a term of imprisonment, determined in accordance with subsection (5), shall be deemed to be imposed in default of payment of the fine.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Determination of term'''&lt;br&gt;
(5) The term of imprisonment referred to in subsection (4) is the lesser of
:(a) the number of days that corresponds to a fraction, rounded down to the nearest whole number, of which
::(i) the numerator is the unpaid amount of the fine plus the costs and charges of committing and conveying the defaulter to prison, calculated in accordance with regulations made under subsection (7), and
::(ii) the denominator is equal to eight times the provincial minimum hourly wage, at the time of default, in the province in which the fine was imposed, and
:(b) the maximum term of imprisonment that the court could itself impose on conviction or, if the punishment for the offence does not include a term of imprisonment, five years in the case of an indictable offence or six months in the case of a summary conviction offence.
&lt;P&gt;...&lt;P&gt;
'''Warrant of committal'''&lt;br&gt;
734.7 (1) Where time has been allowed for payment of a fine, the court shall not issue a warrant of committal in default of payment of the fine
:(a) until the expiration of the time allowed for payment of the fine in full; and
:(b) unless the court is satisfied
::(i) that the mechanisms provided by sections 734.5 and 734.6 are not appropriate in the circumstances, or
::(ii) that the offender has, without reasonable excuse, refused to pay the fine or discharge it under section 736.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Reasons for committal'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) Where no time has been allowed for payment of a fine and a warrant committing the offender to prison for default of payment of the fine is issued, the court shall state in the warrant the reason for immediate committal.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Period of imprisonment'''&lt;br&gt;
(2.1) The period of imprisonment in default of payment of the fine shall be specified in a warrant of committal referred to in subsection (1) or (2).
&lt;P&gt;...&lt;P&gt;
'''Effect of imprisonment'''&lt;br&gt;
(4) The imprisonment of an offender for default of payment of a fine terminates the operation of sections 734.5 and 734.6 in relation to that fine.&lt;P&gt;
1995, c. 22, s. 6; 1999, c. 5, s. 35.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Definition of “penalty”'''&lt;br&gt;
734.8 (1) In this section, “penalty” means the aggregate of
:(a) the fine, and
:(b) the costs and charges of committing and conveying the defaulter to prison, calculated in accordance with regulations made under subsection 734(7).
&lt;P&gt;
'''Reduction of imprisonment on part payment'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) The term of imprisonment in default of payment of a fine shall, on payment of a part of the penalty, whether the payment was made before or after the execution of a warrant of committal, be reduced by the number of days that bears the same proportion to the number of days in the term as the part paid bears to the total penalty.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Minimum that can be accepted'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) No amount offered in part payment of a penalty shall be accepted after the execution of a warrant of committal unless it is sufficient to secure a reduction of sentence of one day, or a whole number multiple of one day, and no part payment shall be accepted until any fee that is payable in respect of the warrant or its execution has been paid.
&lt;P&gt;
'''To whom payment made'''&lt;br&gt;
(4) Payment may be made under this section to the person that the Attorney General directs or, if the offender is imprisoned, to the person who has lawful custody of the prisoner or to any other person that the Attorney General directs.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Application of money paid'''&lt;Br&gt;
(5) A payment under this section shall be applied firstly to the payment in full of costs and charges, secondly to the payment in full of any victim surcharge imposed under section 737, and then to payment of any part of the fine that remains unpaid.
&lt;P&gt;
1995, c. 22, s. 6; 1999, c. 5, s. 36, c. 25, s. 19(Preamble).

&lt;P&gt;...&lt;P&gt;

'''Punishment'''&lt;br&gt;
787. &lt;P&gt;...&lt;P&gt;
'''Imprisonment in default where not otherwise specified'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) Where the imposition of a fine or the making of an order for the payment of money is authorized by law, but the law does not provide that imprisonment may be imposed in default of payment of the fine or compliance with the order, the court may order that in default of payment of the fine or compliance with the order, as the case may be, the defendant shall be imprisoned for a term not exceeding six months.
&lt;P&gt;...&lt;P&gt;
R.S., 1985, c. C-46, s. 787; R.S., 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 171; 2008, c. 18, s. 44.

Default time can be imposed in situations such as:
* default of fine instead of forfeiture under s. 462.37 (1)

{{reflist|2}}

==Victim Fine Surcharge==
According to section 737, an &quot;offender who is convicted or discharged...shall pay a victim surcharge&quot;. The amount will be either (1) 15% of the fine imposed; or (2) $50 for summary offences or $100 for indictable offences.&lt;ref&gt;s.737(2)&lt;/ref&gt; The fine is presumed payable immediately unless the court is satified that time is needed to pay. 

'''Exception'''&lt;br&gt;
Under s. 737(5), &quot;[w]hen the offender establishes to the satisfaction of the court that undue hardship to the offender or the dependants of the offender would result from payment of the victim surcharge, the court may, on application of the offender, make an order exempting the offender&quot; from paying the fine. The court must give reasons for this exemption.&lt;ref&gt; s.737(6)&lt;/ref&gt; If no request is made, the fine is presumed to be imposed.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Tellier, 2000 ABCA 219 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abca/doc/2000/2000abca219/2000abca219.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

A judge has the power to impose a sentence of imprisonment under the authority of s. 718.3 and 787:

{{quotation|
'''Degrees of punishment'''&lt;br&gt;
718.3 (1) Where an enactment prescribes different degrees or kinds of punishment in respect of an offence, the punishment to be imposed is, subject to the limitations prescribed in the enactment, in the discretion of the court that convicts a person who commits the offence.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Discretion respecting punishment'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) Where an enactment prescribes a punishment in respect of an offence, the punishment to be imposed is, subject to the limitations prescribed in the enactment, in the discretion of the court that convicts a person who commits the offence, but no punishment is a minimum punishment unless it is declared to be a minimum punishment.
&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;
1995, c. 22, s. 6; 1997, c. 18, s. 141; 2002, c. 1, s. 182.
&lt;br&gt;...&lt;br&gt;
'''General penalty'''&lt;Br&gt;
787. (1) Unless otherwise provided by law, everyone who is convicted of an offence punishable on summary conviction is liable to a fine of not more than five thousand dollars or to a term of imprisonment not exceeding six months or to both.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec718.3 CCC]
}}

== Intermittent Sentence==
{{quotation|
'''Intermittent sentence'''&lt;br&gt;
732. (1) Where the court imposes a sentence of imprisonment of ninety days or less on an offender convicted of an offence, whether in default of payment of a fine or otherwise, the court may, having regard to the age and character of the offender, the nature of the offence and the circumstances surrounding its commission, and the availability of appropriate accommodation to ensure compliance with the sentence, order
:(a) that the sentence be served intermittently at such times as are specified in the order; and
:(b) that the offender comply with the conditions prescribed in a probation order when not in confinement during the period that the sentence is being served and, if the court so orders, on release from prison after completing the intermittent sentence.&lt;br&gt;

'''Application to vary intermittent sentence'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) An offender who is ordered to serve a sentence of imprisonment intermittently may, on giving notice to the prosecutor, apply to the court that imposed the sentence to allow it to be served on consecutive days.&lt;br&gt;

Court may vary intermittent sentence if subsequent offence&lt;br&gt;

(3) Where a court imposes a sentence of imprisonment on a person who is subject to an intermittent sentence in respect of another offence, the unexpired portion of the intermittent sentence shall be served on consecutive days unless the court otherwise orders.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec732 CCC]
}}

Intermittent sentences cannot exceed 90 days. This includes consecutive sentences totaling more than 90 days.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Balachanoff, [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/2003/2003bcca433/2003bcca433.html 2003 BCCA 433]&lt;/ref&gt;

Intermittent sentences &quot;strike a legislative balance between the denunciatory and deterrent functions of 'real jail time' and the rehabilitative functions of preserving the offender's employment, family relationships and responsibilities, and obligations to the community.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Middleton (2009), 388 N.R. 89, at para 45&lt;/ref&gt;

A court has no authority to vary a sentence from an intermittent sentence to a non-intermittent sentence a once it has been ordered.&lt;ref&gt;R v Germaine (1980) 39 NSR (2d) 177 at para. 5; R v Jules [1988] BCJ No 1605&lt;/ref&gt;

There is some suggestion that the court has some jurisdiction to vary the entry and exit time of a conditional sentence.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. E.K., [http://canlii.ca/t/frc2s 2012 BCPC 132]&lt;br&gt;
See [[Canadian_Criminal_Procedure_and_Practice/Trials/Role_of_Trial_Judge#Doctrine_of_Functus_Officio]]
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==No Contact Orders while in Prison==
Under s. 743.21, a court may order that for the duration of serving a sentence that the offender be subject to no-contact conditions.

{{quotation|
'''Non-communication order'''&lt;br&gt;
743.21 (1) The sentencing judge may issue an order prohibiting the offender from communicating, directly or indirectly, with any victim, witness or other person identified in the order during the custodial period of the sentence, except in accordance with any conditions specified in the order that the sentencing judge considers necessary.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Failure to comply with order'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) Every person who fails, without lawful excuse, the proof of which lies on that person, to comply with the order
:(a) is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years; or
:(b) is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding eighteen months.&lt;br&gt;

Sections 738 to 741.2 deal with Restitution to victim of crime. 

Restitution is intended to rehabilitate the offender by making him immediately responsible for the loss of the victim. It also gives the victim a speedy means of getting money back.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Fitzgibbon, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 1005  [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1990/1990canlii102/1990canlii102.html]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Yates, 2002 BCCA 583 [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/2002/2002bcca583/2002bcca583.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Restitution can be ordered to require the offender to pay a sum of money to compensate a party for a proven loss. Restitution is ordered as either a term of a probation order or else as a stand alone restitution order.&lt;ref&gt;s. 738&lt;/ref&gt; A stand alone restitution order has no time limit for repayment and may be registered as a civil judgement&lt;ref&gt;s. 741&lt;/ref&gt; which in turn could be used to garnish wages and seize property.

Whether to grant restitution is considered as part of the &quot;totality&quot; of the punishment.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Siemens, 1999 CanLII 18651 (MB C.A.)[http://www.canlii.org/en/mb/mbca/doc/1999/1999canlii18651/1999canlii18651.html&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the offender should have some ability to pay the amount, either at sentencing or in the future.&lt;ref&gt;R. v.

#The concept of compensation is essential to the sentencing process:
##it emphasizes the sanction imposed upon the offender;
##it makes the accused responsible for making restitution to the victim;
##it prevents the accused from profiting from crime; and
##it provides a convenient, rapid and inexpensive means of recovery for the victim;
#A sentencing judge should consider;
##the purpose of the aggrieved person in invoking s. 725(1);
##whether civil proceedings have been initiated and are being pursued; and
##the means of the offender.
#A compensation order should not be used as a substitute for civil proceedings.  Parliament did not intend that compensation orders would displace the civil remedies necessary to ensure full compensation to victims. 
# It should not be ordered when the amount is unclear.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Castro, [2010] ONCA 718 at paras. 26 and 43&lt;/ref&gt;
#A compensation order is not the appropriate mechanism to unravel involved commercial transactions;
#A compensation order should not be granted when it would require the criminal court to interpret written documents to determine the amount of money sought through the order.  The loss should be capable of ready calculation.
#A compensation order should not be granted if the effect of provincial legislation would have to be considered in order to determine what order should be made;
#Any serious contest on legal or factual issues should signal a denial of recourse to an order;
#Double recovery can be prevented by the jurisdiction of the civil courts to require proper accounting of all sums recovered; and
#A compensation order may be appropriate where a related civil judgment has been rendered unenforceable as a result of bankruptcy.

No single factor should be determinative on whether restitution should be ordered.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Castro, 2010 ONCA 718 at para. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the order is to be part of the sentence, not to compensate for losses.&lt;ref&gt;
See  R. v. Castro, [2010] ONCA 718 at paras. 26 and 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Under [http://www.canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec380.3 section 380.3(1)], when a person is convicted of fraud, the court is specifically required to inquire into whether restitution is being sought from the victim's involved. If the judge decides not to order restitution he must under s. 380.3(5), give reasons for the decision.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
Once the Crown proves the elements of a regulatory or provincial offence or otherwise establishes a duty upon the accused, the onus is on the accused to establish due diligence. This must be proven on a balance of probabilities.&lt;ref&gt;
e.g. R. v. Ariganello, [http://canlii.ca/t/fvp39 2013 ONCJ 13] (CanLII)&lt;/ref&gt;

Due diligence requires the accused to &quot;take all reasonable steps&quot; to avoid the harm that resulted. &lt;ref&gt;
R. v. British Columbia Hydro and Power Authority, [1997] B.C.J. No. 1744 (S.C.), at para. 55 (&quot;In other words, an accused must take all reasonable steps to avoid harm. However, that does not mean an accused must take all conceivable steps.&quot;)
&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not necessary that the accused take all conceivable steps, however.&lt;ref&gt;BC Hydro and Power Authority at para. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

In assessing due diligence, WD test for credibility does not apply.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Carpentier [http://canlii.ca/t/1m1bb 2005 MBCA 134] (CanLII) at para. 27&lt;br&gt;
Ariganello at para. 18&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Defaria [2008] O.J. No. 5427, [http://canlii.ca/t/223td 2008 ONCJ 687] (CanLII) at para. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

The accused must show that he took “all reasonable care” to avoid committing the offence.

This is considered from the perspective of a reasonable person in similar circumstances.
This does not mean that the accused would be required to perform acts that would put the accused in unreasonable danger. 

'''Industry Standards and Practices'''&lt;br&gt;
Compliance with industry standard practice is a factor that weighs in favour of due diligence but it not determinative.&lt;ref&gt;
see R. v. Emil K. Fishing Corp.; R. v. Kukuljan, 2008 BCCA 490 (CanLII), [2008] B.C.J. No. 2326; 304 D.L.R. (4th) 725 leave refused&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Bui, [2005] O.J. No. 1456(C.J.)
&lt;/ref&gt;

Industry standards and practice cannot be of any value to due diligence if it is established that the standard is insufficient. It then cannot be used as a shield against responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. London Excavators &amp; Trucking Ltd. reflex, (1997) 26 C.C.E.L.(2d) 132(Ont. P.C.)&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Pilen Construction of Canada Ltd. [1999] O.J. No. 5650, affd [2001] O.J. No. 2980 (S.C.J.)&lt;br&gt; 
Libman, Regulatory Offences in Canada, at page 7-27 (“…a defendant cannot hide behind commonly accepted standards of care if, in the circumstances, due diligence warrants a higher level of care.”)&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
Generally, intoxication does not excuse a criminal act where the accused has the requisite intent. As it were a &quot;drunken intent is nonetheless an intent.&quot;
R. v. Canute, [http://canlii.ca/t/1db1b 1993 CanLII 403] (BCCA) at  49&lt;/ref&gt;

The law recognizes three degrees of intoxication:&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Daley, [http://canlii.ca/t/1v5dr 2007 SCC 53], [2007] 3 SCR 523 at para 41&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Mild Intoxication''': alcohol-induced relaxation of inhibitions and acceptable behaviour. This does not affect the mens rea of an offence
# '''Advanced Intoxication''': intoxication to the point of the accused lacking any specific intent to an offence. There is a impairment of the accused's foresight of the consequences of his acts, raising a reasonable doubt on the requisite mens rea. This will only apply to specific intent offences.
# '''Extreme Intoxication''':  intoxication to the point of automatism-like state. This degree of intoxication negates the voluntariness of the accused's actions. It is a rare defence that only applies to non-violent offences (as per s. 33.1)

'''Self-induced Intoxication'''
&lt;br&gt;
'''When defence not available'''&lt;br&gt;
33.1 (1) It is not a defence to an offence referred to in subsection (3) that the accused, by reason of self-induced intoxication, lacked the general intent or the voluntariness required to commit the offence, where the accused departed markedly from the standard of care as described in subsection (2).
&lt;br&gt;
'''Criminal fault by reason of intoxication'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) For the purposes of this section, a person departs markedly from the standard of reasonable care generally recognized in Canadian society and is thereby criminally at fault where the person, while in a state of self-induced intoxication that renders the person unaware of, or incapable of consciously controlling, their behaviour, voluntarily or involuntarily interferes or threatens to interfere with the bodily integrity of another person.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Application'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) This section applies in respect of an offence under this Act or any other Act of Parliament that includes as an element an assault or any other interference or threat of interference by a person with the bodily integrity of another person.

Section 33.1 will exclude intoxication as a defence for general intent offences or involuntariness due to intoxication where the following conditions are met:&lt;ref&gt;

# the intoxication was self-induced; and

      <comment>/* Statutory defence */ typo</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== General Principles ==
The defence of duress exists both in statute under s. 17 of the criminal Code and under the common law.

The common law defence pre-dates the provisions of s. 17, however, by function of s.8 of the Criminal Code, which preserves all common law defences, the broader common law defence is still considered.&lt;ref&gt; Section 8 (3) state: &lt;br&gt;
'''Common law principles continued'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) Every rule and principle of the common law that renders any circumstance a justification or excuse for an act or a defence to a charge continues in force and applies in respect of proceedings for an offence under this Act or any other Act of Parliament except in so far as they are altered by or are inconsistent with this Act or any other Act of Parliament.
&lt;br&gt;
R.S., 1985, c. C-46, s. 8; 1993, c. 28, s. 78; 2002, c. 7, s. 138.
&lt;/reF&gt;

The distinction between the two is that the s.17 defence does not apply to parties, including aiders and abettors.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Wilson, [http://canlii.ca/t/flqd8#par50 2011 ONSC 3385 at 50]&lt;/ref&gt; The common law, however, can still apply for parties to the offence.

Duress is an excuse-based defence.

{{reflist|2}}
==Statutory defence==
{{quotation|
'''Compulsion by threats'''&lt;br&gt;
17. A person who commits an offence under compulsion by threats of immediate death or bodily harm from a person who is present when the offence is committed is excused for committing the offence if the person believes that the threats will be carried out and if the person is not a party to a conspiracy or association whereby the person is subject to compulsion, but this section does not apply where the offence that is committed is high treason or treason, murder, piracy, attempted murder, sexual assault, sexual assault with a weapon, threats to a third party or causing bodily harm, aggravated sexual assault, forcible abduction, hostage taking, robbery, assault with a weapon or causing bodily harm, aggravated assault, unlawfully causing bodily harm, arson or an offence under sections 280 to 283 (abduction and detention of young persons).
&lt;br&gt;
R.S., 1985, c. C-46, s. 17; R.S., 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 40.
|[http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec17 CCC]}}

The requirements of s.17 to have “presence” and “immediacy” is unconstitutional for violating s.7.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Ruzic 2001 SCC 24&lt;/reF&gt; Thus, that portion of the section has no force or effect.

Despite the existence of the common law defence, all offences listed as defence exceptions in s.17 cannot be covered by common law.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Mohamed, 2012 ONSC 1715 at 20&lt;/ref&gt;
Any included offences to offences to the exempted offences listed in s. 17 are also exempted from the statutory defence.&lt;ref&gt;R v Li 2002 CanLII 18077 (ONCA) -- kidnapping charge was also exempted as part of the abduction charge&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Common Law==
At common law, duress is an available defence to any offences short of murder. It must be shown that the accused's will was overborne by threats of death or serious personal injury such that accused is not acting voluntarily.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. T.L.C., [http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abpc/doc/2004/2004abpc79/2004abpc79.html 2004 ABPC 79]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are three elements to the defence.&lt;ref&gt;R v Wilson 2011 ONSC 3385 at 61&lt;/ref&gt; It must be established that:
# the accused must be subject to a “threat of death or serious physical injury” 
# on an objective standard, no safe avenue of escape existed &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Hibbert, [1995] 2 SCR 973 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1995/1995canlii110/1995canlii110.html 1995 CanLII 110]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Keller, [http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abca/doc/1998/1998abca357/1998abca357.html 1998 ABCA 357] &lt;/ref&gt; or any “reasonable opportunity to render the threat ineffective.”&lt;ref&gt;Wilson 2011 ONSC 3385 at 61&lt;/ref&gt;
#  “there must be proportionality between the threat and the criminal act alleged”&lt;ref&gt; Wilson 2011 ONSC 3385 at 61&lt;/ref&gt;

If the defence is raised, the Crown has the burden of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that at least one of the elements is not available.&lt;ref&gt;Wilson at 63&lt;/ref&gt;

The threat need not be of immediate death or bodily harm. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Ruzic, 2001 SCC 24, [2001] 1 SCR 687 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2001/2001scc24/2001scc24.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The defence will not be available through the common law where the accused puts themselves in a position where they are likely to recieve threats.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Li,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2002/2002canlii18077/2002canlii18077.html 2002 CanLII 18077 (ON CA)]&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;the defence in Canada, ...[is] an objective-subjective standard, as in the case of the defence of necessity&quot; (Ruzic at para 71).

A valid excuse for violating the law is on the basis of an officially induced error of law.  &lt;ref&gt;R v Jorgensen at 28 to 37&lt;/ref&gt; The defence arises where the accused is given advice in error that the accused relies upon in doing the criminal act. 

Officially induced error is available as a defence to prevent morally blameless individuals, who believe they are acting in a lawful manner, from being convicted.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Jorgensen 1995 CanLII 85 (S.C.C.), (1995), 4 S.C.R. 55 &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Halloran, 2010 ONSC 4321&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

The elements that must be proven are:
#The error was one of law or mixed law and fact
#The accused considered the legal consequences of her actions
#The advice obtained came from an appropriate official
#The advice was reasonable in the circumstances
#The advice obtained must be erroneous
#The accused must demonstrate reliance on the official advice

Each element must be proven on a balance of probabilities by the accused.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Jorgensen&lt;/ref&gt;

This is an exception to the principle that ignorance of the law is no excuse.

The defence arises in part out of the overly complex nature of regulation. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Jorgensen, 1995 CanLII 85 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 55 at para. 25&lt;br&gt;
Lévis (City) v. Tétreault; Lévis (City) v. 2629-4470 Québec inc., 2006 SCC 12 (CanLII), 2006 SCC 12 at 24&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the defence is to prevent injustices where the ““state approving conduct with one hand and seeking to bring criminal sanction for that conduct with the other”&lt;ref&gt;R v Jorgensen at para 30&lt;/ref&gt;

A successful application will result in a stay of proceedings.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Jorgensen&lt;/ref&gt;

Provocation is a partial defence for the charge of first or second degree murder.
 
{{Quotation|
'''Murder reduced to manslaughter'''&lt;br&gt;
232. (1) Culpable homicide that otherwise would be murder may be reduced to manslaughter if the person who committed it did so in the heat of passion caused by sudden provocation.
&lt;br&gt;
'''What is provocation'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) A wrongful act or an insult that is of such a nature as to be sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control is provocation for the purposes of this section if the accused acted on it on the sudden and before there was time for his passion to cool.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Questions of fact'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) For the purposes of this section, the questions
:(a) whether a particular wrongful act or insult amounted to provocation, and
:(b) whether the accused was deprived of the power of self-control by the provocation that he alleges he received,&lt;br&gt;

are questions of fact, but no one shall be deemed to have given provocation to another by doing anything that he had a legal right to do, or by doing anything that the accused incited him to do in order to provide the accused with an excuse for causing death or bodily harm to any human being.

}}

A trial judge must put the defence to the trier-of-fact where there is evidence of an &quot;air of reality&quot; to the defence.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Cinous, [http://canlii.ca/t/51tb 2002 SCC 29], [2002] 2 S.C.R. 3, at para. 50, 53&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Osolin, [http://canlii.ca/t/1frvz 1993 CanLII 54] (SCC), [1993] 4 S.C.R. 595&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; This means that there must be sufficient evidential basis with respect to each element of the defence. This requires that the evidence must be &quot;reasonably capable of supporting the inferences necessary to make out the defence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R v. Tran, [http://canlii.ca/t/2dk6j 2010 SCC 58] (CanLII), [2010] 3 S.C.R. 350 at para. 41&lt;/ref&gt;
There must be evidence upon which a “reasonable jury acting judicially” could find the defence successful.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Tran, at para. 41&lt;/ref&gt; In deciding, the judge must consider &quot;the totality of the evidence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Krasniqi, [http://canlii.ca/t/fsh9z 2012 ONCA 561] (CanLII), 295 O.A.C. 223, at para. 52
&lt;/ref&gt;

The provocation must be a subjectively held belief that is reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Thibert, [http://canlii.ca/t/1frf6 1996 CanLII 249] (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 37 at para. 4&lt;br&gt;
See also Tran at para. 23&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; This requires:
# a wrongful act or insult of such a nature that it is sufficient to deprive an ordinary person of the power of self-control (objective) and 
# the accused act upon that insult on the sudden and before there was time for his passion to cool (subjective) 

On the objective element, the &quot;normal temperament and level of self-control&quot; refers to a person who is not &quot;exceptionally excitable, pugnacious or in a state of drunkenness&quot;.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Hill, [http://canlii.ca/t/1ftss 1986 CanLII 58] (SCC), [1986] 1 S.C.R. 313 at p. 331&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

The ordinary person is one that can be ascribed the &quot;particular characteristics that are not peculiar or idiosyncratic&quot; such as &quot;sex, age, or race&quot;&lt;ref&gt; Hill, at p. 331; see also Thibert, at para. 14&lt;/ref&gt; This intends to &quot;contextualize the objective standard&quot; but not so far as to &quot;individualize it&quot;.&lt;Ref&gt;
Tran at para. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

The policy behind the objective standard is the desire to &quot;seek to encourage conduct that complies with certain societal standards of reasonableness and responsibility.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;
Hill at pp. 324-25&lt;br&gt;
See also R. v. Mayuran, [http://canlii.ca/t/frtzh 2012 SCC 31]&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of anger can be used to support or demean the availability of the defence. It depends on whether the anger is the fuel for &quot;cold blooded revenge&quot; or the fuel for sudden rage resulting in a loss of control.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Angelis, [http://canlii.ca/t/fvxsv 2013 ONCA 70] (CanLII) at para. 36&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
A defence of entrapment is available when:&lt;ref&gt;R.v.Mack [http://canlii.ca/t/1ftb1 1988 CanLII 24 (S.C.C.)], (1988) 44 C.C.C. (3d) 513 (S.C.C.) at p.559&lt;/ref&gt;
 
#the authorities provide a person with an opportunity to commit an offence without acting on a reasonable suspicion that this person is already engaged in criminal activity or pursuant to bona fide inquiries;
#although having such a reasonable suspicion or acting in the course of a bona fide inquiry, they go beyond providing an opportunity and induce the commission of an offence.
 
&quot;An exception to [the rule establishing entrapment] arises when the police undertake a bona fide investigation directed at an area where it is reasonably suspected that criminal activity is occurring.  When such a location is defined with sufficient precision, the police may present any person associated with the area with the opportunity to commit the particular offence.  Such randomness is permissible within the scope of a bona fide inquiry.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R.v.Barnes [http://canlii.ca/t/1fsnz 1991 CanLII 84 (S.C.C.)], (1991) 63 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (S.C.C.) at pp.10-11&lt;/ref&gt;

An undercover officer who attempts to buy drugs from someone suspected of selling drugs does not constitute entrapment.&lt;ref&gt;
Barnes v. The Queen, 1991 CanLII 84 (SCC), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 449&lt;/ref&gt;

A defence of entrapment cannot be advanced until after the crown has proven all of the elements of the offence.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Mack, 1988 CanLII 24 (SCC), [1988] 2 S.C.R. 903&lt;br&gt;
considered in R. v. Bérubé, [http://canlii.ca/t/fsc5z 2012 BCCA 345] (CanLII)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Random Virtue Testing==
Certain provinces have found that &quot;random virtue testing&quot; by police, such as randomly calling phone numbers found on a suspect's cell phone in hope of catching a drug trafficker.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Swan, [http://canlii.ca/t/22zrj 2009 BCCA 142] (CanLII) at para. 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Conducting a DNA canvass of suspects has been upheld as a valid investigation technique.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
Evidence constitutes an &quot;alibi&quot; where &quot;the evidence at issue [is] determinative of the final issue of guilt or innocence of the accused.&quot; The evidence suggests that &quot;it was impossible for the accused to have committed the crime charged because, at the time of its commission, the accused was elsewhere&quot;&lt;ref&gt; 
R. v. M. R., [http://canlii.ca/en/on/onca/doc/2005/2005canlii5845/2005canlii5845.html 2005 CanLII 5845 (ON CA)] at para 31  &lt;br&gt;
R. v. C.(T.W.) [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2006/2006canlii12286/2006canlii12286.html 2006 CanLII 12286], (2006), 209 O.A.C. 119&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Hill [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1995/1995canlii271/1995canlii271.html 1995 CanLII 271 (ON CA)], (1995), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 469 (Ont. C.A.) at 478-79 &lt;/ref&gt;

An alibi does not need to be proven, but rather it must simply raise a doubt.&lt;ref&gt;
Lizotte v. The King, 1950 CanLII 48 (S.C.C.), [1951] S.C.R. 115&lt;br&gt;
R. V .J.B.J., [http://www.canlii.org/en/ns/nsca/doc/2011/2011nsca16/2011nsca16.html 2011 NSCA 16] at para 40 to 45 &lt;/ref&gt;

All alibi evidence must be disclosed to the crown.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Cleghorn, [1995] 3 S.C.R. 175&lt;/ref&gt; This is an exception to the rule of the right to remain silent. This is due to &quot;the ease with which alibi evidence may be fabricated; and the diversion of the alibi inquiry from the central inquiry at trial&quot;. &lt;Ref&gt;R v Noble [1997] 1 S.C.R. 874 &lt;/ref&gt;
Where the defence does not give enough notice and not sufficiently particularized for the police to investigate prior to trial, an adverse inference may be drawn from this.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Noble at 111&lt;/ref&gt;

Disclosure must be adequate and timely. If the disclosure does not satisfy these requirements, the trier of fact may draw an adverse inference when weighing the alibi evidence at trial.

The failure of the accused to testify on alibi may be used to draw an adverse inference about credibility of the defence.
The reason for this is that aibi evidence is &quot;not directly related to the guilt of the accused&quot; so the determination of the credibility of the alibi does not go to the ultimate issue of guilt.&lt;ref&gt;R v Noble at para 112&lt;/ref&gt;

&gt;&gt;&gt;==Background==--[[User:ContiR|ContiR]] ([[User talk:ContiR|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/ContiR|contribs]]) 01:42, 7 May 2012 (UTC)
	
The post 9/11 airline budget cuts tested the moral fibers of the airline companies in the United States.  In fact, these financial constraints revealed the true colors of the 6 largest U.S. airlines; in the years following 9/11, the number of Enforcement Investigative Reports for the “big 6” dropped by 62% despite the number of commercial passengers increasing by 45%&lt;ref&gt;1http://www.eturbonews.com/1108/airline-safety-whistleblowers-tale&lt;/ref&gt;. Clearly the airlines’ priority for sound planes was compromised as funds for passenger flight security increased. Financial constraints such as this led Northwest Airlines’ mechanics to go on strike on August 20th, 2005&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/08_06/b4070000689813.htm&lt;/ref&gt;. Northwest Airlines did not let the strike restrict their business, within one day the airline had replaced the mechanics with substitute mechanics.  The skills of these Replacement engineers, however, were not up to par. The airline was conscious of their inadequacy; many had never worked on planes and were trained on simulators&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fraud-magazine.com/article.aspx?id=423&lt;/ref&gt;.


This inadequacy eventually led Mark Lund, a Minnesota based Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Inspector, to blow the whistle&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eturbonews.com/1108/airline-safety-whistleblowers-tale&lt;/ref&gt;.  Just days after the replacement mechanics started, Lund noted several avoidable errors made due to the insufficient training of the new mechanics. The first several errors Lund noted were: 1) a DC-10 with a broken lavatory duct allowing waste products to spill onto critical equipment on a flight from Amsterdam to Minneapolis when Northwest Airlines planned to let the plan continue onto Honolulu before it was fixed until an FAA inspector interfered&lt;ref&gt;http://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/08_06/b4070000689813.htm&lt;/ref&gt;, 2) a maintenance mechanic could not find a switch to test the engine on an airbus a320&lt;ref&gt;http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2005/09/08_zdechlikm_faafolo/&lt;/ref&gt;, 3) a mechanic was unsure of how to close a cabin door on a Boeing 757&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fraud-magazine.com/article.aspx?id=423&lt;/ref&gt;, 4) a mechanic failed to lock the brakes on another Boeing 757 before checking the break wear pins&lt;ref&gt;http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2005/09/08_zdechlikm_faafolo/&lt;/ref&gt;, 5) a Boeing 757 blew out its main tires when it landed in Detroit the first morning after replacement mechanics took over&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eturbonews.com/1108/airline-safety-whistleblowers-tale&lt;/ref&gt;.  

There were 121 other problems in the first week following the strike&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eturbonews.com/1108/airline-safety-whistleblowers-tale&lt;/ref&gt;. Immediately after Lund began to notice these mistakes and the inadequacies of the replacement mechanics he wrote his FAA supervisors in Washington.  with 3 recommendations. He claimed that there was a situation that existed “that jeopardized lives”&lt;ref&gt;http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2005/09/08_zdechlikm_faafolo/&lt;/ref&gt; and made several suggestions that needed to be carried out until mechanics and inspectors could do their job “without error”. In his memo he recommended&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fraud-magazine.com/article.aspx?id=423&lt;/ref&gt;:  1) cutting back flight schedules, 2) upgrading mechanic training program, and 3) increasing FAA surveillance. The FAA and Northwest Airlines had a cozy relationship, which led to immediate repercussions for Lund.  The FAA took away his badge and gave him a desk job[http://www.eturbonews.com/1108/airline-safety-whistleblowers-tale 1]. Lund’s claims were verified in a 2010 investigation it was confirmed that Northwest Airlines violated more than 1,000 FAA directives &lt;ref&gt;http://articles.cnn.com/2010-07-22/us/northwest.airlines.faa_1_faa-inspectors-safety-directives-faa-airworthiness-directives?_s=PM:US&lt;/ref&gt;.


Lund, still concerned about the dangerous situation, fought back. He hand delivered his suggestions to the Senator of Minnesota (Northwest’s home state), Mark Dayton. Dayton was appalled by the behavior of the airline and the FAA. Dayton sent letter to inspector general at Department of Transportation (DOT), because the DOT oversees the FAA&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fraud-magazine.com/article.aspx?id=423&lt;/ref&gt;. Dayton helped Lund get his job back within six weeks. Once he was back on the job, Lund immediately inspected the Boeing 757 whose breaks went out upon landing. He concluded that “probable cause for the tire failure was a brake failure caused by a brake control cable that a replacement mechanic inadvertently jammed after routine maintenance to an unrelated system”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fraud-magazine.com/article.aspx?id=423&lt;/ref&gt;.  Lund immediately wrote a letter notifying his FAA supervisors again.  In his letter he cited this incident as an example and stated that Northwest “is not a school to train mechanics while it operates at a safety risk to the public”&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eturbonews.com/1108/airline-safety-whistleblowers-tale&lt;/ref&gt;.

&lt;b&gt;Procedural programming&lt;/b&gt; focuses on the step-by-step instructions that tell the computer what to do to solve a problem. This is the other most significant approach to programming, next to object-oriented programming (OOP). Procedural programming is based on procedure call which is locating specific tasks in procedures that are called by the main program code whenever a task needs to be completed. When it is done programming, the program control will return to the main program.


Procedures are small sections of program code that are called by the main program code when the tasks need to be performed. After a procedure finishes, the program control returns to the main program. 
	
By doing this approach, this allows each procedure to be performed as many times as needed without requiring unnecessary multiple copies of the same code. This makes the program smaller and the main program is easier to understand. With using this programming, it allows faster development time.

'''Structured programming''' is a type of programming that involves breaking the program into smaller modules of code. The modules have a duty of performing a single task, therefore eliminating the need to use the '''GOTO statement'''. The GOTO statement was very heavily used before procedural programming was created. It is basically a statement to send program control to a specific line of a code to complete commands at that specific point until another GOTO statement is reached. [[File:Cf-goto-fr.svg|100px|Cf-goto-fr]] 

In structured programming the overall general tasks that need to be performed first are of the highest priority and then the tasks get more and more specific as it goes on- the '''top-down''' philosophy. Sometimes structured programming and procedural programming are used interchangeably.

== Prepositions and Postpositions ==
A preposition links a noun to an action (e.g., “go ''from'' there”) or to another noun (“the pen ''on'' the table”). For the purpose of clarity, this chapter will divide Oromo prepositions into two categories: true prepositions and postpositions, with true prepositions coming before the noun and postpositions coming after the noun they relate to.
&lt;br/&gt;
'''Some Common Prepositions and Postpositions:'''
{|
|-
| &lt;u&gt;Postpositions&lt;/u&gt; || &lt;u&gt;Prepositions&lt;/u&gt;
|-
| '''ala''' &amp;mdash; out, outside || '''gara''' &amp;mdash; towards
|-
| '''bira''' &amp;mdash; beside, with, around || '''eega, erga''' &amp;mdash; since, from, after
|-
| '''booda''' &amp;mdash; after || '''haga, hanga''' &amp;mdash; until
|-
| '''cinaa''' &amp;mdash; beside, near, next to &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; || '''hamma''' &amp;mdash; up to, as much as
|-
| '''dur, dura''' &amp;mdash; before || '''akka''' &amp;mdash; like, as
|-
| '''duuba''' &amp;mdash; behind, back of || '''waa'ee''' &amp;mdash; about, in regard to
|-
| '''irra''' &amp;mdash; on
|-
| '''irraa''' &amp;mdash; from
|-
| '''itti''' &amp;mdash; to, at, in
|-
| '''jala''' &amp;mdash; under, beneath
|-
| '''jidduu''' &amp;mdash; middle, between
|-
| '''keessa''' &amp;mdash; in, inside
|-
| '''malee''' &amp;mdash; without, except
|-
| '''wajjin''' &amp;mdash; with, together
|-
| '''gubbaa''' &amp;mdash; on, above
|-
| '''fuuldura''' &amp;mdash; in front of
|-
| '''gad(i)''' &amp;mdash; down, below
|-
| '''ol(i)''' &amp;mdash; up, above
|}

&lt;br/&gt;
Examples: &lt;br/&gt;
'''boqonnaarra [boqonnaa irra]''' – “on vacation” &lt;br/&gt;
'''mana keessa''' – “in the house” &lt;br/&gt;
'''waaree booda''' – “afternoon” &lt;br/&gt;
'''irra deebi'i''' – “repeat” [lit. “return on it”] &lt;br/&gt;
'''Yuunivarsitii Haroomayaatti barsiissaa''' – “teacher at Haromaya University” &lt;br/&gt;
'''mana nyaataa kanatti''' – “at this restaurant” &lt;br/&gt;
“'''waa'ee fiilmii sun natti himi'''” – “tell me about that film” &lt;br/&gt;
“'''Chaaltuun akka Hawwiituu baratuu dha'''.” – “Chaltu is a student like Hawitu.” &lt;br/&gt;
'''hanga torban dhufu''' – “until next week” &lt;br/&gt;
'''gammachuu wajjin''' – “with pleasure” &lt;br/&gt;
'''shaayee annan malee''' – “tea without milk” &lt;br/&gt;
“'''Ani meetirii lama gadi'''.” – “I am below [shorter than] 2 meters.” &lt;br/&gt;
“'''Keeniyaan Itoophiyaarraa (gara) kibbatti argamti'''” – “Kenya is located (to the) south of Ethiopia” &lt;br/&gt;

&lt;br/&gt;
From the examples above, you may notice that the postpositions '''itti''', '''irra''', and '''irraa''' most often occur as suffixes, -''tti'', -''rra'', and -''rraa'', on the nouns they relate to.

Often with place names, no preposition or postposition is used to be mean “in”. Therefore, one can say “'''Finfinnee jiratta'''” for “you live in Finfinnee [Addis Ababa]”, or “'''hospitaalan ture'''” for “I was in the hospital”, using no preposition.

Personal pronouns are not used with prepositions. Instead, possessive pronouns are used as personal pronouns.

Examples:&lt;br/&gt;
“toward me” &amp;mdash; '''gara koo'''('''tti''') [not '''gara na''']&lt;br/&gt;
“like us” &amp;mdash; '''akka keenya'''&lt;br/&gt;
“according to him” &amp;mdash; '''akka isaatti'''&lt;br/&gt;
“about you” &amp;mdash; '''waa'ee kee'''&lt;br/&gt;

Postpositions, on the other hand, take the accusative form of personal pronouns.

Examples:&lt;br/&gt;
“at you” &amp;mdash; '''sitti'''&lt;br/&gt;
“from me” &amp;mdash; '''narraa'''&lt;br/&gt;
“under him” &amp;mdash; '''isa jala'''&lt;br/&gt;

When an adjective modifies a noun, the postposition follows the adjective, as in “'''nama guddarraa'''” (“from the big man”).




== Conjunctions ==
Whereas prepositions link nouns to other parts of the sentence, conjunctions usually link more complete thoughts together.

'''Some Common Conjunctions:'''
{|
|-
| and || '''fi''' [also -''f'' suffix]
|-
| but || '''garuu, immoo'''
|-
| or || '''yookin''' (for declaratives), '''moo''' (for questions)
|-
| however || '''haa ta'u malee'''
|-
| though || '''ta'us'''
|-
| so, therefore || '''kanaaf, kanaafu'''
|-
| because || '''sababiin isaa, sababiinsa''' [lit. “its reason”]
|-
| so that, in order to &amp;nbsp; &amp;nbsp; || '''akka'''
|}

Conjunctions come between the two clauses they connect, though '''garuu''' and '''immoo''' (“but”) can also  come after the first noun or nounal phrase in the second clause.

Examples:&lt;br/&gt;
“'''Inni shee jaalata ta'us amanamaa miti'''.” – “Though he loves her, he is unfaithful.” &lt;br/&gt;
“'''Daadhii moo biiraa dhuguu barbaadda'''?” – “Do you want tej [alcoholic honey drink] or beer?” &lt;br/&gt;
“'''Ani kochee nyaadhe kanaafu gara kasan qaba'''.” – “I ate kitfo [raw meat] so I got diarrhea.” &lt;br/&gt;
“'''Nyaatan barbaada sababiinsa nan beela'e'''.” – “I want food because I am hungry.” &lt;br/&gt;
“'''Ani nan deema akka inni dhufuuf'''.” – “I will go so that he will come.” &lt;br/&gt;
“'''Ittoo shiroon jaaladha garuu ittoo misira caalaa jaaladha'''.” or “'''Ittoo shiroon jaaladha ittoo misira garuu caalaa jaaladha'''.” – “I like shiro watt, but I like lentil watt more.” &lt;br/&gt;
“'''Innis gara biyya isaa dhufe, sabni isaa garuu isa hin simanne'''.” – “And he came to his country, but his people did not accept him [John 1:11].”

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Delete a row in Repeating Groups ==

Since OpenClinica 3.1 it isn't possible to delete entries/rows from a Repeating Group once it was saved. The following cite is from the OpenClinica User mailinglist&lt;ref&gt;https://mailman.openclinica.com/pipermail/users/2011-December/006321.html&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;Once data has been entered in a repeating group, the row can never be removed from the UI. 
The user must physically remove the values from each of the fields in the repeating group, and provide a reason 
for change if that configuration is set for the study.

Based on user feedback with the previous implementation of repeating groups and reason for change we believed 
this would be the best course of action. In the future, we might allow the X button again but put a simple 
strike-through the row rather than hiding it from view like we did in versions 3.0.x and earlier.&lt;/source&gt;

(2012-04-12) More detail on this change and the rationale for it has recently been added to the [https://docs.openclinica.com/3.1/openclinica-user-guide/submit-data-module-overview/enter-data-event-completing-crfs#content-title-5239 'Entering Data for an Event Into CRFs'] chapter of the user guide.

In this chapter, we will introduce the important &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; type class.

== Motivation ==

In [[../Other data structures|Other data structures]], we saw operations that apply to all elements of some grouped value. The prime example is &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; which works on lists. Another example we worked through was the following Tree datatype:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
data Tree a = Leaf a | Branch (Tree a) (Tree a) deriving (Show)
&lt;/source&gt;

The map function we wrote for Tree was: 

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
treeMap :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Tree a -&gt; Tree b
treeMap f (Leaf x) = Leaf (f x)
treeMap f (Branch left right) = Branch (treeMap f left) (treeMap f right)
&lt;/source&gt;

As discussed before, we can conceivably define a map-style function for any arbitrary data structure.

When we first introduced &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; in [[../More about lists|More about lists]], we went through the process of taking a very specific function for list elements and generalizing to show how &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; combines any appropriate function with all sorts of lists. Now, we will generalize still ''further''. Instead of map-for-lists and map-for-trees and other distinct maps, how about a general concept of maps for all sorts of mappable types?

== Introducing &lt;tt&gt;Functor&lt;/tt&gt; ==

&lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; is a Prelude class for types which can be mapped over. It has a single method, called &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt;. The class is defined as follows:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
class  Functor f  where
    fmap        :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; f a -&gt; f b
&lt;/source&gt;

The usage of the type variable &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; can look a little strange at first. Here, &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; is a parametrized data type; in the signature of &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; takes &lt;code&gt;a&lt;/code&gt; as a type parameter in one of its appearances and &lt;code&gt;b&lt;/code&gt; in the other. Let's consider an instance of &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;By replacing &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; we get the following signature for &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt;...

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
fmap        :: (a -&gt; b) -&gt; Maybe a -&gt; Maybe b
&lt;/source&gt;

... which fits the natural definition:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
instance  Functor Maybe  where
    fmap f Nothing    =  Nothing
    fmap f (Just x)   =  Just (f x)
&lt;/source&gt;

(Incidentally, this definition is in Prelude; so, we didn't really need to have implemented &lt;code&gt;maybeMap&lt;/code&gt; for that example in the &quot;Other data structures&quot; chapter.)

The &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; instance for lists (also in Prelude) is simple:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
instance  Functor []  where
    fmap = map
&lt;/source&gt;

... and if we replace &lt;code&gt;f&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt; signature, we get the familiar type of &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;.

So, &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt; is a generalization of &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; for any parametrized data type.&lt;ref&gt;Data structures provide the most intuitive examples; however, there are functors which cannot reasonably be seen as data structures. A commonplace metaphor consists in thinking of functors as containers; like all metaphors, however, it can be stretched only so far.&lt;/ref&gt;

Naturally, we can provide &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; instances for our own data types. In particular, &lt;code&gt;treeMap&lt;/code&gt; can be promptly relocated to an instance:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
instance Functor Tree where
    fmap f (Leaf x) = Leaf (f x)
    fmap f (Branch left right) = Branch (fmap f left) (fmap f right)
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;!--Here there could be a digression about Data.Foldable and the catamorphisms in Other data structures. I fear it would grow too long and winding, though--&gt;

Here's a quick demo of &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt; in action with the instances above (to reproduce it, you only need to load the &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;instance&lt;/code&gt; declarations for &lt;code&gt;Tree&lt;/code&gt;; the others are already in Prelude):

{{HaskellGHCi|1=
*Main&gt; fmap (2*) [1,2,3,4]
[2,4,6,8]
*Main&gt; fmap (2*) (Just 1)
Just 2
*Main&gt; fmap (fmap (2*)) [Just 1, Just 2, Just 3, Nothing]
[Just 2, Just 4, Just 6, Nothing]
*Main&gt; fmap (2*) (Branch (Branch (Leaf 1) (Leaf 2)) (Branch (Leaf 3) (Leaf 4)))
Branch (Branch (Leaf 2) (Leaf 4)) (Branch (Leaf 6) (Leaf 8))
}}

{{body note|1=
Beyond the &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt; examples mentioned here, Prelude provides a number of other handy &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; instances. The full list can be found in GHC's documentation for the {{Haskell lib|v=latest|Control|Monad}} module.
}}

=== The functor laws ===

When providing a new instance of &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt;, you should ensure it satisfies the two functor laws. There is nothing mysterious about these laws; their role is to guarantee &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt; behaves sanely and actually performs a mapping operation (as opposed to some other nonsense).&lt;ref&gt;The functor laws, and indeed the concept of a functor, are grounded on a branch of Mathematics called ''Category Theory'' which should not be a concern for you at this point. We will have opportunities to explore related topics in the Advanced Track of this book.&lt;/ref&gt; The first law is:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
fmap id  ==  id
&lt;/source&gt;

&lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; is the identity function, which returns its argument unaltered. The first law states that mapping &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; over a functor must return the functor unchanged.

Next, the second law:

&lt;source lang=&quot;haskell&quot;&gt;
fmap (f . g)  ==  fmap f . fmap g
&lt;/source&gt;

It states that it should not matter whether we map a composed function or first map one function and then the other (assuming the application order remains the same in both cases).

== What did we gain? ==

At this point, we can ask what benefit we get from the extra layer of generalization brought by the &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt; class. There are two significant advantages:

* The availability of the &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt; method relieves us from having to recall, read, and write a plethora of differently named mapping methods (&lt;code&gt;maybeMap&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;treeMap&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;weirdMap&lt;/code&gt;, ''ad infinitum''). As a consequence, code becomes both cleaner and easier to understand. On spotting a use of &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt;, we instantly have a general idea of what is going on.&lt;ref&gt;This is analogous to the gain in clarity provided by replacing explicit recursive algorithms on lists with implementations based on higher-order functions.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Using the type class system, we can write &lt;code&gt;fmap&lt;/code&gt;-based algorithms which work out of the box with ''any'' functor - be it &lt;code&gt;[]&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Maybe&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Tree&lt;/code&gt; or whichever you need. Indeed, a number of useful classes in the core libraries inherit from &lt;code&gt;Functor&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;''Note for the curious'': For one example, have a peek at [[Haskell/Applicative Functors|Applicative Functors]] in the Advanced Track (for the moment you can ignore the references to monads there).&lt;/ref&gt;.

Type classes make it possible to create general solutions to whole categories of problems. Depending on what you use Haskell for, you may not need to define new classes often, but you will certainly be ''using'' type classes all the time. Many of the most powerful features and sophisticated capabilities of Haskell rely on type classes (residing either in the standard libraries or elsewhere). From this point on, classes will be a prominent presence in our studies.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Examples ==
The analysis presented in this section is valid when the length an object analysis, say ''L'', is much larger than other dimensions and when the applied load is in the direction of ''L''. An example of such a case is a pin jointed truss. When a load is applied to a truss its members carry  compressive (or tensile) load acting such as to shorten (or increase) the length or tensile load.

Let us consider a bar of length L, cross sectional area ''A'' and an elastic modulus ''E''. It is fixed on one of its end and is acted upon a force ''P'' along its length.

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;u&gt;'''Content Management Systems'''&lt;/u&gt;

''Content Management Systems (CMSs)'' are document management systems that can include images, multimedia files and other content in addition to conventional documents. Content Management Systems can include, but are not limited to, ''Document Management'' ''Systems'' ''(DMSs)'' and ''Enterprise Content Management Systems (ECMs).''

Document management, often referred to as ''Document Management Systems (DMS),'' is the use of a computer system and software to store, manage and track electronic documents and electronic images of paper based information captured through the use of a document scanner. The term document is defined as &quot;recorded information or an object which can be treated as a unit&quot;. DM systems allow documents to be modified and managed but typically lack the records retention and disposition functionality for managing records. 

Document management, while still recognized and utilized independently, it is also a common component found within an Enterprise Content Management environment. According to Wikipedia, &quot;''Enterprise Content Management (ECM)'' is a formalized means of organizing and storing an organization's documents, and other content, that relate to the organization's processes. The term encompasses strategies, methods, and tools used throughout the lifecycle of the content&quot;.

The website, AIIM.org, refers to Enterprise Content Management (ECM) as, &quot; the strategies, methods and tools used to capture, manage, store, preserve, and deliver content and documents related to organizational processes. ECM tools and strategies allow the management of an organization's unstructured information, wherever that information exists.

As of 2012, the ''Association for Information and Image Management (AIIM)'' gives some examples of unstructured information and examples of their classifications and how they might be organized using a content management system.
Below are examples found on their website AIIM.org:

'''''Content and Documents'''''

Unstructured content enters an organization's IT infrastructure from a variety of sources. Regardless of how a piece of content enters, it has a lifecycle. Follow a document through its lifecycle as viewed through the use of ECM technology.
1.Electronic Unstructured Data: email, instant message, text document, spreadsheet, etc. 
2.Electronic Forms 
3.Paper Documents/Forms 

'''Scanning''' 

Paper generally enters the organization through a scanner, or sometimes, a multifunction device. In centralized scan operations, large volumes of paper are put into the system by dedicated workers. In distributed operations, smaller volumes of documents are captured with lower volume scanners or multifunction devices closer to their point of creation.

'''Document Imaging''' 

Software captures the image of the paper document. Increasingly, electronic document images have the same legal status as a paper document.

'''Forms Processing'''

Business forms are ingested into the system. Most forms today are &quot;structured&quot;-the location of the form elements are known. The ability to process unstructured forms, those without a pre-defined form template, is improving.

'''Recognition'''

Technologies that allow paper information to be translated to electronic data without manual data input. Recognition technologies have progressive capabilities from optical character recognition (OCR) to intelligent character recognitions (ICR) and are important for converting large amounts of forms or unstructured data to usable information in a content management system.

'''Categorization/Taxonomy''' 

A taxonomy provides a formal structure for information, based on the individual needs of a business. Categorization tools automate the placement of content (document images, email, text documents, i.e., all electronic content) for future retrieval based on the taxonomy. Users can also manually categorize documents. Critical step to ensure that content is properly stored.

'''Indexing'''

An essential part of the capture process, creates metadata from scanned documents (customer ID number, for example) so the document can be found. Indexing can be based on keywords or full-text.

'''Document Management'''

Document management technology helps organizations better manage the creation, revision, approval, and consumption of electronic documents. It provides key features such as library services, document profiling, searching, check-in, check-out, version control, revision history, and document security.

'''Records Management''' 

Content of long-term business value are deemed records and managed according to a retention schedule that determines how long a record is kept based on either outside regulations or internal business practices. Any piece of content can be designated a record.

'''Email Management''' 

As the de facto standard for business communication, removing emails from the server and saving them to a repository isn't enough. Email must be classified, stored, and destroyed consistent with business standards-just as any other document or record.

'''Web Content Management''' 

Web content management technology addresses the content creation, review, approval, and publishing processes of Web-based content. Key features include creation and authoring tools or integrations, input and presentation template design and management, content re-use management, and dynamic publishing capabilities.

'''Digital Asset Management''' 

Similar in functionality to document management, DAM is focused on the storage, tracking, and use of rich media documents (video, logos, photographs, xrays, sonograms,etc.). Roots of the technology are in the media and entertainment industry, currently experiencing growth, especially in marketing departments. Digital assets typically have high intellectual property values.

[[File:CeBIT_2006_Chi_Mei_Optoelectronics_56LCD_QuadHDTV_digital_radiography_Digitalroentgen_by_HDTVTotalDOTcom.jpg|100px|thumb|Digital Radiography]]Digital radiology may represent the greatest technological advancement in medical imaging over the last decade. The use of radiographic films in x ray imaging might become obsolete in a few years. Images can be immediately acquired, deleted, modified, and subsequently sent to a network of computers. The referring physician can view the requested image on a desktop or a personal computer and often report in just a few minutes after the examination was performed. The images are no longer held in a single location; but can be seen simultaneously by physicians who are miles apart. In addition, the patient can have the x ray images on a compact disk to take to another physician or hospital.

      <text xml:space="preserve">The framing effect is a cognitive bias in which diverging results tend to be produced from the same choice problem when being described differently.&lt;ref&gt;Bourgeois-Gironde, Sacha, and Raphael Giraud. &quot;Accounting for Framing Effects: an Informational Approach to Intensionality in the Bolker-Jeffrey Decision Model.&quot; (2005): n. page. Web. 4 Apr. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example==

In their study, Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman propose an example to illustrate this.  They provide a problem, and two different sets of choices.&lt;ref&gt;Tversky, Amos, and David Kahneman. &quot;The Framing of Decisions and the Psychology of Choice.&quot; Science. 211.4481 (1981): 453-458. Web. 4 Apr. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Survey Question'''
The United States is preparing for an outbreak of a disease expected to kill 600 people.  There are two programs set forth to combat this disease. Pick one.

'''Scenario 1'''
Given this question, two choices were made available to the study group.  In choice A, 200 people will live.  In choice B there is a 1 in 3 chance that everyone will live, and a 2 in 3 chance that nobody will live.

Under these choices, most people were risk averse, and chose A to save 200 people no matter what. 72% chose A, while 28% chose B

'''Scenario 2'''
For a second study group, the same question was presented, but with differently worded questions.  In choice C, 400 people will die.  In choice D, there is a 1 in 3 chance that nobody will die, and a 2 in 3 probability that 600 people will die.

Under this second set of choices, most people acted as risk takers; they would rather take the chance on everyone living than on 400 people dying for sure. 78% chose D (equivalent of B), while 22% chose C (equivalent of A).

==Results==
In reality, each one of these four choices leads to the same expected outcome, so risk neutrality would suggest that there is no difference between which one is chosen.&lt;ref name=Dalton&gt;Dalton, Thomas. Complexity, Institutions and Economic Activity. 2nd. Dubuque, IA: Kendall Hunt, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  Choices A and C are identical, as are choices B and D. The way in which these questions are presented to an individual greatly affects the decision making process.  This shows a weakness in the ability of individuals to make rational decisions.  The Tversky and Kahneman study shows that individuals are risk seeking when the choice is between a certain loss and a potential larger loss, and individuals are risk averting when faced with deciding between a certain gain and a potential larger gain.&lt;ref name=Dalton /&gt;

==Significance==
The use of framing effects can have significant implications on society in many ways.  The way something is framed has been shown to alter expected utility.  The Expected Utility Theory has four assumptions, one of them being invariance, which states that differing representations of the same choice problem should not affect choice.&lt;ref name=Druckman&gt;Druckman, James. &quot;Using Credible Advice to Overcome Framing Effects.&quot; Journal of Law, Economics, and Organization. 17.1 62-82. Print. &lt;/ref&gt;  This broadly affects society in that any question can be presented in a way that encourages answers to the surveyor's preference. An example of this is that people are more likely to support an economic policy resulting in 90% employment rather than one that results in 10% unemployment. &lt;ref name=Druckman /&gt;

''Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 106 and 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include—
(1) the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a
commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;
(2) the nature of the copyrighted work;
(3) the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted
work as a whole; and
(4) the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted
work.
The fact that a work is unpublished shall not itself bar a finding of fair use if
such finding is made upon consideration of all the above factors.''

      <text xml:space="preserve">&lt;noinclude&gt;{{C sharp/Navigation}}&lt;/noinclude&gt;

== Casting ==

Casting is a way to convert values from one type to another. Mainly, two types of casting exist:

===Implicit casting===

Implicit casting is the way values are cast automatically by the compiler. This happens if and only if no loss of information occurs. Examples can be seen when converting data from smaller integral types to larger types, or derived types to the base type.

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
int iValue = 4711;

double dDistance = iValue ;

public class Animal { […] };

public class Mammal : Animal { […] };

public class Cat : Mammal
{
    […]
}

Mammal mammal = new Cat();
&lt;/source&gt;

===Explicit casting===

This type of casting has to be specified by the developer, as a loss of data is possible.

&lt;source lang=CSharp&gt;
double dPi = 3.1415926535;

int iValue = (int)dPi;   // iValue = 3
&lt;/source&gt;

'''Trafficking in substance'''&lt;br&gt;
5. (1) No person shall traffic in a substance included in Schedule I, II, III or IV or in any substance represented or held out by that person to be such a substance.
&lt;br&gt;
(2) No person shall, for the purpose of trafficking, possess a substance included in Schedule I, II, III or IV.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Punishment'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) Every person who contravenes subsection (1) or (2)
:(a) subject to subsection (4), where the subject-matter of the offence is a substance included in Schedule I or II, is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for life;&lt;br&gt;
...&lt;br&gt;
'''Punishment in respect of specified substance'''&lt;br&gt;
(4) Every person who contravenes subsection (1) or (2), where the subject-matter of the offence is a substance included in Schedule II in an amount that does not exceed the amount set out for that substance in Schedule VII, is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years less a day.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Punishment'''&lt;br&gt;
(5) Every person who contravenes subsection (1) where the subject-matter of the offence is a substance included in Schedule II in an amount that does not exceed the amount set out for that substance in Schedule VIII is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction and liable to a fine not exceeding one thousand dollars or to imprisonment for a term not exceeding six months, or to both.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Interpretation'''&lt;br&gt;
(6) For the purposes of subsection (4) and Schedule VII, the amount of the substance means the entire amount of any mixture or substance, or the whole of any plant, that contains a detectable amount of the substance.
&lt;br&gt;

Schedule VII sets cannabis resin and cannabis marijuana at 3kg.

Schedule VIII sets the cannabis resin at 1 g and cannabis marijuana at 30 g.

==Schedule II: Marijuana, Hash, etc.==
:''For principles on Drug Offences Generally, see [[Canadian Criminal Sentencing/Offences/Drug Offences|Drug Offences]]''

Offenders found trafficking in a Schedule II controlled substance (e.g. Cannabinoids) in an amount greater than 3kg are liable for an indictable offence with a maximum penalty of life in jail. Where the amount is equal or less than 3kg, the offender is liable for an indictable offence with a maximum penalty of 5 years jail.

The primary sentencing principles for these offences involving soft drugs are protection of the public through denunciation and deterrence.
&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Butt, (2007), 265 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 98 (N.L.S.C.)
R. v. Murray, [http://canlii.ca/t/frn0m 2012 ABPC 123] at 92
&lt;/ref&gt;

The courts do recognize a distinction between hard and soft drugs, where soft drugs are treated less seriously from hard drugs.

Trafficking in cannabis is typically a sentence of incarceration.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Butt and Gallant 1993 CanLII 7743 (NL CA), (1993), 106 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 92 (N.L.C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;
There has been a benchmark set by some courts of 6 months.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. McKie (1981), 29 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 181 (P.E.I.C.A.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

The upper range of marijuana trafficking is typically 12 months jail and above.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Chen, [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2007/2007onca230/2007onca230.html 2007 ONCA 230] (18 months jail)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Nguyen (2007), 227 C.C.C. (6th) 356 (C.A.) (15 months )&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

The mid range of sentence is around 12 months on a conditional sentence order.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Imoro, [20011] O.J. No. 996 &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Nagtzaam, [2009] O.J. No. 5409 (O.C.J.)
&lt;/ref&gt; Though will be actual jail in certain cases.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Do, [2002] O.J. No. 5491 (O.C.J.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The lower end of the range is around 6 months jail, served either conditionally or on a straight-time basis.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Schweitzer, [2000] O.J. No. 5228 (O.C.J.) (5 months jail)&lt;br&gt;
 R. v. Stover, [2004] O.J. No. 3736 (O.C.J.) (4 months CSO)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

At the very lowest end there will be the rare granting of suspended sentences, fines, or discharges.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Small [http://canlii.ca/en/bc/bcca/doc/2001/2001bcca91/2001bcca91.html 2001 BCCA 91]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Lucas, [2002] B.C.J. No. 1631 (Prov. Ct.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/reF&gt; This usually involves exceptional circumstances such as the offenders position in the community or a benevolent intent behind the act.

Alberta does not have a starting point for sentence on soft drugs. However, the norm is for a sentence of incarceration regardless of prior record with a range between 6 and 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Murray, [http://canlii.ca/t/frn0m 2012 ABPC 123]  at para. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Attempt to commit murder'''&lt;br&gt;
239. (1) Every person who attempts by any means to commit murder is guilty of an indictable offence and liable
:(a) if a restricted firearm or prohibited firearm is used in the commission of the offence or if any firearm is used in the commission of the offence and the offence is committed for the benefit of, at the direction of, or in association with, a criminal organization, to imprisonment for life and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of
::(i) in the case of a first offence, five years, and
::(ii) in the case of a second or subsequent offence, seven years;
:(a.1) in any other case where a firearm is used in the commission of the offence, to imprisonment for life and to a minimum punishment of imprisonment for a term of four years; and
:(b) in any other case, to imprisonment for life.
&lt;p&gt;
'''Subsequent offences'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) In determining, for the purpose of paragraph (1)(a), whether a convicted person has committed a second or subsequent offence, if the person was earlier convicted of any of the following offences, that offence is to be considered as an earlier offence:
:(a) an offence under this section;
:(b) an offence under subsection 85(1) or (2) or section 244 or 244.2; or
:(c) an offence under section 220, 236, 272 or 273, subsection 279(1) or section 279.1, 344 or 346 if a firearm was used in the commission of the offence. However, an earlier offence shall not be taken into account if 10 years have elapsed between the day on which the person was convicted of the earlier offence and the day on which the person was convicted of the offence for which sentence is being imposed, not taking into account any time in custody.
&lt;p&gt;
'''Sequence of convictions only'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) For the purposes of subsection (2), the only question to be considered is the sequence of convictions and no consideration shall be given to the sequence of commission of offences or whether any offence occurred before or after any conviction.

==Proof of the Offence==
In addition to the essential elements of time, location, and identity, the prosecution should prove:
# the manner in which the attempt occurred
# injuries, if any, to the victim
# there was no consent 
# there was no provocation 
# there was an intent to kill

==Interpretation==


The ''mens rea'' required for attempted murder is that there must be a specific &quot;intent to kill&quot;, not simply an intention to harm with consequences that could have led to death. Nor is it enough that he knows his actions are likely to cause death or was reckless to the possible consequences. There must be subjective foresight of the consequences of the accused's conduct.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Ancio, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 225&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Logan, Logan and Johnson, [1990] 2 S.C.R. 731&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Reeves, 2012 BCCA 98 (CanLII) at para. 10 (&quot;The Crown must prove the accused acted with subjective foresight of the consequences of his conduct. Objective foresight of the consequences will not suffice.&quot;)
&lt;/ref&gt;

Life threatening wounds alone is not sufficient evidence of an intent to kill. There must be evidence from which the trier of fact may infer that the accused intended something more than the actual or natural consequence of his wounding act.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Roberts, [http://www.canlii.org/en/sk/skqb/doc/2006/2006skqb441/2006skqb441.html 2006 SKQB 441] at para. 8 &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Ross, [http://www.canlii.org/en/mb/mbca/doc/2003/2003mbca70/2003mbca70.html 2003 MBCA 70] conviction overturned&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; However, some wounds provide evidence of intent to kill. For example, a shot is to the head may be evidence of intent to kill. It is a question of degree having regard to all of the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;supra.&lt;/ref&gt;

The crown must prove a specific ''intent to kill'' at the time of the actions. &lt;ref&gt;
R. v. J.M. (1995), 134 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 161 (NFPC) acquitted because accused changed her mind&lt;/ref&gt; Anything less would amount to a violation of section 7 of the Charter.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Ancio, [1984] 1 S.C.R. 225 (SCC) &lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Logan, [1990] S.C.J. No. 89 (SCC)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''intent to kill'' is often established by way of utterances of the accused of their desire to cause death.&lt;ref&gt;
for example:&lt;br&gt;
R. v. A.D.Y. (1992), 11 B.C.A.C. 154 (CA)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

When deliberating on consent, a jury can be instructed to rely on the common sense inference that &quot;a person usually knows what the predictable consequences of his or her actions are, and means to bring them about&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Walle, 2012 SCC 41 (CanLII) at para. 64 per Moldaver J.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
The primary consideration is denunciation and deterrence.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. T.H., [2005] O.J. No. 5849 (S.C.J.), para. 24;&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Situ, [2006] O.J. No. 1990 (C.J.), para. 12;&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Thompson, [2009] O.J. No. 1109, (C.A.), paragraph 26); &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Johnston, [2009]
N.S.J. No. 349 (S.C.), paragraph 46); &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Clarke, [2010] O.J. No. 325 (S.C.J.), 16 para.63
&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the attempted murder, in particular a shooting, occurred in a public place is an aggravating factor.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Chanda, [1997] O.J. No.
6315 (Ont. C. J.) at para. 6,7;&lt;br&gt; R. v. Melanson, [1998] N.B. J. No. 140
(C.A.), para. 11;&lt;Br&gt; 
R. v. Currie, [2002] O.J. No. 2191 (C.A.), para. 83;&lt;Br&gt; 
R. v. T.H., [2005] O.J. No. 5849 (Ont. C.J.), para. 31;&lt;Br&gt; 
R. v. Gordon, [2009] O.J. No. 724 (C.A.), para. 86;&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Thompson, [2009] O.J. No. 1109(C.A.), Para. 26; &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Guedez-Infante, [2009] O.J. No. 4351(C.A.), para. 5; &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Clarke, [2010] O.J. No. 325 (S.C.J.), para. 29;&lt;Br&gt; 
R. v. Kipp, [2010] B.C.J. No. 762 (S.C.), para. 81;&lt;br&gt;
R. v. LeBlanc, [2010] N.S.J. No. 490 (S.C.), para. 5, 24&lt;/ref&gt;

A serious gun offence where a person is wounded by a gun shot will range from 7 to 11 years.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Bellissimo, [2009] O.J. No. 179 (C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt; However, attempted murder with a firearm is in the range of 10 years to life regardless of the role played.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Smith, 2011 NSSC 413 at 28&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cyclic groups ==

In the previous section about subgroups we saw that if &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a group with &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt;, then the set of powers of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\langle g \rangle = \{g^n\mid n\in\mathbb{Z}\}&lt;/math&gt; constituted a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, called the ''cyclic subgroup generated by &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;''. In this, section, we will generalize this concept, and in the process, obtain an important family of groups which is very rich in structure.

'''Definition 1:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group with an element &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\langle g \rangle = G&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''cyclic'' group, and &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''generator'' of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Alternatively, &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt; is said to ''generate'' &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. If there exists an integer &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;g^n=e&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest positive such integer, &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is denoted &lt;math&gt;C_n&lt;/math&gt;, the cyclic group of order &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. If no such integer exists, &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is denoted &lt;math&gt;C_\infty&lt;/math&gt;, the infinite cyclic group.


The infinite cyclic group can also be denoted &lt;math&gt;F_{\{g\}}&lt;/math&gt;, the ''free group'' with one generator. This is foreshadowing for a future section and can be ignored for now.


'''Theorem 2:''' Any cyclic group is abelian.

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a cyclic group with generator &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;. Then if &lt;math&gt;h,k\in G&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;h=g^n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k=g^m&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;n,m\in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. To show commutativity, observe that &lt;math&gt;hk=g^ng^m=g^{n+m}=g^{m+n}=g^mg^n=kh&lt;/math&gt; and we are done. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 3:''' Any subgroup of a cyclic group is cyclic.

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a cyclic group with generator &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, and let &lt;math&gt;H\leq G&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;G=\langle g \rangle&lt;/math&gt;, in paticular every element of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; equals &lt;math&gt;g^n&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;n\in\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. We claim that if &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; the lowest positive integer such that &lt;math&gt;g^a\in H&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;H=\langle g^a \rangle&lt;/math&gt;. To see this, let &lt;math&gt;g^n\in H&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;n=qa+r&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0\leq r &lt; a&lt;/math&gt; for unique &lt;math&gt;q,r\in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup and &lt;math&gt;g^a\in H&lt;/math&gt;, we must have &lt;math&gt;g^n (g^a)^{-q}=g^{qa+r}g^{-qa}=g^r\in H&lt;/math&gt;. Now, assume that &lt;math&gt;r&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;g^r\in H&lt;/math&gt; contradicts our assumption that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the least positive integer such that &lt;math&gt;g^a\in H&lt;/math&gt;. Therefore, &lt;math&gt;r=0&lt;/math&gt;. Consequently, &lt;math&gt;g^n\in H&lt;/math&gt; only if &lt;math&gt;n=qa&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;H=\langle g^a \rangle&lt;/math&gt; and is cyclic, as was to be shown. {{Unicode|∎}}

As the alert reader will have noticed, the preceeding proof invoked the notion of ''division with remainder'' which should be familiar from number theory. Our treatment of cyclic groups will have close ties with notions from number theory. This is no coincidence, as the next few statements will show. Indeed, an alternative title for this section could have been &quot;Modular arithmetic and integer ideals&quot;. The notion of an ''ideal'' may not yet be familiar to the reader, who is asked to wait patiently until the chapter about rings.


'''Theorem 4:''' Let &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n=\{0,1,2,...,n-1\}&lt;/math&gt; with addition defined modulo &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. That is &lt;math&gt;a+b\equiv r \,\mathrm{mod}\,n&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;a+b=qn+r&lt;/math&gt;. We denote this operation by &lt;math&gt;a+_nb=r&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{Z}_n,+_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a cyclic group.

''Proof'': We must first show that &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{Z}_n,+_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a group, then find a generator. We verify the group axioms. Associativity is inherited from the integers. The element &lt;math&gt;0\in Z_n&lt;/math&gt; is an identity element with respect to &lt;math&gt;+_n&lt;/math&gt;. An inverse of &lt;math&gt;a\in Z_n&lt;/math&gt; is an element &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a +_n b=0&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;b+a|n&lt;/math&gt;. Then, &lt;math&gt;b\equiv n-a \equiv -a \,\mathrm{mod}\,n&lt;/math&gt;, and so &lt;math&gt;b=n-a=-a&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{Z}_n,+_n)&lt;/math&gt; is a group. Now, since &lt;math&gt;a=a\cdot 1 = \underbrace{1+...+1}_{a\,\mathrm{terms}}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; generates &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{Z}_n,+_n)&lt;/math&gt; is cyclic. {{Unicode|∎}}

Unless we explicitly state otherwise, by &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt; we  will always refer to the cyclic group &lt;math&gt;(\mathbb{Z}_n,+_n)&lt;/math&gt;. Since the argument for the generator of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt; can be made valid for any integer &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;, this shows that also &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is cyclic with the generator &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Theorem 5:''' An element &lt;math&gt;a\in\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt; is a generator if and only if &lt;math&gt;\gcd(a,n)=1&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': We will need the following theorem from number theory: If &lt;math&gt;m,n&lt;/math&gt; are integers, then there exists integers &lt;math&gt;r,s&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;rm+sn=1&lt;/math&gt;, if and only if &lt;math&gt;\gcd(m,n)=1&lt;/math&gt;. We will not prove this here. A proof can be found in the number theory section.

For the right implication, assume that &lt;math&gt;\langle a \rangle = \mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt;. Then for all &lt;math&gt;b\in \mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;b\equiv pa \,\mathrm{mod}\, n&lt;/math&gt; for some integer &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. In paticular, there exists an integer &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;sa\equiv 1 \,\mathrm{mod}\,n&lt;/math&gt;. This implies that there exists another integer &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;sa-rn=1&lt;/math&gt;. By the above-mentioned theorem from number theory, we then have &lt;math&gt;\gcd(a,n)=1&lt;/math&gt;. For the left implication, assume &lt;math&gt;\gcd(a,n)=1&lt;/math&gt;. Then there exists integers &lt;math&gt;s,r&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;sa-rn=1 \,\Rightarrow\, sa\equiv 1 \,\mathrm{mod}\,n&lt;/math&gt;, implying that &lt;math&gt;sa=1&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; generates &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt;, it must be true that &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is also a generator, proving the theorem. {{Unicode|∎}}


We can generalize Theorem 5 a bit by looking at the orders of the elements in cyclic groups.


'''Theorem 6:''' Let &lt;math&gt;H=\langle g \rangle \leq \mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt;. Then, &lt;math&gt;|H|=|a|=\frac{n}{\gcd(a,n)}&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Recall that the order of &lt;math&gt;a\in \mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt; is defined as the lowest positive integer &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;ra=0&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\langle g \rangle&lt;/math&gt; is cyclic, there exists an integer &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;ra=sn&lt;/math&gt; is minimal and positive. This is the definition of the least common multiple; &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{lcm}(a,n)=ra=|a|a&lt;/math&gt;. Recall from number theory that &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{lcm}(a,n)\cdot \gcd(a,n)=an&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;|a|=\frac{\mathrm{lcm}(a,n)}{a}=\frac{an}{a\cdot \gcd(a,n)}=\frac{n}{\gcd(a,n)}&lt;/math&gt;, as was to be proven. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 7:''' Every subgroup of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is of the form &lt;math&gt;n\mathbb{Z}=\{na\mid a\in \mathbb{Z}\}&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': The fact that any subgroup of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is cyclic follows from Theorem 3. Therefore, let &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; generate &lt;math&gt;H\leq G&lt;/math&gt;. Then we see immediately that &lt;math&gt;H=n\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 8:''' Let &lt;math&gt;a,b\in\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; be fixed, and let &lt;math&gt;H=\{ra+sb|r,s\in \mathbb{Z}\}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; generated by &lt;math&gt;\gcd(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': We msut first show that &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup. This is immediate since &lt;math&gt;(ra+sb)-(r^\prime a + s^\prime b) = (r-r^\prime)a+(s-s^\prime)b\in H&lt;/math&gt;. From the proof of Theorem 3, we see that any subgroup of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is generated by its lowest positive element. It is a theorem of number theory that the lowest positive integer &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;d=ra+sb&lt;/math&gt; for fixed integers &lt;math&gt;a,b&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r,s\in\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; equals the greatest common divisor of &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;\gcd(a,b)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;\gcd(a,b)&lt;/math&gt; generates &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 9:''' Let &lt;math&gt;n\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; be subgroups of &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;n\mathbb{Z}\cap m\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is the subgroup generated by &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{lcm}(n,m)&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': The fact that &lt;math&gt;n\mathbb{Z}\cap m\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup is obvious since &lt;math&gt;n\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; are subgroups. To find a generator of &lt;math&gt;n\mathbb{Z}\cap m\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;, we must find its lowest positive element. That is, the lowest positive integer &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is both a multiple of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and of &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;. This is the definition of the least common multiple of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;m&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{lcm}(n,m)&lt;/math&gt;, and the result follows. {{Unicode|∎}}


It should be obvious by now that &lt;math&gt;C_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;C_\infty&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt; are the ''same groups''. This will be made precise in a later section but can be visualized by denoting any generator of &lt;math&gt;C_n&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;C_\infty&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;.

We will have more to say about cyclic groups later, when we have more tools at our disposal.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Application Lifecycle Management (ALM) is a broad term to describe creating and managing an application throughout its entire life cycle, from design through coding and testing to maintenance and eventually to retirement. ALM software typically has several integrated components that work together for a variety of tasks, such as those that take place during the system design and program development process, and are designed to automate, manage, and simplify the program development process. Many ALM programs include program design tools such as, those used to create data flow diagrams, structure charts, and other tools and the ability to generate the program code from the finished design to create the application.

==Optionally Included Tools==

===Requirements Management===
:Requirement management is the process of tracking and managing requirement definitions as they are created and modified through the development process.  This process is crucial to avoiding costly mistakes and to provide a finished product meets the requirements set forth at the start of the project.

===Configuration Management===
:Configuration management refers to the broad scope of tracking the entire program development process.  Several aspects that are tracked include all components used in the final program, revisions, backups of versions during the process and final, and security and control.  Tracking these events allows only authorized users to alter the program and to never lose progress with the backups.

===Issue Tracking===
:Issue tracking is the process of recording bugs, assigning them to personnel to fix them, and then tracking their status along that process.  This process persists after the finish product is released and other issues are identified during use.&lt;ref&gt;Morley, Deborah and Parker, Charles S. &quot;Understanding Computers Today and Tomorrow 13th Edition&quot;&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:FaultTrack FreeEdition.png|thumb|Issue Tracking Software]]

      <text xml:space="preserve">An entity is something of importance to a business or organization. When the entity is something an organization or business wants to store, it becomes a database table. There are three different relationships between entities. The first is one-to-one entity relationships. This exists when one entity is related to only one other entity of a particular type. For example, a business has multiple stores, each store location has a single manager, the relationship between store and manager is 1:1. The second relationship is one-to-many entity relationship. These are the most common relationships and exist when one entity can be related to more than one other entity. For example, if a supplier supplies more than one product to the company, the relationship between the supplier and the products is O:M. The last relationship is many-to-many entity relationship. This relationship exists when one entity can be related to multiple entities of the same type of the original entity. For example, if an order can contain multiple products and one product can appear on many orders, the relationship between orders and products is M:M.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Bits ==

In a digital circuit, the smallest unit of data is the '''bit''', which derives its name from the phrase '''binary digit'''. Any single bit can only exist in one of two possible states. These states are most often represented as either '''one (1)''' or '''zero (0)'''. Other possible representations used are true and false, or off and on, but one and zero are the most common ways to represent the data a bit holds.

In a physical digital circuit, ones and zeros are represented by high and low voltages, respectively. Reasonable voltages within a digital circuit might be 5 volts representing a 1 and zero volts representing a 0. The realities of digital circuits are a bit more complicated than this, but for now this will serve as an adequate abstraction. Understanding how to handle digital information does not require a complete knowledge of how the underlying circuits work.

== Bytes ==

A single bit has limited use, since it can only represent two states. To overcome this limitation, digital circuit designers use groups of bits to represent data more complex than 1 and 0. If you group two bits together, each bit can take on a 1 or 0 value independent of the other bit. This means that the two bits together can represent four different states, 00, 01, 10 and 11. As you group more bits together you can represent a larger number of states. Three bits can represent eight states and four bits can represent sixteen states. If you have a group of ''n'' bits, that group of bits can represent 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; different states.

Early computers used groups of bits of various different sizes, but eventually industry practice converged on the use of groupings of eight bits. Today, a group of eight bits is known as a '''byte'''. The term &quot;byte&quot; is a respelling of the word &quot;bite,&quot; in order to avoid the problem of a typo causing the two words to be mistaken for one another. If you have ever heard of an eight bit computer, what that means is that the digital circuits within the computer are designed to primarily handle single bytes. One famous instance of an eight bit computer is the original Nintendo Entertainment System.

=== Nibble ===

The value of a byte can be represented using eight digits, like so.

 10010110

Even though this is only eight digits, it can be a difficult for a person to read. One way to increase readability is to use some type of spacer or delimiter. We do this all the time with phone numbers (123-555-8765) or social security numbers (XXX-XX-XXXX). A common way to divide a byte is by placing a single space between the two halves of the byte, like so.

 1001 0110

When dividing a byte into halves like this, each half is called a '''nibble''' (because a nibble is a &quot;small byte&quot;). Few computers handle nibbles independently, although they do exist. Nibbles are usually only a convenient way to represent data organized into bytes.

== Word ==

Modern computers are built to handle pieces of digital data larger than a byte. These larger units of data are called '''words'''. The term word is a bit problematic, because its definition is not as strictly defined as a byte. A word could be any group of bits of a particular size, but most often a word is some number of bytes grouped together. Occasionally there will be a computer part that deals with an unusual word size, like 13 bits, but the most common word sizes are 16 bits, 32 bits and 64 bits.

The three common word sizes are sometimes referred to with specific names. The term '''word''' gets reused in this context to specifically mean a 16 bit word. A 32 bit word is called a '''double word''', and a 64 bit word is a '''quad word'''. The reuse of the term &quot;word&quot; to mean any group of bits, or specifically a group of 16 bits can be confusing. Most of the time it won't matter too much, but you will have to rely on the specific context to determine which meaning applies.

      <comment>/* Meaning of a &quot;Search&quot; */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
The relevant Charter provision states under the heading of &quot;legal rights&quot;:
{{quotation|8. Everyone has the right to be secure against unreasonable search or seizure.}}

Privacy is &quot;at the heart of liberty in a modern state&quot;.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Edwards, [1996] 1 SCR 128&lt;/ref&gt; It is &quot;essential for the well-being of the individual&quot; and has a profound significance for the public order.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; R v Edwards at 61&lt;/ref&gt; It is also a “protean concept”, meaning that it tends to be highly variable and change.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Tessling 2004 SCC 67 at para. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

The purpose of the right under s. 8 is to protect &quot;the citizen's right to a reasonable expectation of privacy&quot; &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Colarusso, 1994 CanLII 134 (SCC), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 20 at [http://canlii.ca/t/1frw6#par70 70]&lt;/ref&gt; and to &quot;prevent unreasonable intrusions on privacy, not to sort them out from unreasonable intrusions on an ex post facto analysis&quot;. 
&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Feeney, [1997] 2 S.C.R. 13 at 47&lt;/ref&gt; It is for this reason that the principle of reasonable expectation of privacy is a &quot;normative rather than a descriptive standard&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;R v Tessling at para. 42&lt;/ref&gt;

The right is concerned with balancing the state's interest in law enforcement and privacy interests of persons.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Tessling, 2004 SCC 67, [2004] 3 S.C.R. 432 at 17&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; It is only when the state can &quot;demonstrate the superiority of its interest to that of the individual&quot; that a search can be valid.&lt;ref&gt;
Hunter et al. v. Southam Inc., [http://canlii.ca/t/1mgc1 1984 CanLII 33] (SCC), [1984] 2 SCR 145 at p.160&lt;/ref&gt; This point exists where there is reasonable and probable cause which lies at the point where &quot;point where credibly-based probability replaces suspicion&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
Hunter et al. v. Southam Inc at p. 114, 115&lt;/ref&gt;

Under this section police are prohibited from &quot;unreasonable&quot; searches. The inquiry of the lawfulness of a search is based on whether the search was &quot;reasonable&quot; in the circumstances. The circumstances include the nature of the duty performed as well as the purpose of the search.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Nicolosi 1998 CanLII 2006 (ON C.A.) [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1998/1998canlii2006/1998canlii2006.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

A search is only subject to Constitutional review where the search intrudes on a reasonable expectation of privacy of the accused.
&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Edwards 1996 CanLII 255 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 128 at para. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Only where the privacy right exists that there is an inquiry into the reasonableness of the search.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Edwards, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 126 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1996/1996canlii255/1996canlii255.html]; Hunter v. Southam Inc., 1984 CanLII 33 (S.C.C.), [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145.&lt;/ref&gt;

A lawful search must be (a) authorized by law; (b) the law itself must be reasonable; and (c) the manner in which the search was carried out must be reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. S.A.B.,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2003/2003scc60/2003scc60.html 2003 SCC 60]; R v Collins, 1987 CanLII 84 (SCC)&lt;/ref&gt;

A search consists of any state interference of a person's privacy interests.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Law, 2002 SCC 10, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 227, at para 15&lt;/ref&gt; As such, there is little distinction between the initial intrusion itself and the search subsequent to intrusion. &lt;Ref&gt;R. v. McCormack, [2000] B.C.J. No. 143 (B.C.C.A.) at para 5&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Meaning of a &quot;Search&quot;==

Any police conduct interfering with a reasonable expectation of privacy is a &quot;search&quot;.&lt;Ref&gt;
Hunter v. Southam Inc., 1984 CanLII 33 (SCC), [1984] 2 S.C.R. 145&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Edwards, 1996 CanLII 255 (SCC), [1996] 1 S.C.R. 128&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Law, 2002 SCC 10, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 227 at para. 15&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Wise, 1992 CanLII 125 (SCC), [1992] 1 S.C.R. 527 at 533 (only “[i]f the police activity invades a reasonable expectation of privacy, [that] the activity is a search”) 
&lt;/ref&gt;

Any &quot;inspection is a search&quot; where where a &quot;person has a reasonable privacy interest in the object or subject matter of the state action and the information to which it gives access&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Cole, [http://canlii.ca/t/ft969 2012 SCC 53] (CanLII), at para. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

Knocking at the door for an investigative purpose is not a search.&lt;Ref&gt;
See R v MacDonald, 2012 NSCA 50 at 19&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Hope, 2007 NSCA 103 at para. 27 &lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Evans, [1996] 1 S.C.R. 8 at para. 8&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

However, going onto private property and peering into windows while attempting to detect odours of marijuana can constitute a search.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Kokesch 1990 CanLII 55 (SCC), (1990), 61 C.C.C. (3d) 207 (S.C.C.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Merely peering into a car windows at night using a flash-light while the car in on a public highway is not a search.&lt;ref&gt;
See R. v. Mellenthin 1992 CanLII 50 (SCC), (1992), 76 C.C.C. (3d) 481 (S.C.C.) at 486-87
&lt;/ref&gt;

Detection of an odour of marijuana from a bag, by an officer using his own senses, while performing other duties does not constitute a search.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Rajaratnam, 2006 ABCA 333, 2006 ABCA 333, 67 Alta. L.R. (4th) 22&lt;/ref&gt; This is distinct from detection with the use of technology, such as a sniffer dog or a FLIR device.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. R v Tessling [2004] 3 S.C.R. 432, 2004 SCC 67&lt;/ref&gt;

However, police observations of stains on a shirt visible to the public is not a search.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Hamadeh, [http://canlii.ca/t/2fw3p 2011 ONSC 1241] at 132 to 145&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Meaning of &quot;Seizure&quot;==

A &quot;seizure&quot; in essence is the &quot;taking of a thing from a person by a public authority without that person's consent&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Dyment, 1988 CanLII 10, [1988] 2 S.C.R. 417 at para. 26&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Law, 2002 SCC 10, [2002] 1 S.C.R. 227 at para. 15&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
An individual who gives something to an officer does not constitute a seizure. Rather it is merely the receipt of a thing.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Wills, [http://canlii.ca/t/1npnl 1992 CanLII 2780] (ON CA) at p. 347-348&lt;Br&gt;
Illinois v. Rodrigues, 110 S. Ct 2793 (1999) &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Any &quot;taking is a seizure&quot; where &quot;a person has a reasonable privacy interest in the object or subject matter of the state action and the information to which it gives access&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Cole at para. 34&lt;/ref&gt;

A seizure does not have to be connected to a search.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. D.L.W., [http://canlii.ca/t/fts53 2012 BCSC 1700] (CanLII) at para. 63
&lt;/ref&gt;

Valid consent in this context is determined based on indicia such as:&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Wills, [http://canlii.ca/t/1npnl 1992 CanLII 2780] (ON CA) at p. 353&lt;Br&gt;
adopted in R. v. Borden, 1994 CanLII 63 (SCC), [1994] 3 S.C.R. 145, at p. 162&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
#there was a consent, express or implied;
#the giver of the consent had the authority to give the consent in question;
#the consent was voluntary in the sense that that word is used in Goldman, supra, and was not the product of police oppression, coercion or other external conduct which negated the freedom to choose whether or not to allow the police to pursue the course of conduct requested;
#the giver of the consent was aware of the nature of the police conduct to which he or she was being asked to consent;
#the giver of the consent was aware of his or her right to refuse to permit the police to engage in the conduct requested; and,
#the giver of the consent was aware of the potential consequences of giving the consent.

Taking of a photograph by police has been considered a search or seizure.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Abbey, [2006] O.J. No. 4689 (S.C.J.); reversed on other grounds, 97 O.R. (3d) 330 (C.A.), [2010] S.C.C.A. No. 125: police took a photo of the accused's t-shirt after removing it from his body&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Zones of Protection==
The Charter right protects a person's reasonable expectation of privacy. This is a protection of persons ''not'' places.&lt;ref&gt;See Katz v US, 389 US 347 (1967) at p. 351&lt;/ref&gt;  

The right manifests itself in protecting the zones of the person, territory, and information.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Tessling, [http://canlii.ca/t/1j0wb 2004 SCC 67] (CanLII), [2004] 3 SCR 432&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Gomboc, [http://canlii.ca/t/2dhlk 2010 SCC 55], [2010] 3 SCR 211 at para. 19&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Reflist|2}}

===Personal Privacy===
Personal privacy &quot;protects bodily integrity, and in particular not to have our bodies touched or explored to disclose objects or matters we wish to conceal.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R v Tessling, [2004] 3 SCR 432 at para 21&lt;/ref&gt; It is for that reason that it is considered the strongest of the forms of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;

This form of privacy is most often considered in a strip search&lt;ref&gt;e.g. R v Golden, [2001] 3 SCR 679&lt;/ref&gt; or a warrantless seizure of a bodily sample.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. R v Stillman, [1997] 1 SCR 607&lt;br&gt;
R v Colarusso, [1994] 1 SCR 20&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

===Territorial Privacy===
Privacy over personal territory traces back to the English common law with the maxim that &quot;the house of everyone is to him as his castle and fortress&quot;.&lt;Ref&gt;Semayne's Case at para. 1&lt;/ref&gt; This has since been adopted into the common law of Canada and the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms.&lt;Ref&gt;
Adopted in common law in Eccles v. Bourque et al., [http://canlii.ca/t/1z1gw 1974 CanLII 191] (SCC), [1975] 2 SCR 739, &lt;Br&gt;
Adopted as applicable to Charter in Colet v. The Queen, [http://canlii.ca/t/1lpb2 1981 CanLII 11] (SCC), [1981] 1 SCR 2&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Reflist|2}}

===Informational Privacy===
The right protects the &quot;biographical core of personal information&quot; that includes &quot;information which tends to reveal intimate details of the lifestyle and personal choices of the individual.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Plant, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fs0w 1993 CanLII 70] (SCC), [1993] 3 SCR 281&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Purpose of Search==
The purpose of the search is a relevant to the analysis of the search. The most frequent form of search is a search for evidence of a commission of an offence, criminal or otherwise. Secondarily, there will be searches for the purpose of officer safety. Each type of search will have different scope of powers of search.

{{Reflist|2}}

==Party Performing the Search==
Section 8 of the Charter governs searches by government and its agents. The scope and degree of privacy is always with respect to a particular party.

An employee of a private company become an agent of the state when they are directed to perform a task by the police.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Liang, [http://canlii.ca/t/1r3nj 2007 YKTC 18] at para 241&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Dorfer, [http://canlii.ca/t/2326g 1996 CanLII 10214] (BC CA) at para. 39&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; However, where the actions of the employee, company, or person, were strictly voluntary then they are not agents of the state.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Gomboc [http://canlii.ca/t/2dhlk 2010 SCC 55], [2010] 3 SCR 211&lt;br&gt;
c.f. R. v. Poh, [http://canlii.ca/t/fn5qs 2011 MBQB 214]
&lt;/ref&gt;

A police informer wearing a wire is an agent of the state.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Broyles, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fshb 1991 CanLII 15] (SCC), [1991] 3 SCR 595&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Employees of government agencies, such as social workers, who discover or investigate possible offences are agents of the state.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Choy, [http://canlii.ca/t/21qxs 2008 ABQB 737] at para 28 - social worker discovering bruising&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Westrageer et al, [http://canlii.ca/t/1lwwm 2005 BCSC 1558] at para 43: social working investigating child welfare complaint&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Chang, [http://canlii.ca/t/4s1h 2003 ABCA 293] : private security guard seizing property for police
c.f. R. v. Allen, [http://canlii.ca/t/2dvjl 2010 CanLII 73011] (NL PC)
&lt;/ref&gt;
Similarly, a private citizen performing a citizen's arrest and searching a person in anticipation of the arrival of the police is an agent of the state.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Lerke, [http://canlii.ca/t/1nnwz 1986 ABCA 15]&lt;/ref&gt;

An Internet Service Provider forwarding information on the discovery of child pornography is acting as an agent of the state.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Weir, [http://canlii.ca/t/5rdq 2001 ABCA 181] at para. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Organizational Pre-Trials==

Under s. 625.1(1) the Court has the power to order that a conference be held between the parties to speed up the trial processs. The section states that:
:Subject to subsection (2), on application by the prosecutor or the accused or on its own motion, the court, or a judge of the court, before which, or the judge, provincial court judge or justice before whom, any proceedings are to be held may order that a conference between the prosecutor and the accused or counsel for the accused, to be presided over by the court, judge, provincial court judge or justice, be held prior to the proceedings to consider the matters that, to promote a fair and expeditious hearing, would be better decided before the start of the proceedings, and other similar matters, and to make arrangements for decisions on those matters.

This is also addressed through section 482.1:
:(1) A court referred to in subsection 482(1) or (2) may make rules for case management, including rules
::(a) for the determination of any matter that would assist the court in effective and efficient case management;

Pre-Trial conferences can be helpful for a number of reasons:
# Narrow issues for trial -- parties may be able to agree on certain facts not in dispute at trial
# Learn the opponent's theory and strategy
# Gauge potential sentences -- in certain circumstances possible sentencing proposals can be bounced off the judge to get a sense of the likely outcome in a disputed sentencing hearing.
# Settle the case

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
The &quot;principles of fundamental justice&quot; under section 7 of the Charter include the &quot;right to effective assistance of counsel&quot; in the criminal justice system.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. G.D.B., [2000] 1 S.C.R. 520, [http://canlii.ca/t/526g 2000 SCC 22], at para. 24&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been adopted in Ontario,&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Garofoli, [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1988/1988canlii3270/1988canlii3270.html 1988 CanLII 3270 (ONCA)]&lt;/ref&gt; Nova Scotia,&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Schofield (G.R.) [http://www.canlii.org/en/ns/nssc/doc/1996/1996canlii5462/1996canlii5462.html 1996 CanLII 5462 (NSSC)]&lt;/ref&gt; and British Columbia&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Strauss (D.W.), [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/1995/1995canlii702/1995canlii702.html 1995 CanLII 702 (BCCA)]&lt;/ref&gt; that the proper test is as stated in the US case of Strickland v. Washington, 104 S. Ct. 2052 (1984) which states that:
{{cquote|
A convicted defendant’s claim that counsel’s assistance was so defective as to require reversal of a conviction or death sentence has two components. First, the defendant must show that counsel’s performance was deficient. This requires showing that counsel made errors so serious that counsel was not functioning as the ‘counsel’ guaranteed the defendant by the Sixth Amendment. Second, the defendant must show that the deficient performance prejudiced the defense. This requires showing that counsel’s errors were so serious as to deprive the defendant of a fair trial, a trial whose result is reliable. Unless a defendant makes both showings, it cannot be said that the conviction or death sentence resulted from a breakdown in the adversary process that renders the result unreliable.” }}

A claim for ineffective assistance or incompetent counsel has two components. There must be performance that is incompetent (performance component) and the performance must result in a &quot;miscarriage of justice&quot; (the prejudice component). &lt;ref&gt;
R v Gardiner, 2010 NBCA 46 at para. 2&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; Thusly, the applicant must prove:&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. G. (D.M.), [http://canlii.ca/t/fl79g 2011 ONCA 343] at para. 100&lt;br&gt; 
R v B(J) [http://canlii.ca/t/flkd4 2011 ONCA 404] at para. 2&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Joanisse [http://canlii.ca/t/6jmw 1995 CanLII 3507] (ON CA), (1995), 102 C.C.C. (3d) 35 (ONCA), at p. 59 leave to appeal refused, [1996] S.C.C.A. No. 347&lt;br&gt;
R v White [http://canlii.ca/t/5s25 1997 CanLII 2426] (ON CA), (1997), 99 OAC 1 at paras 63-65, 114 CCC (3d) 225; leave to appeal denied, 117 CCC (3d) vi (SCC)
&lt;/ref&gt;
# the facts that underpin the claim on a balance of probabilities;
# the act or omission that was believed to be incompetent assistance by counsel;
# the incompetent assistance caused a miscarriage of justice by undermining either appearance of a fair trial or reliability of the verdict.

There is a presumption in favour of competence.

The level of competence expected is on a reasonableness standard for the particular case at the time.&lt;Ref&gt;Joanisse 1995 CanLII 3507 (ON CA) at pp. 60-61&lt;/ref&gt; The court cannot use the benefit of hindsight in their analysis.

Absent a possible injustice flowing from the incompetency of counsel there can be no appeal. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Ensor, [1989] 1 W.L.R. 497 (C.A.), Lord Lane, C.J.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Courts are generally deferential to counsel in their conduct and given them wide latitude with defence strategy.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Kelly 52 O.A.C. 241 (ONCA)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Jim, [2003] B.C.J. No. 1663 (Q.L.)(C.A.)
&lt;/ref&gt;

The claimant will usually need to adduce fresh evidence by affidavit or oral testimony that sets out the deficiencies in trial counsel. The trial counsel will then be permitted to respond to the allegations. &lt;ref&gt;
R. v. O'Keefe (No. 2), [http://canlii.ca/t/frczp 2012 NLCA 25] at 14&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Freake, [http://canlii.ca/t/fq5m3 2012 NLCA 10]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

A court should not &quot;blindly&quot; accept an appellant's affidavit of evidence without any evidence from the trial counsel or trial record suggesting something is wrong.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Munson, [http://canlii.ca/t/fv824 2012 MBCA 111] (CanLII)
&lt;/ref&gt;

Unless the transcript confirms the allegations, the appeal counsel should present evidence from trial counsel. Where the transcript raises concerns of competence, the court should order evidence be taken from the trial counsel. If the court is satisfied from the surrounding circumstances and trial transcript that there is no valid concern, then the court can dismiss the appeal at a preliminary stage for failing to establish a factual foundation. In effect, a affidavit from the appellant does not necessarily establish a prima facie case.
&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Le (T.D.), [http://canlii.ca/t/frj5d 2011 MBCA 83] (CanLII) at para. 178&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some courts of appeal have protocols for handling appeals on incompetent counsel.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
Lay opinion, being an opinion of a person who is not qualified as an expert, can be admissible in trial where the opinion constitutes  a &quot;compendious statement&quot; of the observations of a witness in relation to matters of common experience where no special knowledge is required and the opinion is so close to fact that it is impossible to separate the two. &lt;ref&gt; 
R. v. Graat, [1982] 2 SCR 819, [http://canlii.ca/t/1lpcx 1982 CanLII 33] (SCC) &lt;br&gt;

Lay opinion has been found to be valid in relation to the following:
* the identification of handwriting, persons and things;&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
Expert opinion is testimonial evidence that gives an opinion on facts perceived by him or another that concerns an issue that is likely outside the experience and knoweldge of the trier-of-fact (i.e. a lay person).
&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. J-L J, [2000] 2 SCR 600 at para 56 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2000/2000scc51/2000scc51.html];&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Abbey, [1982] 2 SCR 24
&lt;/ref&gt;
The expert must have special knowledge in the matter
&lt;ref&gt; 
R. v. Terceira (1998) 123 CCC 1 (Ont. CA)
&lt;/ref&gt;
and the opinion must be ''reasonably necessary'' to assist the trier-of-fact to make a proper judgment.
&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Mohan, [1994] SCR 9 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1994/1994canlii80/1994canlii80.html];&lt;br&gt;
R. v. C.G. (1996) Nfld. CA;&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Lovie (1995) Ont. CA
&lt;/ref&gt; 
The expert is not to testify to facts, but rather only opinion to allow the trier-of-fact to draw inferences.

==Requirements to Adduced Expert Evidence==

Section 657.3 permits a party to adduce expert evidence without the need to have the expert give viva vice evidence:
{{quotation|
'''Expert testimony'''&lt;br&gt;
657.3 (1) In any proceedings, the evidence of a person as an expert may be given by means of a report accompanied by the affidavit or solemn declaration of the person, setting out, in particular, the qualifications of the person as an expert if
:(a) the court recognizes that person as an expert; and
:(b) the party intending to produce the report in evidence has, before the proceeding, given to the other party a copy of the affidavit or solemn declaration and the report and reasonable notice of the intention to produce it in evidence.
&lt;p&gt;
'''Attendance for examination'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) Notwithstanding subsection (1), the court may require the person who appears to have signed an affidavit or solemn declaration referred to in that subsection to appear before it for examination or cross-examination in respect of the issue of proof of any of the statements contained in the affidavit or solemn declaration or report.
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;p&gt;
1997, c. 18, s. 80; 2002, c. 13, s. 62.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec657.3 CCC]
}}
See also: s. 16 and s. 150.1 of the Code.

A party cannot call more than five witnesses without leave of the court.&lt;ref&gt;
s. 7 of the Canada Evidence Act
&lt;/ref&gt;

Under 657.3, the judge may order compliance, seek particulars, or adjourn. He may not prohibit the the witness from testifying who complies with the section.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Horan, [http://canlii.ca/t/209v1 2008 ONCA 589] (CanLII)&lt;/ref&gt;

Under s.7 of the Canada Evidence Act, where any party intends to &quot;examine as witnesses, professional or other experts entitled according to the law or practice to give opinion evidence, not more than five of such witnesses may be called on either side without the leave of the court or judge or person presiding.&quot;

{{reflist|2}}

===Notice===
A party may call a witness as an expert under [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec657.3 s. 657.3 (1)].  A party intending to call the expert witness must give notice at least 30 days prior to the commencement of trial or within the time set by the judge. 
&lt;ref&gt; s. 657.3(3)(a)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Salter, [http://www.canlii.org/en/ns/nsca/doc/2005/2005nsca129/2005nsca129.html 2005 NSCA 129]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 657.3(3) states:
{{Quotation|
'''Notice for expert testimony'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) For the purpose of promoting the fair, orderly and efficient presentation of the testimony of witnesses,
:(a) a party who intends to call a person as an expert witness shall, at least thirty days before the commencement of the trial or within any other period fixed by the justice or judge, give notice to the other party or parties of his or her intention to do so, accompanied by
::(i) the name of the proposed witness,
::(ii) a description of the area of expertise of the proposed witness that is sufficient to permit the other parties to inform themselves about that area of expertise, and
::(iii) a statement of the qualifications of the proposed witness as an expert;
:(b) in addition to complying with paragraph (a), a prosecutor who intends to call a person as an expert witness shall, within a reasonable period before trial, provide to the other party or parties
::(i) a copy of the report, if any, prepared by the proposed witness for the case, and
::(ii) if no report is prepared, a summary of the opinion anticipated to be given by the proposed witness and the grounds on which it is based; and
:(c) in addition to complying with paragraph (a), an accused, or his or her counsel, who intends to call a person as an expert witness shall, not later than the close of the case for the prosecution, provide to the other party or parties the material referred to in paragraph (b).
}}

{{Reflist|2}}

===If Notice is Not Given===
Section 657.3(4) states that where the notice requirements of s. 657.3(3) are not complied with, the available remedies are as follows:
* &quot;adjournment of the proceedings to the party who requests it to allow him or her to prepare for cross-examination of the expert witness;&quot; (657.3(4)(a))
* an &quot;order the party who called the expert witness to provide that other party and any other party with the material referred to in paragraph (3)(b);&quot; and (657.3(4)(b))
* an &quot;order the calling or recalling of any witness for the purpose of giving testimony on matters related to those raised in the expert witness’s testimony, unless the court considers it inappropriate to do so.&quot; (657.3(4)(c))

These remedies do not include the power to prohibit the party from calling the expert.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Horan, [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2008/2008onca589/2008onca589.html 2008 ONCA 589]&lt;br&gt;
Somerville v. R., [http://canlii.ca/t/fqctg 2012 NBCA 23] (CanLII)
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

===Other Use of the Materials===
Under s. 657.3 (6), the prosecution is prohibited from using any of the materials given to him by defence for as part of its own case where the expert does not testify except for cross-examination without the consent of the accused. It further cannot be used for any other proceedings. (657.3(7))

== Qualification ==
A trial judge must determine on a ''voir dire'' whether the individual is qualified as an expert, and if so, what the &quot;nature and scope of the proposed expert evidence&quot; will be.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Preeper and Doyle (1888) SCR&lt;/ref&gt; The qualification process is one of delineating the boundaries of the evidence and the language used.  
&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Abbey, 2009 ONCA 624 [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2009/2009onca624/2009onca624.html]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. K. A., 1999 CanLII 3793 (ON C.A.) [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1999/1999canlii3793/1999canlii3793.html]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; 

The judge cannot permit the expert to give an opinion on common matters or matters that the expert has no special skills, knowledge, or training. 

To qualify a person as an expert, the evidence must meet the ''Mohan'' requirements:
&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Mohan, supra&lt;/ref&gt;
# the opinion must be ''relevant'';
# the opinion must be ''necessary'' to assist the trier-of-fact to draw the correct inference;
# the ''absence'' of any other exclusionary rule;
# the required qualifications of the proposed expert.

The ''relevance'' requirement includes both ''logical relevance'' (the relationship between the evidence and the fact in issue it is being used to establish) and ''legal relevance'' (the probative value). (R. v. K.(A.), 1999 137 CCC 3d 225 (ONCA))

The ''necessity'' requirement is not a strict standard. It is necessary where it furnishes scientific information that is likely to be outside the experience and knowledge of the trier of fact.(R. v. B.(R.H.), [1994] 2 SCR 656)

Qualified expert evidence can nonetheless be excluded if: (R. v. D.D. [2000] 2 SCR 275) 
# the evidence would tend to usurp the duty of the trier of fact
# the prejudicial effect outweighs the probative value
# the time required outweighs its probative value
# the cost required outweighs the probative value
# the influence of the evidence outweighs the evidence's reliability.

The proposed expert must have some indicia of scientific knowledge. It cannot be admitted if the witness is giving personal opinions based on their experience, knowledge from &quot;some&quot; literature, and interviews. (R. v. Bedford (2000), 143 CCC 3d 311)

Expert evidence should be expected to be impartial to be admissible. There must not be any bias or appearance of bias.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Docherty [2010] OJ No. 2460 - father of defence counsel writes psych report, found invalid&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}

==Novel Sciences==
Novel sciences must be considered on a case-by-case basis. There are no fixed categories where the requirements for expert evidence have been met.&lt;ref&gt;
e.g. R. v. Lavallee, [1990] 1 S.C.R. 852 battered wife syndrome accepted as science&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; The courts must individually distinguish between new sciences and &quot;junk&quot; sciences. As such, needs &quot;special scrutiny&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. J.(-L.),  [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2000/2000scc51/2000scc51.html 2000 SCC 51]&lt;/ref&gt;

Novel sciences must only be qualified if it is (1) necessary and (2) reliable&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Terceira (1998) 123 CCC 3d 1 (ONCA)[http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1998/1998canlii2174/1998canlii2174.html 1998 CanLII 2174]&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence can still be admissible even if the scientific theory is open to debate or that there are exceptional cases to the theory.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. M.(B.) 1998 130 CCC 353 (ONCA)[http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1998/1998canlii13326/1998canlii13326.html 1998 CanLII 13326]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not necessary to establish that the field be one that is subject to &quot;peer review&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Abbey (2009), 246 C.C.C. (3d) 301, [2009] O.J. No. 3534, 2009 ONCA 624 (Ont. C.A.) at para. 97 - lower court erred in requiring peer review
&lt;/ref&gt;

Expertise &quot;may be acquired through study&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
McWilliams’ Canadian Criminal Evidence (4th) at 12:30.20.50. citing Mohan at 414&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the subject, it may not be necessary that the expert have a university degree in the subject to be an expert.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Bulman, [2007] O.J. No. 913 (QL) (C.A.) at para. 7&lt;/ref&gt;

The absence of writing or publications will generally go to weight and not admissibility.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. B.M., [http://canlii.ca/t/1nptj 1998 CanLII 13326] (ON CA) at para. 71&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence==
Once the witness is qualified as an expert they are permitted to give evidence in the area for which they were qualified. 
The opinion evidence will be related by way of hypothetical questions put to the expert.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Fiqia (1994) 162 A.R. 117 (C.A.) &lt;/ref&gt; However, the testimony cannot be &quot;oath-helping&quot; evidence.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Reid, 2003 CanLII 14779 (ON C.A.) [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2003/2003canlii14779/2003canlii14779.html]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The hypotheticals can be put to the expert where the facts are not dispute.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Bleta, [1964] SCR 561 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1964/1964canlii14/1964canlii14.html]&lt;/ref&gt;  If the underlying facts are in dispute the opinion cannot remove the fact-finding function of the trier-of-fact.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. P.G., 2009 ONCA 32 [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2009/2009onca32/2009onca32.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The cross examiner can put to the expert any proven or provable facts to determine whether it alters the confidence of a the opinion.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Kerr, 2000 BCCA 209 [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/2000/2000bcca209/2000bcca209.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The expert must cite the bases on his opinion in order for the trier-of-fact to evaluate the opinion.
&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Neil, [1957] S.C.R. 685 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1957/1957canlii70/1957canlii70.html]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Grandinetti, 2003 ABCA 307 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abca/doc/2003/2003abca307/2003abca307.html]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Trudel, 1994 CanLII 5397 (QC CA) [http://www.canlii.org/fr/qc/qcca/doc/1994/1994canlii5397/1994canlii5397.html]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; The expert can use sources and information found in the &quot;scope of his or her expertise&quot;&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. S.A.B., 2003 SCC 60, [2003] 2 S.C.R. 678 at 63 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2003/2003scc60/2003scc60.html]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as sources outside his knowledge in limited contexts.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Anderson (1914), 22 C.C.C. 455&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Godfrey, [1974] 4 W.W.R. 677, 18 C.C.C. (2d) 90 (Alta. C.A.), at pp. 102-104
&lt;/ref&gt;  The &quot;second hand&quot; evidence of texts is not admissible as evidence, but can be used to show the information on which the opinion is based.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Burns, [1994] 1 S.C.R. 656 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1994/1994canlii127/1994canlii127.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

An expert may be cross-examined on a text, report or article relating to his area of expertise.
&lt;ref&gt;
R. c. Taillefer, 1995 CanLII 4592 (QC C.A.) [http://www.canlii.org/fr/qc/qcca/doc/1995/1995canlii4592/1995canlii4592.html]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Marquard [1993] 3 SCR 223 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1993/1993canlii37/1993canlii37.html]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Conroy, (1993), Ont.C.A.
&lt;/ref&gt; The expert can only comment on works they are familiar with. If the expert acknowledges the authority, the examiner may read parts of the document to the witness to the extent that it is accepted as valid. 

A judge may reject the uncontradicted expert evidence as unreasonable.
&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Prince, (1971) OntCA&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Lambkin, 2002 MBCA 157 [http://www.canlii.org/en/mb/mbca/doc/2002/2002mbca157/2002mbca157.html]
&lt;/ref&gt;
The evidence should not be rejected if there is no contradictory evidence and the opinion is not seriously challenged.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Molodowic, 2000 SCC 16, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 420 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2000/2000scc16/2000scc16.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Drug Expert'''&lt;br&gt;
A lay person such as an RCMP officer cannot be a reliable expert simply by &quot;conducting numerous casual conversations with drug users or traffickers.&quot;  This sort of &quot;[a]necdotal evidence cannot be tested or verified hearsay must be supplemented and supported by some form of admissible evidence.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Klassen, [2003] M.J. No. 417&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Evaluating Conflicting Expert Evidence'''&lt;br&gt;
Where the evidence of multiple experts conflict, it is not a matter of chosing one expert over the other, but rather giving weight to each expert and review the opinions as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Jonkman, [http://canlii.ca/t/fvfwq 2012 SKQB 511] (CanLII) at para. 97&lt;br&gt;
Toneguzza-Norvell v. Burnaby Hospital, 1994 CanLII 106 (SCC), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 114&lt;br&gt;
Housen v. Nikulaison, 2002 SCC 33 (CanLII), 2002 SCC 33, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 235&lt;br&gt;

      <comment>/* Closing submissions */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Opening submissions==
Inflamatory remarks during opening submissions may allow for a mistrial.&lt;ref&gt;Stewart v. Speer (1953), [1953] O.R. 502 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;Br&gt; 
Landolfi v. Fargione (2006), 2006 CarswellOnt 1855 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}
==Closing submissions==

Both counsel have a &quot;fair degree of latitude&quot; on their closings. They are each entitled to &quot;advance his ... position forcefully and effectively&quot;, it is expected that there will be &quot;a degree of rhetorical passion in that presentation.&quot;
&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Daly, (1992), 57 O.A.C. 70, at p. 76&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Boudreau, [http://canlii.ca/t/ftxzt 2012 ONCA 830] (CanLII) at para. 15 onward&lt;br&gt;
see also R. v. Mallory, 2007 ONCA 46 (CanLII), 217 C.C.C. (3d) 266 , at para. 339&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Crown must: &lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Boudreau, [http://canlii.ca/t/ftxzt 2012 ONCA 830] (CanLII) at para. 16&lt;br&gt;
Mallory 2007 ONCA 46&lt;/ref&gt;
* &quot;abstain from inflammatory rhetoric&quot;, 
* abstain from &quot;demeaning commentary and sarcasm&quot;, 
* not &quot;misstate the law&quot;,
* &quot;not invite the jury to engage in speculation&quot; &lt;ref&gt;
see Mallory, at para. 340&lt;/ref&gt;
* not &quot;express personal opinions about either the evidence or the veracity of a witness&quot; &lt;ref&gt;
see Mallory, at para. 340&lt;/ref&gt;

Violations of these requirements may sometimes result in a mistrial. However, the prejudices arising from this conduct can often be remedied by additional jury instructions.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Boudreau, [http://canlii.ca/t/ftxzt 2012 ONCA 830] (CanLII) at para. 20&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

A judge must allow counsel an opportunity to make closing submission in full.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Al-Fartossy, [http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abca/doc/2007/2007abca427/2007abca427.html 2007 ABCA 427], 425 A.R. 336 at para. 25&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, the judge can still comment on the evidence during the submissions and may attempt at focusing the argument on particular issues of concern. The judge cannot prevent counsel from making submissions on relevant issues.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Hodson, [http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abca/doc/2001/2001abca111/2001abca111.html 2001 ABCA 111] at paras. 33 and 35&lt;/ref&gt; 
A trial judge does not have to be silent during submissions and can voice concerns.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. W.F.M. (1995), 169 A.R. 222 (C.A.) at para. 10&lt;/ref&gt;
He is permitted to express a preliminary opinion on the evidence or the law during submissions.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v Baccari, 2011 ABCA 205 at para. 24&lt;Br&gt; 
R. v Johnson,  2010 ABCA 392 at para. 14&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Where counsel makes false or erroneous submissions in the address to a jury, the judge must give corrections in the jury instruction.&lt;ref&gt;see R. v. Romeo, [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1991/1991canlii113/1991canlii113.html 1991 CanLII 113] (SCC), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 86 at para. 95&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Rose, [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1998/1998canlii768/1998canlii768.html 1998 CanLII 768] (SCC), [1998] 3 S.C.R. 262 at paras. 126 and 127&lt;/ref&gt;

The party calling a witness does not need to assert that the trier of fact accept everything said by the witness wholesale. &lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Benji, 2012 BCCA 55 at 158&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Biniaris, 1998 CanLII 14986 (BC CA) at 9&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; 
Crown counsel is entitled to invite the trier of fact to be selective of the evidence they chose to believe from the witness that the Crown called.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Walker, [http://canlii.ca/t/231tg 1994 CanLII 8725 (ON CA)] at 156&lt;/ref&gt; 
Crown counsel can ask that the trier reject evidence of a Crown witness in preference of other evidence heard. However, counsel cannot ask for the rejection of evidence in favour of a theory not in evidence.&lt;Ref&gt;Walker at 157&lt;/ref&gt;
Likewise, a party is not precluded from calling evidence that may contradict other witnesses called by the same party.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Biniaris, 1998 CanLII 14986 (BC CA) at 10 citing Cariboo Observer Ltd. v. Carson Truck Lines Ltd. and Tyrell (1961), 32 D.L.R. (2d) 36 at 39, 37 W.W.W. 209 (B.C.C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Once the Crown has completed their evidence, it is not allowed to change it's theory of the case because of the addition of defence evidence.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. G.(S.G.), 1997 CanLII 311 (SCC), [1997] 2 S.C.R. 716&lt;/ref&gt;

Submissions by counsel on issues before the court cannot be intentionally or inadvertently denied by the court. A failure would result in a new trial.&lt;Ref&gt;
Dewey v. Dawson-Moran, 2011 ABCA 45 at 12&lt;br&gt;
R v Komarnicki, 2012 SKQB 140&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Representation by Agent==
An agent generally may not represent an accused on a summary conviction appeal.&lt;ref&gt;
See R. v. Duggan, [1976] O.J. No. 418 (QL), 31 C.C.C. (2d) 167 (ONCA) at 9, 11;&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Stagg, [http://www.canlii.org/en/mb/mbqb/doc/2011/2011mbqb294/2011mbqb294.html 2011 MBQB 294]&lt;br&gt; 
Aasland v. Mirecki, [2002] M.J. No. 502 (QL), 37 C.P.C. (5th) 230&lt;br&gt; &lt;/ref&gt; 
This is usually prohibited both under common law and under the provincial law society act. The primary reason is to protect the administration of justice and the right to a fair trial by ensuring competent representation.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Romanowicz, 1999 CanLII 1315 (ON CA), (1999), 138 C.C.C. (3d) 225 at 74&lt;/ref&gt;Certain provinces, such as British Columbia (R. v. Dick,  2002 BCCA 27) and Alberta&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Crooks, 2011 ABCA 239 at 8-10&lt;/ref&gt;, allow limited exception to this rule on the discretion of the judge.


{{reflist|close=1}}

==Self-Representation==
Representation by counsel is not necessary to have a fair trial.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Rain [http://canlii.ca/t/5shs 1998 ABCA 315] (CanLII), (1998), 130 C.C.C. (3d) 167 at 182
(&quot;Representation by a lawyer is not a prerequisite for a fair trial. A person is entitled to represent himself or herself and when he or she does so, there are other means which are intended to protect the right to a fair trial, the foremost being the duty of every trial judge to ensure that all persons receive a fair trial.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;
An accused person may always chose to represent him or herself. However, individuals who represent themselves are not entitled to legal advice and strategy advice from the judge.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Gendreau, [http://canlii.ca/t/fn4bp 2011 ABCA 256] at 28&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial judge has an obligation to ensure that a self-represented individual has a fair trial. This includes assisting in the conduct of the defence to ensure that the defence is effectively brought out.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Moghaddam, [http://canlii.ca/t/1mtw4 2006 BCCA 136] at 35&lt;/ref&gt;

The amount of assistance to provide is a matter of the court's discretion. The judge does not need to become the accused's advocate, but must provide a &quot;minimum level of assistance&quot; to ensure a fair trial. 
&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Tran, [2001] O.R. (3d) 161 at para. 31&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Moreno-Baches, [2002] O.J. No. 4480 per Juriansz J. at para. 6&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Conducting a fair trial with a self-represented accused requires a &quot;significant degree of instruction and vigilance.&quot; This will generally require that the judge explain the course which the trial is to take, including:&lt;ref&gt;Tran, supra at 33&lt;/ref&gt;
# the arraignment, 
# the calling of crown witnesses, 
# the right to cross examine witnesses,
# the right to object to irrelevant evidence
# the right to call witnesses,
# the right and associated risks with the decision to testify
# the right to make closing arguments

==Right to be Heard==
There is a fundamental tenant that all parties affected by a decision shall be given an opportunity to be heard by the court before the court makes a ruling. This is the principle of  '''audi alteram partem principle'''.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Gustavson, 2005 BCCA 32 at 64&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|close=1}}
== Withdraw by Counsel ==
An accused has a right to defend himself (s. 651(2)) and so cannot be forced to retain or maintain counsel. The accused has a right to terminate representation by a lawyer at any time, including during trial. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Spataro (1974) SCR; R. v. Huber, 2003 BCCA 43&lt;/ref&gt;

Counsel may not withdraw without leave of the court. Permission to withdraw will be granted where the interests of the lawyer and client are irreconcilable. Once the lawyer has withdrawn they are under no obligation to provide assistance to the accused by way of legal advice or counselling.

Where counsel is seeking to withdraw as counsel due to non-payment of retainer. The court has discretion to refuse the request are require counsel to complete the matter.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Cunningham, 2010 SCC 10&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|close=1}}
== Discharging Counsel ==
The accused has an unfettered right to his counsel at any time for any reason. The Court has not authority to interfere with this decision or force an unwilling accused to continue to be represented by the discharged counsel.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Cunningham, [http://canlii.ca/t/28tlt 2010 SCC 10], [2010] 1 S.C.R. 331, at para. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

== Amicus Curae ==
A superior court and provincial court dealing with criminal matters, has the authority to appoint ''amicus curiae''. This power arises from their authority to &quot;control their processes in order to function as courts of law&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Russel, [http://canlii.ca/t/fl3xg 2011 ONCA 303] (CanLII)&lt;/ref&gt;

The court may also set the terms and conditions of the appointment related to counsel's compensation.&lt;ref&gt;
Russel&lt;/ref&gt;

An ''amicus curiae'' is counsel appointed by the court to assist an accused in representing himself. This is a more limited role than accused's counsel and does not require the confidence or consent of the accused. The amicus will provide assistance such as 
#objecting to perceived legal errors;
#assisting the appellant in drafting a statement of the defence position;
#assisting the appellant in subpoenaing any defence witnesses; and
#advising the appellant on any questions of law.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Amos, [http://canlii.ca/t/frdtr 2012 ONCA 334]&lt;/ref&gt;

The meaning of an ''amicus curiae'' &quot;implies the friendly intervention of counsel to remind the Court of some matter of law which has escaped its notice and in regard to which it is in danger of going wrong.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
Samra (1998), 129 C.C.C.(3d) 145 citing R v Grice (1957), 119 C.C.C. 18 per Ferguson J.&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the accused discharges their counsel who is subsequently appointed as amicus curiae, the accused can only appeal the appointment if there is an actual conflict of interest between the accused and his counsel.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Samra, [http://canlii.ca/t/440t 1998 CanLII 7174] (ON CA), (1998) 129 C.C.C.(3d) 145 at 160 per Rosenberg JA (Ont.C.A.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Under 486.3(1), in any proceedings involving a cross-examination of a witness under 18 years of age and the accused is self-represented, the prosecutor or witness may apply to have counsel appointed to conduct the cross-examination unless the &quot;proper administration of justice requires&quot;.

Under 486.3(2),  in any proceedings involving a cross-examination of a witness and the accused is self-represented, the prosecutor or witness may apply to have counsel appointed to conduct the cross-examination where it is necessary &quot;in order to obtain a full and candid account&quot;.

Under 486.3(4), in any proceedings involving a cross-examination of a witness with respect to an offence of criminal harassment (264) and the accused is self-represented, the prosecutor or witness may apply to have counsel appointed to conduct the cross-examination unless the &quot;proper administration of justice requires&quot;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Powers and Responsibilities of the Judge==
An accused person is entitled to a Constitutional right to an impartial trier-of-fact.&lt;ref&gt;
See s. 11(d) of the Charter which is the right &quot;...to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal;&quot;&lt;br&gt;
See also R. v. Valente (1985), 23 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.)&lt;br&gt; 
R.  v.  Campbell (1997), 118 C.C.C. (3d) 193 (S.C.C.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a judge begins hearing evidence and makes a ruling on it, the judge becomes seized with the matter and no other judge can take over.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Curtis, [1991] 66 C.C.C. (3d) 156 (Ont. Gen. Div.)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
===Process===
A Superior Court Justice has the inherent jurisdiction to eliminate any procedural unfairness that arises during a trial.&lt;ref&gt;  R. v. Rose, [1998] 3 S.C.R. 262 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1998/1998canlii768/1998canlii768.html 1998 CanLII 768]&lt;/ref&gt;

The &quot;procedural directions contained in the Code are of necessity exhaustive&quot;. The powers of a provincial court judge are &quot;entirely statutory.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Doyle [http://canlii.ca/t/1z6fv 1976 CanLII 11] (SCC), [1977] 1 S.C.R. 597&lt;/ref&gt; However, &quot;the authority to control the court's process and oversee the conduct of counsel is necessarily implied in the grant of power to function as a court of law. This Court has affirmed that courts can apply a ‘doctrine of jurisdiction by necessary implication’ when determining the powers of a statutory tribunal.” &lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Cunningham, [2010] S.C.R. 331 at para 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The inherent powers of a superior court judge to control the court process is said to be equally available to provincial court judges either expressly by statute or by necessary implication.&lt;ref&gt;
R vs Doyle 1976 CanLII 11 (SCC), [1977] 1 SCR 597, per Ritchie, J. (&quot;Whatever inherent powers may be possessed by a superior court judge in controlling the process of his own Court, it is my opinion that the powers and functions of a magistrate acting under the Criminal Code are circumscribed by the provisions of that statute and must be found to have been thereby conferred either expressly or by necessary implication.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Consequently, a provincial court judge has implied jurisdiction to &quot;vary one of its own orders in order to correct clerical mistakes or errors arising from an accidental slip or omission or in order to properly reflect the intention of the court&quot;&lt;ref&gt;see R. v. Rhingo, [1997] O.J. No. 1110 (Ont. C.A.) and R. v. Robichaud, [2012] N.B.J. No. 175 (C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt; 

Generally, a &quot;court has a limited power to reconsider and vary its judgment disposing of the case as long as the court is not functus.”&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Adams, 1995 CanLII 56 (SCC), [1995] 4 S.C.R. 707, at para 29&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Limiting evidence===
The judge is required to listen to evidence that &quot;advances the work of the court&quot;. He or she cannot be required to listen to irrelevant or pointless evidence.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Malmo-Levin 2003 SCR&lt;/ref&gt; The judge may even disallow the submission of non-relevant evidence.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Schneider, [http://www.canlii.org/en/ns/nsca/doc/2004/2004nsca99/2004nsca99.html 2004 NSCA 99]&lt;/ref&gt;

The judge has an obligation to track the admission of evidence to ensure that the record is restricted to what is admissible, and also that it is only used for the purpose for which it was admitted.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Morrisey [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1995/1995canlii3498/1995canlii3498.html 1995 CanLII 3498] (ON CA), (1995), 22 O.R. (3d) 514&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Smith, [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2011/2011onca564/2011onca564.html 2011 ONCA 564] at 59&lt;/ref&gt;

The judge has the jurisdiction to edit the evidence, including written statements and oral testimony, as it is given. The judge may edit out portions of the evidence that is prejudicial or otherwise irrelevant or immaterial only so long as it does not distort the probative evidence.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Dubois (1986), ___ (Ont.C.A.);R. v. Toten (1993), 14 O.R. (3d) 225 (Ont.C.A.) [http://canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/1993/1993canlii3427/1993canlii3427.html 1993 CanLII 3427]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
===Fact Finding===
Evidence before a judge are not facts. The judge has the power to hear evidence from which factual conclusions may be made. The Judge may make inferences. These inferences must be logical conclusions drawn from the evidence before the judge at trial. They cannot be conjecture or speculation about potential evidence that has not be submitted before the court.&lt;ref&gt;Caswell v Powell Duffryn Associated Collieries Ltd [1939] 3 All ER 722&lt;/ref&gt;

There are generally well known inferences, that a judge will make regularly such as the inference &quot;that one intends the natural consequences of one’s actions [in] any ... human activity, especially in light of the lack of evidence to rebut the inference.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R.v. Missions [http://canlii.ca/t/1knrn 2005 NSCA 82]  at 21&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
===Sitting Position of Accused===
Sitting arrangment of the accused in the court is in the sole discretion of the trial judge.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Levogiannis, [http://canlii.ca/t/1frxq 1993 CanLII 47], [1993] 4 S.C.R. 475  at para. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

Custom dictates that the accused is to be placed in the dock which is not said to violate the accused’s Charter rights.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Gervais [http://canlii.ca/t/1wd19 2001 CanLII 28428] (ON SC) at 8&lt;/ref&gt;

The jury should be able to see the accused during the trial. This interest may prevent the accused from requesting a seat at counsel table to give instructions.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. McCarthy, [2012 CanLII 10661 2012 CanLII 10661] (NL SCTD) [refused request to sit at counsel table]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Judge Following a Case===
Once a judge hears evidence or facts on a case they are seized with the case and must follow the matter to its conclusion.

Where a judge falls ill, they remain seized with the matter unless there is unreasonable delay that results.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Brown, [http://canlii.ca/t/fpw65 2012 ONSC 822] &lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Doctrine of Functus Officio===
A judge has jurisdiction over an outstanding charge up to the point where the charge has been resolved by way of a stay, withdraw, dismissal, acquittal, or sentencing. The doctrine of functus officio refers to the principle that a court no longer has jurisdiction to change any decisions once a charge has reached its ultimate conclusion.

This common law rule states that the final judgement of a court cannot be reopened. &lt;ref&gt;
originates from Re St. Nazaire Co. (1879), 12 Ch. D. 88&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
The power to review a decision is transferred by the Judicature Act to the appellate division.

This rule only applies to judgements that have been drawn up, issued and entered.&lt;Ref&gt;
Chandler v. Alberta association of architects, [http://canlii.ca/t/1ft28 1989 CanLII 41] (SCC), [1989] 2 SCR 848
&lt;/ref&gt;

It is said that a court is functus if and only if &quot;the duties and functions of the [court’s] original commission have been fully accomplished&quot;&lt;ref&gt; 
Jacobs Catalytic Ltd. vs International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, Local #353 2009 ONCA 749;  312 DLR (4th) 250 at para. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

There are exceptions to this rule. The court may still interfere with a prior decision where:&lt;ref&gt;Chandler v. Alberta association of architects, supra&lt;/ref&gt;
# where there had been a slip in drawing it up, and,
# where there was an error in expressing the manifest intention of the court

A trial judge sitting without a jury is functus officio only after he has imposed his sentence.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. MacDonald 1991 CanLII 2424 (NS CA), (1991), 107 N.S.R. (2d) 374
&lt;/ref&gt;

An intermittent jail sentence cannot be varied by the sentencing court to a non-intermittent.&lt;ref&gt;
R v. Germaine (1980) 39 NSR (2d) 177 at para. 5 - no jurisdiction to make intermittent to non-intermittent because not in text of 732&lt;br&gt;
R v Jules [1988] BCJ 1605&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
There is some authority suggesting that the court may vary the entry and exit times of the intermittent sentence based on the power of the court to control its own process.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. E.K., [http://canlii.ca/t/frc2s 2012 BCPC 132]&lt;br&gt;
c.f. R. v. Crocker, [http://canlii.ca/t/fs5sw 2012 CanLII 42379] (NL PC)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
===Communications with Counsel Out of Court===
''Ex parte'' communications (i.e. communications in absence of one of the parties) concerning an ongoing proceedings should be avoided. It is a rule that relates to the &quot;public perception of fairness within the administration of justice&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Deleary, 2007 CanLII 71720 (ON SC) at para. 22&lt;/ref&gt; It also preserves &quot;confidence of the public in the impartiality of the judiciary and thereby in the administration of justice&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;R v Jones, 1996 CanLII 8006 (ON SC), (1996), 107 C.C.C. (3d) 517 (Ont. G.D.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Ex parte communications between judge and counsel concerning a case will &quot;almost invariably raise a reasonable apprehension of bias&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Jones and Deleary&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Intervention During Trial==
There is a presumption that a trial judge has intervened in a trial properly. The judge may often make comments, give directions or ask questions. &lt;ref&gt;Chippewas of Mnjikaning First Nation v. Chiefs of Ontario, 2010 ONCA 47, at para. 231&lt;/ref&gt; 
The key issue is whether the intervention affected trial fairness. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Valley 1996 (Ont. c.A.)&lt;/ref&gt; This is from the perspective of a reasonable observer. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Stucky [http://canlii.ca/t/22hv3 2009 ONCA 151]&lt;/ref&gt;

A judge may disrupt questioning in order to clear evidentiary ambiguities, pursue subjects left vague by the witness, and ask questions counsel should have asked.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Watson, [http://canlii.ca/t/1jd19 2004 CanLII 45443] (ON CA) at para. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Interlocutory remarks&quot; of the judge during argument are not &quot;judicial pronouncements&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Visscher, [http://canlii.ca/t/frt7v 2012 BCCA 290] (CanLII) at para. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

A judge is permitted to give the jury mid-trial instructions to disregard any erroneous comments made by counsel. If it is given promptly and with explanation of why it should be disregarded, this can effectively correct any concern that a jury might misuse the information. &lt;ref&gt;see R. v. Normand (D.G.), [http://canlii.ca/t/5kkk 2002 MBCA 95] at para. 20, 166 Man.R. (2d) 179)&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a presumption that an accused not be restrained while in court. It is upon the Crown to establish grounds to order the restaint of the accused.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. W.H.A., 2011 NSSC 166&lt;/ref&gt;

Unnecessary and repeated interruptions that disrupt the flow and effectiveness of cross-examination may exceed permissible limits.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Watson&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Exclusion of parties===
The trial judge can order the exclusion of the accused where his conduct makes the proceedings impractical.&lt;ref&gt;See s.650(2)(8); R. v. Pawliw, [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcsc/doc/1985/1985canlii656/1985canlii656.html 1985 CanLII 656] (BCSC)&lt;/ref&gt;

The accused can likewise voluntarily be absent from the trial with the court's consent.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Drabinsky, [http://canlii.ca/t/208km 2008 CanLII 40225] (ON SC)&lt;/ref&gt; However, depending on how the proceedings go in the absence of the accused, there may be a ground of appeal.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Valeanu, [http://canlii.ca/t/6jwm 1995 CanLII 614] (ON CA)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Maintaining Order===

{{quotation|
'''Preserving order in court'''&lt;br&gt;
484. Every judge or provincial court judge has the same power and authority to preserve order in a court over which he presides as may be exercised by the superior court of criminal jurisdiction of the province during the sittings thereof.

R.S., 1985, c. C-46, s. 484; R.S., 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 203.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec484 CCC]
}}

===Misc powers===
The judge does not have the power to order that counsel not communicate with a witness who is not in the middle of testimony. The rules of contempt of court and Professional Conduct are the only limitations on counsel's right to speak with witnesses and clients in court.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Arsenault, (1956) 115 CCC 400 (NBCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">

==Calling Witnesses==
The usual manner that a witness testify is by oral testimony in court (''viva voce'' evidence) while the accused is present. (CCC [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec650 s.650(1)])

The witnesses' testimony must be relevant, material, and admissible. To see details on the scope of these requirements see [[Canadian Criminal Evidence]].

==Choice of Witnesses==
Any party is entitled to call a witness who is competent to testify (See [[Canadian_Criminal_Evidence/Testimonial_evidence]] for details on competency of witnesses).

A party is also permitted call a witness that has already previously been called by the opposing party.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Cook, (1960), 31 W.W.R. 148 (Alta. S.C.A.D.)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Baiton, [http://canlii.ca/t/5h3s 2001 SKQB 264]&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Sutton [http://www.canlii.org/en/nb/nbqb/doc/2002/2002nbqb49/2002nbqb49.html 2002 NBQB 49]&lt;/ref&gt;

A party cannot call a witness for the sole purpose of discrediting a witness who has made a previous inconsistent statement.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Soobrian [http://canlii.ca/t/231tx 1994 CanLII 8739] (ONCA) &lt;Br&gt;
This relates mostly to crowns calling a witness apply under s. 9 CEA to cross examine (see [[Canadian_Criminal_Procedure_and_Practice/Trials/Examinations#Cross-examining a party's own witness (Adverse or Hostile Witnesses)]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The failure to call a witness can be used to make an adverse inference where there is no plausible reason not o do so and it is well within the power of the party to do so. However, where the evidence is merely cumulative or inferior en it should not be taken into account. (R. v lapensee 2009 ONCA 646)

A failure to call a witness cannot be used to make a negative inference on credibility of the accused.&lt;ref&gt;
See [[Canadian_Criminal_Evidence/Credibility#Failure_to_Call_Witnesses]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{reflist|2}}

==Testimonial Aids==

===Witness Screens===
On application by a prosecutor or witness, the judge may order that their testimony be heard either behind a screen or from a different room so that the witness cannot see the accused.

The governing section is 486.2 which states:
{{Quotation|
'''Testimony outside court room — witnesses under 18 or who have a disability'''&lt;br&gt;
486.2 (1) Despite section 650, in any proceedings against an accused, the judge or justice shall, on application of the prosecutor, of a witness who is under the age of eighteen years or of a witness who is able to communicate evidence but may have difficulty doing so by reason of a mental or physical disability, order that the witness testify outside the court room or behind a screen or other device that would allow the witness not to see the accused, unless the judge or justice is of the opinion that the order would interfere with the proper administration of justice.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Other witnesses'''&lt;Br&gt;
(2) Despite section 650, in any proceedings against an accused, the judge or justice may, on application of the prosecutor or a witness, order that the witness testify outside the court room or behind a screen or other device that would allow the witness not to see the accused if the judge or justice is of the opinion that the order is necessary to obtain a full and candid account from the witness of the acts complained of.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec486.2 CCC]
}}

===Video Testimony=== 
Section 714.1 of the Criminal Code allows a court to use “means of technology” to allow a witness to testify as a “virtual presence”.
{{quotation|
714.1 A court may order that a witness in Canada give evidence by means of technology that permits the witness to testify elsewhere in Canada in the virtual presence of the parties and the court, if the court is of the opinion that it would be appropriate in all the circumstances, including
:(a) the location and personal circumstances of the witness;
:(b) the costs that would be incurred if the witness had to be physically present; and
:(c) the nature of the witness’ anticipated evidence.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec714.1 CCC]
}}
 
The purpose of s. 714.1 is to &quot;address not only the high cost of litigation, but also the inconvenience of disruption to the lives of witnesses&quot; where the witnesses are outside of Canada. Consequently, the higher the cost and inconvenience harder it is to resist video link as an option.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Galandie, [2008] B.C.J. No. 79 (P.C.), [http://canlii.ca/t/1vq9f 2008 BCPC 6] (CanLII)&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a presumption that the &quot;unless the circumstances warrant dispensing with the usual practice, the witness should be called to the witness stand to testify.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
R v Chapple [http://canlii.ca/t/1k013 2005 BCSC 383] (CanLII) &lt;/ref&gt;
Section 714.1 &quot;does not replace the established procedure of calling witnesses to the witness stand in criminal cases or of allowing the accused to face his or her accuser&quot; &lt;ref&gt;
Chapple&lt;/ref&gt;

The court can do &quot;a sort of distance-cost, benefit-prejudice analysis&quot; to decide. Naturally, most applicants have witnesses that are in &quot;more remote regions of Canada.&quot;&lt;Ref&gt;R v Allen [2007] OJ No 1353 (ONCJ)&lt;/ref&gt;

However, &quot;cost saving to the state,...,in and of itself does not justify&quot; the use of video conferencing.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Ross, [2007] B.C.J. No. 1753 (P.C.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Factors to consider include:&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Young, [http://canlii.org/en/sk/skqb/doc/2000/2000skqb419/2000skqb419.html 2000 SKQB 419] at para. 8 &lt;/ref&gt;
:1) will a video appearance by the witness impede or impact negatively on the ability of defence counsel to cross‑examine that witness?
:2) the nature of the evidence to be introduced from the witness and whether it is non‑controversial and not likely to attract any significant objection from defence counsel, for example various police and technical witnesses who testify to routine matters with respect to exhibits and the like and other matters that would not attract any particular objection on the part of the accused's counsel;
:3) the integrity of the examination site and the assurance that the witness will be as free from outside influences or interruptions as that person would be in a public courtroom;
:4) the distance the witness must travel to testify in person and the logistics of arranging for his or her personal appearance;
:5) the convenience of the witness and to what degree having to attend in person at a distant location may interfere with important aspects of the witness's life, such as his or her employment, personal life and the like;
:6) the ability of the witness to attend who lives in a country or area that makes it difficult to arrange for travel or travel in a reliable fashion;
:7) the cost to the state of having the witness attend in person; and
:8) a fact to consider also is that the witness is effectively beyond the control of the Court in the trial jurisdiction, and whatever powers a judge may have over such a person, they are certainly extraterritorial.

While the form of the order is at the discretion of the judge, the court should always order that witness be able to testify in a manner in which he can be seen, heard, and questioned by the parties. The court may also request the evidence only be given while the witness is in a courtroom and in the presence of a peace officer.&lt;Ref&gt;
e.g. R. v. Osmond, [http://canlii.ca/t/283bh 2010 CanLII 6535] (NL PC) at para. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

===Use of Pseudonyms by Witnesses===
The Court has discretion to allow a witness to testify under a pseudonym only where a failure to do so would interfere with the administration of justice.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. McKinnon, (1982), 39 A.R. 283 (Alta. C.A.);&lt;Br&gt;

===Interpreters===
Every person charged with a crime has a right to the assistance of an interpreter where they cannot understand the English or French language.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms [http://canlii.org/en/ca/charter_digest/s-14.html section 14]&lt;/ref&gt; This right requires that the interpreter be competent as an interpreter.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Rybak, [2008] O.J. No. 1715, at paragraph 84&lt;br&gt;R. v. Sidhu, [2005] O.J. No. 4881&lt;/ref&gt; 

This does not mean that s. 14 of the Charter extends guarantee to an accredited or certified interpreter.&lt;ref&gt;
See R. v. Sidhu, [http://canlii.ca/t/1m14s 2005 CanLII 42491] (ON SC), (2005) 203 C.C.C. (3d) 17 at para. 298&lt;/ref&gt;
The interpreter must simply be competent and qualified court interpreter.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Tran, [http://canlii.ca/t/1frqw 1994 CanLII 56] (SCC), (1994) 92, C.C.C. (3d) 218 (S.C.C.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Interpretation must be continuous, precise, impartial and contemporaneous. &lt;ref&gt; R. v. Wong, 2011 ONCJ 264 at para. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* Defence's Case */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Purpose of a trial==
A trial is the process by which a judge attempts to ascertain the truth in order to convict the guilty and acquit the innocent.&lt;ref&gt; 
R. v. Levogiannis, [1993] 4 S.C.R. 475 (&quot;The goal of the court process is truth seeking and, to that end, the evidence of all those involved in judicial proceedings must be given in a way that is most favourable to eliciting the truth.&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Nikolovski, [1996] 3 SCR 1197, (&quot;The ultimate aim of any trial, criminal or civil, must be to seek and to ascertain the truth.&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. G. (B.), [http://canlii.ca/t/1fqlt 1999 CanLII 690] (SCC), [1999] 2 SCR 475 (&quot;[T]he essential principle of every criminal trial [is] the search for truth.&quot;)
&lt;/ref&gt;
The process does not go so far as to determine &quot;actual innocence&quot; as the standard of proof a trial is proof beyond reasonable doubt and does not evaluate degrees of acquittal and is not the ultimate purpose of criminal law.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Mullins-Johnson, [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2007/2007onca720/2007onca720.html 2007 ONCA 720]&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial fundamentally is &quot;about the search for the truth as well as fairness to the accused&quot;.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Handy, 2002 SCC 56 (&quot;[t]he  criminal  trial  is,  after  all,  about  the  search  for  truth  as  well fairness  to  an  accused&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;
This is guided by these principles:
#  the presumption of innocence&lt;ref&gt;R v Handy [2002] 2 S.C.R. 908, 2002 SCC 56 at 44&lt;/ref&gt;
# the right against self-incrimination &lt;ref&gt; s. 11(d) of the Charter&lt;/ref&gt;
# the ultimate burden on the crown to prove guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.&lt;Ref&gt;Section 11(c) of the Charter&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Crown's Case==
The Crown will always be the first party to call evidence. It is expected that the crown will call all available witnesses that can provide evidence to establish the elements of the offences charged beyond a reasonable doubt.

The Crown is expected to call, as part of its case, evidence that may rebut any alibi evidence and evidence of similar facts.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Biddle [1995] 1 SCR 761&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Defence's Case==
At the end of the Crown's case the Defence will be permitted to either make a motion for directed verdict, elect to call evidence, or elect not to call evidence.

If the accused elects to call evidence, an opening statement may be given to introduce the trier-of-fact to the defence's case.

The defence has discretion on the order of the calling of witnesses.

If the accused does not call evidence, there will be no need for an opening statement. The case will proceed to closing statements beginning with the Crown's submissions.

{{reflist|2}}

==Reply or Rebuttal==
On closing of the crown's case, the crown is expected to have presented all relevant evidence available. The judge should not allow Crown to &quot;split&quot; it's case and present any part of its case after the defence.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Melnichuk, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fr30 1997 CanLII 383] (SCC), [1997] 1 SCR 602
&lt;/ref&gt;

The judge may permit the crown to present further evidence at the close of the defence's case.

The evidence is limited only to matters that were raised in the defence evidence.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Kuyan (1988) 43 CCC (#d) 339&lt;/ref&gt;

If the Crown evidence could have been reasonably anticipated as being relevant during the Crown's case then it should have been called then and should not be permitted to be called in rebuttal.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Perry (1977), 36 C.C.C. (2d) 209 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Reflist|2}}
==Re-Opening the Case==
Once a party has closed their case, it is presumed they have finished presenting their evidence. It is the judge's discretion to allow a party, usually the crown, to re-open their case.

The factors to consider in exercising discretion to re-open a case prior to verdict are:&lt;ref&gt;
R v Hayward (1993) 86 CCC (3d) 193 at para. 17-19&lt;/ref&gt;
#whether the evidence is relevant to a material issue in the case;
#the potential prejudice to the other party, if reopening is permitted; and
#the effect of permitting reopening on the orderly and expeditious conduct of the trial.

The main consideration is the potential prejudice to the opposing side by re-opening the case.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Hayward, (1993) 86 CCC (3d) 193 (ONCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

The test to re-open the defence's case is more stringent post-conviction in order &quot;to protect the integrity of the process, including the enhanced interest in finality&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Kowall 1996 CanLII 411 (ON CA), (1996), 92 O.A.C. 82, 108 C.C.C. (3d) 481 at para. 31&lt;/ref&gt;
In such cases the test will be the same for admitting fresh evidence on appeal.&lt;ref&gt;See R. v. Palmer, 1979 CanLII 8 (SCC), [1980] 1 S.C.R. 759, cited by Kowall at para. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Re-opening the Crown's Case===
The judge may consider an application by the Crown to reopen their case. The standard will depend on what stage in the trial the application is made.&lt;ref&gt;
Robillard v. The Queen, 1978 CanLII 200 (SCC), [1978] 2 S.C.R. 728&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. P. (M.B.), 1994 CanLII 125 (SCC), [1994] 1 S.C.R. 555&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. G. (S.G.), 1997 CanLII 311 (SCC), [1997] 2 S.C.R. 716&lt;br&gt;
See also R. E. Salhany, Q.C., Canadian Criminal Procedure, 6th ed., looseleaf (Aurora:  Thomson Reuters Canada Limited, 2010) vol. 1 at paras. 6.3975, 6.3980, 6.3990&lt;/ref&gt;

The judge has discretion to reopen the case &quot;to correct some oversight or to prove a matter which it had failed to do inadvertently, provided that there was no prejudice to the accused.&quot; However, &quot;[o]nce the defence had begun to present its case, the judge’s discretion [is] narrowly restricted&quot; and may only be reopened &quot;to prove a matter, ex improviso, which no human ingenuity could have foreseen.&quot;
&lt;ref&gt; Salhany&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
Section 276 is an exclusionary rule of evidence prohibiting any party from adducing evidence of past sexual activity of a complainant in a sexual offence proceedings for certain uses. 

The section states:
{{quotation|
'''Evidence of complainant’s sexual activity'''&lt;br&gt;
276. (1) In proceedings in respect of an offence under section 151, 152, 153, 153.1, 155 or 159, subsection 160(2) or (3) or section 170, 171, 172, 173, 271, 272 or 273, evidence that the complainant has engaged in sexual activity, whether with the accused or with any other person, is not admissible to support an inference that, by reason of the sexual nature of that activity, the complainant
:(a) is more likely to have consented to the sexual activity that forms the subject-matter of the charge; or
:(b) is less worthy of belief.
&lt;p&gt;
'''Idem'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) In proceedings in respect of an offence referred to in subsection (1), no evidence shall be adduced by or on behalf of the accused that the complainant has engaged in sexual activity other than the sexual activity that forms the subject-matter of the charge, whether with the accused or with any other person, unless the judge, provincial court judge or justice determines, in accordance with the procedures set out in sections 276.1 and 276.2, that the evidence
:(a) is of specific instances of sexual activity;
:(b) is relevant to an issue at trial; and
:(c) has significant probative value that is not substantially outweighed by the danger of prejudice to the proper administration of justice.
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;P&gt;
R.S., 1985, c. C-46, s. 276; R.S., 1985, c. 19 (3rd Supp.), s. 12; 1992, c. 38, s. 2; 2002, c. 13, s. 13.
&lt;p&gt;
|[http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec276 CCC]
}}
The section was enacted in response to the decision of R. v. Seaboyer, [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577.

The exclusionary rule can be broken down into three components to be engaged:&lt;ref&gt;R. v. M.T., [http://canlii.ca/t/fs52f 2012 ONCA 511] at para. 29&lt;/ref&gt;
* offence charged
* subject-matter
* purpose

{{reflist|2}}
==Offence Charged==
The applicable offences are listed in s. 276*1) as consisting of 151, 152, 153, 153.1, 155 or 159, subsection 160(2) or (3) or section 170, 171, 172, 173, 271, 272 or 273.

{{reflist|2}}

==Applicable Subject Matter==
Section 276 applies to prior sexual acts consisting of &quot;Evidence ... that the complainant has engaged in sexual activity other than the sexual activity that forms the subject-matter of the charge, whether with the accused or with any other person.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Section 276(2)&lt;/ref&gt;
This includes sexual acts that occur in the moments before the alleged sexual assault.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. S. (D.R.), 1999 ABQB 330 (CanLII) [http://canlii.ca/en/ab/abqb/doc/1999/1999abqb330/1999abqb330.html] at 19&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Silva, 1994 CanLII 4673 (SK CA) at 33 [http://canlii.org/en/sk/skca/doc/1994/1994canlii4673/1994canlii4673.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Purpose==
Section 276(1) prohibits evidence of prior sexual conduct where it is used to make prohibited general inferences. These inference is known as the &quot;dual myths&quot;, summarized as inferring &quot;that unchaste women were more likely to consent to intercourse and in any event, were less worthy of belief&quot; &lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Seaboyer, 1991 CanLII 76 (SCC), [1991] 2 S.C.R. 577 at p.386&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. M.M., [1999] O.J. No. 3943 (S.C.J.) at para. 19&lt;br&gt;
R. v. M.T., [http://canlii.ca/t/fs52f 2012 ONCA 511] at para. 32&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the purpose of the evidence does not touch on the two &quot;myths&quot;, then the exclusionary rule does not apply.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. M.T., [http://canlii.ca/t/fs52f 2012 ONCA 511] at para. 32&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 276(2) sets out the exception to the rule permitting extrinsic evidence of sexual activity to be admitted where it:&lt;ref&gt;R v MT 2012 ONCA 511 at para. 33&lt;/ref&gt;
* is of specific instances of sexual activity;
* is relevant to an issue at trial; and
* has significant probative value that is not substantially outweighed by the danger of prejudice to the proper administration of justice.

When considering whether evidence meets these requirements the courts must consider the factors set out in s.276(3).

===Factors===

{{quotation|
276...&lt;br&gt;
'''Factors that judge must consider'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) In determining whether evidence is admissible under subsection (2), the judge, provincial court judge or justice shall take into account
:(a) the interests of justice, including the right of the accused to make a full answer and defence;
:(b) society’s interest in encouraging the reporting of sexual assault offences;
:(c) whether there is a reasonable prospect that the evidence will assist in arriving at a just determination in the case;
:(d) the need to remove from the fact-finding process any discriminatory belief or bias;
:(e) the risk that the evidence may unduly arouse sentiments of prejudice, sympathy or hostility in the jury;
:(f) the potential prejudice to the complainant’s personal dignity and right of privacy;
:(g) the right of the complainant and of every individual to personal security and to the full protection and benefit of the law; and
:(h) any other factor that the judge, provincial court judge or justice considers relevant.

Evidence of extrinsic sexual activity of the complainant is &quot;rarely ... relevant to support a denial that sexual activity took place or to establish consent&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; 
R v Darrach, [http://canlii.ca/t/523t 2000 SCC 46] (CanLII), [2000] 2 SCR 443 at para. 58&lt;/ref&gt;


Whether the complainant has previously been sexually assaulted is irrelevant.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. B. (A.R.) 1998 CanLII 14603 (ON CA), (1998), 41 O.R. (3d) 361 (C.A.), at p. 365, aff’d 2000 SCC 30 (CanLII), 2000 SCC 30, [2000] 1 S.C.R. 781&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Significant probative value'''&lt;br&gt; 
The ''significant probative value'' standard places a greater threshold on relevance for the admission of prior sexual history evidence. It is intended to prohibit evidence that may be of trifling relevance. Regardless of the purpose of the evidence, sexual history evidence can tend to bring the administration of justice to disrepute.&lt;ref&gt; Darrach at 40&lt;/ref&gt; &quot;Significant&quot; must be 
read in light of the requirement of having &quot;full answer and defence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; Darrach&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

===Evidence related to credibility and consent===
Evidence advanced to make an inference supported by an established myth is prohibited.  Any other inferences directed to credibility and consent may be argued as admissible. &lt;ref&gt;Ecker (1995), 96 C.C.C.(3d) 161(C.A.), &lt;/ref&gt;

Commentators have suggested that the prohibition should focus on &quot;general&quot; inference that are focused on attacking character of the complainant.&lt;ref&gt;David M. Paciocco, &quot;The New Rape Shield Provisions In Section 276 Should Survive Charter Challenge&quot; (1993), 21 C.R.(4th) 223&lt;/ref&gt; Some courts have adopted this in an attempt to reconcile s.276(1) and (2). &lt;ref&gt;Harper (1995), 137 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 77 (P.E.I.S.C.), rev’d on other grounds (1997), 149 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 295 (P.E.I.C.A.), &lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence has been admitted in the following scenarios:
* where the defence wanted to lead evidence of a romantic relationship between the accused and complainant where the complainant characterized it as platonic.&lt;ref&gt;Harris (1997), 118 C.C.C.(3d) 498 (C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence has been found inadmissible in the following scenarios:
* A sex toy party earlier in the day held by the victim constitutes sexual activity and is not relevant to the allegations so is not admissible.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. McDonald, 2003 SKQB 165&lt;/reF&gt;

Similar fact evidence is &quot;presumptively inadmissible. The onus is on the prosecution to satisfy the trial judge on the balance of probabilities that in the context of the particular case the probative value of the evidence in relation to a particular issue outweighs its potential prejudice and thereby justifies its reception.&quot;
&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Handy&lt;br&gt;
The Law of Evidence, by David M. Paciocco and Lee Stuesser, 5th ed. (Toronto: Irwin Law Inc., 2008) at page 55&lt;/ref&gt;

When assessing the similarities of incidents in a similar fact evidence application, the court should consider:&lt;ref&gt;e.g., R. v. Arp, [1998] 3 SCR 339 [http://canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1998/1998canlii769/1998canlii769.html] at para. 50;&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Handy, 2002 SCC 56, [2002] 2 SCR 908 [http://canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2002/2002scc56/2002scc56.html] at para. 82;&lt;Br&gt;
Watt’s Manual of Criminal Evidence, Thomson Reuters, 2010, at p. 503&lt;/ref&gt;
#the temporal proximity of the incidents;
#the physical or spatial proximity of the events; 
#the similarity in detail between the various acts;
#the number of putatively similar acts;
#the circumstances surrounding the incidents at issue;
#distinctive features unifying the incidents; and
#the occurrence and nature of any intervening events.

The risk of &quot;moral prejudice&quot; refers to risks of the evidence being used to draw a prohibited inference that the accused is the kind of person likely to the commit the offence charged.&lt;ref&gt;Handy&lt;/ref&gt;

The risk of &quot;reasoning prejudice&quot; includes risks such as:&lt;ref&gt;Handy&lt;/ref&gt;
* The trier of fact may be distracted from deciding the issue in a reasoned way because of the inflammatory nature of the proposed evidence
* The trier of facts may become confused about what evidence pertains to the crime charged and what evidence relates to the similar fact
* The trial will begin to focus disproportionately on whether the similar act happened
* The accused will be unable to respond to the allegation that the similar act occurred because of the passage of time, surprise or the collateral nature of the inquiry

Reasoning and moral prejudice are considered less of a concern for trials by judge alone than trial by jury.
&lt;ref&gt;R. v. B.(T.), [2009] O.J. No. 751 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Probative Value==

===Collusion===
Potential inadvertent collusion through rumors and media accounts may occur and should not by itself exclude similar fact evidence. However, such occurrence should go to the weight.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Dorsey, 2012 ONCA 185 (CanLII)&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}
===Similarities Between Acts===

What would be called &quot;generic similarities&quot; are to be given less consideration. The risk of &quot;relying 
primarily on generic similarities&quot; to support evidence establishing the actus reus includes the risk that the &quot;initial inference arising from the prior conduct becomes so general, that it approaches bad personhood&quot; and also the risk the accused's &quot;non-specific character, generic similarities may mask underlying dissimilarities that could be important in a particular case.&quot;
&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Blake 2003 CanLII 13682 (ON CA), (2003), 181 C.C.C. (3d) 169, affirmed 2004 SCC 69 (CanLII), (2004), 188 C.C.C. (3d) 428 (S.C.C.) at para 64&lt;br&gt;

The burden of proof indicates who has the responsibility or onus to prove something.

Generally, there are two types of burdens. First, there is the &quot;burden of pursuasion&quot;, often called a &quot;legal burden&quot;, &quot;primary burden&quot;, or &quot;major burden&quot;, which is the requirement to prove the case or disprove the defence. Failure to discharge this burden results in the party losing the case. This type of evidence typically is said to impose a &quot;onus of proof&quot;. Second, there is the &quot;evidential burden&quot;, often called the &quot;secondary burden&quot;, &quot;burden of going forward&quot;, or &quot;minor burden&quot;, which is the requirement of putting an issue before the court using the available evidence.  

{{reflist|2}}

==Presumption of Innocence==
It is well established in law that all persons are entitled to the legal presumption of innocence for all charges they are not convicted for.&lt;ref&gt;
Woolmington v. Director of Public Prosecutions, [1935] AC 462 &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Appleby, [1972] SCR 303 [http://canlii.ca/t/1nfms] &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Proudlock, [1979] 1 SCR 525 [http://canlii.ca/t/1mktb#par6 at para. 6]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore the Crown has the burden of proving all the elements of the offence.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Lauer, [http://canlii.ca/t/fkdt0#par73 2011 PECA 5 at para. 73]&lt;/ref&gt;
The onus of proving guilt never switches from the Crown to the accused.&lt;ref&gt;see R. v. Briand (2010), 258 C.C.C. (3d) 416 (N.L.C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;The “accused bears no burden to explain why his accuser made the allegations against him”&lt;ref&gt;see R. v. J.C.H., 2011 NLCA 8 at para 18&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
The standard of proof asks to how convinced the trier of fact must be of something.  Canadian criminal law has three core standards:&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Proudlock [http://canlii.ca/t/1mktb 1978 CanLII 15 (SCC)], [1979] 1 S.C.R. 525&lt;/ref&gt;
#'''Proof beyond a reasonable doubt''' which is the standard to be met by the Crown against the accused;
#'''a balance of probabilities''' or '''Proof on a preponderance of the evidence''' which is the burden of proof on the accused when he has to meet a presumption requiring him to establish or to prove a fact or an excuse;
#'''Evidence raising a reasonable doubt''' which is what is required to overcome any other presumption of fact or of law. Once a prima facie case has been established by the evidence of the crown, there is no need to prove innocence. Rather the accused need only raise a doubt in the evidence.&lt;Ref&gt;Batary v. Attorney General of Saskatchewan [1965] SCR 465, [http://canlii.ca/t/227rg 1965 CanLII 102 (SCC)], at p. 476&lt;/ref&gt;

The US has a fourth standard known as &quot;clear and convincing evidence&quot; which is a middle ground between the two standards, however, this has never been officially adopted in Canada. When a proposition at issue in a case, such as an element of an offence, must be proven, the standard must be reached using the weight of the totality of evidence presented, not on each individual piece of evidence &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Morin [http://canlii.ca/t/1ftc2 1988 CanLII 8] (SCC), [1988] 2 SCR 345&lt;/ref&gt;.

{{reflist|2}}

==Balance of Probabilities==
The &quot;balance of probabilities&quot; is described as being &quot;more probable than not&quot;, or more technically, the chance of the proposition being true is more than 50%. This standard is known as the civil standard as it exclusively used in civil trial cases.&lt;ref&gt;
Continental Insurance Co. v. Dalton Cartage Co., [http://canlii.ca/t/1lpbl 1982 CanLII 13] (SCC), [1982] 1 SCR 164 - SCC rejected a variable standard, adopting only balance of probabilities&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}

==Beyond a Reasonable Doubt (BARD)==
The standard of &quot;beyond a reasonable doubt&quot; (BARD) is a common law standard of proof in criminal matters.&lt;Ref&gt;
affirmed under the English common law of England in Woolmington v. D.P.P., [1935] A.C. 462 at 481-82 (H.L.)&lt;/ref&gt;
This standard is exclusively used in criminal or quasi-criminal proceedings. This includes not only adult criminal trials, but also young offender cases, adult sentencing, and certain provincial penal offences.

The standard of &quot;reasonable doubt&quot; consists of a doubt based on reason and common sense which must be logically based upon the  evidence or lack of evidence. It is not based on &quot;sympathy or prejudice&quot;. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Lifchus, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fqzt 1997 CanLII 319] (SCC), [1997] 3 S.C.R. 320 at para. 36&lt;br&gt;
See also:  In R. v. J.M.H., [http://canlii.ca/t/fnbb2 2011 SCC 45]  at 39 ( “a reasonable doubt does not need to be based on the evidence; it may arise from an absence of evidence or a simple failure of the evidence to persuade the trier of fact to the requisite level of beyond reasonable doubt.”) &lt;/ref&gt; 

Proof beyond a reasonable doubt &quot;it does not involve proof to an absolute certainty; it is not proof beyond any doubt nor is it an imaginary or frivolous doubt.&quot;&lt;Ref&gt;
Lifchus, at para. 36&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, belief that the accused is &quot;probably guilty&quot; is not sufficient and must acquit.&lt;ref&gt;
Lifcus at para. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard as the ultimate burden of proof is &quot;inextricably intertwined with that principle fundamental to all criminal trials, the presumption of innocence&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Lifchus at para. 36&lt;/ref&gt; The burden should never shift to the accused.&lt;ref&gt;Lifchus at para. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

The burden of proof placed upon the Crown lies “much closer to absolute certainty than to a balance of probabilities.”&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Starr, [http://canlii.ca/t/525l 2000 SCC 40] at para 242&lt;/ref&gt; The standard is more &quot;than proof that the accused is probably guilty&quot; in which case the judge must acquit.&lt;ref&gt; Lifchus at 36&lt;/ref&gt;

“[A] reasonable doubt does not need to be based on the evidence; it may arise from an absence of evidence or a simple failure of the evidence to persuade the trier of fact to the requisite level of beyond reasonable doubt.”&lt;ref&gt;R. v. J.M.H., 2011 SCC 45&lt;/ref&gt;  

The standard of BARD only applies to the evaluation of the evidence as a whole and not individual aspects of the evidence.&lt;ref&gt;
Stewart v. The Queen, [http://canlii.ca/t/1z6bm 1976 CanLII 202], [1977] 2 S.C.R. 748 at 759-61&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Morin, [http://canlii.ca/t/1ftc2 1988 CanLII 8], [1988] 2 S.C.R. 345 at 354, 44 C.C.C. (3d) 193&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. White, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fqqt 1998 CanLII 789], [1998] 2 S.C.R. 72, 125 C.C.C. (3d) 385 at paras. 38-41&lt;/ref&gt;

Reasonable doubt must come as a rational conclusion from the evidence available and not as a basis of conjecture.&lt;Ref&gt; 
R. v. Wild [http://canlii.ca/t/1xd3d 1970 CanLII 148] (SCC), [1971] SCR 101 at 113&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the issue is the reliability or credibility of a witness, the courts must generally consider corroborative evidence.&lt;ref&gt; 
R. v. Kehler, [http://canlii.ca/t/1ggzb 2004 SCC 11], [2004] 1 S.C.R. 328 at paras. 12-23&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

== Sufficiency of Proof ==
Before any evidence gets to a trier of fact there is often a requirement to discharge an evidential burden for the trier of law (i.e. the judge).

In a preliminary inquiry the Crown must show on the whole that the evidence they will present is sufficient to potentially convict the accused. The purpose of this initial evaluation is to avoid frivolous suiting being brought in that have no chance at success. 

The leading case for the standard of proof needed before evidence can be put to the jury is United States of America v. Shephard, [http://canlii.ca/t/1mx51 1976 CanLII 8] (SCC), [1977] 2 SCR 1067. The Court held that: 
:''[The] which governs a trial Judge in decideing whether the evidence is sufficient to justify him in withdrawing the case from the jury, and this is to be determined according to whether or not there is any evidence upon which a reasonable jury properly instructed could return a verdict of guilt.''

In a case where some of the evidence the Crown is relying upon is not directly to the issue of the case, the Crown must satisfy the judge that &quot;the evidence, ''if believed'', could reasonably support an inference of guilt.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;R.v. Arcuri, [http://canlii.ca/t/51xv2001 SCC 54] (CanLII), [2001] 2 SCR 828&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

== Legal Proof ==

Frequently seen standards of proof that are seen include:
#&quot;air of reality&quot; / prima facie case
#reasonable and probable grounds / reasonably-based probability 
#reasonable suspicion

===Air of Reality Test===

The air of reality test determines whether a particular legal defence should be considered by the trier-of-fact. When the standard is met, the effect is to add a burden upon the Crown to prove that the defence fails beyond a reasonable doubt.

In the context of a jury trial, the test determines whether the judge will give instructions to the jury that they should consider the particular defenses. .

The air of reality test creates a burden of evidence, not a persuasive burden.&lt;Ref&gt;
Cinous at para. 52 (&quot;It is trite law that the air of reality test imposes a burden on the accused that is merely evidential, rather than persuasive.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;

The test applies to ''all'' defences&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Cinous, [http://canlii.ca/t/51tb 2002 SCC 29] (CanLII), [2002] 2 S.C.R. 3 at para. 57 and 82&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; as well as all elements of each defence.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Ribic, [http://canlii.ca/t/21mq8 2008 ONCA 790] at para. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

The jury should be instructed of defences that have evidence supporting it.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Ribic, at para. 38 (all defences &quot;that are realistically available on the evidence&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
Cinous, at para. 50 (“a defence should be put to a jury if and only if there is an evidential foundation for it”)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
By inference, a &quot;judge has a positive duty to keep from the jury defences lacking an evidential foundation&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Gunning, [2005 SCC 27 2005 SCC 27] (CanLII), [2005] 1 S.C.R. 627, at para. 29
&lt;/ref&gt;
There must be evidence to support ''each'' element of the defence.&lt;ref&gt;
Ribic at para. 38 (&quot;if evidential support for a necessary element of a defence is lacking, the air of reality test will not be met.&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;

The test requires that there must be &quot;some evidence&quot; upon which &quot;a properly instructed jury acting reasonably could base an acquittal&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
Cinous, at para. 83&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision of a judge on the air of reality test may be reviewed as a &quot;question of law&quot; on a standard of &quot;correctness&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. McRae 2005 CanLII 26592 (ON CA) at para. 38 (&quot;[T]he question of whether there was an air of reality to the defence of duress is an issue of law&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
Cinous at para. 55&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Ryan, 2011 NSCA 30 (CanLII) at para. 114&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

The judge should not consider credibility, make findings of fact, draw inferences, or &quot;weigh&quot; the evidence.&lt;ref&gt;
Cinous at para. 54&lt;/ref&gt;
He or she should not consider the likelihood of success of the defence.&lt;ref&gt;
Cinous at para. 54 (&quot;whether the defence is likely, unlikely, somewhat likely, or very likely to succeed at the end of the day&quot;)
&lt;/ref&gt;

The judge must consider whether inferences would be necessary for the defence to succeed and whether those inferences from the evidence are reasonable.&lt;ref&gt;

Prior space projects have relied on a '''Mission''' concept of operations.  That is you plan a mission ahead of time, with a detailed timeline of all the steps you expect to perform.  Then the crew and ground controllers execute the plan.  If deviations happen, corrective action is taken to return to the plan as much as possible.  This concept works for a single mission in isolation with a well defined goal.  Future projects will have multiple activities in multiple locations, with larger numbers of people involved and interactions between activities.  So planning every step ahead of time in a linear fashion becomes difficult if not impossible.  For cost reasons, you also want to reduce the large amount of planning and training that currently goes on relative to the actual doing.

{{TOC right}}

==Operations Concepts==

For future projects, rather than planning everything in advance, one approach is to develop building blocks of tasks which can then be assembled as needed to reach a goal.  As new feedback comes in from other tasks, the building blocks can be adjusted or replaced as needed.  Changing plans may not be as efficient as carrying out a fully detailed plan made in advance, but the effort to make those advance plans may be larger than the efficiency loss.  The ability to change or replace tasks, rather than a monolithic preplanned mission, also allows continuing operations to adapt and improve over time.

==Operations Tasks==

===Debris Removal===

This task is the removal of human-made orbital debris, and, if possible, natural hazardous objects.  Over time, debris will collide with itself and decay from drag.  In the long term it will clean itself up, but in the short term the collisions will generate more hazardous size pieces, which is an unsatisfactory situation.  Besides clean up of past debris, this task takes care of cleaning up future defunct, lost, or destroyed hardware.  There are a number of methods which have been proposed to do this, none of which have been demonstrated yet:

* A &quot;plasma-puffer&quot;, promoted by Daniel Gregory. That would use an arc discharge from a high altitude balloon to puff air upwards in the path of the junk, making it de-orbit faster.
* Ballistic puffer, which launches a projectile from a very large gun, that releases air or some other material in the path of the debris, having the same effect. The projectile is sub-orbital, so it does not add to the space junk problem.
* Lasers - zap the front of the debris, blasting off some of it, and slowing it down from the reaction.
* Drag devices - attach a large sail or conducting wire to the space junk and make it slow down faster
* Orbital tug - goes from orbit to orbit collecting junk. This requires high efficiency electric thrusters or the fuel used gets absurdly high.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Elements==
In a Criminal trial, the crown will present evidence that will tend to establish the offence charged. Each offence in the Criminal Code is broken down into &quot;elements&quot; that comprise the offence. Each element must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt before a judge can consider making a verdict of guilt.

The elements of each offence are unique for each offence. For a list of elements of major offences, see [[Canadian Criminal Law/Offences]]. Common with all criminal offences in Canada are the basic requirements of an action or omission (known as the &quot;''actus reus''&quot;) and a criminal intent (known as the &quot;''mens rea''&quot;). What constitutes a ''actus reus'' and ''mens rea'' depends on the offence itself. For example, a drug possession charge requires proving ''mens rea'' by establishing that the accused had knowledge of the presence of the substance on their person. An assault, however, requires proving a ''mens rea'' by establishing intended the application of force.    

There are more static elements that need to be proven, such as the identity of the accused as the person subject to the offence, jurisdiction of the court over the person accused, and the timing of the offence.  Identity can sometimes be a non-trivial issue where the accused was not caught in the act. Courts are very wary of wrongful convictions based on identity. The jurisdiction and time elements simply establish that the court is able to adjudicate the matter. Judges cannot concern themselves of offences outside of the province or offences without any specific time period.

Where defences are concerned, the Crown has no obligation to disprove them unless the evidence provides an &quot;air of reality&quot; to the availability of a defence.

{{Quotation|
'''Correction of child by force'''&lt;br&gt;
43. Every schoolteacher, parent or person standing in the place of a parent is justified in using force by way of correction toward a pupil or child, as the case may be, who is under his care, if the force does not exceed what is reasonable under the circumstances.
&lt;br&gt;
R.S., c. C-34, s. 43.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec43 CCC]}} 

Section 43, sets out three requirements&lt;REf&gt;R. v. Gervin, [http://canlii.ca/t/fq3sq 2012 MBQB 44] at para 5&lt;Br&gt;
see also R. v. Sinclair 2008 MBCA 15&lt;Br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
#The force must have been intended for corrective purposes. 
#The child must have been capable of benefiting from the correction.
#The force used must have been objectively reasonable under the circumstances.
 
The first requirement implies that the actions of the child called for corrective action.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Accident==
An accident is a &quot;mishap or untoward event not expected or designed&quot;, or &quot;unforeseen contingency or occurence&quot; &lt;ref&gt;
R v Whitehorne [http://canlii.ca/t/1lp2r 2005 CanLII 34553] (NLPC)&lt;Br&gt;
Hill v. R., [http://canlii.ca/t/1twzh 1973 CanLII 36], [1975] 2 SCR 402, (1974) 14 CCC (2d) 505 (SCC) at p. 510&lt;/ref&gt;
It's meaning varies depending on the type of charge. Where it is a specific intent offence, an accident relates to a denial of voluntariness of the act or denial of intention to cause the outcome. General intent offence claims the act was unexpected or chance that was not foreseeable. &lt;ref&gt;
Criminal Pleading &amp; Practice, Ewaschuck, (2nd Edition) at para. 21.0030&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Mathisen, [http://canlii.ca/t/21dw7 2008 ONCA 747] at 70&lt;/ref&gt;

The effect in law is that the mens rea is not present. This is distinctive from mistake which occurs in “the realm of perception”.&lt;ref&gt; R v Whitehorne &lt;/ref&gt;

Once the accused establishes there is an &quot;air of reality&quot; to the defence, the crown must disprove the availability of the defence. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Sutherland, [http://canlii.ca/t/20t70 1993 CanLII 6614] (SK CA), (1994) 84 CCC (3d) 484 (Sask. C.A.) per Vanscise, J.A., at pp. 497-498&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
==Reflex==
It is permissible to argue that the action of accused was not voluntary as it was a reflexive act.&lt;ref&gt;

R. v. Mullin (1990), 56 C.C.C. (3d) 476 (P.E.I.C.A.)&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==De Minimus Principle==
The principle of ''de minimus non curat lex'' excludes certain acts from criminal sanctions due to their trivial nature. The principle is based on the premise that the law should not concern itself with trifling matters. 

In general, the least touching of another person without their consent constitutes an assault.&lt;ref&gt;see R. v. Dawydiuk (2010), 253 C.C.C. (3d) 493, [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/2010/2010bcca162/2010bcca162.html 2010 BCCA 162]&lt;/ref&gt;  The strength of the force is immaterial to consideration of guilt. &lt;ref&gt;see R. v. Palombi (2007), 222 C.C.C. (3d) 528 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;

The principle cannot be applied in the context of domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Downey, 2002 NSSC 226 at para. 38&lt;/ref&gt;

The defence can be invoked in relation to the possession of drugs where the amounts alleged are merely residual particles of a controlled substance. &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Marusiak, 2002 ABQB 774&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-consensual touching that amounts to an assault, or that was trivial, is subject to the legal maxim ''de minimus non curat lex''.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Juneja,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/oncj/doc/2009/2009oncj572/2009oncj572.html 2009 ONCJ 572]&lt;br&gt;
R v Hinchey (1996) 111 CCC 3d 353 (SCC) at P 380-81 &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Light strikes can fall within the meaning of trifling.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Merasty, 2002 SKPC 86, R. v. Wiebe, 2001 SKQB 389&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">
==General Principles==
Certain offences mandate higher penalties where there is a prior conviction for the offence. The higher penalty can only be sought where the Crown has given notice of their intention to seek greater punishment.

Offences for which this applies include:
* [[Canadian Criminal Law/Offences/Use of Firearm in Commission of an Offence|use firearm]] (s. 85) 
* [[Canadian Criminal Law/Offences/Unsafe Storage of a Firearm|careless storage of a firearm]] (86)
* [[Canadian Criminal Law/Offences/Possession of Unauthorized Firearm|possession firearm]] (92) 
* betting, pool-selling, bookmaking (202)
* placing bets on other’s behalf (203)
* [[Canadian Criminal Law/Offences/Impaired Driving and Over 80|impaired driving and over 80]] (253)
* [[Canadian Criminal Law/Offences/Refusal|refusal]] (254)

By failing to give proper notice the Crown cannot rely upon the legislated mandatory minimums. However, a judge may still consider the prior record when sentencing and can impose the mandatory minimum as long as it is in the range of sentence.&lt;reF&gt;
R v Norris, (1988) 41 C.C.C. (3d) 441 (N.W.T.C.A.)
&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
==Notice==
Notice of increased penalty is governed by s. 727(1):      
{{quotation|              
727. (1) Subject to subsections (3) and (4), where an accused or a defendant is convicted of an offence for which a greater punishment may be imposed by reason of previous convictions, no greater punishment shall be imposed on him by reason thereof unless the prosecutor satisfies the court that the accused or defendant, before making his plea, was notified that a greater punishment would be sought by reason thereof.
|[http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec727 CCC]}}

Section 727(1) does not specifically require written notice, thus, both written or verbal notice is sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;R v Collini (1979) 3 MVR 218 (Ont HCJ)&lt;/ref&gt;

There is divided cases on whether the accused must be served personally or whether service on the agent or counsel is sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Beaulieu;  R. v. Lepine (1979), 50 C.C.C. (2d) 189 (Que. S.C.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
The dominant opinion however has been that service of notice upon counsel is sufficient to satisfy the requirements of s.727(1) and that personal service is not necessary.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Fowler, (1982), 2 C.C.C. (3d) 227 (NSCA)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Simms, (1986), 31 C.C.C. (3d) 350 (NLCA)&lt;BR&gt;
R. v. Godon, (1984), 12 C.C.C. (3d) 446, (SKCA)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Van Boeyen, 1996 CanLII 8372 (BC CA)&lt;bR&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
In select jurisdictions, such as Saskatchewan, it has been determined that service upon an agent, including a relative, is also sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Godon, (1984), 12 C.C.C. (3d) 446, (SKCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not sufficient to notify the accused that the Crown “may” be seeking a greater punishment.&lt;Ref&gt;
R .  v. Riley (1982), 69 C.C.C. (2d) 245 (Ont. High Ct.) 
&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not necessary to notify the accused of the nature and character of the penalty sought, including the length of the possible jail sentence.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Bear (1979), 47 C.C.C. (2d) 462 (Sask C.A.) 
&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no need for “reasonable notice”. So notice can be given on the day of trial.&lt;ref&gt;R v Bufford (1988) 46 CCC (3d) 116 (Ont.DC)&lt;/reF&gt;

Notice must be given to the accused of the Crown's intention to seek a greater penalty for past offences.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Zaccaria, 2005 ABCA 130 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abca/doc/2005/2005abca130/2005abca130.html]; R. v. Veinot (1983), NSCA__&lt;/ref&gt;


Although it is generally practiced, it is not necessary to specify the previous convictions being relied upon when giving notice.&lt;ref&gt;R v Pidlubny (1973) 10 CCC (2d) 178 (ONCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two lines of cases on the issue of whether the notice is discretionary on the judge to accept. This turns on whether the notice is part of the core prosecutorial duties which are not reviewable by a court absent evidence of abuse of process or bad faith.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Haneveld 2008 ABPC 382 - not reviewable by court&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Gill,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onsc/doc/2011/2011onsc1145/2011onsc1145.html 2011 ONSC 1145] - reviewable by court&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Cases is support of the crown discretion view suggests that to do otherwise would create too much second guessing and erode the boundary between the separatoin of powers.&lt;ref&gt; R v Mohla [2012] OJ No. 388 at 164&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the crown does not serve proper notice under s. 727, then the accused cannot be said to have been convicted &quot;of an offence that is punishable by a minimum term of imprisonment&quot; under s.742.1, and so would not disqualify the offender from being subject to a conditional sentence.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Demchuk, [http://canlii.ca/t/l0l 2003 CanLII 15723] (ON CA)
&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Evidence==
The admissibility of evidence is significantly different in a sentencing hearings than in trials. The interests at stake differ in a sentencing as opposed to a trial as the presumption of innocence is gone and there is no longer a concern for a wrongful conviction.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Angelillo, [http://canlii.ca/t/1q3xt 2006 SCC 55] (CanLII), [2006] 2 SCR 728 such as at para. 30
&lt;/ref&gt;

In sentencing, courts should be open to a broad range of information in order to achieve the objectives under the Code.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Jones, [http://canlii.ca/t/1frtc 1994 CanLII 85] (SCC), [1994] 2 SCR 229 at p.396 (&quot;...both the public interest in safety and the general sentencing interest of developing the most appropriate penalty for the particular offender dictate the greatest possible range of information on which to make an accurate evaluation of the ganger posed by the offender.&quot;) and at p. 398 (&quot;sentencing judge is to obtain the accurate assessment of the offender that is necessary to develop an appropriate sentence, he will have to have at his disposal the broadest possible range of information.&quot;( &lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the evidence must still meet the standard of accuracy, credibility and reliability.&lt;Ref&gt;
McWilliams' Canadian Criminal Evidence, Fourth Edition at 34:10&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Lévesque, [http://canlii.ca/t/523w 2000 SCC 47] (CanLII), [2000] 2 SCR 487 at para. 30&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Campbell, [http://canlii.ca/t/f6k 2003 CanLII 49352] (ON SC) at para. 31&lt;br&gt;
Angelillo  at para. 20
&lt;/ref&gt;

The prejudicial effect of the evidence should not outweigh the probative value.&lt;ref&gt;
Angelillo at para. 32&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Edwards, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fbx6 2001 CanLII 24105] (ON CA) at para. 63
Campbell&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Exclusionary rules of evidence are not applied strictly in sentencing.&lt;ref&gt;
Campbell at para. 29, 31, 32&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Boyd, [http://canlii.ca/t/23m12 1983 CanLII 240] (BC CA)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Admissibility voir dires, such as for voluntariness, may be held but are not necessary.&lt;ref&gt;
Campbell at para. 9&lt;/ref&gt;


In 1996, Part XXIII was amended to create a statutory framework for sentencing hearings.&lt;ref&gt;
Angelillo, such as at para. 21
&lt;/ref&gt;

The law of evidence at sentencing equally applies to dangerous and long term offenders.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Johnson, [http://canlii.ca/t/51pl 2003 SCC 46] (CanLII), [2003] 2 SCR 357 at para. 23
&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Character Evidence'''&lt;br&gt;
Character evidence is admissible and relevant to sentencing.&lt;Ref&gt;
Edwards at para.39-42&lt;br&gt;
Angelillo at para. 28, 29 &lt;/ref&gt; Character evidence may be excluded where fairness would outweigh the probative value.&lt;ref&gt;Angelillo at para. 32&lt;Br&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Factual findings===
Section 723 codifies the common law rules on submission of evidence on sentencing.

{{quotation|
'''Submissions on facts'''&lt;br&gt;
723. (1) Before determining the sentence, a court shall give the prosecutor and the offender an opportunity to make submissions with respect to any facts relevant to the sentence to be imposed.
&lt;p&gt;
'''Submission of evidence'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) The court shall hear any relevant evidence presented by the prosecutor or the offender.
&lt;p&gt;
'''Production of evidence'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) The court may, on its own motion, after hearing argument from the prosecutor and the offender, require the production of evidence that would assist it in determining the appropriate sentence.
&lt;p&gt;
'''Compel appearance'''&lt;br&gt;
(4) Where it is necessary in the interests of justice, the court may, after consulting the parties, compel the appearance of any person who is a compellable witness to assist the court in determining the appropriate sentence.
&lt;p&gt;
...&lt;p&gt;
R.S., 1985, c. C-46, s. 723; 1995, c. 22, s. 6.
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;p&gt;
'''Information accepted'''&lt;br&gt;
724. (1) In determining a sentence, a court may accept as proved any information disclosed at the trial or at the sentencing proceedings and any facts agreed on by the prosecutor and the offender.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec723 CCC]
}}

On a guilty plea, a judge may rely on facts that are agreed upon by the parties. The Crown will read the facts alleged as well as submit allegations of prior criminal convictions.&lt;ref&gt;
e.g. R v Bartlett, [http://canlii.ca/t/1m697 2005 NLCA 75] (CanLII)&lt;/ref&gt; The Defence must have an opportunity to deny or consent to the allegations.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Cataract (1994), 93 CCC 486 (SaskCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, at a minimum the crown should read-in enough facts to make out the essential elements of the offence. Preferably there should also be all admitted facts going to aggravating and mitigating factors.

The judge may rely upon any information placed before him. This includes submissions by Crown and Defence counsel as well as admissible evidence.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Bartlett [http://canlii.ca/t/1m697 2005 NLCA 75] (CanLII)&lt;/ref&gt;

A guilty plea is only an admission of the essential elements of the offence.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Gardiner, [1982] 368 S.C.R. 2 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1982/1982canlii30/1982canlii30.html 1982 CanLII 30] at 330 and 331&lt;/ref&gt;

On sentencing, where facts are not in dispute, the judge may makes inferences from proven or undisputed evidence.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Ducharme, [http://canlii.ca/t/fr0w3 2012 MBCA 35] at para 5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disputed of facts===

&lt;p&gt;...&lt;p&gt;
'''Disputed facts'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) Where there is a dispute with respect to any fact that is relevant to the determination of a sentence,
:(a) the court shall request that evidence be adduced as to the existence of the fact unless the court is satisfied that sufficient evidence was adduced at the trial;
:(b) the party wishing to rely on a relevant fact, including a fact contained in a presentence report, has the burden of proving it;
:(c) either party may cross-examine any witness called by the other party;
:(d) subject to paragraph (e), the court must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities of the existence of the disputed fact before relying on it in determining the sentence; and
:(e) the prosecutor must establish, by proof beyond a reasonable doubt, the existence of any aggravating fact or any previous conviction by the offender.
&lt;p&gt;
|R.S., 1985, c. C-46, s. 724; 1995, c. 22, s. 6.|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec724 CCC]
}}

Where there is a dispute on facts, the court cannot rely upon the crown's version without supported facts.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Choice Atlantic Seafoods Inc., 2001 NSSC 161 at para. 7&lt;/ref&gt;
To settle the conflict the judge must hear evidence to settle the evidence or chose to accept the accused's version &quot;so far as possible&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; s. 724(3)(e)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Choice Atlantic Seafoods Inc., 2001 NSSC 161 at para. 7 citing R. v. Poorman 1991 CanLII 2759 (SK C.A.), (1991), 6 C.R. (4th) 364 (Sask. C.A.)
&lt;/ref&gt; 
If the difference amounts to a dispute between characterizations, the Defence must call evidence.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Poulin, [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/1995/1995canlii2368/1995canlii2368.html 1995 CanLII 2368] (BCCA)&lt;/ref&gt;

Aggravating facts must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt by the crown.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Larche, [http://canlii.ca/t/1q3xv#par43 2006 SCC 56], [2006] 2 S.C.R. 762 at para. 43-44
R. v. Tomdio-Yiuiti, [http://www.canlii.org/en/sk/skca/doc/2010/2010skca81/2010skca81.html 2010 SKCA 81]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Malinowski, [http://canlii.ca/t/1r2qg 2007 SKCA 33] at para. 6&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Lewis, 2012 NLCA 11, (&quot;an aggravating factor that is disputed is, like an essential element of the offence, required to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt.&quot;)
R. v.  Gardiner, [http://canlii.ca/t/1lpcq 1982 CanLII 30] (S.C.C.), [1982] 2 S.C.R. 368 at p. 414-5&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Angelillo [http://canlii.ca/t/1q3xt 2006 SCC 55] (CanLII), (2006), 214 C.C.C. (3d) 309 (S.C.C.), (&quot;the extrinsic evidence is contested, the prosecution must prove it. Since the facts in question will doubtless be aggravating facts, they must be proved beyond a reasonable doubt (s. 724(3)(e)). The court can sentence the offender only for the offence of which he or she has been convicted, and the sentence must be proportionate to the gravity of that offence...&quot;)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

A &quot;Gardiner Hearing&quot; refers to the hearing of oral evidence that is conducted at sentencing where there is a dispute between the parties as to the facts on a guilty plea.&lt;ref&gt; see R. v. Gardiner, 1982 CanLII 30 (SCC), [1982] 2 S.C.R. 368 (the &quot;issue should be resolved by ordinary legal principles governing criminal proceedings&quot;)&lt;/ref&gt;

This hearing is conducted according to s. 724(3). It will concern the “extrinsic evidence” that must be proven by the crown.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Angelillo 2006 SCC 55 (CanLII), (2006), 214 C.C.C. (3d) 309 (S.C.C.),&lt;/ref&gt;

The Crown does not have to prove voluntariness of statements made by the accused.&lt;ref&gt;

===Evidence of Untried Offences===
Evidence of untried offences is generally a form of character evidence and may be admissible.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. McCauley, [2007] O.J. No. 1593 (S.C.)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Fouquet, [http://canlii.ca/t/1lkj3 2005 ABQB 673] (CanLII)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Factors to consider whether untried conduct is admissible to establish character includes the following:&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Edwards, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fbx6 2001 CanLII 24105] (ON CA)&lt;/ref&gt;
# the nexus between the evidence and the offence for which the offender was convicted—the closer the connection the more likely the evidence will shed light on the circumstances of the charged offence;
# the similarity between the evidence and the offence for which the offender was convicted;
# the difficulty the offender may encounter in properly defending against the allegations in the proposed evidence;
# the danger that the sentence hearing will be unduly prolonged;
# the danger that the focus of the sentence hearing will appear to be diverted from the true purpose of imposing a fit sentence for the charged offence that is proportionate to the gravity of the offence and the degree of responsibility of the offender in accordance with s. 718.1;
# whether, as in Lees, the offender has adduced evidence of good character; and
# the cogency of the proposed evidence.

      <comment>/* Joint Recommendations */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">==Introduction==
A plea bargain is an agreement between the Crown and defence whereby the Defence agrees to plead guilty to particular offences in exchange for a particular proposal on sentence. If the defence accepts the offer on sentence, the agreement is put the judge as a jointly recommended sentence. 

==Joint Recommendations==
A joint recommendation is an agreement on penalty between the Crown and Defence to present a single penalty recommendation that the judge is asked to adopt. 

A joint recommendation does not need to encompass all aspects of the sentence. There can be a joint recommendation on part of a sentence, such as the form of penalty, while still keeping aspects of the penalty in dispute, such as the length of the penalty, conditions associated with the penalty, or ancillary orders.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. R. v. Parsons, [http://canlii.ca/t/fvf3f 2012 CanLII 81320] (NL SCTD) - length of CSO and ancillary orders in dispute alone&lt;/ref&gt;

A joint submission often indicates a lower range of sentence.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Kane [http://canlii.ca/t/fs972 2012 NLCA 53]&lt;/ref&gt; The motivation for an agreement is often due to a weak aspect in the Crown's case or the risk of the judge giving a higher penalty than what would sought by defence without an agreement. 

A joint recommendation may even be accepted where it is more lenient than the lower end of the normal range.&lt;ref&gt;R v Oake [http://canlii.ca/t/28pd1 2010 NLCA 19] at 64&lt;/ref&gt;

Sentences arising from a joint recommendation &quot;have little or no precedential value.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Johnston, [http://canlii.ca/t/fmqxj 2011 NLCA 56] &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Johnson, [http://canlii.ca/t/2ct1p 2010 ABQB 546] &lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Benlolo [http://canlii.ca/t/1nj8l 2006 CanLII 19284] (ON CA), (2006), 81 O.R. (3d) 440 (C.A.)&lt;Br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Deference'''&lt;br&gt;
A joint recommended sentence is a sentence for which the courts do not readily overturn. &lt;ref&gt;
R. v. J.W.I.B., [http://canlii.ca/t/58s1 2003 MBCA 92]&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Pashe (S.J.) [http://canlii.ca/t/1pfkc 1995 CanLII 6256] (MB C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt; 
The court may only do so where the sentence in not within a reasonably appropriate range for the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Smith, [http://canlii.ca/t/1jj1t 2004 BCCA 657] &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Gartner, [http://canlii.ca/t/2fptk 2010 BCCA 600] &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Wickstrom, [http://canlii.ca/t/flrqw 2011 BCSC 745]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Cerasuolo [http://canlii.ca/t/1fbn2 2001 CanLII 24172] (ON CA)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. DeSousa, [http://canlii.ca/t/fr17k 2012 ONCA 254]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt; The judge must give reasons for not adopting a joint recommendation.

A judge should give serious consideration to a joint sentencing proposal.&lt;ref&gt;R v GWC, [http://canlii.ca/t/5rmx 2000 ABCA 333] at para 17&lt;/ref&gt;

There is less weight given to &quot;joint recommendations&quot; that do not involve a &quot;quid pro quo&quot; (i.e. some reduced recommendation on sentence).&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Wolonciej, [http://www.canlii.org/en/mb/mbca/doc/2011/2011mbca91/2011mbca91.html 2011 MBCA 91] at 10&lt;/ref&gt;
Likewise, where the accused was without counsel less deference is given.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Bambrick, [http://www.canlii.org/en/nl/nlca/doc/2011/2011nlca79/2011nlca79.html 2011 NLCA 79] at para. 14&lt;/reF&gt;

'''When Not Followed'''&lt;br&gt;
If a judge has reservations to adopt a joint recommendations it should allow counsel an opportunity to respond.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v GWC, 2000 ABCA 333 (CanLII), 2000 ABCA 333 at 26
&lt;/ref&gt; 
Likewise, where a judge is looking to go beyond the range set by counsel, the judge should equally provide notice to the parties before going above or below the range.&lt;ref&gt;
R v Hood, [http://canlii.ca/t/flqvp 2011 ABCA 169] at 14&lt;Br&gt; 
R v Abel, [http://canlii.ca/t/fm1mv 2011 NWTCA 4] at 23&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Burback, [http://canlii.ca/t/fq14b 2012 ABCA 30]&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/reF&gt; 
Similarly, where a judge wishes to impose a condition that was not contemplated by either party nor could it have been easily foreseen, then the judge should also provide notice before doing so.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Beal, [http://canlii.ca/t/2fk7g 2011 ABCA 35]
&lt;/reF&gt;

'''Other Issues'''&lt;br&gt;
Where the accused misapprehended the joint recommendation, it can be grounds for a successful appeal of a sentence.&lt;ref&gt;
e.g. R v Kinney, [http://www.canlii.org/en/sk/skca/doc/2011/2011skca122/2011skca122.html 2011 SKCA 122]
&lt;/ref&gt;
Where an offender is unaware of a significant consequence of a particular sentence agreed upon, such as deportation without appeal, the court may reopen the consideration of sentence.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Jamieson, [http://canlii.ca/t/fpf0n 2011 NSCA 122]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
It generally preferred that when calculating a global sentence for multiple offences that the sentence be determined before taking into account pre-trial custody. Instead, the ordered sentence should be declared to be reduced for pre-trial custody credit.
&lt;ref&gt; 
R. v. Schira,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abca/doc/2004/2004abca369/2004abca369.html 2004 ABCA 369]
R. v. Letta,  [http://www.canlii.org/en/mb/mbca/doc/2004/2004mbca179/2004mbca179.html 2004 MBCA 179]
&lt;/ref&gt;

A failure to take into account remand time is an error of principle.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Aubin [http://canlii.ca/t/2607r#par2 2009 BCCA 418 at 2] &lt;/ref&gt;
The method of taking into account remand time is to first calculate the total sentence and then deduct an amount of credit based on the amount of time served.&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Orr [http://canlii.ca/t/1vsdv 2008 BCCA 76] at para. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

On February, 2010, the ''Truth in Sentencing Act'' came into force limiting to circumstances where offenders on remand can get 2 for 1 credit. All offences occurring before that date will still be subject to the old rules of remand credit.

Prior to 2010, courts had discretion to grant 2:1 remand credit for time spent in custody. In practice, this was granted in most cases. The addition of s. 719(3.1) required a credit of 1:1 unless justified and with a maximum of 1:1.5 credit for remand time.

{{Quotation|
s. 719&lt;P&gt;...&lt;P&gt;
'''Determination of sentence'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) In determining the sentence to be imposed on a person convicted of an offence, a court may take into account any time spent in custody by the person as a result of the offence but the court shall limit any credit for that time to a maximum of one day for each day spent in custody.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Exception'''&lt;br&gt;
(3.1) Despite subsection (3), if the circumstances justify it, the maximum is one and one-half days for each day spent in custody unless the reason for detaining the person in custody was stated in the record under subsection 515(9.1) or the person was detained in custody under subsection 524(4) or (8).
&lt;P&gt;
'''Reasons'''&lt;br&gt;
(3.2) The court shall give reasons for any credit granted and shall cause those reasons to be stated in the record.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Record of proceedings'''&lt;br&gt;
(3.3) The court shall cause to be stated in the record and on the warrant of committal the offence, the amount of time spent in custody, the term of imprisonment that would have been imposed before any credit was granted, the amount of time credited, if any, and the sentence imposed.
&lt;P&gt;...&lt;P&gt;
R.S., 1985, c. C-46, s. 719; R.S., 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 157; 1995, c. 22, s. 6; 2009, c. 29, s. 3.

}}

Where the offence is one with a mandatory minimum, the court may give remand credit that has the effect of reducing the sentence below the mandatory jail sentence.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Wust 2000 18&lt;br&gt; R. v. Arthurs, 2000 SCC 19 at 1&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Circumstances in which enhanced credit have been given include:&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Stonefish, 2012 MBCA 116 (CanLII) - summary of circumstances of enhanced credit&lt;/ref&gt;
# Conditions of the remand facilities:
## lack of available programming and counselling&lt;Ref&gt;
e.g., R. v. Haly, 2012 ONSC 2302 (CanLII) -- 1.2:1 time was given&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Mullins (P.E.), 2011 SKQB 478 (CanLII)&lt;Br&gt;
R. c. Auger, 2012 QCCQ 568 (CanLII)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
## frequency of lockdowns during remand&lt;ref&gt;
e.g. Mullins&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Oates, 2012 ONCJ 461 (CanLII)&lt;br&gt;
c.f. R. v. Sayed, 2012 ONSC 843 (CanLII)
&lt;/ref&gt;
## duration of time in solitary confinement&lt;ref&gt;
e.g., R. v. Seymour, 2011 BCSC 1682 (CanLII) solitary for his own protection&lt;br&gt;
R. c. Guo, 2011 QCCQ 10469 (CanLII)&lt;Br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
## other harsh circumstances in the facility such as double bunking, sleeping on floor, violence, etc.&lt;ref&gt;
e.g., R. v. J.B., 2011 BCPC 158 (CanLII) - double-bunking and exposure to violence&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Clayton, 2012 ABQB 333 (CanLII) - overcrowding, slept on the floor&lt;Br&gt;
Auger - no visitors while on remand&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
# delay post-trial not attributed to the accused:
## delay due to court scheduling&lt;ref&gt;
e.g., R. v. Dingwell (D.A.), 2012 PESC 13 (CanLII)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. B.R.S., 2011 ONCJ 484 (CanLII)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Sabatine, 2012 ONCJ 310 (CanLII) - judge requested further submissions and time spent drafting reasons&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
## request by Court or Crown for a pre-sentence report or Gladue report&lt;ref&gt;
e.g,. R. v. House (Z.C.) (2012), 319 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 197 (NL Prov. Ct.)&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Sharkey, 2011 BCSC 1541 (CanLII)&lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Mozumdar, 2012 ONCJ 151 (CanLII)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
## multiple court appearances for the purposes of sentencing&lt;ref&gt;
e.g., R. v. Przybyla, 2012 ABPC 183 (CanLII)&lt;Br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;
# delay due to Crown&lt;ref&gt;
e.g., R. c. Lefrançois, 2012 QCCQ 5655 (CanLII)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Enhanced credit will be ''denied'' in circumstances such as:
# delay caused by the offender, including where the proceedings are drawn out deliberately.&lt;Ref&gt;
See R. v. Leggo (R.) (2012), 317 Nfld. &amp; P.E.I.R. 252 (NL Prov. Ct.)&lt;Br&gt; 
R. v. Morris, 2011 ONSC 5206 (CanLII)
R v Johnson, 2011 ONCJ 77&lt;br&gt; 
J.B.&lt;br&gt; 
Sabatine&lt;br&gt;

'''Victim impact statement'''&lt;br&gt;
722. (1) For the purpose of determining the sentence to be imposed on an offender or whether the offender should be discharged pursuant to section 730 in respect of any offence, the court shall consider any statement that may have been prepared in accordance with subsection (2) of a victim of the offence describing the harm done to, or loss suffered by, the victim arising from the commission of the offence.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Procedure for victim impact statement'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) A statement referred to in subsection (1) must be
:(a) prepared in writing in the form and in accordance with the procedures established by a program designated for that purpose by the lieutenant governor in council of the province in which the court is exercising its jurisdiction; and
:(b) filed with the court.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Presentation of statement'''&lt;br&gt;
(2.1) The court shall, on the request of a victim, permit the victim to read a statement prepared and filed in accordance with subsection (2), or to present the statement in any other manner that the court considers appropriate.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Evidence concerning victim admissible'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) Whether or not a statement has been prepared and filed in accordance with subsection (2), the court may consider any other evidence concerning any victim of the offence for the purpose of determining the sentence to be imposed on the offender or whether the offender should be discharged under section 730.
&lt;P&gt;

&lt;P&gt;
'''Copy of statement'''&lt;br&gt;
722.1 The clerk of the court shall provide a copy of a statement referred to in subsection 722(1), as soon as practicable after a finding of guilt, to the offender or counsel for the offender, and to the prosecutor.

Under [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec722 s. 722(2)], the Court must consider victim impact statements that are submitted to the court. After a finding of guilt, the court is required under [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/rsc-1985-c-c-46/latest/rsc-1985-c-c-46.html#sec722.2 s. 722.2(1)], to inquire whether the victim has been advised of the opportunity to prepare a victim impact statement.

{{reflist|2}}

==Persons Who can File a VIS==
Only a victim may file a VIS. Section 722(4) defines a victim as:
{{quotation|
'''Definition of “victim”'''&lt;br&gt;
(4) For the purposes of this section and section 722.2, “victim”, in relation to an offence,
:(a) means a person to whom harm was done or who suffered physical or emotional loss as a result of the commission of the offence; and
:(b) where the person described in paragraph (a) is dead, ill or otherwise incapable of making a statement referred to in subsection (1), includes the spouse or common-law partner or any relative of that person, anyone who has in law or fact the custody of that person or is responsible for the care or support of that person or any dependant of that person.
&lt;P&gt;
R.S., 1985, c. C-46, s. 722; 1995, c. 22, s. 6; 1999, c. 25, s. 17(Preamble); 2000, c. 12, s. 95.
|[http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec722 CCC]
}}

The victim must also be capable of &quot;describing the harm done to, or loss suffered by, the victim arising from the commission of the offence.&quot;(s. 722(1))

It has been recommended that VIS not be permitted in by persons who are &quot;unidentified in their connection to the [victim] or too remote in connection&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel at para.48&lt;/ref&gt;


==Form of Statement==
It has been suggested that in order for a VIS to be admissible it should contain the following:
&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Gabriel (1999), 137 C.C.C. (3d) 1 (Ont. Sup. Ct.) at para. 16&lt;/ref&gt;
*the statement is to be prepared in writing,
*the statement is to be in the form and in accordance with procedures established by a program designated for that purpose by the province,
*the statement is to be authored by a person meeting the definition of &quot;victim&quot; (s. 722(4) of the Code),
*the statement is to describe the harm done to, or loss suffered by, the victim arising from the commission of the offence,
*the statement is to be filed with the Court,
*the clerk of the Court is to provide a copy of the statement to the prosecution and the defence (s. 722.1 of the Code)

It is important that when considering the VIS that the court maintain its “independent neutrality&quot; by not &quot;react[ing] to public opinion as to the severity of sentences.&quot;&lt;ref&gt;
Gabriel at para. 33&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}

==Admissible Content==

Impact statements should describe &quot;the harm done to, or loss suffered by, the victim arising from the commission of the offence&quot;. (s. 722(1))


==Inappropriate Content for a VIS==
The Statement should describe the harm arising out of the offence. It is not an opportunity for the victim to criticize the offender, including his character, assert facts or recommend sentence. Such comments are inadmissible.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Gabriel, 1999 CanLII 15050 (ON S.C.) 137 C.C.C. (3d) 1 at para. 16&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Bremner, 2000 BCCA 345 at 27&lt;/ref&gt; Nor should there be reference to offences not charged.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Noor, 2011 BCSC 1629 at 21&lt;/ref&gt;

There is limited cases where sentence recommendation may be admissible, such as during a sentencing circle.&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel at para. 29 to 33&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested the follow sort of statements not be permitted:&lt;ref&gt;Gabriel at para. 48 to 53&lt;/ref&gt;
# statements by persons with unidentified connections to the victim or to remote a connection
# references to facts that are not accurate
# statements speaking of the offender including character&lt;ref&gt;e.g.R. v. Walchuk, [2001] S.J. No. 148 (Sask.C.A.)&lt;/ref&gt;
# suggesting penalties 
# seeks personal revenge &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Bremner [2000] B.C.J. No. 1096 (B.C.C.A), R. v. Sangha, [2001] A.J. No. 545 (Alta. Q.B.), R. v. D.M.L.G. [2001], S.J. No. 581 (Sask. Prov. Ct.), R. v. Hawley [1999] O.J. No. 5393  &lt;/ref&gt;
# promoting an &quot;eye for an eye&quot;
# statements that are inflammatory and jeopardize the desired restraint in sentencing&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Bremner [2000] B.C.J. No. 1096 (B.C.C.A) calls offender a pedophile&lt;/ref&gt;
# makes diagnoses of the offender&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Bremner [2000] B.C.J. No. 1096 (B.C.C.A) calls him a pedophile&lt;/ref&gt;
# mischaracterizations of the offence or the law

==Offence Specific Impact Statement==
{{quotation|
'''Community impact statement'''&lt;br&gt;
380.4 (1) For greater certainty, for the purpose of determining the sentence to be imposed on an offender, or whether the offender should be discharged under section 730, in respect of an offence referred to in subsection 380(1), the court may consider a statement made by a person on a community’s behalf describing the harm done to, or losses suffered by, the community arising from the commission of the offence.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Procedure'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) The statement must
:(a) be prepared in writing and filed with the court;
:(b) identify the community on whose behalf the statement is made; and
:(c) explain how the statement reflects the community’s views.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Copy of statement'''&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Guilty plea or Conviction==

A sentencing hearing is to be commenced &quot;as soon as practicable&quot; after the point where a conviction has been entered.&lt;ref&gt;Section 720(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
==Submissions of counsel==
Both the Crown and Defence are permitted to make submissions to facts for consideration.&lt;ref&gt;s. 723(1); R. v. Digiacomo, 2002 BCCA 444&lt;/ref&gt; However, submissions themselves do not constitute evidence.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Jackman, [1996] N.J. No. 107 (NLCA) “cannot be over-emphasized that, in making submissions to Court, counsel are not giving evidence but rather making argument in support of their respective submissions.”&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
==Accused addressing the Court==
At the end of the submissions by counsel, the accused is entitled to make comments to the court.&lt;ref&gt;s. 726&lt;/ref&gt; Failure to allow the accused to speak will not invalidate the sentence if it is an inadvertent slip or error.&lt;ref&gt;

==Judgement on Sentence==
A judge, in deciding on a sentence, after hearing the recommendations from both Crown and Defence, may go above the range recommended by Crown counsel, but must do so after giving reasons for the sentence given.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Jones, [http://canlii.ca/t/fsqtm 2012 ONCA 609] (CanLII) at para. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also recommended that the judge give counsel an opportunity to make further submissions.&lt;ref&gt;
see R v Hood, 2011 ABCA 169 (CanLII) at para 15&lt;br&gt;
R v Keough, 2012 ABCA 14 (CanLII) at paras 19 to 20 and 51 to 57&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon deciding on a particular sentence the judge shall comply with s.570 and 806 requiring him to make a minute or memorandum of conviction and upon request, make a conviction order under Form 35 or 36. Further a warrant of committal, if applicable, will be made under Form 21 or 22.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Statutory Minimum==
It has been agreed upon by several courts that mandatory minimums act as an &quot;inflationary floor&quot; and sets a new minimum punishment for the best offender.
&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Morrisey, 2000 SCC 39 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2000/2000scc39/2000scc39.html], discussed in minority decision&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Colville, 2005 ABCA 319 at paras. 21-26 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ab/abca/doc/2005/2005abca319/2005abca319.html] &lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Ferguson, 2006 ABCA 261 at para. 85&lt;br&gt;
R. v. B.C.M., 2008 BCCA 365 [http://www.canlii.org/en/bc/bcca/doc/2008/2008bcca365/2008bcca365.html] &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Newman, 2009 NLCA 32
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statutory Maximums==
The maximum available sentence for a given offence will be provided within the provisions defining the offence.

Given the distinction between summary offences and indictable offences, the maximum penalties for summary offences will always be less than indictable. 

Where an offence is punishable by &quot;summary conviction&quot;, [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec787 section 787(1)] states the punishment will be a fine of no more than $5,000 and/or 6 months jail unless the offence specifies otherwise. Other available summary offence maximums include 18 months jail.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. s. 253, 264.1&lt;/ref&gt;

However, under [http://canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec735 s. 735] where the accused is an organization, the summary conviction fine amount increases to $100,000.

The maximum for indictable offences will always be specified in the provisions. The code will specify a maximum of 2, 5, 10, 14 years jail or life.

It is generally stated that the maximum penalty is not simply reserved for the &quot;worst of the worst&quot; offenders.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Solowan, 2008 SCC 62, [2008] 3 S.C.R. 309 [http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2008/2008scc62/2008scc62.html]; R. v.

On summary elections for hybrid offences, the court is bound by the maximum range set by parliament. However, the courts should not &quot;scale up&quot; or &quot;scale down&quot; the sentences due to the election.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Solowan, ''supra''&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
Cumulative punishments are known as consecutive sentences. This only applies to jail sentences, all other sentences run concurrently.

All sentences are presumed to be served concurrently. The Code provides for cumulative punishments at section 718.3:
{{quotation|
718.3
&lt;p&gt;...&lt;p&gt;
'''Cumulative punishments'''&lt;br&gt;
(4) The court or youth justice court that sentences an accused may direct that the terms of imprisonment that are imposed by the court or the youth justice court or that result from the operation of subsection 734(4) or 743.5(1) or (2) shall be served consecutively, when
:(a) the accused is sentenced while under sentence for an offence, and a term of imprisonment, whether in default of payment of a fine or otherwise, is imposed;
:(b) the accused is found guilty or convicted of an offence punishable with both a fine and imprisonment and both are imposed;
:(c) the accused is found guilty or convicted of more than one offence, and
::(i) more than one fine is imposed,
::(ii) terms of imprisonment for the respective offences are imposed, or
::(iii) a term of imprisonment is imposed in respect of one offence and a fine is imposed in respect of another offence; or
:(d) subsection 743.5(1) or (2) applies.&lt;P&gt; 
1995, c. 22, s. 6; 1997, c. 18, s. 141; 2002, c. 1, s. 182.

}}

Generally, sentences for offences that occur at separate occasions will be served consecutively.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Dube 2006 QCCA 699 [http://www.canlii.org/fr/qc/qcca/doc/2006/2006qcca699/2006qcca699.html]; R. v. Howett (1982) BCCA&lt;/ref&gt; While where the offences arise out of the same transaction, the sentences will be typically concurrent.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Mascarenhas, 2002 CanLII 41625 (ON CA) [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2002/2002canlii41625/2002canlii41625.html]; &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Veysey, 2006 NBCA 55 [http://www.canlii.org/en/nb/nbca/doc/2006/2006nbca55/2006nbca55.html]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Desmarest (1986), 2 Q.A.C. 151 &lt;br&gt;
R. v. Charchuk (1973), 6 N.S.R. (2d) 519
 &lt;/ref&gt;
If the court does not indicate whether sentences are concurrent or consecutive it is presumed concurrent.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. McCarthy 2005 NLCA __&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nevertheless, the decision of consecutive sentences is one entitled to deference.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. M.(T.E.), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 948, at para. 46&lt;/ref&gt;

Sentences may be imposed consecutively in relation to a single transaction where the punishments protect &quot;different societal interests&quot; or &quot;different legal interests&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Gillis, 2009 ONCA 312 [http://www.canlii.org/en/on/onca/doc/2009/2009onca312/2009onca312.html]; R. v. Clarke (1994), 94 CCC 249(NSCA)&lt;/ref&gt; A judge should consider the time frame within which the offences occurred, the similarity of the offences, whether a new intent or impulse initiated each of the offences and whether the total sentence is fit and proper under the circumstances.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. G.A.W., (1993), 125 N.S.R. (2d) 312 (NSCA)&lt;br&gt; R. v. Naugle, 2011 NSCA 33&lt;/ref&gt;

When deciding whether a sentence should be consecutive or concurrent, the court should consider 1) the time frame of the offences, 2) the similarity of the offences, 3) whether a new intent broached each offence, and 4) whether the total sentence is fit and proper.&lt;ref&gt;  R. v. G.A.W., (1993), 125 N.S.R. (2d) 312 (NSCA);&lt;br&gt; R. v. Naugle, 2011 NSCA 33 (CanLII), 2011 NSCA 33&lt;/ref&gt;

Certain sentences must be ordered to be served consecutively:
#Commission of indictable offence to advantage a terrorist group (s. 83.2 and s. 83.26)
#Instructing activity for terrorist group (s. 83.21(1) and s. 83.26)
#Instructing terrorist activity (s. 83.22(1) and s. 83.26)
#Instructing commission of offence for criminal organization (s. 467.13(1) and s. 467.14)

The decision on whether a sentence should be concurrent or consecutive &quot;should be treated with the same deference owed by appellate courts to sentencing judges concerning the length of sentences ordered.&quot;&lt;ref&gt; R. v. McDonnell, 1997 CanLII 389 (SCC), [1997] 1 S.C.R. 948 at para. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Retrospective punishments ==
Section 11(i) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedom states:

{{quotation|11. Any person charged with an offence has the right ...
:(i)	if found guilty of the offence and if the punishment for the offence has been varied between the time of commission and the time of sentencing, to the benefit of the lesser punishment.}}

''Ex post facto'' treatment of the offender is not viewed as punishment under s. 11(i). That includes deportation following conviction&lt;Ref&gt;see Re Gittens and the Queen [1983] 1 FC 152, 68 CCC 2d 438 (FCTD); Hurd v. Canada (MEI) [1989] 2 FC 594 (FCA);&lt;br&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and license suspension under provincial law which is considered a &quot;civil disability&quot;&lt;ref&gt;see Johnston v. Superintendent of Motor Vehicles [1987] BCJ No44 (BCSC)&lt;/ref&gt;. 

=== SOIRA Orders===
SOIRA legislation is not considered a &quot;punishment&quot; within the meaning of s. 11(i) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms except where the impact of the order amounts to &quot;harsh treatment&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Cross 2006 NSCA 30 [http://canlii.ca/en/ns/nsca/doc/2006/2006nsca30/2006nsca30.html] at 85&lt;/ref&gt; As such, the dominant line of cases suggests that the provisions of SOIRA are retrospective.&lt;ref&gt; 
R. v. Cross, supra&lt;Br&gt; 
R .v. Aberdeen, [2005] AJ No. 1062 [http://canlii.org/en/ab/abpc/doc/2005/2005abpc203/2005abpc203.html]&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Rouschop&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cruel and Unusual Punishment ==
Section 12 of the Charter states: &quot;Everyone has the right not to be subjected to any cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.&quot;

      <comment>/* Symmetric groups */ misspelling corrected</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Symmetric groups ==

'''Theorem 1:''' Let &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; be any set. Then, the set &lt;math&gt;S_A&lt;/math&gt; of bijections from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to itself, &lt;math&gt;f\,:,A\rightarrow A&lt;/math&gt;, form a group under composition of functions.

''Proof'': We have to verify the group axioms. Associativity is fulfilled since composition of functions is always associative: &lt;math&gt;(f\circ g)\circ h(x) = f\circ g(h(x))=f(g(h(x)))=f(g\circ h(x))=f\circ(g\circ h)(x)&lt;/math&gt; where the composition is defined. The identity element is the identity function given by &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{id}_A(a)=a&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a\in A&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, the inverse of a function &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is the function &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; taking &lt;math&gt;f(a)&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a\in A&lt;/math&gt;. This function exists and is unique since &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is a bijection. Thus &lt;math&gt;S_A&lt;/math&gt; is a group, as stated. {{Unicode|∎}}


&lt;math&gt;S_A&lt;/math&gt; is called ''the symmetric group on &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;''. When &lt;math&gt;A=\{1,2,...,n\}\,,\, n\in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;, we write its symmetric group as &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt;, and we call this group the ''symmetric group on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; letters''. It is also called the group of ''permutations'' on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; letters. As we will see shortly, this is an appropriate name.

Instead of &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt;, we will use a different symbol, namely &lt;math&gt;\iota&lt;/math&gt;, for the identity function in &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt;.

When &lt;math&gt;\sigma\in S_n&lt;/math&gt;, we can specify &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; by specifying where it sends each element. There are many ways to encode this information mathematically. One obvious way is to indentify &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; as the unique &lt;math&gt;n\times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix with value &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; in the entries &lt;math&gt;(i,\sigma(i))&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; elsewhere. Composition of functions then corresponds to multiplication of matrices. Indeed, the matrix corresponding to &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; has value &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; in the entries &lt;math&gt;(i,\rho(i))&lt;/math&gt;, which is the same as &lt;math&gt;(\sigma(j),\rho(\sigma(j)))&lt;/math&gt;, so the product has value &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt; in the entries &lt;math&gt;(j,\rho(\sigma(j)))&lt;/math&gt;. This notation may seem cumbersome. Luckily, there exists a more convenient notation, which we will make use of.

We can represent any &lt;math&gt;\sigma\in S_n&lt;/math&gt; by a &lt;math&gt;2\times n&lt;/math&gt; matrix &lt;math&gt;\left( \begin{array}{cccc} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; \dots &amp; n \\ \sigma(1) &amp; \sigma(2) &amp; \dots &amp; \sigma(n)\end{array}\right)&lt;/math&gt;. We obviously lose the correspondence between function composition and matrix multiplication, but we gain a more readable notation. For the time being, we will use this.


'''Remark 2:''' Let &lt;math&gt;\sigma,\rho\in S_n&lt;/math&gt;. Then the product &lt;math&gt;\sigma\rho \equiv \sigma \circ \rho&lt;/math&gt; is the function obtained by ''first'' acting with &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt;, and ''then'' by &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;. That is, &lt;math&gt;\sigma\rho(x)=\sigma (\rho (x))&lt;/math&gt;. This point is important to keep in mind when computing products in &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt;. Some textbooks try to remedy the frequent confusion by writing functions like &lt;math&gt;(x)\rho\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, that is, writing arguments on the ''left'' of functions. We will ''not'' do this, as it is not standard. The reader should use the next example and theorem to get a feeling for products in &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Example 3:''' We will show the multiplication table for &lt;math&gt;S_3&lt;/math&gt;. We introduce the special notation for &lt;math&gt;S_3&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;\iota=\rho_0&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\rho_1=\left( \begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\ 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 \end{array} \right)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\rho_2=\left( \begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 \end{array} \right)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mu_1 = \left( \begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\ 1 &amp; 3 &amp; 2 \end{array} \right)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mu_2= \left( \begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\ 3 &amp; 2 &amp; 1 \end{array} \right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu_3=\left( \begin{array}{ccc} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 \\ 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 \end{array} \right)&lt;/math&gt;. The multiplication table for &lt;math&gt;S_3&lt;/math&gt; is then

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{c|cccccc} \circ &amp; \rho_0 &amp; \rho_1 &amp; \rho_2 &amp; \mu_1 &amp; \mu_2 &amp; \mu_3 \\ \hline \rho_0 &amp; \rho_0 &amp; \rho_1 &amp; \rho_2 &amp; \mu_1 &amp; \mu_2 &amp; \mu_3 \\ \rho_1 &amp; \rho_1 &amp; \rho_2 &amp; \rho_0 &amp; \mu_3 &amp; \mu_1 &amp; \mu_2 \\ \rho_2 &amp; \rho_2 &amp; \rho_0 &amp; \rho_1 &amp; \mu_2 &amp; \mu_3 &amp; \mu_1 \\ \mu_1 &amp; \mu_1 &amp; \mu_2 &amp; \mu_3 &amp; \rho_0 &amp; \rho_2 &amp; \rho_1 \\ \mu_2 &amp; \mu_2 &amp; \mu_3 &amp; \mu_1 &amp; \rho_1 &amp; \rho_0 &amp; \rho_2 \\ \mu_3 &amp; \mu_3 &amp; \mu_1 &amp; \mu_2 &amp; \rho_2 &amp; \rho_1 &amp; \rho_0 \end{array}&lt;/math&gt;


'''Theorem 4:''' &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; has order &lt;math&gt;n!&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': This follows from a counting argument. We can specify a unique element in &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; by specifying where each &lt;math&gt;i\in\{1,2,...,n\}&lt;/math&gt; is sent. Also, any permutation can be specified this way. Let &lt;math&gt;\sigma\in S_n&lt;/math&gt;. In choosing &lt;math&gt;\sigma(1)&lt;/math&gt; we are completely free and have &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; choices. Then, when choosing &lt;math&gt;\sigma(2)&lt;/math&gt; we must choose from &lt;math&gt;\{1,...,n\}-\{\sigma(1)\}&lt;/math&gt;, giving a total of &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; choices. Continuing in this fashion, we see that for &lt;math&gt;\sigma(i)&lt;/math&gt; we must choose from &lt;math&gt;\{1,...,n\}-\{\sigma(1),...,\sigma(i-1)\}&lt;/math&gt;, giving a total of &lt;math&gt;n+1-i&lt;/math&gt; choices. The total number of ways in which we can specify an element, and thus the number of elements in &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; is then &lt;math&gt;|S_n|=\prod_{i=1}^n (n+1-i)=n(n-1)...\cdot 2 \cdot 1 = n!&lt;/math&gt;, as was to be shown. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 5:''' &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; is non-abelian for all &lt;math&gt;n\geq 3&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;\sigma=\left( \begin{array}{ccccc} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; \dots &amp; n \\ 2 &amp; 1 &amp; 3 &amp; \dots &amp; n\end{array}\right)&lt;/math&gt; be the function only interchanging 1 and 2, and &lt;math&gt;\rho=\left( \begin{array}{ccccc} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; \dots &amp; n \\ 1 &amp; 3 &amp; 2 &amp; \dots &amp; n\end{array}\right)&lt;/math&gt; be the function only interchanging 2 and 3. Then &lt;math&gt;\sigma \rho = \left( \begin{array}{ccccc} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; \dots &amp; n \\ 2 &amp; 3 &amp; 1 &amp; \dots &amp; n\end{array}\right)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho\sigma = \left( \begin{array}{ccccc} 1 &amp; 2 &amp; 3 &amp; \dots &amp; n \\ 3 &amp; 1 &amp; 2 &amp; \dots &amp; n\end{array}\right)&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\sigma\rho \neq \rho \sigma&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; is not abelian. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Definition 6:''' Let &lt;math&gt;\sigma\in S_n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\sigma^n=\iota&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;n\in \mathbb{Z}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is called an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;''-cycle'', where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is the smallest positive such integer. Let &lt;math&gt;\sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; be the set of integers &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\sigma(a)\neq a&lt;/math&gt;. Two cycles &lt;math&gt;\sigma,\rho&lt;/math&gt; are called ''disjoint'' if &lt;math&gt;\sigma^*\cap \rho^* = \emptyset&lt;/math&gt;. Also, a 2-cycle is called a ''transposition''.


'''Theorem 7:''' Let &lt;math&gt;\sigma,\rho\in S_n&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;\sigma^*\cap \rho^*=\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\sigma\rho=\rho\sigma&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': For any integer &lt;math&gt;1\leq a\leq n&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a\in \sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;a\not\in\rho^*&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;\sigma\rho(a)=\sigma(\iota(a))=\sigma(a)=\iota(\sigma(a))=\rho(\sigma(a))=\rho\sigma(a)&lt;/math&gt;. A similar argument holds for &lt;math&gt;a\in \rho^*&lt;/math&gt; but &lt;math&gt;a\not\in\sigma^*&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;a\not\in\sigma^*\cup\rho^*&lt;/math&gt;, we must have &lt;math&gt;\sigma\rho(a)=\sigma(a)=a=\rho(a)=\rho\sigma(a)&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\sigma^*\cap\rho^*=\emptyset&lt;/math&gt;, we have now exhausted every &lt;math&gt;a\in \{1,...,n\}&lt;/math&gt;, and we are done. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 8:''' Any permutation can be represented as a composition of disjoint cycles.

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;\sigma\in S_n&lt;/math&gt;. Choose an element &lt;math&gt;a\in \sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; and compute &lt;math&gt;\sigma(a),\sigma^2(a),...,\sigma^k(a)=a&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; is finite of order &lt;math&gt;n!&lt;/math&gt;, we know that &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; exists and &lt;math&gt;k \leq n!&lt;/math&gt;. We have now found a &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt;-cycle &lt;math&gt;\sigma_1&lt;/math&gt; including &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\sigma_1^* = \{a,\sigma(a),...,\sigma^{k-1}(a)\}&lt;/math&gt;, this cycle may be factored out &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, obtaining &lt;math&gt;\sigma=\sigma_1\sigma^\prime&lt;/math&gt;. Repeat this process, which terminates since &lt;math&gt;\sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; is finite, and we have contructed a composition of disjoint cycles which equal &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


Now that we have shown that all permuations are just compositions of disjoint cycles, we can introduce the ultimate shorthand notation for permutations. For an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-cycle &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt;, we can show its action by choosing any element &lt;math&gt;a\in\sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; and writing &lt;math&gt;\sigma=\left(a\ \sigma(a)\ \sigma^{2}(a)\ ...\ \sigma^{n-1}(a)\right)&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Theorem 9:''' Any &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-cycle can be represented as a composition of transpositions.

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;\sigma=\left(a\ \sigma(a)\ \sigma^{2}(a)\ ...\ \sigma^{n-1}(a)\right)&lt;/math&gt;. Then, &lt;math&gt;\sigma = \left( a\ \sigma^2(a)\ ...\ \sigma^{n-1}(a)\right)\left(a\ \sigma(a)\right)&lt;/math&gt; (check this!), omitting the composition sign &lt;math&gt;\circ&lt;/math&gt;. Interate this process to obtain &lt;math&gt;\sigma=\left(a\ \sigma^{n-1}(a)\right)...\left(a\ \sigma^{2}(a)\right)\left(a\ \sigma(a)\right)&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Note 10:''' This way of representing &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; as a product of transpositions is ''not'' unique. However, as we will see now, the &quot;parity&quot; of such a representation is well defined.


'''Definition 11:''' The ''parity'' of a permutation is ''even'' if it can be expressed as a product of an even number of transpositions. Otherwise, it is ''odd''. We define the function &lt;math&gt;\sgn(\sigma)=1&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is even and &lt;math&gt;\sgn(\sigma)=-1&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; is odd.


'''Lemma 12:''' The indentity &lt;math&gt;\iota&lt;/math&gt; has even parity.

''Proof'': Observe first that &lt;math&gt;\iota \neq (a\ b)&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;a\neq b&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the minimum number of transpositions neccesary to represent &lt;math&gt;\iota&lt;/math&gt; is 2: &lt;math&gt;\iota=(a\ b)(a\ b)&lt;/math&gt;. Now, assume that for any representation using less than &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; transpositions must be even. Thus, let &lt;math&gt;\iota=(a_1\ b_1)...(a_k\ b_k)&lt;/math&gt;. Now, since in paticular &lt;math&gt;\iota(a_1)=a_1&lt;/math&gt;, we must have &lt;math&gt;a_1\in (a_i\ b_i)^*&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;1&lt;i\leq k&lt;/math&gt;. Since disjoint transpositions commute, and &lt;math&gt;(a_r\ a_s)(a_i\ a_r)=(a_i\ a_s)(a_r\ a_s)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;a_i\neq a_r\neq a_s&lt;/math&gt;, it is always possible to configure the transpositions such that the first two transpositions are either &lt;math&gt;(a_1\ b_1)(a_1\ b_1)=\iota&lt;/math&gt;, reducing the number of transposition by two, or &lt;math&gt;(a_1\ b_1)(a_1\ b_2)=(a_1\ b_2)(b_1\ b_2)&lt;/math&gt;. In this case we have reduced the number of transpositions involving &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt; by 1. We restart the same process as above. with the new representation. Since only a finite number of transpositions move &lt;math&gt;a_1&lt;/math&gt;, we will eventually be able to cancel two permutations and be left with &lt;math&gt;k-2&lt;/math&gt; transpositions in the product. Then, by the induction hypothesis, &lt;math&gt;k-2&lt;/math&gt; must be even and so &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is even as well, proving the lemma. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 13:''' The parity of a permutation, and thus the &lt;math&gt;\sgn&lt;/math&gt; function, is well-defined.

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;\sigma\in S_n&lt;/math&gt; and write &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; as a product of transposition in two different ways: &lt;math&gt;\sigma=\tau_1...\tau_k=\tau_1^\prime...\tau_{k^\prime}^\prime&lt;/math&gt;. Then, since &lt;math&gt;\iota&lt;/math&gt; has even parity by Lemma 11 and &lt;math&gt;\iota = \sigma\sigma^{-1} = \tau_1...\tau_k\tau_{k^\prime}^\prime ... \tau_1^\prime&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, &lt;math&gt;k+k^\prime \equiv 0 \ \mathrm{mod}\ 2&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;k\equiv k^\prime\ \mathrm{mod}\ 2&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; has a uniquely defined parity, and consequentially &lt;math&gt;\sgn&lt;/math&gt; is well-defined. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 14:''' Let &lt;math&gt;\sigma,\rho\in S_n&lt;/math&gt;. Then, &lt;math&gt;\sgn(\sigma\rho)=\sgn(\sigma)\sgn(\rho)&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Decompose &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; into transpositions: &lt;math&gt;\sigma=\mu_1...\mu_k&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\rho=\nu_1...\nu_l&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\sigma\rho=\mu_1...\mu_k\nu_1...\nu_l&lt;/math&gt; has parity given by &lt;math&gt;k+l&lt;/math&gt;. If both are even or odd, &lt;math&gt;k+l&lt;/math&gt; is even and indeed &lt;math&gt;\sgn(\sigma)\sgn(\rho)=1\cdot 1=1=\sgn(\sigma\rho)&lt;/math&gt;. If one is odd and one is even, &lt;math&gt;k+l&lt;/math&gt; is odd and again &lt;math&gt;\sgn(\sigma)\sgn(\rho)=(-1)\cdot 1=-1=\sgn(\sigma\rho)&lt;/math&gt;, proving the theorem. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Lemma 15:''' The number of even permutations in &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; equals the number of odd permutations.

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; be any even permutation and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; a transposition. Then &lt;math&gt;\tau\sigma&lt;/math&gt; has odd parity by Theorem 14. Let &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; be the set of even permutations and &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; the set of odd permutations. Then the function &lt;math&gt;f:E\rightarrow O&lt;/math&gt; given by &lt;math&gt;f(\sigma)=\tau\sigma&lt;/math&gt; for any &lt;math&gt;\sigma\in E&lt;/math&gt; and a fixed transposition &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;, is a bijection. (Indeed, it is a transposition in &lt;math&gt;S_{S_n}&lt;/math&gt;!) Thus &lt;math&gt;E&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;O&lt;/math&gt; have the same number of elements, as stated. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Definition 16:''' Let the set of all even permutations in &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; be denoted by &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''alternating group'' on &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; letters.


'''Theorem 17:''' &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt; ''is'' a group, and is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt; of order &lt;math&gt;\frac{n!}{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': We first show that &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt; is a group under composition. Then it is automatically a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt;. That &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt; is closed under composition follows from Theorem 14 and associativity is inherited from &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt;. Also, the identity permutation is even, so &lt;math&gt;\iota\in A_n&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt; is a group and a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt;. Since the number of even and odd permutations are equal by Lemma 14, we then have that &lt;math&gt;|A_n|=\frac{|S_n|}{2}=\frac{n!}{2}&lt;/math&gt;, proving the theorem. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 18:''' Let &lt;math&gt;n\geq 3&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt; is generated by the 3-cycles in &lt;math&gt;S_n&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': We must show that any even permutation can be decomposed into 3-cycles. It is sufficient to show that this is the case for pairs of transpositions. Let &lt;math&gt;a,b,c,d\in S_n&lt;/math&gt; be distinct. Then, by some casework,

:i) &lt;math&gt;(a\ b)(a\ b)=(a\ b\ c)^3&lt;/math&gt;,

:ii) &lt;math&gt;(a\ b)(b\ c)=(c\ a\ b)&lt;/math&gt;, and

:iii) &lt;math&gt;(a\ b)(c\ d)=(a\ d\ c)(a\ b\ c)&lt;/math&gt;,

proving the theorem. {{Unicode|∎}}


In a previous section we proved Lagrange's Theorem: The order of any subgroup divides the order of the parent group. However, the converse statement, that a group has a subgroup for every divisor of its order, is false! The smallest group providing a counterexample is the alternating group &lt;math&gt;A_4&lt;/math&gt;, which has order 12 but no subgroup of order 6. It has subgroups of orders 3 and 4, corresponding respectively to the cyclic group of order 3 and the Klein 4-group. However, if we add any other element to the subgroup corresponding to &lt;math&gt;C_3&lt;/math&gt;, it generates the whole group &lt;math&gt;A_4&lt;/math&gt;. We leave it to the reader to show this.

== Dihedral Groups ==

[[File:Hexagon Reflections.png|thumb|The lines represent the reflection symmetries of a regular hexagon]]
[[File:Dihedral8.png|thumb|Illustration of the elements of the dihedral group &lt;math&gt;D_{16}&lt;/math&gt; as rotations and reflections of a stop sign.]]
The dihedral groups are the symmetry groups of regular polygons. As such, they are subgroups of the symmetric groups. In general, a regular &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-gon has &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; rotational symmetries and &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; reflection symmetries. The dihedral groups capture these by consisting of the associated rotations and reflections.


'''Definition 19:''' The ''dihedral group of order ''&lt;math&gt;2n&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;D_{2n}&lt;/math&gt;, is the group of rotations and reflections of a regular &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-gon.


'''Theorem 20:''' The order of &lt;math&gt;D_{2n}&lt;/math&gt; is precisely &lt;math&gt;2n&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; be a rotation that generates a subgroup of order &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;D_{2n}&lt;/math&gt;. Obviously, &lt;math&gt;\langle\rho\rangle&lt;/math&gt; then captures all the pure rotations of a regular &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-gon. Now let &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; be any rotation in  The rest of the elements can then be found by composing each element in &lt;math&gt;\langle\rho\rangle&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt;. We get a list of elements &lt;math&gt;D_{2n}=\{ \iota,\rho,...,\rho^{n-1},\mu,\mu\rho,...,\mu\rho^{n-1}\}&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the order of &lt;math&gt;D_{2n}&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;2n&lt;/math&gt;, justifying its notation and proving the theorem. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Remark 21:''' From this proof we can also see that &lt;math&gt;\{\rho,\mu\}&lt;/math&gt; is a generating set for &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, and all elements can be obtained by writing arbitrary products of &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\mu&lt;/math&gt; and simplifying the expression according to the rules &lt;math&gt;\rho^n=\iota&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\mu^2=\iota&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\rho\mu=\mu\rho^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. Indeed, as can be seen from the figure, a rotation composed with a reflection is new reflection.

&lt;/NOINCLUDE&gt;

[[File:CPT-Structured_Chart_Example.svg|thumb|center|350px|Structure charts can map the structure and data flow of complicated tasks]]
A Structure Chart in software engineering is a chart which shows the breakdown of a system to its lowest manageable parts. They are used in structured programming to arrange program modules into a tree. Each module is represented by a box, which contains the module's name. The tree structure visualizes the relationships between modules, showing data transfer between modules using arrows.  Structured Charts are an example of a '''top-down''' design where a problem (the program) is broken into its components.

{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;
|-
! Symbol !! Name !! Meaning
|-
| 
{| class=&quot;wikitable&quot;  style=&quot;margin: 1em auto 1em auto&quot;
|-
| Module&lt;br/&gt;Name
|}
 || Process || Each Box represents a programming module, this might be something that calculates the average of some figures, or prints out some pay slips
|-
| [[File:CPT-Structured Chart Data Couple.svg]] || Data Couple || Data being passed from module to module that needs to be processed.
|-
| [[File:CPT-Structured Chart Flag.svg]] || Flag || [Extension - you don't need to know this for the exam] Check data sent to process to stop or start processes.  For example when the End of a File that is being read is reached, or a flag to say whether data sent was in the correct format
|}

Let's take a look at a simple example of how this might be executed when representing the following code:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;

sub calculateAverage()
  dim avg as integer
  inputNums()
  avg = average(num1, num2)
  outputAvg(avg)
end sub

function average(a,b)
  return (a + b) / 2
end function

sub inputNums()
  dim num1 as integer
  dim num2 as integer
  num1 = console.readline()
  num2 = console.readline()
end sub

sub outputAvg(x)
  console.writeline(&quot;average = &quot; &amp; x)
end sub
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

[[File:CPT-Structured Chart Average.svg|thumb|400px|center|A structure chart for the above code]]
{{CPTExercise|title=Exercise: Structure Charts}}
{{CPTQuestionTab}}
Create structure charts for the following code:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
sub main()
  dim num1 as integer
  dim num2 as integer
  dim avg as integer
  sayHello()
  num1 = 34
  num2 = 89
  avg = average(num1, num2)
end sub

function average(a,b)
  return (a + b) / 2
end function

sub sayHello()
  console.writeline(&quot;hello&quot;)
end sub
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

{{Robox/Close}}

====Selection====
[[File:CPT-Structured Chart Selection.svg|thumb|center|200px|Structure Chart representation of the selection code]]
A selection in a Structure Chart is determined by the diamond symbol.  This means a condition will be checked and depending on the result, different modules will be executed.
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
sub main()
  dim num1 as integer
  num1 = console.readline()
  if num1 = 7 then
     luckyNumber()
  else
     otherNumber()
  endif
end sub
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

====Iteration====
[[File:CPT-Structured Chart Loop.svg|thumb|center|85px|Structure Chart of the code to the left]]
Using the semi circular arrow we can represent iteration in Structure Charts.  The arrow encompasses a link to a module, implying that module is executed multiple times.  Let's take a look at a coded example:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
sub main()
  dim num1 as integer
  num1 = console.readline()
  while num1 &gt; 0 do
     num1 = countdown(num1)
  end while
end sub

sub countdown(a)
  return a - 1
end sub
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

{{CPTExercise|title=Exercise: Structure Charts, Iteration and Selection}}
{{CPTQuestionTab}}
Create structure charts for the following code:
&lt;syntaxhighlight lang=&quot;vbnet&quot;&gt;
sub howManyThrees()
  dim num1, count, total as integer
  num1 = startMsg()
  count = 0
  total = 0
  while num1 &gt; 0 do
     checkNumber(count, total, num1)
     num1 = num1 - 1
  end while
  endMsg(count)
end sub

sub checkNumber(byRef c, byRef t, byVal n)
  If n MOD 3 = 0 Then
     c = divBy3(c)
  Else
     t = add(n, t)
  EndIf
end sub

function divBy3(x)
  return x + 1
end function

function add(n, t)
  return n + t
end function

function startMsg()
  console.writeline(&quot;program started, enter your number&quot;)
  return console.readline()
end function

sub endMsg(n)
  console.writeline(&quot;number of threes : &quot; &amp; n)
end sub
&lt;/syntaxhighlight&gt;

[[File:Utrecht huisvuil.jpg|left|thumb|proper wasteland]]
Protecting the privacy of personal information is very important for both individuals and businesses. Information that individuals and businesses can include tax returns, and passwords for personal websites or social websites, sometimes can include, personal videos pictures, or even music.One key way of doing this is protecting the information located on paper documents and hardware (such as backup media, used CDs, obsolete computers, and mobile phones) that you will be disposing. Papers, CDs, DVDs, and other media containing sensitive data should be shredded. Hard drives should be wiped with special disk-wiping or disk-erasing software before being sold or recycled. Data that has been erased or reformatted can still be recovered so it is best to properly wipe the drive. Physically destroying all of these hardwares is also good so there is no way of getting the important data back and data destruction services are available. Many companies and business do that so no thief or rival can get a hold of their data.  Although you can wipe of your hard drive, sometimes be recovered, but many find difficult to do so. By breaking your hard drive, disks, or CD's with a hammer, it is a safer way to do so. Some companies even melt their information and throw it in a fire.  A movie i have recently watched &quot;Argo&quot;, showed of a U.S base, destroying their files a perfect example of properly disposing their data, informations and hard drives with fire, so the country they were in would not get a hold of their data.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Paleoecology uses fossils and sub fossils to recreate the ecosystems and environments in the past. It involves the study of prehistoric fossils of organisms and remains that have been fossilized. The goal is to be able to recreate the fossils paleoenvironments, life cycle, living interactions, and the death and burial of the fossil. It is then that scientists will be able to see the ecosystems of prehistoric organisms and their environs.

==Application==


===General Principles for Offences against Children===
Offences of violence against children by their parents requires a strong response due to their inability to defend themselves and the fiduciary duty towards them.&lt;REf&gt;
R v Laberge [http://canlii.ca/t/2dc8j 1995 ABCA 196] at para 28
&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important factors to consider is the child's exposure to harm and the forseeability of the harm.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Nickel, [http://canlii.ca/t/frgmj 2012 ABCA 158] at 34, 35&lt;/ref&gt;

{{reflist|2}}
===Factors===

Factors include:&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Nickel, [http://canlii.ca/t/frgmj 2012 ABCA 158] at 36&lt;/ref&gt;
# use of weapon or confinement (Nickel)
# use of potentially harmful substances such as drugs or alcohol (Nickel)
# involvement of third parties (Nickel)
# multiplicity of victims or offences over time (Nickel)


{{reflist|2}}

===Range===
The range for a first time offender where the offence concerns the neglect of the elderly will often be between 4 and 8 months.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Peterson, 2005 CanLII 37972 (ON CA) at 59&lt;br&gt;

:(c) evidence that a person has failed for a period of one month to make provision for the maintenance of any child of theirs under the age of sixteen years is, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, proof that the person has failed without lawful excuse to provide necessaries of life for the child; and
:(d) the fact that a spouse or common-law partner or child is receiving or has received necessaries of life from another person who is not under a legal duty to provide them is not a defence.&lt;br&gt;

}}

==Proof of the Offence==
In addition to the essential elements of time, location, identity, the Crown should also prove the follow:
# the accused was subject to a duty under s.215(1) to provide necessities of life, by being either:
## as a parent, foster, parent guardian or head of family to a child under the age of 16
## a spouse or common law partner
## a person in charge to someone who is unable to provide themselves with necessities of life and unable to withdraw from the charge, due to detention, age, illness, mental disorder, or other causes
# either
## the person to whom the duty is owed is &quot;in destitute or necessitous circumstance&quot; due to a breach of the duties or
## the accused caused or likely to have caused the person to whom the duty is owed endangerment of life or health endangered permanently;
# there is no lawful excuse for doing so

==Interpretation==
The purpose of s. 215 is to establish a uniform minimum level of care to be provided to certain designated persons, a societal standard rather than a personal standard.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Naglik, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fs0h 1993 CanLII 64] (SCC), [1993] 3 SCR 122&lt;/ref&gt;

&quot;Necessaries of life&quot; are necessaries that &quot;tend to preserve life and not necessaries in their ordinary legal sense&quot;.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Brooks (1902), 5 C. C. C. 372 (BCCA)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Failure to seek medical attention can be a failure to provide.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. R. P., [2004] O. J. No. 5109 at para. 29
&lt;/ref&gt;

Factors to consider whether the there is a duty, includes the severity of the injury and the knowledge that it occurred.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Alexander, 2011 ONSC 980 cited in R. v. Turley [2012] B. C. J. No. 540, at para. 146&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the duty is found, the crown must prove:&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Turley [2012] B. C. J. No. 540&lt;/ref&gt;
# the accused acts or omissions which led to the failure to provide necessaries of life were a marked departure from the conduct of a reasonably prudent person in similar circumstances, and
# it was objectively foreseeable that the failure to provide necessaries would lead to a risk of danger to the life or permanent endangerment to the health of the person to whom the duty is owed.

&quot;Endangers&quot; refers to exposing someone to danger, harm or risk but does not connote actual injury or damage.&lt;ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
A Pre-sentence Report is a report that is generated by a probation officer on order of the court after interviewing the accused and collateral sources that is for the benefit of the judge in determining sentence.

The enabling provision that allows the ordering of a report is section 721, which states:

{{quotation|
'''Report by probation officer'''&lt;br&gt;
721. (1) Subject to regulations made under subsection (2), where an accused, other than an organization, pleads guilty to or is found guilty of an offence, a probation officer shall, if required to do so by a court, prepare and file with the court a report in writing relating to the accused for the purpose of assisting the court in imposing a sentence or in determining whether the accused should be discharged under section 730.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Provincial regulations'''&lt;br&gt;
(2) The lieutenant governor in council of a province may make regulations respecting the types of offences for which a court may require a report, and respecting the content and form of the report.
&lt;br&gt;
'''Content of report'''&lt;br&gt;
(3) Unless otherwise specified by the court, the report must, wherever possible, contain information on the following matters:
:(a) the offender’s age, maturity, character, behaviour, attitude and willingness to make amends;
:(b) subject to subsection 119(2) of the Youth Criminal Justice Act, the history of previous dispositions under the Young Offenders Act, chapter Y-1 of the Revised Statutes of Canada, 1985, the history of previous sentences under the Youth Criminal Justice Act, and of previous findings of guilt under this Act and any other Act of Parliament;
:(c) the history of any alternative measures used to deal with the offender, and the offender’s response to those measures; and
:(d) any matter required, by any regulation made under subsection (2), to be included in the report.&lt;br&gt;
'''Idem'''&lt;br&gt;
(4) The report must also contain information on any other matter required by the court, after hearing argument from the prosecutor and the offender, to be included in the report, subject to any contrary regulation made under subsection (2).
&lt;br&gt;
'''Copy of report'''&lt;br&gt;
(5) The clerk of the court shall provide a copy of the report, as soon as practicable after filing, to the offender or counsel for the offender, as directed by the court, and to the prosecutor.
&lt;br&gt;
R.S., 1985, c. C-46, s. 721; R.S., 1985, c. 27 (1st Supp.), s. 203; 1995, c. 22, s. 6; 1999, c. 25, s. 16(Preamble); 2002, c. 1, s. 183; 2003, c. 21, s. 15.
|[http://www.canlii.ca/t/7vf2#sec721 CCC]}}

Under section 724(3)(b), where there is a dispute on factual claims within the report, the party relying upon it must prove the fact.

The purpose of a pre-sentence report is to provide a “picture of the accused as a person in society - his background, family, education, employment record, his physical and mental health, his associates and social activities, and his potentialities and motivations.”&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Riley, [http://canlii.ca/t/1mpw0 1996 CanLII 5615] (NS CA)&lt;/ref&gt;

The function is not to provide evidence of an offence, give details of a criminal record, or tell the court what sentence to give.&lt;ref&gt;
 R. v. Bartkow (1978), 24 N.S.R. (2d) 518, at para. 10
&lt;/ref&gt;

The judge may use the information in the report to assess the character of the accused in order to relate the offence to the accused.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Brown, (1985), 31 Man.R. (2d) 268 per Monnin, C.J., at 274&lt;/ref&gt;

Where a judge lacks full information on the background of the accused, particularly where the jeopardy of the accused is significant a judge should order a pre-sentence report.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Pritchett; R. v. Graham (1969), 9 C.R.N.S. 262 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Samaras (1971), 16 C.R.N.S. 1 (Ont. C.A.)&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Generally, a pre-sentence report should be considered when sentencing a first-time offender.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Bates (1977), 32 C.C.C. (2d) 493, 1 W.C.B. 116, 1977 CLB 408 (Ont. C.A.) at p. 494
&lt;/ref&gt;

However, given the general limitations on resources, the judge may want to decline to order a report where there is no specific purpose in ordering one.&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Shapley, [1998] S.J. No. 790 (Q.B.), 174 Sask.R. 92, at para. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

-- slight pain, so it's nice to automate it.

-- Note that to use this script you will need a copy of mw, which is
-- responsible for talking to the Wikibooks server. mw can be obtained
-- from https://github.com/ianweller/mw . It depends on bzrlib (from
-- bzr, the Bazaar VCS) and python-simplemediawiki 
-- (see https://github.com/ianweller/python-simplemediawiki).
-- Both deps can be found, e.g., on the Fedora repositories).

-- Setting it up
-- -------------
-- mkdir haskell-wikibook
-- cp PrintVersion.hs haskell-wikibook
-- cd haskell-wikibook
-- mw init http://en.wikibooks.org/w/api.php
-- mw pull 'Haskell!Print_version.wiki'

-- Running it
-- ----------
-- cd haskell-wikibook
-- ./PrintVersion.hs
-- mw login
-- mw commit -m &quot;update print version&quot;

| description = The Coal Tit, Periparus ater, is a passerine bird in the tit family Paridae. It is a widespread and common resident breeder throughout temperate to subtropical Eurasia and northern Africa.

The Coal Tit is 10–11.5 cm in length, and has a distinctive large white nape spot on its black head. The head, throat and neck of the adult are glossy blue-black, setting off the off-white sides of the face (tinged grey to yellow depending on subspecies) and the brilliant white nape; the white tips of the wing coverts appear as two wingbars. The underparts are whitish shading through buff to rufous on the flanks. The bill is black, the legs lead-coloured, and irides dark brown. The young birds are duller than the adults, lacking gloss on the black head, and with the white of nape and cheeks tinged with yellow.

The Blue Tit is classified as a Least Concern species on the IUCN Red List (version 3.1).

      &lt;h1&gt;&lt;span&gt;Creative Commons Legal Code&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;

      &lt;div id=&quot;deed-license&quot;&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;CC0 1.0 Universal&lt;/h2&gt;
      &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

    &lt;div id=&quot;deed-main&quot;&gt;
      &lt;div id=&quot;deed-main-content&quot;&gt;

        &lt;blockquote&gt;
	  CREATIVE COMMONS CORPORATION IS NOT A LAW FIRM AND DOES NOT
	  PROVIDE LEGAL SERVICES. DISTRIBUTION OF THIS DOCUMENT DOES
	  NOT CREATE AN ATTORNEY-CLIENT RELATIONSHIP. CREATIVE COMMONS
	  PROVIDES THIS INFORMATION ON AN &quot;AS-IS&quot; BASIS. CREATIVE
	  COMMONS MAKES NO WARRANTIES REGARDING THE USE OF THIS
	  DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED HEREUNDER, AND
	  DISCLAIMS LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE USE OF
	  THIS DOCUMENT OR THE INFORMATION OR WORKS PROVIDED
	  HEREUNDER.
        &lt;/blockquote&gt;

        &lt;h3&gt;&lt;em&gt;Statement of Purpose&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;The laws of most jurisdictions throughout the world
	automatically confer exclusive Copyright and Related Rights
	(defined below) upon the creator and subsequent owner(s) (each
	and all, an &quot;owner&quot;) of an original work of authorship and/or
	a database (each, a &quot;Work&quot;).&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;Certain owners wish to permanently relinquish those rights
	to a Work for the purpose of contributing to a commons of
	creative, cultural and scientific works (&quot;Commons&quot;) that the
	public can reliably and without fear of later claims of
	infringement build upon, modify, incorporate in other works,
	reuse and redistribute as freely as possible in any form
	whatsoever and for any purposes, including without limitation
	commercial purposes. These owners may contribute to the
	Commons to promote the ideal of a free culture and the further
	production of creative, cultural and scientific works, or to
	gain reputation or greater distribution for their Work in part
	through the use and efforts of others.&lt;/p&gt;

	&lt;p&gt;For these and/or other purposes and motivations, and
	without any expectation of additional consideration or
	compensation, the person associating CC0 with a Work (the
	&quot;Affirmer&quot;), to the extent that he or she is an owner of
	Copyright and Related Rights in the Work, voluntarily elects
	to apply CC0 to the Work and publicly distribute the Work
	under its terms, with knowledge of his or her Copyright and
	Related Rights in the Work and the meaning and intended legal
	effect of CC0 on those rights.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Copyright and Related Rights.&lt;/strong&gt;
	   A Work made available under CC0 may be protected by
	   copyright and related or neighboring rights (&quot;Copyright and
	   Related Rights&quot;). Copyright and Related Rights include, but
	   are not limited to, the following: 
	&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ol type=&quot;i&quot;&gt;
	  &lt;li&gt;the right to reproduce, adapt, distribute, perform,
	  display, communicate, and translate a Work;&lt;/li&gt;

	  &lt;li&gt; moral rights retained by the original author(s) and/or
	  performer(s);&lt;/li&gt;

	  &lt;li&gt;publicity and privacy rights pertaining to a person's
	  image or likeness depicted in a Work;&lt;/li&gt;

	  &lt;li&gt;rights protecting against unfair competition in regards
	  to a Work, subject to the limitations in paragraph 4(a),
	  below;&lt;/li&gt;

	  &lt;li&gt;rights protecting the extraction, dissemination, use and
	  reuse of data in a Work;&lt;/li&gt;

	  &lt;li&gt;database rights (such as those arising under Directive
	  96/9/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 11
	  March 1996 on the legal protection of databases, and under
	  any national implementation thereof, including any amended
	  or successor version of such directive); and&lt;/li&gt;

	  &lt;li&gt;other similar, equivalent or corresponding rights
	  throughout the world based on applicable law or treaty, and
	  any national implementations thereof.&lt;/li&gt;

	&lt;/ol&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Waiver.&lt;/strong&gt; To the greatest extent
        permitted by, but not in contravention of, applicable law,
        Affirmer hereby overtly, fully, permanently, irrevocably and
        unconditionally waives, abandons, and surrenders all of
        Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights and associated claims
        and causes of action, whether now known or unknown (including
        existing as well as future claims and causes of action), in
        the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
        maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty
        (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or
        future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
        purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
        advertising or promotional purposes (the &quot;Waiver&quot;). Affirmer
        makes the Waiver for the benefit of each member of the public
        at large and to the detriment of Affirmer's heirs and
        successors, fully intending that such Waiver shall not be
        subject to revocation, rescission, cancellation, termination,
        or any other legal or equitable action to disrupt the quiet
        enjoyment of the Work by the public as contemplated by
        Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose.
	&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Public License Fallback.&lt;/strong&gt; Should any
        part of the Waiver for any reason be judged legally invalid or
        ineffective under applicable law, then the Waiver shall be
        preserved to the maximum extent permitted taking into account
        Affirmer's express Statement of Purpose. In addition, to the
        extent the Waiver is so judged Affirmer hereby grants to each
        affected person a royalty-free, non transferable, non
        sublicensable, non exclusive, irrevocable and unconditional
        license to exercise Affirmer's Copyright and Related Rights
        in the Work (i) in all territories worldwide, (ii) for the
        maximum duration provided by applicable law or treaty
        (including future time extensions), (iii) in any current or
        future medium and for any number of copies, and (iv) for any
        purpose whatsoever, including without limitation commercial,
        advertising or promotional purposes (the &quot;License&quot;). The
        License shall be deemed effective as of the date CC0 was
        applied by Affirmer to the Work. Should any part of the
        License for any reason be judged legally invalid or
        ineffective under applicable law, such partial invalidity or
        ineffectiveness shall not invalidate the remainder of the
        License, and in such case Affirmer hereby affirms that he or
        she will not (i) exercise any of his or her remaining
        Copyright and Related Rights in the Work or (ii) assert any
        associated claims and causes of action with respect to the
        Work, in either case contrary to Affirmer's express Statement
        of Purpose.&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Limitations and Disclaimers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

        &lt;ol type=&quot;a&quot;&gt;
          &lt;li&gt;No trademark or patent rights held by Affirmer are
          waived, abandoned, surrendered, licensed or otherwise
          affected by this document.&lt;/li&gt;

	  &lt;li&gt;Affirmer offers the Work as-is and makes no
	  representations or warranties of any kind concerning the
	  Work, express, implied, statutory or otherwise, including
	  without limitation warranties of title, merchantability,
	  fitness for a particular purpose, non infringement, or the
	  absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or the present
	  or absence of errors, whether or not discoverable, all to
	  the greatest extent permissible under applicable law.&lt;/li&gt;

	  &lt;li&gt;Affirmer disclaims responsibility for clearing rights of
	  other persons that may apply to the Work or any use thereof,
	  including without limitation any person's Copyright and
	  Related Rights in the Work. Further, Affirmer disclaims
	  responsibility for obtaining any necessary consents,
	  permissions or other rights required for any use of the
	  Work.&lt;/li&gt;

	  &lt;li&gt;Affirmer understands and acknowledges that Creative
	  Commons is not a party to this document and has no duty or
	  obligation with respect to this CC0 or use of the Work.&lt;/li&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">Paleontology is a job that involves outdoor and indoor work. This about the outdoor field techniques. Before you can dig up a fossil first you must locate the location on a geological map, a geological map is a map in which the sediment is given the time when it was first formed. 
Before you have moved to a promising dig site stop to make sure you have the permission to dig and prospect the land for fossils, remember all land belongs to someone, if it belongs to a family y ou must gain their permission to dig. If it is government owned land and you are in the U.S you will need to gain permission from the Forest Service or Bureau of Land Management departments in the area.              
Not all fossils are under sediment, in fact most of them aren't. Most are broken or chipped fossils that the weather has eroded out of the sediment. Check the base of the terrain to see if any chips have rolled to the bottom of the terrain.     
You will need tools to excavate, transport, and study the fossils that you do find under sediment. some of these tools will be large like shovels and jackhammers to remove the rock surrounding the fossil, and some of them will be small e.g. picks and rock hammers or drills to remove smaller fragments of dirt and rock. Sometimes crumbling fossils need to be glued together in order not to break the fossil.
The next step is to cover the excavated parts of the fossil with wet paper towels and layer plaster coated burlap strips. the paper towels protect the fossil from the plaster. The plaster then dries into a hard shell or jacket that protects the fossil from outside influences. Do this with the rest of the fossil until it is completly jacketed. 
The final step is to label the jacket with the date, time, and specimen. You then will transport the fossil back to the lab with a truck or helicopter if it is really heavy.

==Introduction==
Much of the foundation of criminal law lies in the premise that the accused had a requisite &quot;mens rea&quot; (or guilty state of mind) when committing the offence. In principle a person should only be convicted of an offence for which they had some degree of awareness or intention when committing the criminal act. This is closely tied to the theory of moral culpability which is what criminal law is attempting to address and as such is constitutionally required under s. 7 of the Charter.

The criminal law generally does not include offences for which the accused was not subjectively aware to some degree of the offence. Further, there is no duty of precaution upon an individual to ensure that they do not perform the illegal act without their intent or knowledge. This is in contrast to regulatory offences and other forms of civil liability which generally require only an objective standard of responsibility. This is known as a &quot;duty of care&quot; and &quot;standard of care&quot;. The duty of care is the legal obligation to maintain a certain standard. The standard of care is the specific standard of conduct that is imposed by law upon an individual which, if violated, could result in liability of some sort or another.

==Duty of Care==
Certain criminal offences create a duty of care, where, if the standard of care is violated, will result in a criminal act. The offences that impose a duty of care include:
# [[Canadian Criminal Law/Offences/Unsafe Storage of a Firearm|unsafe storage of a firearm]] (86)
# [[Canadian Criminal Law/Offences/Criminal Negligence|Criminal negligence]] (219)
# [[Canadian Criminal Law/Offences/Dangerous Operation of a Motor Vehicle|dangerous operation of a motor vehicle]] 249

==Standard of Care==
The modern foundation of duty of care in criminal law originated from the case of R v Hundal [http://canlii.ca/t/1fs58 1993 CanLII 120] (SCC), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 867. The case stated that to determine whether an act violated a standard of care requires a &quot;modified objective test&quot;&lt;ref&gt;see R. v. Hundal, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fs58 1993 CanLII 120] (SCC), [1993] 1 S.C.R. 867, at page 887&lt;/ref&gt;

For any offence where the standard of care involves objectively dangerous conduct, the conduct must be shown to be a &quot;marked departure&quot; from the the norm. Wherein a &quot;reasonable person in the position of the accused would have been aware of the risk&quot; and &quot;would not have undertaken the activity&quot;.&lt;ref&gt; R. v. Beatty, [http://canlii.ca/t/1vrp5 2008 SCC 5], [2008] 1 S.C.R. 49 &lt;/ref&gt;
The assessment, then, is of a &quot;reasonably prudent person in the circumstances&quot; the accused found himself when the events occurred.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Beatty, [http://canlii.ca/t/1vrp5 2008 SCC 5], [2008] 1 S.C.R. 49  at 40&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, if the accused actions' show a marked departure from the standard of care described in the offence provision, he still cannot be convicted if a reasonably prudent person in the position of the accused would not have been aware of the risk or would not have been able to avoid the creating the risk.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Tayfel (M.), 2009 MBCA 124 (CanLII), &lt;http://canlii.ca/t/273wk&gt; at 51&lt;/ref&gt;

This standard was determined to be constitutionally acceptable.&lt;Ref&gt;
Trilogy cases on Duty of care: R. v. Hundal [http://canlii.ca/t/1fs58 1993 CanLII 120], [1993] 1 S.C.R. 867&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. DeSousa [http://canlii.ca/t/1fsb0 1992 CanLII 80], [1992] 2 S.C.R. 944, 1992 SCC 77&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Tutton and Tutton, [http://canlii.ca/t/1ft5f 1989 CanLII 103], [1989] 1 S.C.R. 1392&lt;/ref&gt;

== Font size ==
I don't know the reason but if you find the font size an issue for your editing, you can try a local solution in place of increasing the size of the general text (that will clash with the rest of the content on other pages). If you are using Firefox (or a Firefox derivative) browser the No Squint extension will permit a by site configuration of text size. You can also use a personalized skin in your preferences on Wikibooks that shapes how content is displayed.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 23:36, 17 April 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
Certain offences in the criminal code require not only that the offender do a prohibited act along with the requisite mens rea, but also that the act caused a particular result. 
Criminal responsibility for causation must be established in fact and in law.&lt;Ref&gt; 
R. v. Nette, [http://canlii.ca/t/51x9 2001 SCC 78], [2001] 3 S.C.R. 488, at para. 44
&lt;/ref&gt; 
This makes a distinction between the physical, biological, or medical cause a particular result and the legal boundary that would attribute responsibility to the accused for the result. 

The standard to prove causation is the same as between all homicide offences, including murder, manslaughter, operation of a motor vehicle causing death.&lt;ref&gt;R v K.L., [http://canlii.ca/t/22h4n 2009 ONCA 141] at [http://canlii.ca/t/22h4n#par17 17]&lt;/reF&gt; Likewise, the standard applies equally to offences involving bodily harm.

The criminal standard of causation in criminal matters is that the &quot;accused's  conduct be at least a contributing cause of the [result], outside the de minimis range&quot;&lt;reF&gt;
R v K.L., [http://canlii.ca/t/22h4n 2009 ONCA 141] at 17 citing: &lt;Br&gt;
R. v. Smithers, [http://canlii.ca/t/1mk9r 1977 CanLII 7] (SCC), [1978] 1 S.C.R. 506 at p. 519&lt;br&gt; 
R. v. Nette, [http://canlii.ca/t/51x9 2001 SCC 78] (CanLII), [2001] 3 S.C.R. 488 at paras. 71 and 72&lt;br&gt;
&lt;/ref&gt;

Criminal law does not include any issues of contributory negligence nor does it apportion responsibility for harm caused outside of sentencing.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Nette [http://canlii.ca/t/51x9 2001 SCC 78] at para. 49&lt;br&gt;
R. v. K. L., [http://canlii.ca/t/22h4n 2009 ONCA 141] at 18&lt;/ref&gt; 

The inference of foreseeability can be rebutted with evidence of intoxication.&lt;Ref&gt;
R. v. Seymour, [http://canlii.ca/t/1fr9z 1996 CanLII 201], [1996] 2 SCR 252 at para. 23&lt;br&gt;

==Causation in Homicide==
Homicide is defined in s.222(1) as occurring where a person &quot;directly or indirectly, by any means, ... causes the death of a human being.&quot;. Culpable Homicide (i.e. murder, manslaughter, or infanticide) is defined in section 222(5) as &quot;when [a person] causes the death of a human being...by means of an unlawful act&quot;.

Causation is explicitly identified as existing where the death might have been otherwise &quot;been prevented by resorting to proper means&quot;(s. 224) or where the immediate cause of death is proper or improper treatment applied in good faith (s.225) or where the victim is already suffering from a terminal condition. (s 226)

The &quot;Smithers test&quot; for causation applies to all types of homicide.  The test requires that the accused's act be a &quot;significant contributing cause&quot; of death beyond something trifling or minor. Thus, the unlawful act remains the legal cause of death even where the act by itself would not have cause death as long as it was beyond the de minimus. &lt;ref&gt;
R v Smithers, [http://canlii.ca/t/1mk9r 1977 CanLII 7], [1978] 1 SCR 506 - defines manslaughter as “a contributing cause of death, outside the de minimis range” (p. 519)&lt;br&gt;
R v Nette [http://canlii.ca/t/51x9 2001 SCC 78] at 71-72
&lt;/ref&gt;

By implication, causation is in no way limited to a direct, an immediate, or the most significant cause.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Maybin, [http://canlii.ca/t/frczg 2012 SCC 24] at para 20&lt;/ref&gt;

Where the offence is &quot;constructive murder&quot; under s. 231(5), that there is an added requirement.&lt;ref&gt; R v Nette at 73&lt;/ref&gt;

A distinction is made between factual causation and legal causation.&lt;ref&gt;R. v. Kippax, [http://canlii.ca/t/fp7n6 2011 ONCA 766], [2011] O.J. 5494 at 22 to 27&lt;/ref&gt; The former being the broader of the two.  
*''Factual causation'' requires &quot;an inquiry about how the victim came to his or her death, in a medical, mechanical, or physical sense, and with the contribution of the accused to that result&quot; (Nette, at para. 44) To put it simply, the question is &quot;but for&quot; the act would death have arose? &lt;ref&gt;R. v. Maybin, [http://canlii.ca/t/frczg 2012 SCC 24] at para 15&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Legal Causation'' addresses the moral element of whether the accused &quot;should be held responsible in law for the death&quot;&lt;ref&gt;Nette at para. 45&lt;/ref&gt;


{{reflist|2}}

===Intervening Acts===
The doctrine of intervening acts can limit the scope of legal causation. The law recognizes an intervening cause that &quot;'break the chain of causation' between the accused's acts and the death&quot; which results in the &quot;accused’s actions not being a significant contributing cause of death&quot; &lt;ref&gt;R v Tower [http://canlii.ca/t/1vn7l 2008 NSCA 3] at para 25&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Background==
Irving Fisher coined the phrase in his article &quot;Money Illusion&quot; in the early 20th century &lt;ref name=Thaler&gt; Thaler, Richard H. The American Economic Review, Vol.87, No. 2, Papers and Proceedings of the Hundred and Fourth Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association (May, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;. He defined explicity the problem that many people think in nominal instead of real values, or as the case may be, in a mix of the two. The ease &lt;ref name=Eldar&gt; Eldar Shafir, Peter Diamond, Amos Tversky. The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. 112, No. 2, In Memory of Amos Tversky(1937-1996) (May, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; of using nominal thinking makes this problem widespread, especially when it occurs during times of hyperinflation that Irving Fisher studied. Alternative framinings of the same situation (one in nominal and one in real) can lead to different choices because people adhere to the frame presented to them&lt;ref name=FehrTyran2001&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fehr|first1=Ernst|last2= Tyran|first2=Jean-Robert|year=2001|title=Does Money Illusion Matter?|journal=The American Economic Review|volume=91|issue=5 |pages=1239-1262|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/10.2307/2677924}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This problem leads to poor economic choices and an inadequate view of prices and costs. While inflation is the most common lense to view money illusion, sunk costs is also prominant and it comes in many forms: not accepting a lower wage, not selling at a marginal loss, investment, mental accounting, and even fairness &lt;ref name=Eldar&gt; Eldar Shafir, Peter Diamond, Amos Tversky. The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. 112, No. 2, In Memory of Amos Tversky(1937-1996) (May, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;. Though, this theory is not strictly a behavioral problem. Macroeconomists use this insight in their analysis of peoples reaction to inflation and how that effects monetary policy and compare the effects to negative interest rates &lt;ref&gt; The Economist. &quot;The Buck Shrinks Here.&quot; The Economist. The Economist Newspaper, 16 Apr. 2012. Web. 23 Apr. 2012. &lt;http://www.economist.com/blogs/freeexchange/2012/04/monetary-policy-0&gt;. &lt;/ref&gt;. And psychological insights are very important in understanding why money illusion occurs, especially in cases where framing[[https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/wiki/Bestiary_of_Behavioral_Economics/Framing_Effect]] risk aversion plays a role (investing and transactions) &lt;ref name=Eldar&gt; Eldar Shafir, Peter Diamond, Amos Tversky. The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. 112, No. 2, In Memory of Amos Tversky(1937-1996) (May, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;. Central to the problem of money illusion is the lack of economic education, but even with education or learning nominal values are still used.

==Specific Examples==
In this section, we will dissect a select couple of examples of money illusion that have been studied over the years.
===Earnings===
Shafir, Diamond, and Tversky&lt;ref name=Eldar&gt;Eldar Shafir, Peter Diamond, Amos Tversky. The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. 112, No. 2, In Memory of Amos Tversky(1937-1996) (May, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;, created a situation to test people's understanding of money illusion in wage earnings. There are two people who have the same college experience, same type of job, same starting wage, yet experience different percentage rates of inflation and bonus. 


Person 1: $30,000 base salary, 0% inflation (the first year), 2% rise in salary (second year)

Person 2: $30,000 base salary, 4% inflation (the first year), 5% rise in salary (second year)


In strictly real terms, Person 1 is better off than Person 2 as they receive a higher wage after inflation is taken into account, while Person 2 has more &quot;money&quot; in a nominal sense but after taking into account inflation Person 2's money is worth less. 

The questions asked of the participants, who had to evaluate Person 1 and Person 2, had to answer three questions, one on &quot;economic terms&quot;, happiness and job attractiveness. In response to the first question about who was doing better in &quot;economic terms&quot;, the majority sided with Person 1, which is correct in real terms. But in response to the next question on who was happier, respondents (different people from question one) said Person 2 was happier even though the majority of earlier respondents acknowledged that Person 1 was better off. This answer clearly shows the nominal bias: people assume a larger bonus means more money which in turn makes them happier. The third question reinforces this concept. Another set of respondents were asked who would be more likely to leave their job and the majority said Person 1. This response also shows nominal bias because Person 1 is actually receiving a greater bonus once inflation is taken into account. 

The surveys indicated that people in fact do use nominal values to create judgements. But when a question was framed that emphasized who would be better off in &quot;economic terms&quot; people answered correctly saying Person 1 was better off. This means people do think in real terms when they are reminded of it, but the bias is toward nominal in all other cases.

===Mental Accounting===
Mental accounting[[https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/w/index.php?title=Bestiary_of_Behavioral_Economics/Mental_Accounting&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1]] is a topic in and of itself and more can be learned by accessing the link provided. This example with be looking at Shafir, Diamond, and Tversky's,&lt;ref name=Eldar&gt;Eldar Shafir, Peter Diamond, Amos Tversky. The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. 112, No. 2, In Memory of Amos Tversky(1937-1996) (May, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;surveys assessing people's responses to past nominal values and sunk costs. People have difficulty disassociating past costs with the present and are unsure of what to make of the connection between the two. This lead to a variety of answers and a lack of consensus. So the authors developed a second question. Two stores buy the same quantity of goods at different input prices and sell them at different output prices. One of the two buys and sells his a year later with inflation. 


Store A: Bought 100 goods for $20 each and sold them at $44 each
:-A Year Later-
Store B: Bought 100 goods for $22 each and sold them at $45 each-while experiencing 10% inflation


An overwhelming majority when asked &quot;who made the better deal?&quot; selected Store A over Store B. This makes sense thinking in nominal terms as you multiply the quantity times the output price and subtract the quantity times the input price. Then you repeat for both stores:

Store A:((100 quantity of goods)x($44 output price))-((100 quantity of goods)x($20 input price))= $2,400
Store B:((100 quantity of goods)x($45 output price))-((100 quantity of goods)x($22 input price))= $2,300

Under this logic (ignoring inflation) it is easy to see that the easier line of nominal thinking is very persuasive. Aknowledging inflation, the price of the input was offset by the rise inflation allowing for more money to be made by only increasing the output price by one dollar. Money illusion shows it's hand by illustrating, once again, that people instinctively think in nominal terms.

===Experimental Monetary Shock===

It is disputed as to whether exogenous monetary shocks in the &quot;real world&quot; have a real impact on output as it is still highly debated&lt;ref name=FehrTyran2001/&gt;, but Fehr and Tyran ran their experiment in a lab acknowledging that field data would be filled with skepticism. The model they constructed was to have an &quot;exogenous&quot; and expected monetary shock. In the experiment, participants play against other players and the computer (removing any need to act off of uncertainty) to set set prices and trade with each other. They select a number (1-30) and then select the price's expectation, as well as, the confidence in thier decision. To prepare to analyze the situation, they tested the people before, during and after the negative shock on the money supply. The &quot;pre-shock&quot; test was used for getting participants familiar with the system and using it to compare to the &quot;post shock&quot; price. 

The results of their experiment showed: 
* With real values against computers, the shock had no almost no effect on prices with players having to make very minimal adjustments to equilibrium. 
* With nominal values against computers, the shock created a limited amount of money illusion as it became harder for participants to get back to equillibrium.
* With real values against other participants, the shock had a limited effect on prices but there were fluxuations. 
* With nominal values against other participants, the shock had an astounding effect on prices creating such variance that the participants never reached equillibrium.

To conclude it is evident that money illusion plays a part in peoples decision making and has an even more drastic effect in a nominal frame. Even in a fully expected drop in the quantity of money still lead to large income losses for participants until they got closer to equilibrium. The same researchers conducted a study on positive economic shocks as well but the effects of money illusion were much smaller.

==Conclusions==
We can conclude that there is no easy solution to the problem of money illusion. Attempts to reconcile the lack in logic with economic education or to pursue policies that have very little inflation have not been very successful&lt;ref name =Thaler&gt;Thaler, Richard H. The American Economic Review, Vol.87, No. 2, Papers and Proceedings of the Hundred and Fourth Annual Meeting of the American Economic Association (May, 1997),440&lt;/ref&gt;. Money illusion, though has immense policy and business implications especially when contracts, and even tax methods are incorrectly indexed. It is an especially complicated ordeal for businesses who wish to raise prices to combat inflation but do not want to confront the public who views in anger any nominal price rise.&lt;ref name=Eldar&gt;Eldar Shafir, Peter Diamond, Amos Tversky. The Quarterly Journal of Economics, Vol. 112, No. 2, In Memory of Amos Tversky(1937-1996) (May, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; Macroeconomists will continue to struggle with the concept of money illusion in their explanations of short term changes in equilibrium prices&lt;ref name=FehrTyran2001/&gt;. Behavioral economists still have much to research empirically about money illusion and to find evidence of it outside of the laboratory or questionaire setting.

I'd also like to help develop a wikibooks for JROTC (particularly NJROTC) since I am well-versed in that program. But maybe later. 

For now, focusing on IB Economics. Afterwards, I'll shift to IB Biology or History. Or maybe instead I'll develop the General IB Program Wikibook. We'll see!</text>

Computer hardware can be inherently fragile.  Heat, water, and physical accidents are the biggest threats to a computer's physical safety.  Computers should be properly cleaned on a regular basis to keep dust buildup to a minimum (this protects the unit from excessive heat).  Care must also be taken when liquids are used around a computer.  Finally, dropping a computer (or most electronic components) can be the kiss of death for the machine.

Besides being fragile, computers are also very valuable.  Care must be taken to protect computers from theft.  Various locks are available to protect a computer from theft.  In addition, there are special tracking systems that can be used to find a computer if it is stolen or misplaced.  And for the “nuclear” approach, there are self-destructing devices that become unusable if stolen!

==How to Prevent Your Computer From Crashing==

There are ways to prevent your computer from crashing although this isn’t a guarantee. If your computer crashes it can affect your schedule for those that depend on it for daily activities may cause a loss of data, damage your system and data files and my leave your computer unbootable.

At times rebooting may help or solve the problem but if you haven’t backed up your computer you may be in trouble.

However, at times, computer crashes may occur due to user negligence that may result in virus infections, a damaged registry, or hard disk problems. You can easily prevent computer freeze problems due to this, by performing regular PC maintenance. Let us have look at some of the tasks that you can perform to prevent and recover from computer crashes.



There are a few steps that can be taken to protect your computers hardware. You should first install and use security software. Then you should back up your system regularly. Another step to protecting your hardware is to update your operating system, browser, and e-mail program regularly as well. Finally, test your system for vulnerabilities.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Most of this is good notes from which an actually good wikibook can be developed. However, there are things here not mentioned in the Syllabus and the information selected for 'basic definitions' seems arbitrary. Superfluous entries I think should be removed unless later used for didactic reasons will be stored on this discussion page. After checking, though, it's clear that all relevant section one information is present.

Hello, and '''[[Wikibooks:Welcome, newcomers|welcome]]''' to [[Wikibooks]]!

Here are some tips to [[Help|help]] you get started:
* To learn the wiki-markup-language syntax, see [[Help:Editing]].
* Make sure to sign your posts and comments with four tildes, like this: &amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126;&amp;#126; 
**There is a box at the top of the edit window (if javascript is enabled on your browser) that will insert it too (looks like part of a signature). This will let others know who left it, and make it easy to reply back to you.
* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] (global to the system) or in a page on your own userspace.
* Remember to use [[Commons:Main Page|Commons]] project for image uploading.
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks are open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer since things work a little different here.
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to keep a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you have questions, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;(This is not an automated message, I'll be watching during a time for any reply you make to it...)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

Good luck!  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 10:30, 18 April 2012 (UTC)

== Blanking pages ==
Please do not blank a page. See [[Wikibooks:Deletion policy]], since you are the creator and it has no usable content it can be tagged for speedy deletion.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 10:26, 18 April 2012 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">                  VISCO ELASTIC PROPERTIES OF POLYMERS AND PLASTICS
                         By RAM SAI NAG .ADAPA  (NAG CEUTICS)
The measurement of Viscoelastic properties of polymers and plastics are most commonly done on dilute solutions or molten polymers, and are critical for determining molecular architecture (molecular weight, molecular weight distribution, and degree of branching), processing behavior and end product performance.

The most common device used for measuring viscoelastic properties of melt polymers is a melt index, which is an empirical method that provides a single point measurement of viscosity. The melt index (MI) actually is the amount of material which flows through a capillary under a standard set of conditions (temperature, pressure and time). While it is most often used as a simple, quick way to grade the relative differences between polymers and plastics in a quality control environment, its limitations are that it is not very sensitive to differences in molecular architecture and provides little useful information to simulate how a polymer or plastic will behave in a process.

Polymers are complex rheological materials in that they exhibit both viscous and elastic (viscoelastic) properties under varying conditions of stress, strain and temperature. The best example of a material with viscoelastic properties is silly putty (or PDMS) – when left “at rest” in a lump, when time and natural forces of gravity are applied, it eventually flows like a fluid (albeit slowly) to form a puddle. Yet, when rolled into a ball and bounced, it behaves like an elastic solid. Lastly, when stretched rapidly, it snaps and breaks cleanly as if it was a solid piece of plastic. This demonstrates the importance of measuring the rheological properties of polymers and platsics under varying conditions of stress, strain and time if we want to understand how they will perform in a process or end use conditions.

Typically, stress and/or strain-controlled, rotational rheometers are used to measure properties such as:

viscoelasticity (G’, G’’, tan delta) as a function of frequency (time) and temperature
molecular architecture (molecular weight, molecular weight distribution,, branching) using frequency sweeps and creep/recovery tests (zero shear viscosity)
influence of long chain branching on linear viscoelastic properties (zero shear viscosity, steady state recoverable compliance)
Also, capillary rheometers are used to measure:

shear viscosity from low to high shear rates, directly simulating conditions experienced during processing
melt fracture, die swell, and shark skin which are often due on elastic properties that manifest themselves at high shear rates during processing
extensional viscosity and/or melt strength, which become important parameters to measure for many polymer processes.</text>

{{TOC right}}

Assembly refers to putting together parts or component systems to make a functional complete device.  Construction refers to permanent installations not intended to move often or ever and consisting of many devices and systems.  These tasks typically consist of many simple steps in series.


==Assembly Methods==

Assembly methods can be organized by the type of operator and the type of connections are made between elements

===Operator Types===

Assembly methods can be categorized by the type of operator that performs the assembly:

* '''Manual Assembly''' - This is performed by humans using manual dexterity and strength. It can be assisted by tools and fixtures for leverage, speed, and positioning.
* '''Robotic Assembly''' - This is performed by robots either under human remote control or computer control.
* '''Automatic Assembly''' - This is where the devices to perform the assembly task are built into the components.

===Mechanical Connections===

===Electrical Connections===

===Fluid Connections===


==Construction Methods==

Construction can be organized by analogy to Earth construction, with suitable modifications

===Construction Planning===

===Logistics===

Delivering construction equipment and supplies to the construction site from other locations.

====Orbital Tugs====

When launching multiple components from Earth that need to be collected in one place for assembly, if the orbits are similar, then a single vehicle dedicated to the job is more efficient than including a propulsion and navigation system on each component payload &lt;ref&gt;Gralla and De Weck [http://strategic.mit.edu/docs/2_20_JBIS_60_6_219_Tugs.pdf '''Strategies for On-Orbit Assembly of Modular Spacecraft'''], JBIS, vol 60, p 219, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;.  We call that vehicle an '''Orbital Tug'''.  Besides propulsion, navigation, and means to grab the payloads, it needs the ability to periodically refuel.  This can be done with occasional payloads being fuel tanks, which the Tug attaches to itself as needed.  In order not to be left stranded, it should have at least two tank locations, and install a fresh tank while the second one still has some fuel left.  If you have more than one Tug, they should be designed to grab each other for heavier cargos needing more total propulsion, or in case one stops working and needs to be returned for repair.

===Materials Handling===

Positioning items within the construction site to the point of use.

====Docking====

Mechanical Docking Systems

====Deployment====

Unpacking a component shipped in a compact state to an operating configuration.

===Site Work===

Where you are doing construction on or near a natural body, and you need to modify the construction area by road-building, excavation, and other methods.

===Cast and Block Structures===

These are not pressure tight structures, but installed by methods like casting concrete or stacking blocks

===Fabricated Structures===

These are from metal, wood, plastic, or other materials delivered as components to be assembled on site

==Outfitting Methods==

Outfitting involves installing and activating items within a larger construction element once it is in place.

===Sealing and Protection===

===Utilities Installation===

===Equipment Installation===

===Habitation Setup===

===Activation===

      <comment>/* Example Of A Conversation In The Tsugaru Dialect */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">The Tsugaru Dialect (津軽弁 / つがるべん / tsugaru-ben)is a Japanese dialect spoken in Tsugaru, the western region of the Aomori Prefecture. There are often times when Tsugaru dialect is mistaken for &quot;Aomori Dialect.&quot; Assuming that this dialect is used throughout the entire
prefrecture is a misconception.
Tsugaru-ben is reputed to be too divergent from standard Japanese for those who are not native speakers, to the point that even people living in the same prefecture may have trouble understanding it. 
In 1988, fans of the Tsugaru dialect proclaimed October 23 to be Tsugaru Dialect Day (津軽弁の日 Tsugaru-ben no hi). 
October 23 is the anniversary of the death of Kyōzō Takagi, a famous poet who wrote in the Tsugaru dialect.
In Tsuruta, there is an annual summer Tsugaru-ben competition (津軽弁大会 Tsugaru-ben taikai) in which teams of foreigners create short skits or performances, usually humorous, using Tsugaru-ben.
In June 2009, a short segment featuring the competition was broadcast nationally on Japan Broadcasting Corporation.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Ruggedized devices are devices that are designed to withstand much more physical abuse than conventional devices and range from semirugged to ultrarugged. These devices are usually used for consumers whose needs for protection aren’t met with just a regular protective case. For example, most police cars are equipped with portable laptops that have been ruggedized due to the nature of their jobs. Semirugged devices typically have more durable cases and are spill resistant. The ultrarugged devices are designed to withstand falls from three feet or more onto concrete, extreme temperature ranges, wet conditions, and use while being bounced around over rough terrain in a vehicle. Ultrarugged devices are usually used by construction workers and outdoor technicians whose jobs put them in unpredictable working conditions.
{{BookCat}}

However, you don’t have to purchase a ruggedized device in order to amp up your portable device’s ability to withstand a toddler’s errant hand or an unlikely fall into a water receptacle.

Common sense goes a long way.  Keep your devices out of dusty areas and away from water.  Also, don’t leave your device where it will be subject to extreme heat or cold.  

Thin layers of sheeting that will provide protection from scratches can be purchased to cover screens.    And, if there is a device that has been made, then there is most likely a customized protective case to go with it.  Everything from hard cases to soft cases to protective sleeves exists in the marketplace.

Although there is no guarantee against a shattered screen or a trip through a laundry cycle, owning either a ruggedized device or accessorizing it with the latest protective wear and keeping your portable device in a safe environment will help ensure your hardware is protected.

== Our confusing subject/category hierarchy ==

The way we've got things set up is less than ideal; it's grown up over the years as we've tried to make do with the wiki software we've been given.  I can try to fix up a Subject:Anarchism for you later today (anywhere from a few minutes to a few hours from now).  Here's an attempt to explain generally how it all works:
* Each book has a ''book category'', which contains all the pages in that book (and also any templates specific to that book).
* Each subject has a ''subject category'', which contains the main pages of all the books that explicitly name that subject.
* Each subject has an associated ''allbooks category'', which contains the main pages of all the books that explicitly name either that subject, or any of its subsections.
There are a series of pages that (unfortunately) have to be set up just right in order to make all that happen; it's a bit tricky.  We really ''should'' have a full-blown interactive wizard for managing it all, but while we're waiting for that (I'm working on tools for building wizards, over at [[n:Help:Dialog|English Wikinews]]), it can be confusing.
* '''''If''''' template {{tl|subjects}}, on the main page of a book,is given the name of a subject that has been set up just the way expected by our semi-automation, the template automatically lists the book under the named subject and all the ancestors of that subject.  For example, I've now set up a [[Subject:Christianity]], so putting {{tlx|subjects|Christianity}} on a book's main page will now cause it to be listed in that subject, and also in [[Subject:Abrahamic religions]], [[Subject:Religion]], and [[Subject:Humanities]].
* Creating a category for a topic, such as [[:Category:Anarchism]], doesn't automatically set up an associated subject.
* There ''is'' a way to get assistance with setting up a category, though it sure would be nice to have more assistance than it gives.  I used this assistance to set up [[Subject:Christianity]] a few minutes ago, and, as I say, I'll try to do [[Subject:Anarchism]] soon.  The trick is to edit the book's main page, add parameter &quot;{{!}}diagnose=true&quot; to the {{tl|subjects}} template, and preview the page; there's no need to save the page.  If there's a &quot;subject&quot; page there that hasn't been set up properly, the preview presents you with a bunch of buttons for setting up the needed infrastructure pages.

:{{Ping|Pi zero}} I figured out how ''some'' of that was working by tinkering myself. Thanks. My only concern was that there were existing categories which are more refined and better for navigation which you were emptying it out of. If you think a category is ''too'' refined and should be upmerged (and you may not think this), then discussion would be better. Thanks. —[[User:Koavf|Justin (&lt;span style=&quot;color:grey&quot;&gt;ko'''a'''vf&lt;/span&gt;)]]&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;❤[[User talk:Koavf|T]]☮[[Special:Contributions/Koavf|C]]☺[[Special:Emailuser/Koavf|M]]☯&lt;/span&gt; 15:12, 12 September 2014 (UTC)

:: Yeah, it can be awkward to decide when something is worth creating a child subject for, and when it's better to simply list it in the parent subject.  I suppose it depends on how well-defined the child subject is, and how naturally it fits into the existing hierarchy.  It ''usually'' wouldn't make sense, for instance, to create a subject just so that a single book could be put in it.

:: When a non-subject category is passed to {{tl|subjects}}, so that the template is unable to list the book in subjects as it's supposed to, the template puts out a call for help by adding the book to [[:Category:Attention needed (allbooks)]].  Every once in a while I remember to go look there, and fix all the problems it reports.  Usually this consists of changing parameters to the template, to put the book in subjects that have been set up rather than ones that haven't been set up.  However, sometimes the subject really ''should'' be set up.  As, for example, [[Subject:Christianity]].  I got partway into shifting listings to [[Subject:Abrahamic religions]] before my higher reasoning caught up with me and said, wait a minute, there are already child subjects for Islam and Judaism, why on Earth wouldn't there be one for Christianity?  (This is my laughing at myself.)  --[[User:Pi zero|Pi zero]] ([[User talk:Pi zero|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Pi zero|contribs]]) 15:32, 12 September 2014 (UTC)
:::{{Ping|Pi zero}} Exactly: there is and will be enough material to warrant a division but maybe not for Rastafarianism (at least not now or soon). By the way, thanks for all the work you do wb and wn--they don't get enough attention as WMF projects. I can tell that you really want to improve them. —[[User:Koavf|Justin (&lt;span style=&quot;color:grey&quot;&gt;ko'''a'''vf&lt;/span&gt;)]]&lt;span style=&quot;color:red&quot;&gt;❤[[User talk:Koavf|T]]☮[[Special:Contributions/Koavf|C]]☺[[Special:Emailuser/Koavf|M]]☯&lt;/span&gt; 15:34, 12 September 2014 (UTC)</text>

Lua bytecodes are *not* portable in any useful sense, they are decidedly ideosyncratic to not ''just'' host platform, but the specific build of lua/luac that created that them. lua bytecode has no defined standard and thus any interoperability of its bytecodes is effectively accidental. Some alternate lua librarys, such as luajit, don't even use bytecodes in the first place.

Granted, you can ''usually'' get away with it...but its not anything you can or should actually rely on.
This is not a contentious point, the source makes no attempt at all to shield the bytecodes from changes due to so much as compiler options, let alone platform. and this is a fact well recognised in the official lua IRC channel and the lua mailing list (both frequented and maintained by the lua devs themselves) [[Special:Contributions/210.4.231.20|210.4.231.20]] ([[User talk:210.4.231.20|discuss]]) 14:02, 19 April 2012 (UTC)</text>

      <comment>/* Systems of Numbers */ decapitalizing &quot;algebra&quot;</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">== Systems of Numbers ==

Geometric algebra is an example of a system of numbers. In particular, it's an example of what mathematicians call an '''algebra over a field'''. But since this is not intended to be a book solely for mathematicians, this page is here as an attempt to explain what exactly this means, give a general impression of what systems of numbers are and how they can be built up, and show where geometric algebra fits in. You probably already know most of what's in this section, and it is presented primarily for comparison's sake, but seeing it presented in this way may raise some interesting questions.

Perhaps the most basic system of numbers is the natural, or counting, numbers. This is the familiar set of numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, etc. One of the fundamental properties of the natural numbers is that for every natural number ''n'', there is a natural number ''n'' + 1 (which is never equal to ''n'') that comes after it. Since this is true no matter how big ''n'' is, there are infinitely many natural numbers. We'll call the first number that comes after ''n'' the '''successor''' of ''n''. One reason this property is fundamental to the natural numbers is that any natural number can be represented by the successor function applied to 0 some number of times. In fact if you have another set of things in which each one has a successor and there is only one that is not the successor of any other, your set of things can be identified with the natural numbers -- just call the thing that isn't the successor of anything else 0, and go from there. Another reason the successor operation is fundamental is that the basic operations of addition and multiplication can be reduced to it. The sum of two natural numbers ''a'' and ''b'' is the ''b''th successor of ''a''. Likewise, the product of ''a'' and ''b'' is the sum of ''a'' and itself repeated ''b'' times. ''a'' to the power of ''b'' is defined similarly, as the product of ''a'' with itself repeated ''b'' times.

The operations of addition and multiplication that we've introduced have a few important properties in common. If you add three numbers, it doesn't matter whether you start by adding the first and second numbers, and then add the third one to your answer, or if you start by adding the second and third numbers, and then add your answer to the first number. In equation form, this is (''a'' + ''b'') + ''c'' = ''a'' + (''b'' + ''c''). The corresponding statement is true for multiplication. That is, ''a''(''bc'') = (''ab'')''c''. This is called  the '''associative property''', since it is a statement of the fact that it doesn't matter in which order the terms (or factors) are associated. Both versions of the associative property are true for all natural numbers ''a'', ''b'', and ''c''. A statement that is true for all values of the variables in it is called an '''identity''', and mathematicians sometimes say that it is ''identically true'' or ''holds identically.'' This can be confusing because it conflicts with the everyday definition of ''identical'', but the meaning is usually clear in context.

Another important identity that's true for both addition and multiplication is the '''commutative property''', which is the statement that the order in which you add (or multiply) two numbers doesn't matter. That is, for all natural numbers ''a'' and ''b'', ''a'' + ''b'' = ''b'' + ''a'' and ''ab'' = ''ba''. Also, for all natural numbers ''a'', 0 + ''a'' = ''a'' + 0 = ''a'' and 1''a'' = ''a''1 = a. Because of this, 0 is called the '''identity element''' for addition and 1 is called the identity element for multiplication -- yet another sense of the word ''identity.'' An important identity that relates multiplication to addition is the '''distributive property''', the statement that, for all natural numbers ''a'', ''b'', and ''c'', ''a''(''b'' + ''c'') = ''ab'' + ''ac''.

In the fairly recent past, mathematicians have begun to study sets of &quot;numbers&quot; that share some or all of these properties (including ones we'll discuss later on), and have come up with names for certain combinations of properties. Any set of elements with an operation that satisfies the associative property and has an identity element is called a '''monoid'''. In particular, the natural numbers with addition form what is called (for rather obvious reasons) a ''commutative'' monoid. The natural numbers with multiplication also form a commutative monoid, but of a rather different sort. To see the difference, notice that any natural number can be formed by adding 1 and 0 in various combinations, but there is no (finite) set of numbers that you can build all natural numbers out of using multiplication in a similar way. There are, however, infinite sets with this property -- take, for instance, the set containing 0, 1, and all prime numbers.

=== Inverses and Groups ===
One of the most basic questions we can ask about natural numbers is this: given two natural numbers ''a'' and ''b'', what is a number that, when added to ''a'', gives ''b''? Let's call this the subtraction problem for the pair (''a'', ''b''). There is never more than one natural number that answers the subtraction problem for a given pair (''a'', ''b''); we call that number, if it exists, ''b'' - ''a''. For example, the answer to the question &quot;What number, when added to 6, gives 13?&quot; is 13 - 6 = 7. But suppose we ask &quot;What number, when added to 12, gives 9?&quot; There is no answer. None of the numbers ''n'' in the set we have just constructed has the property that 12 + ''n'' = 9. But suppose there were such a number. If it obeyed all the same rules as the natural numbers, we would be able to say that it also satisfies 20 + ''n'' = 17, since 9 = 9, and therefore 8 + 9 = 8 + 9 -- but 12 + ''n'' = 9, so 8 + (12 + ''n'') = 8 + 9. Using the associative property, we can show that this means (8 + 12) + ''n'' = 8 + 9, and so, since we know 8 + 12 is 20 and 8 + 9 is 17, 20 + ''n'' = 17. By running the same kind of reasoning in reverse, we can show that our number ''n'' must also satisfy 3 + ''n'' = 0. Symbolically, then, we can say that our number is 0 - 3, since it solves our original problem for 3 and 0 just as 13 - 6 = 7 solves it for 6 and 13. Usually, we drop the 0 and write this number as -3. By adding the numbers -''n'' for all natural numbers ''n'' greater than 0 to our set, we end up with a  solution for the subtraction problem, not only for the pairs (''n'', 0), but for all pairs of numbers (''a'', ''b'') in our new set. (Notice that we don't have to add -0 because the subtraction problem already has a solution for the pair (0, 0) - namely 0.)

We need to be careful here to make sure that what we're talking about -- the set of integers -- actually exists, and that we can define addition and multiplication in a meaningful way on this new set of numbers. (Of course, the integers are a well-known system, and you almost certainly already know how to add and multiply them, but this is intended as a demonstration and a clarification.) One way to do this is to represent a number by the set of pairs for which it satisfies the subtraction problem. We do this by putting together a set of rules that tell us whether two pairs represent the same number -- what mathematicians call an '''equivalence relation'''. In this case, we'll say that the pair (''a'', ''b'') is equivalent to the pair (''c'', ''d'') if and only if (''a'' + ''d'' = ''b'' + ''c''). Then, writing ''b'' - ''a'' for the set of pairs related to (''a'', ''b''), we define addition and multiplication by the rules we want them to follow: (''b'' - ''a'') + (''d'' - ''c'') = (''b'' + ''d'') - (''a'' + ''c'') and (''b'' - ''a'')(''d'' - ''c'') = (''ac'' + ''bd'') - (''ad'' + ''bc''). Now all we have to do is name the sets ''n'' and -''n'' for each natural number ''n'', and this is easy - just let ''n'' be the set of pairs we've been calling ''n'' - 0 and -''n'' be the set of pairs 0 - ''n''. (Can you see how this all fits together? Hint: Try drawing a picture.)

Our new set of numbers, with addition, has a new, important property -- every integer has an '''inverse element''', or a number that it can be added to to get the identity (that is, 0). A monoid with this property is called a '''group''' -- a name which can be confusing, especially since the everyday meaning of ''group'', unlike the mathematical definition, has no notion of structure associated with it. A commutative group, like the integers, is also called an '''Abelian group''', after the mathematician [[w:Niels Henrik Abel|Niels Henrik Abel]].

One question we may want to ask about integers is the equivalent of the subtraction problem for multiplication: the division problem. Given a pair of integers (''a'', ''b''), it asks what number, when multiplied by a, gives b. We call the answer to the division problem for a pair (''a'', ''b''), if it exists, ''b''/''a''. If we treat the division problem just as we treated the subtraction problem for natural numbers, we end up with a new set of numbers, the rational numbers, in which every number other than 0 has a multiplicative inverse element 1/''a''. A set, like the rational numbers, with an addition operation with which it is an Abelian group and a multiplication operation with which its set of nonzero elements is a group is called a '''field'''.

=== Magnitudes and the Continuum ===

The process by which we extended the natural numbers to the integers and then the rational numbers was one of abstraction and generalization: If a solution to an equation existed and obeyed the rules we had already learned about numbers, it had to have certain properties. Once we knew all the properties it would have to have, we could build a new set of numbers in which it did exist. We can carry this process even further. Some equations cannot be solved by rational numbers, for example &lt;math&gt;x^2=2&lt;/math&gt;. In introducing irrational numbers into our system, let's go a bit further than we strictly have to by allowing numbers with any decimal expansion as part of our set, which we'll call the real numbers. The real numbers have some interesting properties: every positive real number has a real root (of every order) and a real logarithm, and they are complete in the sense that for every set of real numbers, you can find exactly one number that's greater than every other number in the set and smaller than every other number with this property. You can't do this for all sets of rational numbers -- for example, it fails for the set 3, 3.1, 3.14, 3.141, 3.1415, ..., which contains infinitely many numbers that approach &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt;. One of their most interesting properties is that you can assign exactly one real number to every point on a line and cover the entire line. Somehow along the way in this process of abstraction and generalization, numbers have turned from something we use only for counting to something we can use to describe shapes, and this is the concept geometric algebra is based on.

=== Complex Numbers ===
[[Image:Complex number illustration.svg|thumb|right|Complex numbers can be visualized as points in a plane.]]

As you may know, the real numbers aren't the end of the story. There are still equations that can't be solved by any real numbers, for example &lt;math&gt;x^2=-1&lt;/math&gt;. In order to solve equations like this, we will introduce a number &lt;math&gt;i=\sqrt{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. The new set of numbers we build using &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;, which includes all numbers of the form &lt;math&gt;a+bi&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are real numbers, is called the complex numbers. &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is quite a remarkable invention. For one thing, it's the last hoop we have to jump through -- every algebraic equation has a solution in the complex numbers. For this reason, we say that the complex numbers are ''algebraically closed''.

Since complex numbers aren't as familiar as the other sets of numbers we've discussed, I'll talk briefly about how to work with them. To find the sum of two complex numbers, we use the distributive property and the associative and commutative properties of addition:

&lt;math&gt;(a+bi)+(c+di)=a+bi+c+di=a+c+bi+di=(a+c)+(b+d)i&lt;/math&gt;.

To find their product, we use the distributive property and the fact that &lt;math&gt;i^2=-1&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;(a+bi)(c+di)=a(c+di)+bi(c+di)=ac+adi+bci+bdi^2=(ac-bd)+(ad+bc)i&lt;/math&gt;.

Finding the difference of two complex numbers is simple as long as you remember to distribute the negative sign to both parts of the number, but division is a little more complicated. You have to use a little trick to turn the bottom of the fraction into a real number:

&lt;math&gt;\frac{a+bi}{c+di}=\left(\frac{a+bi}{c+di}\right)1=\left(\frac{a+bi}{c+di}\right)\left(\frac{c-di}{c-di}\right)=\frac{(ac+bd)i+(-ad+bc)i}{(c^2+d^2)-(cd-cd)i}=\left(\frac{ac+bd}{c^2+d^2}\right)+\left(\frac{-ad+bc}{c^2+d^2}\right)i&lt;/math&gt;.

[[Image:Vector Addition.svg|200px|left|thumb|Addition of two complex numbers can be done geometrically by constructing a parallelogram.]]

[[File:ComplexMultiplication.png|right|thumb|Multiplication of 2+''i'' (blue triangle) and 3+''i'' (red triangle). The red triangle is rotated to match the vertex of the blue one and stretched by √{{overline|5}}, the length of the [[hypotenuse]] of the blue triangle.]]

We call the complex number &lt;math&gt;c-di&lt;/math&gt;, which you had to multiply by on the top and the bottom as part of that trick, the '''complex conjugate''' of &lt;math&gt;c+di&lt;/math&gt;.

Like the real numbers, the complex numbers have a natural geometric interpretation -- they can be thought of as points in a plane. The standard representation of the complex plane is with the real line running horizontally and the line of real multiples of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; running vertically, &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; above the real line and &lt;math&gt;-i&lt;/math&gt; below it. Geometrically, the sum of two complex numbers can be constructed in the same way as the sum of two vectors -- draw a parallelogram with two of its sides running from the origin (that is, 0) to the numbers you are adding. The point of the parallelogram opposite the origin is the sum of the two complex numbers. The rule for multiplication is a little more complicated: first, construct a right triangle for each of the numbers being multiplied, with one of its vertices at the origin, one at the endpoint of the complex number, and one along the real axis (at the point representing the real part of the complex number). Rotate one of these triangles until the leg that was on the real axis is parallel to the hypotenuse of the other triangle, and then scale it by a factor equal to the length of the hypotenuse of the other triangle. The tip of this triangle represents the product of the two complex numbers.

When we interpret complex numbers as points (or vectors) in a plane, it makes sense to introduce the concept of absolute value, which we will define exactly as we did for real numbers: the distance between a number and 0. The absolute value of a complex number is also called its '''modulus'''. Notice that there's a complication: more often than not, a complex number is situated along a diagonal, and so we have to use the Pythagorean theorem to find this distance. For example,

&lt;math&gt;|1+i|=\sqrt{(1)^2+(1)^2}=\sqrt{2}&lt;/math&gt;.

Complex conjugates come in handy here. As we saw in the division rule, the product of a complex number and its conjugate is always real. What's more, ''it's equal to the square of the complex number's absolute value''. So we can simply multiply a complex number by its conjugate and then take the square root to find its absolute value. Here's a little demonstration of why this works algebraically:

&lt;math&gt;(a+bi)(a-bi)=a(a-bi)+bi(a-bi)=a^2-abi+abi-b^2i^2=a^2-b^2(-1)=a^2+b^2&lt;/math&gt;.

See if you can work out the geometric proof for yourself. Note that taking the complex conjugate of a number amounts to reflecting it across the real axis.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol ==

Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) allows for manual and automatic assignment of IP addresses (see IETF rfc 2131 &amp; 2132). DHCP is enacted when a new machine joins a network or an existing machine attempts to renew its IP address. DHCP is an extension of an older protocol known as the &quot;bootstrap protocol&quot; (BOOTP) and is backwards compatible with BOOTP. There are three methods of IP address allocation:

    Manual:     An administrator manually assigns the IP address; tedious but most secure method.

    Automatic:  DHCP server assigns permanent IP address to requesting client.

    Dynamic:    DHCP server &quot;leases&quot; IP address to requesting client. The IP address is only valid for a limited period of time;
                after which the client must request a renewal or ask for a new IP address.

By far the most common (and most detailed) method is the dynamic method, which we'll focus our attention on. A typical sequence for a new client requesting an IP address is shown in the diagrams.below. Please note that this depiction shows the DHCP server located on a different network segment than the new client. But it's not required to be that way.


==== Example ====
'''''Figure 1'''''&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DHCP1.jpg]]

In figure 1, a new client that just joined the network, needs an IP address. Since it does not know the DHCP server's location, the client broadcasts (step 1) a DHCPDISCOVER message on the local network. The message packet contains a hardware identifier (usually the MAC address), the source port (68), the destination IP (255.255.255.255), destination port (67), and a randomly generated transaction id. Optionally the client can specify the IP address it wants and the lease duration in the message. Once the DHCP relay receives the broadcasted message, it fills in the &quot;giaddr&quot; field of the packet with the gateway IP address of 10.1.2.9 . This piece of information is critical because the DHCP Server needs it to determine which subnet the client is on and thus which IP address to allocate to the client. Afterwards the DHCPDISCOVER message is relayed to the DHCP Server via unicast (step 2). A unicast, instead of a broadcast, is sufficient because the DHCP relay knows the exact location of the DHCP server. For this same reason, the DHCP relay does not allow the other network segment, 10.1.1.X, to receive the message.

Once the DHCP server receives the DHCPDISCOVER request, it allocates an IP address, marks it as taken, and then broadcasts a DHCPOFFER message back to the requesting client. This message packet contains the DHCP server's IP address, the client's hardware identifier, the same transaction id, and the IP address allocated for the client. Optionally, the message may also contain the lease time, subnet mask, default TTL, default router(s), and numerous other parameters.

'''''Figure 2'''''&lt;br&gt;

In figure 2, the DHCP server allocates new IP address 10.1.2.3 for the client and broadcasts a DHCPOFFER message to its network (step 3). When the DHCP relay sees the DHCPOFFER broadcast, it relays the broadcast to the 10.1.2.X network and only that network (step 4). Once the new client sees the DHCPOFFER message, it accepts the IP address (step 5) and prepares a confirmation message to the DHCP
server with a DHCPREQUEST packet. Please note that the client does not have to accept this IP address, in which case it will not send a DHCPREQUEST message. If multiple DHCP servers sends out a DHCPOFFER, the client can choose which one to accept. If for some reason, the DHCPOFFER message fails to ever arrive, the client will rebroadcast the DHCPDISCOVER message.

'''''Figure 3'''''&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:DHCP3.jpg]]

If the client included optional information in the initial DHCPDISCOVER message, it must include that same information in the subsequent DHCPREQUEST message. In step 6 of figure 3, the new client confirms it wants the IP address 10.1.2.3 by broadcasting a DHCPREQUEST to the DHCP server. Once the DHCP Server receives this message (with help again from the DHCP Relay), it first ensures that it is the intended target - because  the client could be responding to another DHCP Server. If this DHCP server is not the intended target, then it knows some other DHCP server is handling this client. So this DHCP server can discard any previously allocated IP address for that client. If this DHCP Server is the intended recipient, then it has to verify the optional parameters that it specified in the previous DHCPOFFER message to this client, are still valid. Assuming everything is fine up to this point, the DHCP Server sends a DHCPACK broadcast (step 8) to tell the client that its new IP address can now officially be used. However, if something is wrong, then a DHCPNACK is broadcasted instead. Either way, a DHCPACK or DHCPNACK will be the final message sent by the DHCP server in the dynamic IP address allocation sequence..

Assuming it receives the DHCPACK relayed by the router (step 9), the client is encouraged to verify no other hosts has the same IP address. This is usually accomplished through a simple ARP probe. Any response to the probe means that another client is already using the IP address. In such a situation, the client must send a DHCPDECLINE message to the DHCP server. Afterwards the client will then need to restart this whole process beginning with DHCPDISCOVER phase. In most cases, there's no response to the client's ARP probe. This means the client can go ahead and use the allocated IP address along with any other optional information stored in the message packet.

If the client got a DHCPNAK instead of DHCPACK, then it has no choice but to restart everything from the very beginning i.e. the DHCPDISCOVER stage. Finally, if the client doesn't receive any DHCPACK or DHCPNAK message after a certain period of time, then it rebroadcasts the DHCPREQUEST message.

==== Other DHCP Messages ====
   IP Renewal:  If the client wishes to renew its existing IP address (usually because of expiring lease), it unicasts a special  
                DHCPREQUEST message that indicates it's renewing (and not asking for new) IP address. The DHCP server can choose 
                to extend the lease or reject it. Either way, it must inform the client via a DHCPACK message.

   Release IP:  The client can request its current IP address be relinquished by issuing a DHCPRELEASE message (via unicast) to          
                the DHCP server. The message packet must contain the IP address and the hardware identifier of the client. Upon 
                receipt, the DHCP server marks the client's IP address as unallocated.

   Inform:      The client already has an IP address but needs additional configuration parameters, such as default TTL, subnet 
                mask, etc. So it sends a DHCPINFORM message to the DHCP server. In response, the DHCP server unicasts a DHCPACK


==== Security Concerns ====
DHCP is inherently insecure because there's no authentication mechanism built in. Here are a few examples of security weaknesses.

   Problem:  The DHCP server does not know if requests are from a legitimate new client or a rogue host pretending to be one.
   Impact:   This could lead to IP addresses allocated to spoofed MAC addresses that don't exist, and eventually exhaust the pool  
             of legitimate IP addresses. Thus new hosts cannot added to the network.
   Solution: Manually assign IP addresses or manually verify every new client requesting IP address. Can also audit the DHCP 
             database. But these are all fairly time-consuming. No simple way to address this issue.

   Problem:  A new client doesn't know if responses are coming from real DHCP server or rogue host pretending to be a DHCP server.
   Impact:   If the client accepts all the information given to it by the rogue DHCP server, then false information (e.g. bad 
             subnet mask) could render the client useless.
   Solution: Can identify fake DHCP servers by using security tools that send out DHCPDISCOVER &amp; DHCPREQUEST messages and flag any
             suspicious information returned.


== Summary ==
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) is a convenient, though insecure, technique to assign an IP address to a host newly added to a network. It can also be used to extend the lease period of an existing IP address, drop the IP address of a host, or provide initial configuration parameters to a requesting host.

== Exercises ==
Question:
# Using the example illustrated in the DHCP section, explain how the interaction between the new client and the DHCP Server would change if the DHCP Server is located on the same network segment as the new client.
# (T/F) Once a new client receives the IP address after the DHCPOFFER, the client should verify no other hosts are using that IP address.

Answer:
# The only difference would be the DHCP Relay not getting involved. Thus the DHCP Server receives broadcasts instead of unicasts, and the &quot;igaddr&quot; field of the message packet wil be empty.
# False - the client must wait until DHCPACK (not DHCPOFFER) because the IP address is not officially assigned to the new client until DHCPACK is received.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Network Address Translation ==

When IP addresses were introduced, only a portion of the theoretical four billion or so IP addresses were available for assignment. Early on, this was not a problem because the Internet was only used among groups of academic researchers, a few high tech companies, and the U.S. Government. But after the Internet exploded in popularity during the mid-1990s, it soon became clear that there won't be enough IP addresses to keep up with demand. In response, IPv6 was proposed as a long term solution. But IPv6 was quite different from IPv4 and had complexities that slowed down its adoption. So a practical short term solution was needed, and thereby Network Address Translation (NAT) was introduced.

=== Example ===
The basic idea behind NAT is to assign a single IP address to a NAT device. We'll call this the public IP address. Within the local network behind the NAT device, every computing device gets assigned a private IP address as illustrated below:

'''''Figure 1'''''&lt;br&gt;
[[Image:Network Address Translation (file1).jpg]]

In figure 1, the NAT device's public IP address is 145.12.131.7 while the private IP addresses are in the range 192.168.X.X. This range of private IP addresses is one of three common ranges:

   Class A: 10.0.0.0 - 10.255.255.255/8
   Class B: 172.16.0.0 - 172.31.255.255/12
   Class C: 192.168.0.0 - 192.168.255.255/16

Keep in mind that private IP addresses are valid only within that local area network. It is not recognized on the public Internet. For packets that originate from a private IP address and port, it must be converted to a unique public IP address and port before it can be sent to the Internet. The mapping from private IP address &amp; port to a public IP address &amp; port is typically done through a translation table inside the NAT device. An example is shown in figure 2:

'''''Figure 2'''''
[[Image:Network Address Translation (file2).jpg]]

In step 1, the host at private IP address 192.168.100.3 is requesting the homepage of www.yahoo.com via an HTTP request through port 3855. When the HTTP packet arrives at the NAT device (step 2), it looks up the translation table for an existing public (IP addr, port) entry for this private (IP addr, port) combination. If no existing entry exists, then the NAT device will create a new public (IP addr, port) entry. If there is an existing entry, then the translation process will use the existing entry. Please remember that each entry in the translation table must always remain unique! After the table lookup is complete, the IP packet is then altered so that the new IP address and port replaces the old one. Finally in step 3, the altered packet is routed to www.yahoo.com . This entire network address translation process is completely transparent to the end hosts. In other words, neither the host at 192.168.100.3 nor the Yahoo web server realizes the packet has been changed.

The packet from Yahoo's web server now goes through the reverse translation process to reach the requesting host.

'''''Figure 3'''''
[[Image:NAT3.jpg]]

The reverse process is similar to the original translation process. It will look up the translation table for the corresponding private (IP addr, port) pair when given the public (IP addr, port) pair. The only difference it that a missing entry will result in the packet getting thrown away. Once the lookup and alteration is completed (step 5), the packet (now contains the original private (IP addr, port) information) is sent to the requesting host at 192.168.100.3 port 3855.

===NAT vs. Proxy===
NATs are sometimes confused with proxies, but they are actually quite different in one aspect: transparency. NAT is completely transparent to the end hosts i.e. only the NAT device knows that an IP conversion is taking place. But for proxies, the source application/host is well aware of the change because it has to deliberately be configured to use the proxy.

===Problems with NAT===
Applications that holds their [private] IP address information inside data packets will find that it doesn't match with their actual IP address once the IP translation is done and the packet is on the Internet. Example: FTP

Among the chief complaints is that the widespread use of NAT has resulted in delayed deployment of IPv6, which is the more ideal long-term solution. Despite all the issues associated with NAT, it is still &quot;good enough&quot; for most home users. Therefore, adoption of IPv6 among DSL and cable Internet customers in the U.S. will continue to be slow. For Internet purists, the whole NAT solution is considered to be a quick &quot;hack&quot; rather than a long term solution. The original Internet was designed for end-to-end communication, where every host has a public IP address.

===Overcoming NAT Restrictions===
Simple Traversal of UDP through NAT (STUN) : Suppose Host A and Host B are both behind asymmetric NATs and both have a UDP session with server S who is directly connected to the Internet. Then host A can use the same source IP &amp; port as the existing connection with S to initiate session with host B. Meanwhile, S knows the public IP and port of A's session with B since it's the same as A's session with S. S then passes this info to B, and B initiates UDP session with A.

Traversal Using Relay NAT (TURN): this setup requires an intermediary server S, who is directly connected to Internet. Both hosts A and B would have to initiate session with S, and then S will relay their messages to each other.

==Port Address Translation==
A related but somewhat different concept to NAT is port address translation (PAT). PAT allows incoming sessions, that are initiated from an external host, to map to a specific internal host and port. For example, in figure 4

'''''Figure 4'''''
[[Image:PAT.jpg]]

all incoming requests to port 80 of the router are forwarded to internal host 192.168.100.2 port 7575. Likewise, all incoming connections to port 22 or the router are redirected to host 192.168.100.1 port 22. This type of setup is common for users to wish to run a server behind a NAT device. The only down side to PAT is that it's restricted to one entry per router port.

== Summary ==
Network Address Translation (NAT) is a widely-used solution to the shortage of IP addresses. NAT introduces the concept of a &quot;private&quot; IP address that is valid only within a Local Area Network (LAN) and must be translated to the &quot;public&quot; IP address that's used on the Internet. With NAT, we can have multiple private IP addresses share a single public IP address, thus delaying the need to deploy long-term solutions to the shortage of IP addresses.

== Exercises ==
Question:
# STUN and TURN were presented as 2 ways to bypass NATs. Can you describe 2 additional methods for bypassing NAT?
# (T/F) Both STUN and TURN can only be used for UDP and never for TCP.

Answer:
# Universal Plug and Play (mkiUPnP), assuming the router or NAT device is configured to accept it. Another method is to tunnel out to a server. Yet a third method is to use Application Layer Gateways, assuming the router or NAT device has it built in.
# False - STUN is only for UDP, but TURN applies to both UDP and TCP.

==Introduction==

====Significance====

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Space Office Space] is a comedy movie released in 1999. It was written and directed by [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Judge Mike Judge], the creator of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/King_of_the_Hill King of the Hill] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beavis_and_Butt-head Beavis and Butt-head]. The movie was promoted using the tagline “Work Sucks.&quot; The tagline is indicative of the attitudes towards work that Office Space characters hold. The movie was intended as a satire of life in a typical software company, but has been interpreted as a satire of white collar office life in general. It grossed more than $10 million in North America &lt;ref&gt;Box Office Mojo (2012). ''Office Space''. Retrieved from http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=officespace.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;, but it was even more successful in after-theatre sales &lt;ref&gt;CNN (2003). ''Film flops flourish on DVD, VHS''. Retrieved from http://edition.cnn.com/2003/SHOWBIZ/Movies/03/04/second.wind/index.html.&lt;/ref&gt;. Office Space has a substantial cult following. It has sold 6 million copies on VHS and DVD &lt;ref&gt;The Numbers (2012). ''Office Space''. Retrieved from http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1999/OFFIC.php.&lt;/ref&gt;.

====Plot====

Peter Gibbons, the main character, is a programmer at Initech, a software company. Peter hates his job. The only coworkers that he can tolerate are his friends Michael and Samir, who also hate their jobs. In particular, Peter hates his boss, Bill Lumbergh, who nitpicks and micromanages him. Bill hires two consultants, Bob and Bob, to assist Initech in evaluating employees and conducting layoffs. The layoffs create a high stress environment in the office, as the employees have to interview for their own jobs.

Peter’s life is changed once he visits a hypnotherapist, who hypnotizes him, putting him in a state of ecstasy. The hypnotherapist dies immediately after hypnotizing Peter. Stuck in his state of ecstasy, Peter does not concern himself with things he doesn’t like doing, like going to work. He shows up sporadically, comes in late, guts a fish on his desk, and knocks down one of the walls of his cubicle. Ironically, Peter’s laid back demeanor strikes the consultants positively and he’s offered a promotion. At the same time, however, he discovers that his friends Michael and Samir will be fired.

After he tells them, the three decide to steal from Initech by planting a virus in its accounting system. They think the theft will be so small that it won’t be noticed. However, they make a mistake and unintentionally steal much more money than they intended. Peter, Samir and Michael are nervous about being caught and sentenced to prison. Peter decides to leave a check for the stolen amount at Initech along with a note taking responsibility for the theft. The next morning, Peter finds the Initech office in flames. The check, along with all the evidence, is destroyed.

==Professionalism Themes==

====Autonomy====

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Autonomy Autonomy], or lack thereof, is a strong unifying theme in ''Office Space''. An Initech memo stated that employees should use a specific cover-sheet on their reports. After forgetting to include the cover-sheet on his report, Peter apologizes for his mistake to his managers. They repeatedly ask whether he received a copy of the memo, even while Peter is holding a copy of the memo in plain sight. The managers do not trust Peter to perform even the simplest of tasks. He is not empowered to think for himself. Simply, he has no autonomy. An exchange between Peter and the consultants illustrates this.

Peter Gibbons: The thing is, Bob, it's not that I'm lazy, it's that I just don't care.&lt;br /&gt;
Bob Porter: Don't... don't care?&lt;br /&gt;
Peter Gibbons: …And here's something else, Bob: I have eight different bosses right now. &lt;br /&gt;
Bob Slydell: I beg your pardon?&lt;br /&gt;
Peter Gibbons: Eight bosses.&lt;br /&gt;
Bob Slydell: Eight?&lt;br /&gt;
Peter Gibbons: Eight, Bob. So that means that when I make a mistake, I have eight different people coming by to tell me about it. That's my only real motivation is not to be hassled, that and the fear of losing my job. But you know, Bob, that will only make someone work just hard enough not to get fired.&lt;br /&gt;

This behavior is emblematic of management's treatment of employees in this movie. Every major character suffers from the same lack of autonomy. One of the cornerstones of professionalism is the freedom to exercise discretion and judgment - a freedom these employees lacked.

====Duty====
Peter, Michael, and Samir are also brought together by their lack of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duty duty] to Initech. As employees, one would consider it their duty to work in the best interests of the company in all of their actions at work. Peter's description of a typical workday is telling of his opinion of his duty towards the company: &quot;Well, I generally come in at least fifteen minutes late. I use the side door, that way Lumbergh can't see me. Uh, and after that, I just sorta space out for about an hour ... I just stare at my desk but it looks like I'm working. I do that for probably another hour after lunch too. I'd probably, say, in a given week, I probably do about fifteen minutes of real, actual work.&quot; At one point in the movie, Lumbergh hangs up a sign that says “Is this good for the company?” indicating that employees should strive to observe their duty to the firm. Later, Peter tears down the sign, an outward sign of how little he cares about Initech. This lack of duty contributes to Peter’s unprofessional actions – theft – later in the film.

====Arete====
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arete Arete] is the concept of excellence in a pursuit that is challenging and fulfilling. Describing his work at Initech, Peter says, &quot;I sit in a cubicle and I update software for the two thousand switch... it doesn't really matter. I don't like my job, and I don't think I'm going to go anymore.&quot; This statement shows that he has no arete there. The key part of this statement is when he says &quot;it doesn't really matter.&quot; Clearly, he has no sense of excellence in his job. This lack of arete that leads him to feel a crushing sense of despair early in the film.

Later in the film, Peter gets a job as a construction worker. This is a job that he may have initially looked down on, but finds fulfilling. When his former coworkers offer him a job at their new firm, he responds that he’s “definitely sure” he doesn’t want a job. The last shot of him in the movie is a wide pan, showing him surveying the workplace with a broad smile on his face: the smile of someone who has achieved happiness through excellence.

==Analogous Cases==

====Galileo Galilei====

[[File:Justus Sustermans - Portrait of Galileo Galilei, 1636.jpg|right|frame|x150px|Galileo Galilei was a famous astronomer and physicist]]

[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_Galilei Galileo Galilei] was an Italian astronomer and physicist most noted for his support for [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliocentrism heliocentricism]. During his time, heliocentricism was a dangerous view to hold - the [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_Church Catholic Church] described Galileo's views as &quot;altogether contrary to Holy Scripture.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Decree of the Index. ''Galileo Trial Documents''. Retrieved from http://www1.umn.edu/ships/galileo/library/1616docs.htm.&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Church's tasked a special team, known as the [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roman_Inquisition Roman Inquisition], to prosecute and try those suspected of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heresy heresy] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blasphemy blasphemy]. The Inquisition levied various punishments up to the death penalty. Knowing that his writings and teachings could catch the Inquisition's eye, Galileo still continued to write about his observations regarding the solar system. Even later warnings from the Church did not dissuade Galileo from pursuing his steadfast duty to science.

Eventually, the Inquisition put Galileo on trial for his &quot;crimes&quot; and he spent the rest of his life in house arrest&lt;ref&gt;Weidhorn, Manfred (2005). The Person of the Millennium: The Unique Impact of Galileo on World History. ISBN 0-595-36877-8&lt;/ref&gt;. Despite his house arrest, Galileo continued his research and supported the cause of truth and heliocentricism. Although the Church took his physical autonomy, Galileo still retained his professional autonomy and freedom to pursue science. It is clear that Galileo had both autonomy and duty. History proves his arete or excellence since he is titled &quot;The Father of Modern Science&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Finocchiaro, Maurice A. (Fall 2007). &quot;Book Review—The Person of the Millennium: The Unique Impact of Galileo on World History&quot;. The Historian 69 (3) doi:10.1111/j.1540-6563.2007.00189_68.x.&lt;/ref&gt; or &quot;The Father of Modern Physics&quot; &lt;ref&gt;Weidhorn, Manfred (2005). The Person of the Millennium: The Unique Impact of Galileo on World History. ISBN 0-595-36877-8 &lt;/ref&gt; because of his exceptional contributions to the fields of astronomy, physics and mathematics.

====Lucius Cincinnatus====



Lucius [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cincinnatus Cincinnatus] was a famous Roman politician from roughly 2500 years ago &lt;ref&gt; Lucius Quinctius Cincinnatus. (2012). In Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved from http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/117993/Lucius-Quinctius-Cincinnatus&lt;/ref&gt;. Although his story is somewhat apocryphal – it comes from one ancient Roman historian, [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Livy Livy] – it contains highly relevant lessons. Cincinnatus was an important Roman politician, but a scandal brought him down and saw him exiled to a small farm outside of Rome. However, a few years later, Rome was threatened by an invading army, and the Roman government appointed him to a dictatorial position to repel the invaders. In fifteen days, Cincinnatus raised an army and personally led it to victory. On the sixteenth day, he resigned his position as dictator and went back to his farm &lt;ref&gt;Lucius Q Cincinnatus. (2012). The Cincinnatus Association. Retrieved from http://www.cincinnatusassoc.org/pages/Lucius-Q-Cincinnatus.html&lt;/ref&gt;. His arête and autonomy are both clear here: ability to turn a losing war into a winning war in fifteen days demonstrates that leadership is his area of excellence. And as an appointed dictator, he clearly had an excess of autonomy. But the most compelling aspect of Cincinnatus’s story was his sense of duty to the Roman people. Although he had been exiled, he did not hesitate to come to Rome’s aid when called upon. And after achieving victory, he could have remained as dictator, but his sense of duty to the Roman people and the Roman republic had him resign his power and return to his farm. This duty – a commitment to the people he served, over his own interests – made him a true professional, and a successful one.

====Robert McNamara====

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_McNamara Robert McNamara] is best known for his service as the Secretary of Defense under Presidents [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_F._Kennedy John F. Kennedy] and [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyndon_B._Johnson Lyndon B. Johnson]. He had been the President of [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ford_Motor_Company Ford Motor Company] for less than five weeks when he received the call from the newly elected President Kennedy to serve as [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense Secretary of Defense] &lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Defense (2012). ''Robert S. McNamara''. Retrieved from http://www.defense.gov/specials/secdef_histories/bios/mcnamara.htm.&lt;/ref&gt;.

The role of autonomy in McNamara’s career is very prevalent. McNamara was given extensive autonomy by President Kennedy during the early years of the Vietnam War. [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_Sorensen Ted Sorensen], one of Kennedy’s advisors, wrote that Kennedy regarded McNamara as the &quot;star of his team, calling upon him for advice on a wide range of issues beyond national security, including business and economic matters.&quot; &lt;ref&gt;John Shattuck (2012). ''An Evening with Ted Sorensen''. &lt;/ref&gt; However, McNamara’s autonomy was significantly restricted under Johnson. McNamara's recommendation to freeze troop levels and stop bombing North Vietnam was rejected by Johnson &lt;ref&gt;National Exhibition (2010). ''Biography of Robert McNamara''. Retrieved from http://www.nationalcoldwarexhibition.org/explore/biography.cfm?name=McNamara,%20Robert.&lt;/ref&gt;. Rather than accept his limited autonomy and ability to carry out his professional duties, McNamara resigned in 1968. In this way, McNamara demonstrated uncompromised professional conviction.

==Conclusion==
&lt;!--Do not remove templates below this line --&gt;
There is a great deal to be learned about office ethics from ''Office Space''. In particular, the movie illustrates the concepts of autonomy, duty, and arete through the main character, Peter. While these components are not a comprehensive characterization of a professional, they are necessary components. These concepts have been integral in the conduct of professionals throughout history, as exemplified by Galileo Galilei, Lucius Cincinnatus, and Robert McNamara.

== &lt;u&gt;'''Introduction'''&lt;/u&gt; ==

Knowledge management (KM) is essential in helping employees work efficiently and effectively. Groff and Jones (2003) portray KM as a tool, technology and strategy to analyze, organize and improve organization operation which helps developing new knowledge and creating the competitive advantage. KM can be used to harvest human asset in individuals’ mind. By using KM, librarians can serve user in a user-friendly way. A university library in Asia (Library A) realized this and started to develop KM in ten years ago. They have used different tools such as intranet and wiki to implement KM.

In the following, we will use 4 stages in KM cycle to analyze and evaluate KM application in Library A. They are knowledge capture, creation, sharing and lastly application and reuse.
 
==== '''Definition of Knowledge Capture''' ====

As suggested by Becerra-Fernandez, Gonzalez and Sabherwal (2004, p. 32-36 as cited in SAĞSAN, 2006), “knowledge capture which may be defined as the process of retrieving either explicit or tacit knowledge that resides within people, artifacts or organizational entities”.
 
==== '''Definition of Knowledge Creation''' ====

The Next step is knowledge creation. According to Dalkir (2005), Nonaka and Takeuchi Model states that knowledge creation is to transform tacit and explicit knowledge into different forms. It consists of Socialization (tacit to tacit), Externalization (tacit to explicit), Combination (explicit to explicit), and Internalization (explicit to tacit).
 
==== '''Definition of Knowledge Sharing''' ====

As suggested by Becerra-Fernandez, Gonzalez and Sabherwal (2004, p. 32-36 as cited in SAĞSAN, 2006), knowledge sharing is the stage which “Tacit or explicit knowledge is communicated to other organizational participants.”

==== '''Definition of Application and Re-use''' ====

The final step is knowledge application and reuse. Dhiman and Sharma (2009) state that this stage is to use the knowledge created or acquired before to further organize, publish, distribute and reuse whenever it is useful.


== &lt;u&gt;'''Literature Review'''&lt;/u&gt; ==


==== '''Background''' ====

In this information and knowledge age, knowledge has become a valuable asset (Maponya, 2004). In the last ten years, many academic industries, particularly university library, started to apply knowledge management in their daily operations and consider it as a serious issue in the organization. Wen (2005) reports that The International Federation of Library Associations (IFLA) 69th General Conference and Council (Berlin, Germany; August 2003) opened a session on KM, while the 3rd China-US Library Conference (Shanghai, China; March 22-25, 2005) addressed KM as a sub-theme of the conference. 

==== '''Knowledge Capture''' ====

Library uses formal and informal ways in capturing knowledge. Lim (1992), Dhiman and Sharma (2009) indicate some KM tools to capture knowledge at the Victorian Universities in Australia and The National Library Board. They use printed material such as newsletters and agendas of meetings. There is also an increased use of communication technologies to capture knowledge such as fax, teleconferencing, videoconferencing, and E-mail. Lim (1992) claims an informal way like cross-campus visits is organized at the Victorian Universities’ libraries which can ensure staff can be kept informed and in-the-know about their job. Besides, electronic systems are also set up to capture knowledge. Dhiman and Sharma (2009) take The National Library Board (NLB) in Singapore as an example. Database InfoXpress is established for recording customers’ questions while the Project Broadcast database was implemented to record the staff contributions and accomplishments. Besides, Gibson (2010) suggests to develop data cleaning in order to enable library records generated by library users navigation to be mined.

==== '''Knowledge Creation''' ====

After capturing the facts, information and data, the next step is creating the new skills, ideas as to increase the efficiency and effectiveness of the operation of library.  Dhiman and Sharma (2009) indicates knowledge creation is an essential process for the future development of the organization to ensure better operation. Some libraries have built a learning atmosphere to encourage employees create new knowledge. Dhiman and Sharma cites that some libraries create knowledge competition to let employee contribute to the KM. The university libraries in the U.S. emphasizes on the knowledge creation in innovation since it help the library to keep pace with the dynamic environment. Most of the top managers agree that their staff need continue to capture knowledge to create new knowledge to achieve greater effectiveness.
 
==== '''Knowledge Sharing''' ====
 

After gaining organized knowledge in order to improve the daily operational process, librarian can utilize know-how through knowledge sharing. Librarian training is one of the strategies in knowledge sharing. Among different types of training, Clark (1986) claims that one to one instruction mode of teaching is the best and the most common one in Library bibliographic instruction training. However, only several libraries use one to one assistant or mentor systems in training. In another case, Semertzaki (2011) states the redesigned intranet “iSeek” in the United Nations (UN) fosters a sense of community and encourages dialogue among employee and top management worldwide. Furthermore, Lim (1992) claims some the sharing ways like social gatherings and interchange of staff to establish good communication between staffs.
 
The knowledge sharing practice not only takes place within an organization. Maponya (2004) points out that libraries need to cooperate with each other to handle or address the problems encountered and acquire knowledge. Lim (1992) even identifies a cooperation system - administrative centralization that is used in the libraries in Victorian universities in Australia to share knowledge within organization.

==== '''Knowledge Application and Re-use''' ====

Gibson (2010) reports that data mining technology should be used by territory school’s library to implement KM in library operation in order to improve the effectiveness  and efficiency. This method allows library staff to read the record and generate knowledge.

==== '''Problems of applying KM in library''' ====

The low willingness of staff to share their knowledge and high difficulties in managing tacit knowledge are two general problems when applying KM in library. Mapanya (2004) and Trivedi (2007) identify these two problems in University of Natal Pietermaritzburg Libraries and Department of Health in UK. Staff usually does not aware of the importance of KM and ignores the KM policies or strategies in libraries. Besides, it is difficult to capture and share tacit knowledge of all internal staff, for example, no written KM policy and strategy is written in University of Natal Pietermaritzburg Libraries. Beside these two problems, Wen (2005) discovers that most knowledge is context specific, which means useful in particular situations. Trivedi (2007) also points out a similar problem that old knowledge is not useful in current and future times. Therefore, knowledge in a centralized knowledge management system would be relevant to users of certain unit but irrelevant to most users.
 
==== '''Future Development''' ====

In the 21st century, many written resources would be digitized such as e-mail, e-newspaper, online shop and even e-books. It is inevitable to use technology for the future development of KM in academic library. Burke(2004) and Trivedi (2007) predict that using automated systems would be the trend for all libraries in the world. As a result, libraries need more technical staff that is familiar with high technology. They need to understand the information and knowledge needs of users and should be responsible for mapping the external and internal knowledge for enhancing working efficiency.

Besides, the information landscape would be reshaped in the 21st century. Lee (2007) points out that many libraries provide coffee shops, computer labs and Web 2.0 technologies as complement of their service. It provides an instant gratification and choice for the users. Those libraries can build a more relaxed atmosphere to encourage people to exchange knowledge in libraries.


== &lt;u&gt;'''Methodology'''&lt;/u&gt; ==
 
The objective of this research is to find out a series of KM application in the Library A.

Before going into deep investigation of the applications of KM in Library A, 21 pieces of works have been read, including books, articles, e-journals and thesis, in order to understand the applications of KM in other universities and libraries. Based on the literature reviews, this academic research focuses on two main aspects: how the University of Asia apply KM in the daily operation of libraries. And how the University of Asia can improve the daily operation by using KM. 

In order to find out a series of most suitable application of KM in Library A, the current knowledge management applications have been investigated and an interview has been conducted with the Knowledge Management Coordinator.

The KM Coordinator is also titled Information Literacy &amp; Knowledge Management Librarian. She is responsible for monitoring the organization of library instruction programmes, such as the application of knowledge management, foundations to information technology and credit-earning course for undergraduates, in Library A.

In an hour face-to-face interview with the KM coordinator,  . In order to facilitate the flow of the interview, note-taking is allowed during the interview.



== &lt;u&gt;'''Analysis of Result'''&lt;/u&gt; ==


==== '''Knowledge Capture''' ==== 

The Knowledge Management Coordinator in Library A states that there is a significant project, Scholar Hub, running in the library. Before this project implemented, a lot of essays written by different scholars in university cannot be searched by users systematically. The Scholar Hub allows users to search and gain specialised knowledge from professionals. It collects the knowledge from university  effectively.  By referencing to the knowledge base in The National Library Board mentioned  by Dhiman and Sharma (2009), using database to capture knowledge effectively seems to be a major trend in library industry.

On the other hand, the library committee is formed by representatives from every faculty, subject librarians, and knowledge team. They receive the opinions from faculties. The subject librarians understand the needs of faculties and different subjects. After that, they make policy and IT improvements for the library. These activities are kinds of interviews with subject matter experts in different fields. The tacit knowledge can be gathered for the community. We found that it is quite similar to other libraries like The National Library Board which capture the tacit knowledge by meetings and discussion. (Dhiman &amp; Sharma 2009)

When employees quit their jobs, they need to prepare a handover notes in order to pass the specific knowledge acquired to newcomers. The library also hires professionals to train their staffs. Both explicit knowledge and tacit knowledge are available to be transferred to the staffs in the library.

Another way in capturing tacit knowledge is attending international forum by staff. They will share their experience and knowledge acquired from the forum by creating notes, providing presentations to other staff in the library. All staff can learn the knowledge acquired from other libraries. In this way, the library can improve their working process.

Library A also captures tacit knowledge from public. In the library website, the public can make enquiries or express their opinion through text, telephone, email, social media etc. The librarians and staff can review the records when they encounter the same situation or enquiry from customers afterwards. Dhiman and Sharma (2009) reflects that a database should be implemented to record customers knowledge and experience. It would be better to store knowledge in a database. 

==== '''Knowledge Creation''' ==== 

Library A lacks a great effort on creating knowledge within the library. By comparing to other libraries, Library A only provides some training courses to teach staff how to use the libraries’ database. However, other libraries have developed knowledge construction such as a good culture to increase the incentive of staff to create new ideas in order to improve organizational processes and competencies(Dhiman &amp; Sharma, 2009). Although the staff of Library A has attended many site visits, it just acquires knowledge but not build on its own knowledge. It is good to absorb others advantage and then apply in the organization. However, it is bad to ‘copy’ others ideas without new knowledge. Library A would be lag behind others and fail to renew all their capabilities.

==== '''Knowledge Sharing''' ====

Eden (2002) suggests that people can visit other successful library for knowledge sharing. Library A sends representatives to visit other libraries in the city nearby to learn from them. Librarians share their professional knowledge and experience to each other during the library visit. Furthermore, Library A is a member of Joint University Library Advisory Committee. Expertise knowledge in library management is shared in the meetings so the staff can learn the practices of other libraries.
 
Semertzaki (2011) states that the redesigned intranet “iSeek” in the United Nations (UN) fosters a sense of community and encourages dialogue among employee and top management worldwide. In Library A, different types of knowledge are shared through the intranet, which is only accessible by full-time staff. Written materials such as discussion minutes, conference records, reports of specific projects are posted in the intranet. Besides, the quality sharing team posts their minutes in the intranet to let each departments in the library to learn and improve. Some departments also post basic procedures and regulations of work for the staff. However, it does not utilize the intranet system. Staff does not share their knowledge and gives their opinions to the information posted. So knowledge cannot be shared in a fast pace within the library.
 
As reported by Dhiman and Sharma (2009), regular meetings and formal briefings are commonly used in The National Library Board to ensure the staff is on the right track of their work. Every department in Library A has their regular meetings and formal briefings, knowledge about work is shared within the department in these activities, which is an effective way that knowledge can be shared regularly and in a formal manner.
 
Lim (1992) points out that some other methods such as social gatherings or interchange of staff are used to enhance knowledge sharing at the Victorian Universities in Australia. Staff Relationship Committee (SRC) also organizes social activities such as barbecue and hiking for different departments. The staff does not consider the social activities as a means to share their knowledge, but an opportunity of improving the relationship of the staff only. This wastes a treasurable opportunity of knowledge sharing between the staff of different departments since they have little chance to work together and share their knowledge to the others.

==== '''Knowledge Application &amp; Re-use''' ==== 

Re-use is the final process that users selectively seek out the knowledge which can apply and re-use the retrieved knowledge according to their needs. 

Although all the comments and complaints of the library are stored in the website of the Library A, Anna said that there is no knowledge base for staffs to handle the complaints. As the complaints are diverse over topic, the response and answer is not reusable and cannot be standardized. Therefore, according to Anna, there is no need to establish a knowledge base to handle the complaints even though Gibson(2010) reported that implementing data mining in libraries would improve the effectiveness and efficiency of its daily operation.



== &lt;u&gt;'''Recommendations'''&lt;/u&gt; ==


Establish a knowledge base recording past experience and best practices
In Library A, enquiries, complaints and suggestions from customers are collected on the library’s website. However, the replies to the enquiries and customers’ opinions as well as the best practice of work are not recorded. The experience from employees and best practice as templates are useful for future use and to raise staff performance. 
Dhiman &amp; Sharma (2009) reports that National Library Board implemented the Project Broadcast database to record staff contributions and accomplishments. Library A is encouraged to establish similar knowledge base to record customers’ opinions and staffs’ accomplishments . In this way, other staffs especially new comers can refer to previous cases when they face similar matters.

==== '''Training for using new technology''' ====

There are immense amount of literature in the searching database in Library A. However, employees cannot effectively use the knowledge management tools, for instance, the database searching in library. They only understand the basic functionality of the systems.
Koenig (2004) states that librarians cannot perform effective database mining without training. In Library A, it is not compulsory for the staff to attend training courses for the new technology applied in the library. However, it is necessary for employee to be familiar with the data mining skill to enhance information seeking. Staff should be encouraged to participate in related training activities when new technology is implemented into the library.

==== '''Establish electronic communication forum''' ====

Library A does not have any electronic communication forums for the staff. Electronic communication forums can be used as a platform for organizing community of practice among employees. 
Kuhlen (2004) states that electronic forums can allow exchange of information between employees with different backgrounds who will not have any collaborations in real life. It will also build a continuous knowledge bases which is available for employees. It is suggested to establish a electronic forum as a platform for the staff from different departments to share their knowledge and discuss current issues about the library. Knowledge can be shared among the staff of different departments without complicated procedures.

==== '''Build up knowledge sharing culture''' ====

A library in the same city of Library A has already built the common learning place to develop its sharing culture. However, most of the staff in Library A do not know the importance of knowledge sharing and has low willingness and incentive to share their knowledge. Gurteen (1999) suggests that rewarding knowledge sharing and motivating knowledge sharing helps create knowledge sharing culture in an organization. Financial reward can be an incentive for knowledge sharing. Staffs who are active in knowledge sharing can be given reward to encourage his behavior. In addition, Library A can let the staffs learn the benefits of knowledge sharing to themselves since knowledge sharing helps the staffs do their jobs more effectively, helps them in their personal development and career progression and brings more personal recognition. With the financial incentive and benefits of knowledge sharing, staffs are encouraged to be more active in knowledge sharing in the library.

==== '''Build a knowledge creating culture''' ====

The staffs of Library A lack incentive to create new knowledge. They always accept the order from the manager and solve problem with same solution. They do not think of new methods to increase the effectiveness of operation. Therefore, the managers should cultivate staff to have the idea of creating new knowledge. They can provide some creativity course and talk to initiate their interesting. Besides, managers must be opened to accept staffs’ opinion in order to let them feel free to create new idea without unfriendly criticism. 


== &lt;u&gt;'''Conclusion'''&lt;/u&gt; ==



Applying KM from ten years ago, Library A is still at the starting stage to have well-rounded KM. Considering the three critical elements of successful KM, technology, process and people, Library A still has space for improvement. Regarding “technology”, Library A has developed intranet and wiki for information provision and sharing, but the systems are not widely used by the staff for knowledge sharing. Also, knowledge base is not developed to record good staff practices as reference of the staffs’ daily work. Concerning “process”, many practices in the library enhance knowledge capture in the library, but little efforts are put on other processes including knowledge creation, knowledge sharing, and knowledge application and re-use. With regard to “people”, staffs in library A still have low awareness about KM. Most of the staff do not know the importance of knowledge sharing in the library and not much knowledge of the staff are applied and used at their work. Once the problems related to the three key elements of KM are solved with corresponding measures, the application of KM in Library A will be more smooth and successful.

Please post your comments here.

Wong Nga Shun: It is better to include the definitions of Knowledge Capture, Creation, Sharing and Application under the section of Literature Review rather than Introduction part.

Lau Hei Tung Herbert: The concepts of knowledge management are well defined but it should be organized more effectively. It is because the literature Review has the details of those concepts.

What is electronic communication forum? Does the unit really need this forum since it has an intranet already --[[User:Au Sze Wah|Au Sze Wah]] ([[User talk:Au Sze Wah|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Au Sze Wah|contribs]]) 11:57, 25 April 2012 (UTC)

Chiu Pui Lai: You may further explain why Knowledge Creation is not active in Library A as Library A has implemented KM for 10 years and there 're a number of sharing opportunites provided. There're must some reasons behind that you can focus on and elaborate more, it may be related to the sharing culture or KM strategies etc.

Yuen Tung Ki: some of the Literature Review seem to be personal opinion. Overall, the recommendation part is good with LR support.


Kwok Pak Lun: The definition of KM activities (e.g. Knowledge Creation, Knowledge Capture) are well defined. For easy understand, the recommendation is preferred to structure based on the analysis.

The purpose of this research is to analyze how KM is implemented. KM strategies, organizational culture and KM metrics are considered to examine the operations in dealing with career resources in a higher education institution (named as ‘C&amp;P department in institution X’ for reference) in Asia. Relevant data has been gathered through conducting interviews with director and staff. The findings indicate that the institution has a strong demand for knowledge sharing, in which a network filing system can be used to share important data within the organization. However, improvement in KM application can be seen as for having limited structural KM system embodied in the institution. Also, housekeeping can be further enhanced and more encouragement can facilitate higher level of sharing culture. It is recommended that the institution can enhance their knowledge management by using different KM strategies and tools together with interactive features, in order to reinforce existing platforms for more collaboration and more rapid sharing of career resources.



== &lt;u&gt;'''Introduction'''&lt;/u&gt; ==


===='''Background'''====

Recently, there has been growing awareness in KM in higher education. KM Team in libraries is one of the common departments, which starts adopting KM in the very first beginning. The implementation of knowledge management is now well established in some organizations like Ernst &amp; Young (EY) and Langham Place Hotel. These successful KM implementations have brought various benefits towards the companies through appropriate KM strategies and metrics.
 
As Rumizen (2002) pointed out that people tend to be inactive in receiving others’ sharing rather than giving feedback. As a result, this may discourage the initiative of sharing, and hence is one of the reluctances of knowledge exchange. Undoubtedly, organizational culture largely influences the degree of knowledge sharing. In the institution we interviewed, there is lacking of tools and incentives to support sharing culture. Therefore, employees are indifferent to participate in sharing. Besides, the opportunity to gather all staff together is little due to complexity within the department. 

It is suggested that Web 2.0 technologies can enhance the organizational culture. Web 2.0 facilitates participatory sharing, allowing information shared from different information providers. Though there are many researches regarding to the application of KM in commercial companies, application of KM in higher education institution, using Web 2.0 technologies are rarely investigated for this domain.



===='''Aims of study'''====

Since KM has been neglected in certain organizations, the institution is a case in point which has been investigated in this study. C&amp;P department is one of the departments in institution X, which engages in generating and handling tremendous information in daily operation. The professional knowledge of advisors which is one of the major knowledge needs to be captured and shared. Although the nature of the department is certainly to deal with knowledge and sharing is weighted as the important culture. However, the existing approaches do not embody a full picture of KM models for implementation, which may affect its accessibility and efficiency in terms of connecting people, KM system and evaluation of working process.
 
Therefore, this report aims at conducting an in-depth analysis on knowledge management practice on career resources in a well-known higher education institution in Asia, in order to evaluate the comprehensiveness and maturity of KM application within this department. It is undoubtedly that what they are doing is totally relevant to KM that knowledge sharing is a significant issue, which can be used to facilitate their work. Therefore, it is worth for spending effort and time to examine the application of KM in C&amp;P because of its job nature which is closely related to knowledge capture, exchange and preservation and they may have significant impact on the working process in C&amp;P. Last but not least, this report investigates the capability of technological innovations in university departments, which can facilitate a two-way knowledge exchange approach in order to meet a higher degree of knowledge sharing.


 
== &lt;u&gt;'''Literature review'''&lt;/u&gt; ==

Considering job nature of C&amp;P department, services provided are their main duties. Attitude of staff, level of collaboration between staff, use of latest information technology and adoption of knowledge management are factors affecting their performance. Therefore, references are sourced in these 4 aspects, including individual’s perception, organizational practices, technology, and implementation of knowledge management.



===='''Individual’s perception towards knowledge sharing'''====

Many people nowadays tend to keep their knowledge to themselves and rarely share with others. This is illustrated by Collison &amp; Parcell (2004) that people are afraid of allowing others know what they possess because competitive advantages may be lowered if others also share the same knowledge as theirs. Besides, according to Dalkir (2005), employees are reluctant to share their experiences with fellow colleagues and their counterparts for the reason that employees regard their own knowledge as assets. As a result, for the matter of knowledge sharing, people are generally not willing to circulate their explicit materials and tacit knowledge.  
 
Mayfield and Mayfield (2012) illustrated that feedback is important when experiences are shared within a community. However, Rumizen (2002) pointed out that most people only gather others’ sharing but seldom give feedback, which frustrates those people who take initiative to share, discouraging sharing culture. Consequently, no feedback will be a barrier for people to share. Collison &amp; Parcell (2004) demonstrated one of the reasons why people are not eager to share is that people think they will lose their knowledge during the process of knowledge sharing. Hence, from these peoples’ perspective, they cannot get the tangible benefits when sharing their knowledge. However, Hercheui (2012) pointed out that change in behavior of people can be foster by using the KM tools in order to accelerate the spread of explicit and tacit knowledge. Therefore, these tools mainly online technology can change people perception towards knowledge privacy.  
 
From the above perspectives, it can be concluded that people nowadays are still reluctant to share and in turn this hinders the knowledge flow as well as block the knowledge management. Chen (2011) shared the same view because research conducted showed that there is a significant relationship between knowledge-sharing attitudes and knowledge-sharing intentions. Staff employed by the university departments may also have similar attitude towards knowledge sharing.



===='''Practices of organizational culture'''====

Dalkir (2005) stated that organizational culture can generate cross-individual behavioral consistency such as shared values and shared mental models. Moreover, open organizational culture facilitates knowledge sharing as well as forming communities of practices (Collison &amp; Parcell, 2004). Hence, employees, who are encouraged to share, are more engaged in knowledge sharing activities. Furthermore, Nola (2012) reflected that knowledge transfer and sharing could be facilitated by the well-established policies and sharing culture of an organization. Consequently, organizational culture no doubt largely influences degree of knowledge sharing.
 
Rumizen (2002) observed that even if there are perfect hardwares such as knowledge sharing tools, knowledge sharing would not be successful. It can be explained by that employees are indifferent to participate in sharing under the organizational culture that promotes individual success rather than team spirit as a whole. Apart from that, Harorimana (2010) argued that individual and organizational culture could co-exist. When individual culture is exaggeratedly stressed, conflicts may be easily found and harmony of the organization would be destroyed. In this way, team spirit and open organizational culture can make knowledge management outcomes more obvious.



===='''Interactive technological innovation on knowledge sharing'''====

''Tools'''

After Wang’s (2012) investigation on informational platforms for educational purpose, the barrier of knowledge sharing could be eased by collaborative and advanced technology. Concerning collaboration, Connolly, Gould, Baxter &amp; Hainey (2012) suggested using Web 2.0 technologies for vocational training environment, where learning management systems could be further utilized. Preference is given to interactive features of Web 2.0 technologies. On top of that, Sampson &amp; Zervas (2012) illustrated using mobile platform is considered to be more efficient than web-based alone, in terms of user accessibility. These two technological innovations facilitate better two-way knowledge exchange between students and institutions.

 
''Services''

Socially oriented principles should be followed in Web 2.0 (Knol et al., 2008). Examples can be found in enterprise search tools that intelligent search reduces deployment time, improving knowledge sharing efficiency (Ghani, Djordjevic &amp; Cumby, 2011). Multimedia content search in addition to traditional textual ones channels users to designated resources more effectively, matching with the principle that both tangible and intangible resources are directed towards the right projects and people (Mvungi &amp; Jay, 2009).

 
''Adoption in an organization''

Depending on organizational culture, application of knowledge sharing tools may vary, resulting in benefits ranging from technology enhancement of existing platform to more unbounded collaboration (Bebensee, Helms &amp; Spruit, 2011). Web 2.0 is in a position bonding individuals in an organization more closely, which allows higher degree of knowledge sharing that everyone in it can contribute and add value to the system (Levy, 2009).



===='''KM in Higher Education'''====

According to Bridgstock (2009), the application of KM to the career center of the university can enhance and facilitate the employability in tertiary students because the self-management and career establishment skills can be transmitted to the graduates effectively if the KM is well implemented to the career center. Apart from that, based on Lamont (2011), after carrying out the KM, admission department in the university becomes one very process-intensive for the reason that large amount of information is well organized and the tacit knowledge of staff are also monitored through using the method of knowledge mapping so that the expertise of the staff are fully utilized. Apart from that tertiary students could get more diverse employment information when the University’ career center employed the Knowledge Management because of the fact that employment student advisers with various background expertise (for example business and social sciences) could give professional advice for the students from different faculties and disciplines (KM 2002 workshops targets decision-makers and beginners, 2002).
 
Besides, Ngulube and Mngadi (2009) stated that social interaction and knowledge sharing can be facilitated by the Communities of Practice (CoP) at the University of KwaZulu-Natal and the University of Zululand but policy of Cop is needed in order to enhance the efficiency of KM implementation. Furthermore, by implementing the Knowledge management, various explicit knowledge is captured and tacit knowledge is codified into documents so complete learning resources can be provided to students.  In the Higher Education in Britain, distance learning is greatly promoted because knowledge management helps to collect suitable information and knowledge to the learners (Open Text to provide Livelink to the UK academic community, 2002). 
 
Although there are articles regarding to the commercial organizational culture, the university departments’ cultures with the use of online platform, particularly Web 2.0 are rarely investigated. Hence, it is worth to spend time research this area.


 
== &lt;u&gt;'''Methodology'''&lt;/u&gt; ==

The source and data of this research report collected can be divided into two types, primary and secondary resources.


===='''Primary Research Resources'''====


''Interview''

An one-hour interview was conducted in March 2012 with Director and Student Advisor of C&amp;P. Notes and tape-record were made for the entire interview. The interview provided original resources, which show the real practices of implementing KM within the C&amp;P in terms of strategies, tools and metrics. This useful information illustrates a whole picture of the level of application of KM concept in a department within a university including the processes of capturing knowledge (tacit knowledge), documenting knowledge (explicit knowledge) as well as the KM tools which was being used in the department and how they were used to facilitate the knowledge sharing and meet the objectives of the department. The above data was gathered and analyzed with the findings (gaps) discovered from the literature review.
Since there was only one interview being conducted, the limitation of time has restricted the scope of our research that observation of C&amp;P’s working processes cannot be done. Otherwise, more in depth information may be collected.


===='''Secondary Research Resources'''====

Apart from the primary resources, a range of secondary resources were selected, for instance, scholar journals, theses and books regarding to the application and development of knowledge sharing in different organizations and higher education. These reliable resources are published materials and provided by different databases vendors with high credibility and authority, for example, ProQuest, EBSCOhost and so forth.
 
Besides, documentations such as brochures, PowerPoint slides and other printed materials related to the intranet (network filing system) were given during the interview. Information distributed on C&amp;P website was also captured for our research needs. It indicates one of the ways that C&amp;P keeps their information for open access.


 
== &lt;u&gt;'''Application of Knowledge Management'''&lt;/u&gt; ==

The application of KM in C&amp;P will be elaborated in details according to Dalkir’s (2005) integrated KM cycle model, which suggests that the KM processes should include creation, capture, sharing and dissemination, and acquisition and application.


===='''Knowledge creation'''====

C&amp;P generates a lot of new knowledge every day. Staff with different duties have different core functions and generate specific knowledge accordingly. For example, the Career Advisors who deal with students, they get the experience of handling the enquiries; also develop the expertise and skills to search related information in the knowledge base, so tacit knowledge is created. Then they input the enquiries and solutions to the knowledge base, so explicit knowledge is created. Take the staff that is responsible for organizing the workshops as another example; they need to find sources before giving speech to the audiences. Through referring to the best practices in career advising or listening to experienced colleagues, they get some new understanding or ideas about a specific subject, so tacit knowledge is generated. In addition, PowerPoint slides, worksheets, agendas and other useful resources are created by them for the workshop, so explicit knowledge is generated.


===='''Knowledge capture'''====

There are several methods for C&amp;P to capture and codify the tacit knowledge. They learn from history, learn from others, interview with partners and build a knowledge asset. If the department needs to organize similar activities, they will refer to and learn from the past experience. The department also learns from others, for example, the director regularly finds some information like the latest best practices in the foreign career advising industry, and then he tries to apply these practices in the department. Furthermore, the department captures tacit knowledge through interviews. It holds annual meetings with companies which have cooperated with them to organize activities, so the C&amp;P staff can get more ideas about the selection criteria, future plan or particular requirements of those companies. Last but not least, building a knowledge asset, the department has a central system that contains all important information that the staff has to know.
 
On the other hand, the department uses taxonomies to capture and codify the explicit knowledge. According to Rumizen (2002), taxonomy is a classification scheme that use for easy retrieval of specific information in a system. There are five layers in the hierarchical structure of filing system. Level 1 is the location of information; level 2 is the broadest term of information, and more specific information is in the subsequent levels. More details can be referred to Appendix I.


===='''Knowledge sharing and dissemination'''==== 

C&amp;P has regular meeting called ‘Work Coordination Meeting’ on weekly basis. In the meeting, the top management briefs upcoming activities in the coming two weeks. For example, there would be information about the venue, date and time, special arrangement of a recruitment talk. Staff is welcomed to raise any questions or topics that related to their works for further discussion. Open platform can be seen in the meetings. This kind of person-to-person interaction is a typical socialization style in an organization, which facilitates ‘Tacit-to-Tacit’ transformation of knowledge (Nonaka &amp;Takeuchi, 1995). Formal meeting is the most frequently used method for ‘Tacit-to-Tacit’ transformation of knowledge in the department. However, it is difficult to gather all staff sometimes, so the meeting cannot be held weekly.  A regular sharing practice might not be maintained since engaging all participants is necessary in knowledge sharing.
 
On the other hand, the department relies heavily on computer system to share knowledge among its staffs. The central system which stores all important information is the knowledge base and intranet of the department. It is accessible to staff only. Moreover, when the management gets useful information from recruitment fairs or conferences, they circulate the hard copy or send the soft copy through email to inform all staff. This practice allows as many staff engage as possible with the use of high-accessible platform.


===='''Knowledge acquisition and application'''==== 

There are two major types of knowledge application in C&amp;P, including Knowledge repositories / Electronic Performance Support System (EPSS) and Knowledge reuse. By definition, knowledge repository is an intranet platform that includes all the tacit and explicit knowledge of an organization which is collected from the experience and practices of staff (Dalkir, 2005). C&amp;P has set up a knowledge-based system which keeps all the knowledge like best practices in career advising, records of recruitment talks and student feedback records and analysis. It is regarded as an intranet. According to Bokhari and Poehlman (2003), Electronic Performance Support System (EPSS) is an electronic construction that uses to capture, store and disseminate the knowledge asset of individual or collective efforts. It helps the staff to work efficiently and effectively. The system assists in preserving the organizational knowledge asset, and improves the working performance and efficiency of the staff. For instance, Career Advisors can find relevant information in the system quickly and provide satisfactory answer to enquirers.

In addition, the staff can reuse the knowledge that contained in the system for different purposes. For example, reuse the PowerPoint slides for similar workshops; reuse the ideas and concepts for department planning, etc.


===='''Organization culture'''====

Organization culture sometimes is known as corporate culture, meaning the people there share the same norms, values, attitudes, beliefs and paradigm (Sathe, V., 1983). Actually, the implementation of KM is closely related to it, particularly related to the knowledge-sharing culture and collaborative climate.


===='''Knowledge-sharing culture'''====

Dalkir (2005) stated that the knowledge-sharing culture is one where sharing knowledge became the norm of the organization, and collaboration among people is encouraged. Knowledge is shared through different channels such as knowledge repository, emails. C&amp;P does not have any incentive system like rewards to encourage sharing. Since the manager believes that knowledge sharing is part of the corporate culture, there is no need to promote the message of knowledge sharing through incentives. In fact, it requires staff to document all activities in daily operation and upload all relevant information to the system from time to time by following the established departmental policies for the purpose of effective knowledge dissemination and sharing among the staff.


===='''Collaborative climate'''====

Sveiby and Simons (2002) suggested the assessment of collaborative degree of an organization, can be treated as an indicator of effectiveness of knowledge management. Other than the core functions, individual staff is encouraged to have knowledge in other aspects. There is no formal training provided for them, however, through self-learning and communication with other colleagues, they are expected to have the knowledge in other aspects. Staff’s workloads vary in teams and periods, based on the actual needs of the department in a specific period of time that staff may be assigned to other team for extra support. For example, when Survey Team does not have much works to do, part of staff in the team will be assigned to help Workshop Team consequently. Moreover, the department has launched many collaborative projects, which involve cross-team collaboration.


 
== &lt;u&gt;'''Analysis of case'''&lt;/u&gt; ==

“In actual practice, we manage the knowledge every day according to the flow and process of KM models, but we don’t have a structural KM system.” said Director of C&amp;P. The concept of KM does exist in the department, but the implementation and formalization of KM has yet been fully actualized. To successfully carry out KM within an organization, three critical elements should be embraced that are people, process and technology, and the balance of these three issues will lead to the success of KM (Collison &amp; Parcell, 2004). In the case of C&amp;P, although the department does not have formal KM system, it does have enabling technologies and established policies and process for the sharing of corporate knowledge. Furthermore, people who know and those who need to know are brought together to share knowledge. However, the top-down approach of knowledge sharing adopted by C&amp;P might not be the best style for knowledge management based on the Nonaka-Takkeuchi Model (Nonaka &amp; Takeuchi, 1995). The down side of the top-down approach is that the extent of knowledge sharing will be limited since this typical management style often overlooks the voices of frontline staffs. Frontline staffs normally accept all the knowledge and views that top managers shared without raising objections or alternative opinions due to their weak puissance. As a result, top-down management style might become a bottleneck of knowledge sharing.    

 
===='''Technology'''====

In terms of technology, C&amp;P has set up a knowledge-based system which keeps all the tacit knowledge like best practices in careers advising, records of recruitment talks and students’ feedbacks on careers talks or fairs. The system does not only assist in preserving the organizational knowledge asset, but also help to improve the working performance and efficiency of the staffs. In addition, the system is regarded as an intranet that is the only channel for knowledge sharing besides email. Insufficient channel for sharing knowledge might lower the sharing atmosphere.

 
===='''Process'''====

From the process point of view, C&amp;P makes clear policies and procedures to ensure the knowledge management process can be executed in a smooth way. The department requires its staffs document all activities in daily operation and upload all relevant information to the system from time to time by following the established departmental policies for the purpose of effective knowledge transfer, learning and sharing among the staffs.

 
===='''People'''====

From the perspective of people issue, the team spirit and open organizational culture are the positive motivators for advocating knowledge sharing among the staffs. Nevertheless, the top-bottom approach of knowledge management in the Unit resulted in discouraging knowledge sharing atmosphere among the lower-level staffs. The lower-level staffs always are the receivers and listeners of the knowledge provided by the top-level staffs, but they may have lower degree of sharing about feedbacks and experiences to the top management due to the lack of sharing channels and tools. For example, the top-level staffs will circulate the best practices in careers advising in foreign countries to the lower-level staffs via email or the knowledge-based system, yet there is no sufficient channel for lower-level staffs to express their opinions in those best practices or share their personal experience in careers advising.  
 
Additionally, the department utilizes KM strategies in managing the organization’s knowledge such as continuous improvement in intranet and the advancement in working procedures. Also, metrics and assessments to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of the practice of KM within the department can be practiced as well. Practice of KM in C&amp;P can be done in a more comprehensive way on top of the existing proactive ones.


 
== &lt;u&gt;'''Recommendations'''&lt;/u&gt; ==

In order to advance the maturity of KM practice and culture in a careers advising department, developing KM strategies and relevant metrics will be the prior tasks to achieve better knowledge sharing. Moreover, the amelioration of knowledge sharing platform and KM style might make the department to practice KM well.  
 
C&amp;P is suggested to develop KM strategies, which start with identifying staff needs and issues within the department. Then, several initiatives can be considered to execute, for instance, formalize communities of practice, organize knowledge sharing lunch, implement coaching and mentoring programs, and implement team collaboration tools and processes (Robertson, 2004). Metrics can also be subsequently developed for measuring the progress of the implemented initiatives. Brown (2010) suggests that an effective metric should comprise 4 types of measures, which are awareness, behavior, outputs and outcomes (see Figure 1). An effective metric should put 60% of the weight on output or outcome measures and 40% on awareness or behavior measures. When developing a metric, the department should avoid focusing on the quantity of KM activities and practices, for instance count the number of KM meeting or CoP. On the contrary, the qualitative analysis of KM practices is the most meaningful thing of the metric. For measuring output or outcomes, the department could measure how many new ideas or recommendations on improving the quality of career services has developed, and the impacts of that new knowledge on the organizational performance such as the productivity of department as well. For measuring awareness or behavior, it could measure the engagement of the staffs in KM activities. The participation level helps to indicate the staffs’ contribution and enthusiasm on the department. Additionally, KM behavior measures should track the use of collaboration tools among the staffs (Brown, 2010).    

Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995) believe that effective knowledge sharing should involve both the top- and the lower-level employees. The top-down approach of knowledge management style in C&amp;P may not able to achieve the best sharing knowledge. As a result, the department is suggested to organize the bottom-top meetings for the lower-level staffs to raise suggestions to the top management. Apart from bottom-top meetings, forming a community of practice to gather different levels of staffs to share their experiences in careers advising can also strengthen the knowledge-sharing atmosphere within the department. 
 
To facilitate the communication and knowledge sharing, more communication platforms and tools are advised to practice. Web 2.0 technologies with interactive features such as Wiki and discussion forums help to make better two-way knowledge transfer, learning and sharing among staffs. It is believed that these kinds of platforms can enable and motivate the lower-level staffs to voice out their opinions easily, leading to activate knowledge-sharing culture. 


== &lt;u&gt;'''Conclusions'''&lt;/u&gt; ==

In conclusion, C&amp;P in accrual practice has applied the concept in terms of the flow and process of KM models with relevant information system. However, it can be observed that they may not have formal structural KM system. Surely, as the major target of C&amp;P is to meet their primary objectives including information keeping, activities documentation, and sharing of activity processes and knowledge for future use, the top-down approach acts as a guidance to lead the knowledge flow within the department. Such inactive sharing, however, has become one of the barriers in knowledge management. Nevertheless, the existing communication channels may not effectively facilitate the knowledge exchange among the staff in order to make the working process more efficient.
In fact, the general staff of C&amp;P, except senior staff, does not have a clear mind of KM application because of the implication of top-down approach. Since the existing knowledge management system in C&amp;P is established, it will be an added value for the department to improve their KM application in various aspects, for instance, forming a Community of Practice, and making good use of Web 2.0 in order to encourage higher level and degree of sharing culture, which is one of the important elements in success of KM implementation.

Kwok Pak Lun: The case study structured a lot of references to support the ideas which can be foreseen that the recommendations can mostly adopted by the department. It would be great if the writers can provided the feedback from the investigated department and state the limitation for their case study.

== Abstract ==

With the great improvement in efficiency and effectiveness towards the organizational performance, more organizations become increasingly aware that knowledge is their most valuable strategic assets and engage in developing knowledge management within their organizations. Based on an exploratory study of KM practices, this chapter will be focused on analyzing the application of Knowledge Management (KM) in the counseling unit in a tertiary institution. This chapter mainly provides a conceptual framework on how the KM strategies and tools are employed in the unit so as to help manage its knowledgeable resources. By considering the challenges encountered by the unit, the chapter will suggest some KM tools and strategies to cope with it. Further development trend in counseling industry and its feasibility will also be discussed in this chapter to grasp the idea of building and nurturing the knowledge sharing culture within the supporting unit.

== Introduction ==

This paper examines the current status of knowledge management and reviews the highlighted features of the traditional theory, definition and concepts, strategies and tools that involved in knowledge management in the departments of universities. Through conducting the research and doing the analysis on the key concepts of Knowledge Management, several phrases are identified which are Knowledge capture and codification, Knowledge sharing and dissemination and Knowledge creation. Benefits and shortcomings of the application of Knowledge Management in departments will also be summarized in this paper to obtain a clear picture on how Knowledge Management helps organize its knowledgeable resources effectively.

== Literature Review ==

The purpose of this literature review is to provide an overview of available publications investigating the theory and the application of knowledge management in both consulting industry and tertiary institutions. 

=== Knowledge Management ===
Sporleder and Moss (2002) defined KM as an integrated approach to identifying, creating, managing, sharing, and exploiting all information and knowledge assets of an organization. Later Dalkir (2011) further studied over a hundred published definitions of knowledge management and introduced ‘’knowledge management from the cognitive science or knowledge science perspective: Knowledge-the insights, understandings, and practical know-how that we all possess- is the fundamental resource that allows us to function intelligently’’ (p.6). 

=== Knowledge Creation ===
Nonaka and Takeuchi (1995) defined that there are two dimensions of knowledge: tacit and explicit and brought its importance to organizational attention. Tacit knowledge is embedded in the expertise and experience of individuals and groups, not yet explicated (Leonard and Sensiper, 1998). Explicit knowledge is created in organisational rules, routines, and procedures so as to improve the efficiency. In Nonaka’s Model, it suggested that the key to knowledge creation lies in four forms of knowledge conversion. They are socialization, externalization, internalization and combination respectively.

=== Knowledge Capture and Codification ===
Knowledge capture and codification is an important process to an organization since learners can internalize the others’ knowledge and construct new form of knowledge. The knowledge generated from the interaction between the learners should be captured, stored and reused in order to maximize knowledge construction. Barchan (1999) suggested that six conditions, which are maintaining an open dialogue, sharing values, keeping knowledge flowing, embracing flexibility, building trust and surrounding with the right people, to enhance the knowledge capture among the whole organization. After capturing the knowledge, appropriate knowledge codification is needed to store the knowledge systematically. Janicot and Mignon (2012) proposed a model of the service’s time value and cognitive value, assessed through the integrative and interactive ITs used as a channel for codification. Time value refers to the time saved by using organizations’ cognitive resources. Cognitive value is regarded as the enhancement of quality and ability to indicate their competitive advantages to clients as a result of leveraging knowledge. Integrative technology means disseminating knowledge through database and interactive technology develops workplaces for sharing. Through this model, the methods utilized by the organization can be evaluated and spaces can be spot for improvement.

Knowledge SharingManagement consulting is an industry whose core product is knowledge itself. Managing knowledge is the most critical process in the consulting industry. (Sarvary, 1999) Hansen, Nohria and Tierney (1999) identify that there are two different knowledge management strategies employed by the consulting businesses which are codification strategy and personalization strategy respectively, as shown in Table 1.
Codification Strategy refers to the “strategy centres on the computer” in which the knowledge is being codified and stored in the designated databases. This allows the staff within the company can easily access and use the knowledge stored in the databases and encourages the reusability of knowledge in a large scale.
Personalization Strategy implies that “knowledge is closely tied to the person who developed it and is shared mainly through direct person-to-person contacts” such as face-to-face meetings, email, video conferences and telephone. This strategy focuses on communicating knowledge among people, not storing knowledge. The choice of KM strategy depends on the way the company serves its clients, the economies of its business, and the people it hires. Hansen, Nohria and Tierney (1999) also found that effective firms excelled by focusing on one of the strategies and using the other one in a supporting role. (Roughly an 80-20 split)


Knowledge Management MetricsKM Metrics is used to assess the effectiveness of KM strategies and applications. KM strategy should include the assessment framework that will be used to monitor progress toward and successful attainment of the targeted KM objectives and initiatives. (Dalkir 2005 p.268) There are several KM measurement techniques that can help assess how well an organization is progressing. For example, Benchmarking method is the search of industry-wide best practices that can lead to superior performance. It usually consists of a study of similar companies to determine how things are done best in order to adapt these methods for their own use. (Dalkir 2005, p.272) Besides, Balanced Scorecard Method provides feedback on both internal business process and external outcomes in order to continuously improve strategic performance and results. The result enables us to clarify the vision and the strategy and to translate them into action. (p.275) Moreover, there are four types of measures : Awareness, Behavior, Outputs and Outcomes (Brown, 2010). Awareness refers to whether we have the knowledge of what to document, how to document it, how to access KM databases. Behavior refers to whether the participation in KM activities is high or low to indicate high-level participation in key meeting. Outputs refer to whether there is any databases, white papers, lessons learned reports, best practice documentation. Outcomes refer to whether the impact of new knowledge on key measures of organizational performance is big or not.

=== KM Strategies and Tools ===
KM systems are usually designed to integrate the knowledge process into work processes. (Labedz, 2011) eGain® Service™ is a concrete example that is used to integrate knowledge management with customer relationship and services. Many companies such as HMV in Canada, WebCentre and Business Evolution’s @Once Service Centre used eGain to manage numerous daily e-mails to maintain customer relationships by learning customer knowledge management technique. Another one is WebFOCUS from Information Builders Inc. (ibi.com), which was being used by several higher education organizations including the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board. (Lamont, 2011) Besides, YELLOW PAGES, which is a Web 2.0 tool, helps people within the organization to locate the person who possesses the expertise in solving a particular problem. (Rumizen, 2002) Recently, a more interactive Q&amp;A system is launched which allow users to ask questions and the system will response directly to the users with solutions provided. (Iske and Willem, 2005)
Carleton (2011) added that the organizational culture is important in nurturing KM. Many organizations like the World Bank and UN has used km4dev as a form of community of practice (CoP) to promote knowledge sharing. (KM4DevWiki, 2006) Nevertheless, some staff may be reluctant to share their individual knowledge in order to maintain their position. Amar (2004) suggested using people-oriented strategies to solve the case. This strategy focuses on encouraging the younger generation or new comers of the organization to share their own knowledge in order to create a knowledge sharing atmosphere. He also suggested the psychological driver like money incentive can also be a driven force in initiating KM.


Moreover, knowledge map is introduced as a tool to display internal members and their impact in terms of know-how, expertise and relational intelligent capital(IC) on the firm’s value chain. Here is a typical example of a knowledge map in SME with technical staffs and sales. The different activities of the firm are represented by oval shapes. Relevant activity coming from outside the firm is shown as a dashed oval shape.A – Head of Department – Process PlanningB – Group Leader – Electrical EngineeringD – Group Leader – Prototype AssemblyE – Managing Director – SalesF – Managing Director – Production and PurchasingG – Managing Director – Research &amp; DevelopmentAssistant – Assistant of GCNC – CNC ProgrammerBy locating the central expertise and skills held by a few members of staff, which the department highly dependent on, managers can understand the reason of the organization’s success. Moreover, the map allows information gathered about the types of knowledge that exist in the firm, enabling the managers to identify the areas where knowledge gaps may need to be filled. It therefore can be a guide for knowledge management for locating what to capture and know-who, which can be an initiative of further strategic moves on knowledge capturing.

To due with knowledge drain, structure interview can be arranged to the staff in order to produce a record of their knowledge, whether in audio, video, electronic or paper media. It helps capturing tacit knowledge to tangible knowledge. Similar to our research method, this intangible knowledge will usually be converted to produce a transcript, which can be accessed by any other staffs later. Since structured knowledge would preferably be recorded down, structure interview is more likely to be conducted. This allows no flexibility. All questions are pre-established. Experts, who have similar preliminary knowledge, are recommended to be involved in the interview to ask technical questions. Right questions should be formulated and asked, here is some typical types of questions which may be possible to be applied in counseling services:
Type of questions	Example
Knowledge             	What information did you use in making this decision, and how was it obtained?
Standard scenarios    	Does this case fit a standard or typical scenario? Does it fit a scenario you were trained to deal with?
Aiding                	If the decision was not the best, what training, knowledge, or information could have led to a better choice?
Errors                	What mistakes are likely to occur at this point? Did you acknowledge you’re your situation assessment or option selection could have been incorrect? How might a novice have acted or responded differently?



=== Challenges of KM in tertiary institutions ===
During the implementation of knowledge management in a tertiary institution, various difficulties may be encountered by the staff. Ian Caddy (2001) identifies some possible challenges in the implementation process. For example, staff in the organization may not know the existence of knowledge which has been stored in the database. Similarly, Frank McKenna (1997) also pointed out that some of the staff may not be familiar with the usage of software. This may lead to ineffective application of knowledge management. Another possible challenge may be the privacy and security problems against the information and knowledge stored in the database. Brankovic and Castro stated that there may be a risk of potential misuses from unauthorized tapping into the database and then retrieve the private information.Besides, Birkinshaw (2001) declared that many organizations actually managed their own knowledge through informal networks. In order to do it better, it “involves not only developing new tools, but alsoeliminating old ways of working”. As a result, it is difficult to change its culture which involves fundamental changesto people’s behaviour, and it typically takes many yearsto bring about.



=== Further development trend for knowledge management ===
Peng (2007) mentioned that people, technology and process are three key issues in KM research in 1990s. He suggested that the future of KM development should focus on a better integration of the common business processes, a concentration on the human-organization-interface and a better match of IT-aspects to human factors. With similar ideas, Holtshouse (2007) pointed out that raising the value of work, advancing workplace performance, reducing and streamlining work complexity and early detection of emerging market changes or disruptions should be the aims for the further development of KM.Besides, Kim (2007) also has an idea of having a better match of IT-aspects to human factors. He emphasized the linkage between information technology (IT) and knowledge management (KM). Kim (2007) criticized that many consulting firms only make use of some basic IT tools including email and search engines since they do not require much advanced knowledge for usage. It is suggested that managers should focus more on the matching of KM models and IT capability in order to maximize the benefits.Moreover, further development of KM can be done by combining theories together. Whelan et al. (2011) stressed on the superior benefits gained by combining talent management (TM) and knowledge management (KM) together. This demonstrates how TM can assist the implementation of KM throughout the KM life cycle. It includes knowledge talent identification, knowledge creation, knowledge sharing and positioning, knowledge competencies and knowledge retention. Whelan et al. (2011) suggested that the knowledge sharing of the top performing knowledge workers is the key to enhance the overall organizational performance and it is significant for the further development of KM within an organization.

== Methodology ==

Our research objective is to investigate what kinds of knowledge management activities have been implemented in the selected counseling unit. Firstly, qualitative approach was used to analyze the data collected from different sources such as in-depth interviews, books, journals and websites. Secondly, semi-structured interviews with the director of the unit will be also conducted so as to gather useful information. Four types of questions were asked to collect the information we need. They are simple fact, open-ended, judgment and comparison of fact questions respectively. Thirdly, we will analyze the information gathered from the interviews and summarize it findings discovered from books, journals and other sources.

== Case Study of the Counselling Unit ==
Our group has interviewed the director of the counselling unit, which has around fifteen to twenty professional staff and a number of officers. Some information that is relevant to our study is shown as follows:

=== Application of KM Strategies and Tools ===
==== Meeting ====
Two types of regular meetings are held to facilitate the knowledge sharing within the team. One is the 1-hour professional meeting which often holds every week. Counsellors and clinical psychologists are grouped together to review new cases during the week. They can freely express their opinions towards the cases or the problems they came across in order to provide better services for the students. Another type of meeting which mainly discusses its direction and daily operation usually holds once a month. Moreover, the director of the unit will visit each professional staff once a month so that the director can perceive their individual needs.
 
==== Internal Operational Guidelines ====
It has its own internal operational guidelines to ensure that the employees be aware and comply with the policies and working procedures to avoid any leakage of the private information.
 
==== Communicational Channels ====
Its major communication channel is email which mainly uses for transmitting the information about the daily operation or the problems encountered by the staff. However, they rarely use email for transmitting the case information between the staff since they are aware of the confidentiality of the collected data.
 
==== Information Search ====
The unit would prefer searching the information online through some search engines like Google rather than constructing its own online database. The staff will also search some journal articles and books through the libraries to enrich their knowledge on particular issues. They may also join as a member of The Hong Kong Psychological Society and refer to the postings on its forum to get more information.

==== Ways to evaluate and ensure the quality of service ====
Regarding quality control of services provided, there are four kinds of methods to evaluate the quality which are using the evaluation forms, managing complaints, supervising the performance of the employees and meeting with the staff regularly.
 
==== Evaluation form ====
The unit has prepared some evaluation forms and distributes them after each workshop completed. Students are required to complete the form and express their opinions towards the workshops.Based on the evaluation forms collected from the students, the staff will analyse the feedback from students and prepare a report to be submitted to the Personal Development and Counselling committee as a reference.
 
==== Complaints Received ====
The director suggested that managing the complaints received from students can be one of the indicators to spot out the problems in the unit and helps improve its operational efficiency.
 
==== Supervision ====
Supervising the performance of employees is a usual practice to ensure the quality of services provided. All the staff will be asked to attend several training or workshops each year to improve their capability on work. Besides, referential books will also be bought to enrich the knowledge they have.
 
 
==== Regular Meetings ====
In order to get familiar with each employee, the supervisors need to meet each staff individually to discuss about their case load or any problems they came across so as to ensure the quality of their performance.

=== Ways to manage information ===
 
==== Evaluation Forms ====
All evaluation forms received from the students are organized in statistics and saved as excel files.

==== Counseling Data ====
The data collected from students will be classified into three categories. They are problem areas and issues, demographic characteristics and statistics. They will then be stored in the database and share among the staff.

==== Details of Personal Enrichment Programmes ====
Students can retrieve the detailed information of the programmes through the leaflets or booklets printed by the unit as well as its web page. Some reference materials like time management tips can be retrieved from its website. E-learning platform is provided to allow students to acquire knowledge. On the other hand, the materials like Powerpoint slides presented in the programmes will be stored within  its own repositories.

== Findings and Analysis ==

=== Background of Implementing KM ===
This counselling unit aims at empowering the students to build up their own character and strengths. It also encourages the students to maintain a satisfying and psychologically healthy life. In order to help them develop a positive attitude towards life and contribute to the communities, the director of the unit believes that knowledge management is a way to achieve the goals.
Knowledge Creation
Knowledge Creation refers to the continuous process of new ideas through interactions between explicit and tacit knowledge between individuals. Through handling the complaints and evaluation forms received from the students, knowledge is created since the students’ comments are collected and being used to analyze their needs. Besides, the unit also offers different kinds of workshops and programmes to the students which stimulates the knowledge creation by lectures, storytelling or video shows. Apart from this, community of practice and experience sharing are introduced to support the knowledge creation within the unit. 

=== Knowledge Capture and Codification ===
Knowledge capture refers to the process of retrieving knowledge resides within people, artifacts or organizational entities. As mentioned by Barchan, there are six conditions that must exist if leaders want to foster learning, generate new knowledge and capture that knowledge to benefit the organization. They are maintaining an open dialogue, sharing values, keeping mobile knowledge, embracing flexibility, building trust and surrounding yourself with the right people. As regards maintaining an open dialogue, employees in the unit have enough opportunities to contribute their opinions and suggestions through regular meetings. Monthly meetings can help tracking all employees to follow the core values of the unit in order to drives a consistent and long-lasting operation.Information and knowledge can be captured by employees through a variety means which facilitates the mobility of the knowledge flow, i.e. share folders. They are also encouraged to join workshops which broaden their horizons to other fields of counselling service. The employees work as a team with common aims nurtures a knowledge sharing culture which facilitates knowledge capturing a lot. 
From the Janicot and Mignon’s model, time value and cognitive value are the indicator to evaluate the knowledge codification methods. The counselling unit makes use of shared folders, particular database and electronic case files. Stored past cases, workshop materials and statistics of the counselling cases can be used to evaluate the quality of service which reaches high cognitive value.
==== Possible Challenges and Solutions ====
As regards the time value of the enquiries services, there may be a challenge of the staff to answer ad hoc questions. In case there is a student asking questions about the programs of the person enrichment workshop, they need to find out the answers from the leaflets and the website of the unit which is time-consuming. To due with this problem, an interactive Q&amp;A system mentioned by Iske and Willem can be launched which allows the staff to type in the enquiries and the system will response directly to them with solutions provided.

Besides, since the counseling unit is relying heavily on tacit-to-tacit knowledge sharing, valuable tacit knowledge may not be retained completely. In addition, due to the high turnover rate of the professionals, knowledge drain may be aggravated. Arranging structure interview for the leaving staff can mitigate this potential problem by capturing the tacit knowledge from them into explicit documents.

=== Knowledge Sharing and Dissemination ===
Since this supporting unit regards “knowledge” as the core asset of the unit, it applied both “Personalization Strategy” and “Codification Strategy” to retain the valuable and useful knowledge.

==== Personalization Strategy ====
The director of the unit plays an essential role in promoting the sharing atmosphere within the team. Meetings are held to facilitate the knowledge sharing within the team. Opportunities are given to the counsellors and clinical psychologists to freely share their opinions towards the cases or the problems they came across. It is a kind of knowledge exchange from person to person. Apart from the meetings aforementioned, as the unit only comprises of twelve to fifteen professional staff, it is easy for them to gather together at lunch time and discusses the problems they have encountered. They can also simply send an email to transmit the information about the daily operation and share with one another. They are also a kind of socialization in which the tacit knowledge is shared via social interactions. 

==== Codification Strategy ====
“Knowledge repository” is being used by the unit which can enable multiple users commonly share the resources together. The formal internal knowledge such as the internal operational guidelines, counselling data, student information and training materials is being codified and stored in the designated databases for the staff to access and use. This can facilitate the search and retrieval of the relevant data by the staff. Personal tacit knowledge is converted into the form of explicit knowledge and shared. Explicit to Tacit knowledge conversion is also involved in this case since the staff can make use of existing knowledge codified and internalizes others’ shared experience in problem-solving.
Besides, with reference to the collected counselling data and student information, the data collected from students will be classified into three categories. They are problem areas and issues, demographic characteristics and statistics. They will then be stored in the database and share among the staff. This can show us that the discrete pieces of explicit knowledge is being recombined and converted into a new form of explicit knowledge like report and statistics and shared in the database.

==== Possible Challenges and Solutions ====
After analysing the knowledge sharing system in the counseling unit, there may be a lack of systematical storage of specific knowledge. As mentioned by the director, some of the counselors have their own specialties like Developmental Dyslexia and they possess their own particular collections in their rooms. The unit may suffer a great loss of knowledge in particular fields if the specialties are gone with the counselors.  Thus, a regular storytelling held by the counselors is suggested to fill in this knowledge gap among them.

Moreover, it may not be sufficient for the counseling units to share the information with other units in their department only once a month. The director mentioned that the departments are not frequently interacted with each other, instead of when holding a big project together. Knowledge map is suggested to be implemented so as to allow the staff in the units and also the outsiders especially the students understand their scope of management.

=== KM Metrics ===
KM Metrics is used to assess the effectiveness of KM strategies and applications. KM strategies should include some assessment framework to monitor the process of the KM applications so that the target of the KM strategy can be accomplished. As for the unit, there are internal organizational guidelines and crisis guidelines explicitly outlining the working process for the new staff. The experienced staff will supervise the newly employed staff’s performance. Moreover, PRSD, which is a kind of appraisal form, is used as an assessment framework to monitor the employee’ progress. The unit also establishes some evaluation forms to collect feedback from the students in order to further improve its performance. The unit also produces both qualitative and quantitative figures and statistics regularly in terms of the problem areas, faculty, sex etc. With the aids of the reports, the staff may find out what problem is frequently encountered by students and do the corresponding actions.

According to Brown, there are four types of measures for the KM metrics. They are Awareness, Behaviour, Outputs and Outcomes respectively.

==== Awareness ====
The unit has a systematic way to organize the documents. Their documents are divided into 3 categories which are counselling data, case notes and training materials. They have a separated database to store the counselling data which contain the client personal information. The case notes are stored in case file and the files are organized in a systematic way. The training materials are stored in a shared folder in the intranet and particular staff can access it providing he has the access right.

==== Behavior ====
Meeting is the main communication channel used by the unit. It conducts regular meeting once a month to discuss about the main goal of the unit. Some meeting held once a week for the senior staff to review the cases in the past week. Moreover, the director of this unit will visit each senior staff office to have an informal meeting. The top manager frequently participates in different meeting, which enhance the knowledge sharing, hence it can help documentation of valuable knowledge that currently only resides in senior employees' heads, and minimizing the impact of valuable employees retiring or quitting by first documenting what they know and have learned over the years.

==== Output ====
It is seldom to form some lessons learned report within the unit but they can shared their experience in any meeting freely. For example, they will send a staff as a representative of the unit when there is a big function like Orientation to join the representatives of other departments and form a group. This staff will share his or her experience in the regular meeting.

==== Outcomes ====
It does not have any key measure like sales and cost reduction. By improving the processes, this helps save the cost and improve the productivity of the unit.

=== Future Development of KM in Counselling Service ===
In the literature review and case learned, the success of knowledge management is not just dependent on organizational culture like staff leadership but also on the general fiscal climate which may affect the implementation of the technology that support KM. A concrete financial support is the first priority in consideration to continue the activation of the knowledge sharing culture in the future KM development.
The competing demands and budgetary constraints experienced by this counseling department shows that the knowledge management is not a new initiative, but as a reframing of information sharing and evidence-informed decision making. Still, patience is needed to let the developmental process of knowledge management.
Knowledge management needs a permanent supporter who believes in the positive changes that KM will bring. Hiring a particular knowledge manager, the whole student resources centre of university including counseling part will be overlooked on knowledge practices. He/She may be retrospectively see what has been accomplished and the future needs that remain to be addressed as management always has space to be improved.
Furthermore, the term “professional” should not be a box limiting the sharing of knowledge. The current turnover rate of professional may be an opportunity for recruiting new staff with common value in knowledge practices. The talent and willingness of working in collaborative environment of psychological expertise as well as other professional discipline would be the basic requirement in this knowledge age.
Last but not least, it is important to have an ideal but also work hard toward the next best approach when current KM strategies are not sustainable for current circumstance, since knowledge management model needs to be flexible to accommodate rapid change under the information age. The upcoming development will be perhaps focusing on the sustainability of current approaches on KM as well as innovation strategies in foreseeable prospect.

== Conclusion ==

All in all, knowledge management tools and strategy can undoubtedly bring benefits to the counselling unit. The tacit knowledge can be captured in explicit form well and shared across the companies so that all staff can reach a certain standard of knowledge. The explicit knowledge can be managed more systematically and further enriched in the database. Therefore, it is a global trend to utilize KM tools and strategies properly in order to maximize the benefits. However, not all KM tools and strategies are suitable to every industry. Tailor-made KM tools and strategies are needed when the counselling unit applys those tools in order to match its cultures and usual practice. From the case study, we recognize that some common KM practices are not adopted by it as there are difficulties to tackle the privacy problem with high cost. However, in long run, the cost of the KM tools may be possibly declined due to a massive demand of them since they are getting more popular in this knowledge age.

== Comments ==
Please post your comments here.

Ma Yim Hing: The Literature Review is too long. And for the four types of measures of the KM metrics,it is better to provide some methods to evaluate the effectiveness of the KM applications in these 4 aspects instead of simply mention what does the department do in these aspects.


Stephanie Tsui: It would be better if a summary is added to Literature Review to provide a scope.


Lee Pui Yee, Wendy: For the Literature Review, it is better to add the rationale to further explain why this review has those sub-parts. Besides, the potential difficulties may be stated in the &quot;Future development of KM&quot; part. Recommendations may be added. 



Kwok Pak Lun: In the Future Development of KM in Counselling Service part, the writer stated the collaboration culture should be developed in the department. However, there are no concrete suggestion for how to develop the collaboration culture. The writer may consider to add more concrete solutions or practices to help improve the development of KM in the department.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Abstract==

This case study aims to investigate the knowledge management (KM) practices in a department of a university in Asia, which offers general education to students, and provide advices for improvement.
According to the literature, KM is has been implementing in business world, however, the success of KM in higher education field is still under determined. To investigate the effectiveness of KM in the department, the integrated knowledge management cycle is used to construct the current view of KM. Furthermore, KM metric and G-KMMM are applied to address the Key Process Areas, namely people, process and technology that can be improved. The finding also implicates those Key Process Areas are co-related with each other. What’s more, the maturity assessment shows the department was at initial stage and the infrastructures and strategies were not be able to facilitate the capturing and sharing of knowledge in the department.
In the recommendation session, room for improvement is identified. Recommendation, including the application of KM strategies, KM technologies, and culture, are given based on the process, technology and people aspect of KM development in the department respectively. However, this study only focuses on how KM can be implemented by different tools in a higher education environment but does not cover the long term KM performance in the department. It is recommended more studies should be conducted to investigate how KM can affect the organization’s long term performance.


==Introduction==

With increasing amount of organizations notice the significance of their labor force’s knowledge, as assets leveraging competitive advantage (Drucker, 1999), this gives rise to the emergence of Knowledge Management (KM). While Knowledge Management aims to develop strategies for organizations to manage the knowledge creation, sharing and application, it enables them to reach their organizational goals more efficiently and effectively (Dalkir, 2005).
A literature research reveals a number of publications targeting knowledge management in higher education institutions which is for educational purposes (Metcalfe, 2006; McCarthy, 2006). However, there is a lack of research focusing on the possibility of implementing KM within higher education institutions in a department scale, and how KM implementation could help these departments to share and disseminate knowledge, not only to its external customers, but also its internal staffs.
There is where this research joins in. This particular field of KM is explored by conducting interviews and surveys in a department which is responsible for providing general education to students in a university in Asia. This research would like to shed light on the following research questions:
How knowledge management can help sustaining knowledge within a small size department with minimum resources? What knowledge management approaches can facilitate maximum efficiency and effectiveness in knowledge sharing, so knowledge can reach as much audience with a limited resource?
The investigated department is very small. It serves the whole university by limited resource. Knowledge management thus becomes a significant and useful tool in enabling effective knowledge sharing. While in this research, questions above are addressed by two steps: 1) Evaluate its current KM implementation level; 2) Spot out the problems and give constructive suggestions.


==Background of the department==

In 1995, a university in Asia established a department that aims to provide whole-person education to students. It is a small department with a high turnover rate. In 2012, there are only 8 staff in total. The department operates in Person-In-Charge (PIC) approach and staff work as project-based. The job role can be summarized into three categories: Director, PIC and Organizing Committee (OC).
:'''Director'''
::* Monitoring the progress of different events
::* Setting the directions and objectives of the upcoming academic year
::* Promoting sharing culture within the organization
:'''PIC'''
::* Making decisions for in-charged event
::* Planning workflow and distributing workload
::* Keeping track of progress of event in charged
:'''OC'''
::* Performing administrative task for the events
Each year, the department provides more than 40 programmes on a variety of topics. The programmes are in different formats such as seminars, workshops and field trips in order to stimulate students’ critical thinking.

==Literature Review==

===Introduction===

There has been arousing concerns about knowledge management in organizations. University, the place where knowledge is created, shared and used, put emphasis on this field. To investigate the knowledge management practice in the department that we concern, it is good that we understand knowledge management well beforehand. In this literature review, knowledge management is introduced with knowledge management cycle followed by the way of measuring knowledge management practice as well as the criteria for improvement. A knowledge collaboration platform for educational institutions, Integrated Knowledge Space (IKS), will also be introduced.

===Knowledge management and KM cycle===

Knowledge management, as defined by Teruya (2003), is the systematic process of identifying, capturing, and transferring information and knowledge held by an organization and its employees, and by doing so, the intrinsic value of knowledge can be leveraged and shared within the organization, and eventually, these value could foster competitiveness and innovation, and in turn, generate revenue (Curley, 2001; Dash, 1998; Hibbard, 1997).

To illustrate the process of knowledge management, a number of knowledge management cycles, which were built by different specialists, like Meyer &amp; Zack, Bukowitz &amp; Williams, McElroy and Wiig, have been introduced. To make it easier to understand, the integrated knowledge management cycle summarizes those cycles. There are 3 components in the integrated knowledge management cycle, namely knowledge capture and creation, knowledge sharing and dissemination, as well as knowledge acquisition and application (Gibran, 2005). For knowledge capture and creation, it is the process of recording and generating of new knowledge. For knowledge sharing and dissemination, it is the exchange of knowledge among people. Knowledge is personalized and distributed to the right persons. For knowledge acquisition and application, it is the process of identifying the relevant knowledge and developing systems to extract the knowledge followed by applying knowledge to suitable case and evaluating the outcome as well as learning from it (Pakirh, 2001).

There are four factors which facilitate the operation of KM cycle, namely KM strategy, KM metrics, technologies and KM team. First, developing a KM strategy is the first step to lead to information management success in an organization. The strategy should find out the problems that the organization is facing and come up with solutions to those problems (Robertson, 2004). The KM approach and prioritization of the alternatives which benefit the organization most should be identified (Dalkir, 2005). Second, since it is difficult to measure the performance of knowledge management, standardize metrics is needed to quantify the measure (Bose, 2004). Brown proposed KM metrics as the measurement for KM success. KM metrics are comprised of four measures which are awareness, behavior, outputs and outcomes (Brown, n.d.). Awareness refers to the organization’s knowledge of what and how to do concerning knowledge management. Behavior is people’s participation to the knowledge management activities. Outputs are the products of knowledge management practices. Outcomes bring impacts to the organization’s performance. Third, technologies help manage knowledge in the organization by acting as the medium for the flow of knowledge (Borghoff &amp; Pareschi, 1997). Fourth, KM team is a group of professionals with different skills, attributes and backgrounds who work together to enhance the knowledge management practice in an organization. A good KM team should have sound communication, leadership, KM tools, strategic planning, knowledge of the organization, connection with the top, systems view and risk taking preparation (Dalkir, 2005). The Integrated KM Cycle is operated in the culture, which is the external factor that affects its performance.

===Application of Knowledge management maturity model===

Pee and Kankanhalli proposed the General Knowledge Management Maturity Models (G-KMMM) based on the review of different Knowledge Management Maturity Models to guide and assess the progress of knowledge management in an organization (2009). Their investigation emphasized the importance of people, process and technology factors to knowledge management development. Their proposed model put KM maturity level of an organization into 5 categories, namely initial, aware, defined, managed and optimizing. Their KM maturity assessment instrument had been tested in a big university. Their empirical study demonstrated G-KMMM was a good assessment tools for KM development.

===Criteria for improvement of knowledge management practice===

KM enablers are the stimulate elements of KM. It refers to the building of an infrastructure that facilitates KM. It helps to maintain a sustainable and systematic development of organizational knowledge. Lee and Choi pointed out that the KM enablers could be classified according to the socio-technical theory (2000). They assumed that there were two types of interacting system in an organization, namely social system and technical system. Social system referred to people, organization structure and organization culture. Technical system included processes and technology. They believed that KM enablers were the significant predictors for non-financial performance of an organization. Further, Ho also introduced an explanation of the relationship between KM process indices and KM enablers in addition to the previous researches (2009). He brought up five types of enablers in KM, namely culture, information technology, evaluation, strategy and leadership, which is more comprehensive when compared with Lee and Choi’s study. In his finding, he discovered that KM enablers had positive relationship with KM process indices. However, there was no significant positive correlation between the number of employees and KM process performance indices. Those researches showed that KM enablers were important control keys in the planning stage of KM.

===Further KM development in Education – Integrated Knowledge Space (IKS)===

Knowledge management in educational institution is different from that in business organization. As mentioned by Chavez, knowledge management is not only about capturing, storing and sharing of knowledge, it should include the effectiveness of collaboration and the way to improve the entire knowledge sharing system (2011). Schrage defined collaboration as the process of interacting and sharing of understandings of the same objects among individuals (1990). This can be applied to the university. Some studies suggested that interdisciplinary and cross-department collaborations should be adopted in the platform in order to fully utilize the knowledge resource (Tikhomirov et al., 2009). In addition to above studies, Tikhomirov, Tikhomirova, Maksimova and Telnov suggested that this kind of collaboration activities could be extended to all educational institution and formed the Integrated Knowledge Space (IKS) (2009). IKS is a platform which integrates the faculties, scholars and business people within the framework of distributed departments. (Tikhomirov et al., 2009). It can help higher educational institutions to achieve student’s self-learning as well as synergetic integration of educational and innovative process.

==Methodology==

This research aims at investigating knowledge management practices in a department of a university in Asia that offers general education to students. Two interviews were conducted with Dr. A, the Assistant Director and Mr. B, the Senior Executive Assistant of the department on 6th and 7th March 2012. Both interviews lasted for an hour and were taped with prior permission. The information that they provided were the main sources for this research.

A survey was also conducted for the staff of the department. There were 8 questions in the questionnaire which were classified into three categories. The first part gathered the respondents’ background information, the second part focused on their proficiencies in computer literacy and the third part collected their perceptions on knowledge sharing. 7 copies of questionnaire were distributed, but only 4 were returned. Due to the low response rate, the data collected were not comprehensive enough that it will only be considered as additional reference for the this study.

==Applications of KM and Finding analysis==

After interviewing the Assistant Director and the Senior Executive Assistant of the department, certain level of KM practices are identified within the department. In this part, applications of KM are categorized and analyzed using the framework of Integrated KM Cycle (Dalkir, 2005) (Noted that &quot;KM Teams&quot; is intentionally omitted, the reason will be explained in the limitation part of the report) and we aim to: '''See Figure 1'''



:# Identify the current application of KM in the department by knowledge processing phrases
:# Measure the level of KM implementation in the department by KM Metrics
:# Analyze the KM Maturity level of the department by Knowledge Management Maturity Model (KMMM)

===Application of Knowledge Management===

In order to identity and better understand the current KM practices in the department, the integrated KM cycle is used as a framework in our study. The three processing phrases in the KM cycle, namely &quot;knowledge capture and creation&quot;, &quot;knowledge sharing and disseminating&quot; and &quot;knowledge acquisition and application&quot;, are used to categorize the current KM activities within the department and the identified KM practices are as follows: 

&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr style='background-color:#b0c4de;'&gt;&lt;td style='border:1px solid;'&gt;Knowledge processing phrases&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style='border:1px solid;'&gt;Existing representative KM Practices&lt;br/&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style='border:1px solid;'&gt;Knowledge Capture and Creation&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style='border:1px solid;'&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Workplace Retreat&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Knowledge Capture and Codification&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style='border:1px solid;'&gt;Knowledge Sharing and Disseminating&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style='border:1px solid;'&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Community of Practice (CoP)&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style='border:1px solid;'&gt;Knowledge Acquisition and Application&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td style='border:1px solid;'&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Knowledge Reuse&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Knowledge Repositories&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;

====Knowledge capture and creation====

:'''Workplace Retreat (靜修)'''
:A “workplace retreat” programme was introduced to the department by the Assistant Director in last semester. Workplace retreat is an innovative programme which prompts not only knowledge creation but also knowledge sharing within the organization. As De La Mothe &amp; Foray (2001) suggests, informal social activities outside workplace like retreat can serve as an appropriate instruments for a firm’s learning strategy. While staffs are invited to travel out of office, the peaceful surrounding could help stimulating reflections and brainstorms. It was aimed, by such platform, to create a strategic direction for the department and set themes for projects of next academic year. 

:With specific activities held during the retreat, knowledge sharing culture can also be established in retreats. Hughes (1999) suggests that holding retreats can be a good opportunity for organizations to identify barriers to collaboration and to build bridges to improve communication, trust, and cohesiveness among staffs. Thus, it can encourage staffs to share their ideas. After all, a year plan will be constructed base on the ideas generated during the retreat. 

:'''Knowledge Capture and Codification'''
:Structured method of capturing and codifying, no matter tacit or explicit knowledge, was not commonly found within the department. It might due to the lack of awareness that the organization’s knowledge has to be captured, organized and managed in a systematic way, so it can be retained can converted into organization’s asset. In the interview, we could only identify unstructured, elementary level of knowledge capture and codification. In summary, there is only one key practice for this category: Learn from others.

:By participating in different conference, exhibits or events held by similar educational organization, the department was able to learn from the experience of others. Indeed, community of such is an emerging form of tacit knowledge development where people can learn from each other (Binney, 2001). However, since the department did not intend to do any knowledge capture or codification, it limited the actual outcome for participating in these events.

====Knowledge sharing and disseminating====

:'''Community of Practice (CoP)'''

:Community of Practice, according to Lave &amp; Wenger (1991), is a group of people who share a profession. It is hoped that by communication and sharing among the members, they can learn from each other and develop themselves personally and professionally (Lave &amp; Wenger, 1991). CoP is, again, not intentionally held in the department. Yet, we found that an elementary level of CoP exist and run quite smoothly in the department. By holding weekly meetings and project evaluation meetings, staffs are asked to gathered and share their knowledge on event hosting and project management. As claimed by the Senior Executive Assistant in the interview, it had been proof an effective way for staffs to learn experience form history and from each other.  However, as the CoP was not well-organized, given that no CoP roles (e.g. Facilitator, Champions) are defined, it was not well structured for sharing knowledge. To conclude, there is still a long way for CoP fully developed its potential benefit towards the department.

====Knowledge acquisition and application====

:'''Knowledge Reuse'''
:To make knowledge reusable, there are there main roles during the process (Markus, 2001):

::'''Knowledge producer:''' The original creator of the knowledge
::'''Knowledge intermediary:''' The one who packages and prepares the knowledge so that it can be stored, retrieved, and shared. This may involve any number of functions such as indexing, categorization, standardizing, publishing, mapping, etc.
::'''Knowledge consumer:''' The recipient and user of the knowledge in question.

:The knowledge intermediary plays a crucial role in building up objects library, to make knowledge objects available, so knowledge consumer can reuse the knowledge and avoid time wastage in reinventing the whole object.

:The department has long established a physical document library for the storage of past projects materials, including proposals, forms, letters, etc. These materials are used as reference for future project development. These documents are categorized according to timeframe, and placed in several corners in the office. As these materials are in paper form and they are not placed in order, staffs claimed that it is hard for them to retrieve the resources. In most cases, instead of searching for the old documents, they would tend to seek help directly from the former PIC of the particular event. It shows that knowledge reuse is not well developed in the department.

:In contrast, the department did a great job in performing a knowledge intermediary job externally. The department organized numerous events and seminars in the past years, and it accumulates a rich level of knowledge objects and resources. To make the knowledge objects available for reuse, the department has set up an external archive for storing and disseminating the video clips and event materials of workshops and seminar. Though it was reported that the usage rate was not very high due to the material content and promotion of the archive, it is a good direction for the department to make these knowledge objects available on the web and reusable in the future.


:'''Knowledge Repositories'''
:An internal document archive was set up to serve as a digital central storage tool. It presented as a share folder, which every staffs have to right to access, put files and share with each other. The internal archive aimed to centralize all the event documents for future reference. Especially when there is a high turnover rate in the past few years, new comers often found that they can barely catch up the administration work. Therefore, the internal archive was established with guidelines written from the staffs, so to ensure new comers can take up their job quickly and efficiently. However, as no one was assigned to manage of the internal archive, the archive is not well organized and maintained. Furthermore, as not all project documents were being collected, so some information was missing.

===KM Metrics===

According to Dalkir (2005), KM metrics include quantitative, qualitative, and anecdotal methods to measures how well KM is implemented within the organization.  
There are 4 KM metrics, namely awareness, behavior, output and outcome (Brown, n.d.).

====Awareness====

Awareness refers to knowledge of what to document, how to document it, how to access KM data base, etc (Brown, n.d.).

In the interview, they were asked what type of knowledge they would be documented. They said lots of documents were documented in share drive including temporary files and draft, but some of them are not co-relate to any meaningful outcome. There is no staff organizes the share drive and classifies what type of knowledge should or should not be documented. In addition, there are lots of informal meetings within the department. However, no records or minutes were taken in the meetings.

Besides, they said they would seek helps from different people when they have troubles rather than find the solution from the share drive. It shows that staffs in the department do not have the concept of knowledge management. They watch for knowledge everywhere when they require and depose it when they do not need it. The knowledge were lost instead of retaining in the department as their asset. So the staffs have use long time to find for the solution when they face the same problem.

====Behavior====

Behavior refers to participation in KM activities such as committees/teams, making presentation, etc. (Brown, n.d.).

When communication practice was concerned, both the Senior Executive Assistant and the Assistant Director said they communicated with other very frequently. All the staffs would participate in weekly meeting. The meeting was causal and aims to report the progress of the event that they were organizing. However, other KM related activities like mentorship programme were not well-participated within the department. For example,  the mentorship programme should be a senior staff as a mentor and a junior staff as a mentee to form a pair or group in order to share their knowledge and skills, but not all the staffs were joined the programme and the programme was not smoothly run during a period of times.

====Output====

Output refers creation of data bases, white papers, lessons learned reports, best practice documentation, etc. (Brown, n.d.).

In the interview, two interviewees were asked whether there is any guideline for their work and they responded that there is no such thing in their department. They were also questioned about “do you have policies or guidelines for your work? If so, how do you access these kinds of documents or materials?” and “What sort of orientation or refresher training have you received?” The two dedicated interviewees presented there did not have any official guidelines or training materials for their reference.

Apart from these, there is a few lecture materials were provided by the department to public including student. The lecture materials such as lecture notes and videos were uploaded to the department archive randomly, not all the related materials were provided and accessed by all students.

====Outcome====

Outcome is the impact of new knowledge on key measures of organizational performance such as new product sales, productivity, cost reduction, or quality improvement (Brown, n.d.).

The interviewees were asked questions like “how do you add value to the department?” The assistant director responded how his past working experience can streamline the working process in this department now. The senior administrative assistant of the department responded the experience how he taught his colleagues use mail merge function to send mass email to the students and made some tutorials and white papers for how to use some specific functions in the software. After this practice, no staff needs to send thousands of similar emails one by one and hence the productivity of the department is higher than before.

It can be seemed that the interviewees experienced the advantage gained from knowledge management. However, since their KM just start from the initial stage, the level of outcome that created by KM was not apparent. Nevertheless, from the above four KM metrics, it can find that the practice of knowledge retaining and sharing within the department is at the low level.

===General Knowledge Management Maturity Model (G-KMMM)===

As proposed by Pee and Kankanhalli (2009), the general-KM maturity model (G-KMMM) integrated the existing KM maturity models and illustrated the life cycle of KM in an organization. G-KMMM composed 5 stages (see Appendix).

:#'''Initial''' – No or little recognition of manage organization knowledge asset
:#'''Aware''' – Organization starts to recognize knowledge management, but it does not have guidance on what to do
:#'''Defined''' – Organization has assigned resources or infrastructures to support KM
:#'''Managed''' – KM initiatives are well recognized
:#'''Optimizing''' – KM is profoundly integrated with organization strategies and demonstrated improvements to the organization

To further investigate the KM development in an organization, Pee and Kankanhalli (2009) characterize each maturity level in context of Key Process Area (KPA) which included people, process and technology perspectives.

Their model is structured into assessment instrument for both academic and practice of KM development. In the following part, the G-KMMM assessment questions proposed by Pee and Kankanhalli (2009) are used for investigating the KM maturity level of the department.

People, as a KPA, include perspectives on organization culture, strategies and polices (Pee &amp; Kankanhalli, 2009). Through the interview, we could conclude that the department was able to recognize knowledge as an important element for the department to grow in long term. The assistant director realized and kept emphasizing the problems on knowledge transitions (e.g. lack of job training for new staff). Both of the two interviewees understood and agreed knowledge management can help providing better working environment and sustain the development of the department. Every week, sessions were held for the staff to share the experience or issues encountered in the week. The face-to-face discussions were intensive in the department. The senior staffs were willing to sharing the knowledge and willing to answer questions from juniors. The top management (e.g. assistant director) was active to participate in staff discussion. However, it can be seen that they did not have a clear vision and planning for KM, it can be concluded they had not implement all the key practices at maturity level 3. To summarize, the department was at level 2 in maturity for people KPA.

As described by Pee and Kankanhalli (2009), the process KPA refers to the KM activities in the organization. With regard to the process KPA, the department used shared drive to store routine documents. However, there was no formal guideline or process to indicate what document should be store, how to update the content and who shall be the one to update. Since there was no responsible person to manage the share drive, the staffs just asked their colleagues, leaving the share drive idle. To conclude, the department only able to achieve at level 1 maturity in process KPA.
For technology, it can be considered as internal and external infrastructures that support KM. Internally, the department did not have any pilot project about KM. The staff relied heavily on local document storage (e.g. the files on their own computer) and the share network drive only worked as an external storage place for the staffs.

For external, the department serviced as central hubs for students to learn about general issues other than their own disciplines. The department organized plenty of seminars and workshops throughout the year. Some of the seminars will be video captured and uploaded on the web archive. However, the online archive only offered simple playback function for the video. The access rate of the online archive was low. It can be summarized that the technology KPA was at level 1.

After the KM maturity evaluation, the comprehensive overview of KM can be structured. It can be seem that the department demonstrated a good atmosphere for KM to grow in terms of organization culture and the initiative of the top management. However, the management seemed did not have a clear KM planning and strategies. And the technology could not support staff capture and share the knowledge in the department. It can be considered that the KM maturity level was at level 1, more effort should be put on process and technology KPA.

==Recommendation==

As mentioned in the previous section, G-KMMM suggested that process, technology and people are Key Process Areas that should pay attention to for improvement. They are closely related to each other that the failure of either one will affect the whole KM implementation. Therefore, KM strategies(for process), KM technologies(for technology) and culture(for people) are emphasized to bring out a better KM practice in the department, With these strategies objectives and technical issue implemented the maturity level will be raised from initial stage of 1 to defined stage of 3 respectively.

There are many ways to improve KM practice, after considering various constraints like manpower, budget, and technical support level within the department, some recommendations are made. 

===KM strategies===

The department relies on face to face conversation, which belongs to tacit to tacit knowledge transfer, heavily. However, tacit knowledge is difficult to formalize and communicate, and even many of them were being reinvented or lost in the transition. Besides, the department was facing ineffective knowledge sharing to the external (e.g. students). The objectives of the recommended strategy should be:

:#Balancing the focus on more tacit to explicit knowledge transfer
:#Minimizing the overhead on tacit knowledge transfer
:#Establishing project cases and best practices for future reference (by After Action Reviews)
:#Implementing coaching and mentoring programmes
:#Establishing knowledge mapping and Communities of practice (CoP) for external events archive

===KM Technologies===

:'''Project team site'''
:For objective I, II, III and IV the department may consider use project team site (e.g. Google Site, MediaWiki) as a tool to formalize the KM activities (e.g. knowledge creation, capture) in the department. As Skyrme suggested people tend to recall knowledge better when it is received in the form of storytelling (2001), a project case is suggested as a learning tool for new staff. In order to capture the entire picture of the project, all the three type of projects (Seminars, Field Trips, Workshops) should be included.  As the program natures are different, each of them should have an individual team site for future reference. Each project team site should consist of some formalized components: project announcements, project calendar, project details (project proposal, milestone, checklist, etc.), best practice, after action review and updates. The PIC (person-in-charge) is responsible for updating the team site for their projects.

:The project team sites offer standard structures of how to record the knowledge in a project. All the project details should be captured on the project site to ensure the accuracy of knowledge shared and avoid duplication of records. The project team site will act as a storytelling object and the reference for After Action Reviews, which is a learning process for participant to discover the problems in the project and discuss the related solution. The solutions generated can be displayed in the form of Frequently Asked Question(FAQ), which can  refine the best practice for future reference (Skyrme, 2001). After the reviews, the best practice will be updated according to needs, so new staffs can learn the procedures through best practice and can look for the details in project cases. Best practices make use of roles and responsibilities to clearly identify the knowledge that need to be obtained when it is in certain role and training. Information should be limited to the maximum efficiency of accessing and learning the knowledge.

:'''Knowledge mapping and Community of Practice'''
:For the external knowledge dissemination, the department may consider using knowledge mapping and conducting virtual Community of Practice (CoP) for enhance the integrated knowledge space in the university. Wexler (2001) describes knowledge mapping is a new communication channel using graphical presentation of ideas, topics and stories between map creators and map users. What’s more, knowledge maps collect and organize explicit knowledge and present the relationship between different knowledge. In order to facilitate the knowledge dissemination to students, the department is suggested to apply knowledge mapping for students to study according to topics and relations. Students can choose their favorite topic and follow the study path in the knowledge map.

===Culture===

The experience of the department is relatively young that it is good for implementing KM, because people are more willing to share their knowledge when everyone is new and still in the learning stage. It is suggested that the department should provide more guides of the technologies adapted to the staff, as they will be more willing to practice knowledge management when they are more familiar with the technologies (Tikhomirov, Tikhomirova, Maksimova &amp; Telnov, 2009).

==Limitations and Conclusion==

The department has long been developed a sharing culture, and it provided a strong foundation for KM development in the future. The staff recognized KM is an important element for long term success. However, it can be discovered that the department has no idea on what should be captured and how the captured knowledge can be disseminated more effectively. In the case study, the integrated KM cycle was applied to investigate the KM development of the department. '''See Figure 2'''



Together with the G-KMMM assessment, we structured a comprehensive view of the department’s KM implementation level. The integrated KM cycle, KM metrics and G-KMMM, as a framework of investigation, help us identify the key areas that need to be improved in different aspects of view. 

The case study also implicated the KPAs (People, Process and Technology) worked as the principle of KM practices. All of the KPAs are co-related with each other and facilitate the KM activities to run smoother. Refer to Collison and Parcell suggestion (2004); knowledge management should be embedded in core processes. As demonstrated in the finding, the department seemed to neglect the importance of integrating their KM practices into their core routine tasks.

In the case study, we used interview for our primary research reference. There are times that interviewees might get out of track to our discussion and additional guidance had to be made in order to help the interviewees grasp the idea of the questions. In addition, more quantitative data should be collected by other survey methods (e.g. questionnaire) for double validation of the result.

&quot;KM Teams&quot; in the Integrated KM Cycle is intentionally omitted in our analysis. KM Teams refers to the KM professionals who work on a team and perform knowledge management in a firm. As quoted by A. A. Hodg (1823 -1886), these professionals should be the one “who knows the sources of knowledge—where it is written and where it is to be found.” However, due to the size of the department, it is not feasible for it to recruit any specialist in KM to implement KM and so KM Teams is not in our scope of study. Yet, as the department grows in size, there may be needs for setting up KM Team in the future and it leaves further investigation in the future.

For the future challenges in KM for the development, it can be foreseen that the KM practices were easily be isolated from organization goals.  The new KM practices should put effort to enhance the organization competence by improving the organization creativity in organizing events.

Despite the current limitation, the case study demonstrated how the department was investigated by different diagnostic tools and what could be improved for the department in order to reach higher KM maturity level. However, the actual performance of KM could not be evaluated. As stated by Dalkir (2005), organization should quantify and qualify the result of KM performance (e.g. creativity). To recommend further study, we suggest more focus should be put on how KM can actually improve the organization performance.

      <text xml:space="preserve">===Video Surveillance===
Surveillance systems are becoming a popular security feature in public places, schools, businesses and even at home.  Simply having a video surveillance system that is visible to the public can act as a deterrent.  Commonly seen video surveillance systems are in gas stations, fast food restaurants and banks.  There are a wide range of video surveillance systems with an array of features and they vary drastically in cost.  These systems typically record “real-time” or for review at a later time, some also have the ability to record audio.  Video surveillance is a rapidly growing area of technology and there is a type of surveillance system to meet the needs of almost everyone.
 http://www.wisegeek.com/what-are-video-surveillance-systems.htm

Video surveillance is used at many stores, buildings and facilities where they need extra security. Video surveillance is also been added to subways, streets, airports, etc. The cameras are located and attatched to posts, or a building and can used to identify criminals, and crime. Camera phones are also becoming extremely popular in being used as a security feature. Cell phones are also being used in a negative way, which is why many facilities, ban the use of cell phones all together. Many facilities like to protect the privacy of their customers and client’s privacy by not allowing cell phones, video usage, or pictures to be taken. Camera phones are also being banned in schools to prevent cheating.

These Video Surveillance cameras are basically located outside and attached to or built to the wall unit; just as the lamp posts or they are sometimes even attached to buildings. Nowadays, video surveillance cameras are used in schools so that administrators can monitor the activities of both teachers and students and have to record any disturbing incidents that can happen between students. On the other hand, when Video Surveillance cameras are attached in public places they even have face recognition technology to try to identify any known culprits or suspicious person or even to identify the criminals if any crime has been caught on tape, and furthermore to prevent any crimes from occurring.

'''Closed-Circuit Television'''[[File:Axis 214 PTZ Camera.jpg |right| thumb | An example of a surveillance camera which can be remotely operated. These types of cameras can be found anywhere and are becoming increasingly more common.]]
Closed-Circuit Television or CCTV is the use of a video camera or multiple video cameras which broadcast their feed to a specific location and that feed is not accessible by anyone outside that specific location. CCTV can be found in most stores and most public public buildings, such as schools and hospitals. There are CCTV products for sale that allows an individual to purchase them and set them up around their property and then they can log onto the internet and log onto their cameras and view the feed from anywhere in the world. Some of the cameras are even capable of being controlled online so that you can move them around while being thousands of miles away.

==Employee Monitoring==

Some or most employers are using monitoring software to see what their employees are doing throughout the day or week. Some companies state in their company handout that they may choose to monitor the activity of employees of theirs. They do own the equipment. This practice has been going on for quite some time. They can listen to your phones calls, private or business. They can check to see where you have been on the internet. Some companies block certain websites such as: gaming, social networks, porn and personal e-mailing. This to me seems that they want to eleviate too much socializing on computers during our work day. They also have software that can tell you how many keystrokes a person is using, people who do a lot of data entry or preforming a high amount of keystrokes. They could also tell how long your computer has been idle; meaning you may be away from your desk for long periods of time. They will just keep monitoring you and say nothing until it is time for your performance review. We all know the we shouldn't be using computers at work for our own enjoyment but how many people do it? Is anyone monitoring the monitors. I think if you don't use it to the extreme it should be ok, but that is company time unless you are on lunch.

People that work for the government or company that provides cell phones have a right to monitor the usage of those devices. These devices are given to workers to help them perform your duties. There are also tracking devices which some employees use to keep up with their drivers. I bet you didn't know that companies can also monitor and even open your mail even if it's against the law. We are constantly being monitored in some way, either at work or outside. Survelliance and monitoring are used intensively in retail and marketing stores to deter theft. Currently there are few laws regulating employee monitoring. There are several groups that are actively involved in workplace monitoring issues and that advocate stronger government regulation of employee monitoring activities.</text>

Section 487.03 governs the execution of warrants from outside of the province:
{{quotation|
'''Execution in another province'''&lt;br&gt;
487.03 (1) If a warrant is issued under section 487.01, 487.05 or 492.1 or subsection 492.2(1) in one province, a judge or justice, as the case may be, in another province may, on application, endorse the warrant if it may reasonably be expected that it is to be executed in the other province and that its execution would require entry into or on the property of any person, or would require that an order be made under section 487.02 with respect to any person, in that province.
&lt;P&gt;
'''Endorsement'''&lt;br&gt;
(1.1) The endorsement may be made on the original of the warrant or on a copy of the warrant that is transmitted by any means of telecommunication and, once endorsed, the warrant has the same force in the other province as though it had originally been issued there.

== TDang review April 2012 ==

I'm reviewing [https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikibooks/en/w/index.php?title=Strategy_for_Information_Markets/Durable_goods&amp;diff=2313377&amp;oldid=2312700 this version]. I'll likely be more critical than complimentary, because (a) that's the way I am and (b) that's what will help improve things. Please don't take the criticism-over-compliments to mean I have a wholly negative view.

Make sure to check the [[Talk:Strategy_for_Information_Markets#review_thoughts_April_2012|all-purpose review thoughts]] as well.

* ''Definition of &quot;Durable Goods&quot;'' and ''Durable vs. Non Durable''--These are trying to get at the same thing. They should be merged, and the section title removed, which will make that section the &quot;introduction&quot; to this page.
* ''Tone''--There's no need to sell the advantages of durable goods. A sandwich is not a durable good, but I might still prefer one to a pen.
* ''&quot;They should be thought of in terms of the course of services provided over time by the good rather than the physical good itself&quot;''--This is important, and should continue to be highlighted, perhaps as its own section of the page.
* ''&quot;Due to the fact that time is one of the main concerns when dealing with durable goods it is important to use ceteris paribus (keep all other things held constant) when considering the subject matter.''&quot;--&quot;ceteris paribus&quot; is used throughout economic analysis, so I'm not sure what you're aiming for with this, but maybe remove it from this section and put it back somewhere where it's more clearly being used?
* ''Costs''--Much of the second paragraph talks about the costs to make goods durable. This is part of the standard analysis of durable goods, but doesn't fit with our focus for information goods. My suggestion would be:
*# Makes &quot;costs&quot; its own section
*# Mention ''briefly'' that much durable goods analysis highlights the cost difference to make goods durable.
*# Then go on to point out that this isn't the case (at least not in the same way) for information goods.
* ''&quot;An example of a non durable good would be a water bottle.''&quot;--I reuse water bottles. Perhaps go for something completely non-durable like a food item (also these examples fit better up in the introduction).
* ''Current Role of Durable Goods in the Economy''--There are two problems with this section:
*# It's very timely, which would be good in a lot of reports, but isn't appropriate for a textbook. We would hope someone could get just as much out of this if they read it 6 years from now.
*# It's not about information goods, but about other kinds of durable goods, so gets away from the focus of this book.
** So, I expect this section should get pulled out. This does point out an interesting statistical thing, however, which is how &quot;durable goods&quot; are defined in government statistics. You'll need to find the references, but as I recall, most information goods are not formally classified as &quot;durable goods&quot;, except for some things like business software. Talking about that would be a good addition.
* ''&quot;An even better example of an information durable good is an online website.''&quot;--A web site is generally not a durable good. If I download it to my computer, it may be a durable good, but if it's on the web site, it's more of a service, the web site owner can remove it at any time.
* ''&quot;One important thing to note about durable information goods is that their value may deteriorate, but the information is still durable.''&quot;--This is something that would be worth elaborating on. For instance, you could look at the depreciation rate for business software. It can technically last for decades, but the typical use is more like 2-5 years (before updating to a new version).
* ''Damage of Piracy and Resale in the Video Game Market''
** I provided a link to a Slashdot article, but that's not a good enough reference in itself. It was just a place for inspiration. You need to find better references, which you might be able to get by following links in that Slashdot article (or maybe you'll have to search elsewhere).
** Software piracy and resale are two different things, which should be treated separately. I'd probably leave piracy off this page entirely, since there's [[Strategy for Information Markets/Piracy|a separate page on piracy]].
** You should address the [[w:doctrine of first sale|doctrine of first sale]] and how it fits with resale (and rental) of copyrighted material.
** You could talk about DVD rental--because of the state of U.S. law it is note generally legal to rent music recordings but is generally legal to rent video recordings. Thus, the video rental business. When a business like NetFlix rents DVD's, they don't have to get permission from or pay the copyright holders. However, if they stream videos, they do need to negotiate deals with the copyright holders.
** There are legal issues with whether someone &quot;owns a copy&quot; of a piece of software or merely is &quot;licensed&quot; a copy. Software companies argue that if they license a piece of software, the consumer is not allowed to resell it.
** The textbook talks a lot about durable goods and resale, including formal models and pictures. While the cost part of the durable goods thing is not so useful to us, the models of resale are.
** Mention (briefly, since there's another section on it) &quot;software as a service&quot; (SaaS) because that is taking something we're used to thinking of as a durable good which could be re-sold and turning it into a service (which is non-durable and can't be re-sold).
* ''Importance of Durable Goods''--This section is fuzzy right now, and should be merged into some stuff above.
* ''References''--The reference to businessweek would be good if the material were more appropriate to the article. The reference to Slashdot needs to be replaced with something better. Otherwise, this page is in desperate need of references.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Digital Counterfeiting==
In definition '''digital counterfeiting''' is the use of computers or digital equipment to make counterfeit copies of printed resources.  The major example of counterfeits is currency which according to the U.S. Secret Service around 60% of currency made counterfeit is done so digitally.  Other counterfeit items also include business checks, collectibles, fake identifications, and credit cards.  The practice of counterfeiting is illegal in the United States and offenders could be sentenced to 15 years per offense.  The majority of counterfeit currency are produced by gangs, organized crime, and terrorist organizations but has also been seen done so by college students and even high school students.  Although easily detectable counterfeit currency has had more ease of creating due to more and more digital technology that allows to do so. [[File:New_five_dollar_bill.jpg|thumb|US Currency]]

In order to prevent currency counterfeiting, the Government has been implementing measures such as changing the currency design every 7 to 10 years. With each new edition they are incorporating additional security features (watermarks, microprinting)which make it hard to duplicate the bills and can be easily seen when holding the bills up to the light. 
Also, in order to make it easier to track the source of the counterfeit item, the digital imaging equipment(copiers, scanners)are equipped with technologies such as printing invisible code that make tracking possible.Cannon has revealed to be using such technologies since 1992.

===Digital Watermark===
The use of digital watermarks is incredibly popular and most often people have no idea when something actually has a digital watermark.  Digital watermarks are used to identify whether or not a document has been tampered with, protect sensitive material from unauthorized editing and to deter things like counterfeiting and piracy.  The process of digital watermarking involves embedding digital information or identifiers into audio, video and printed materials.  The digital watermark, while undetectable to people can easily be identified and analyzed by computers.

===Security Thread===
One digital counterfeiting prevention tool is a security thread.  A security thread is a plastic strip that is embedded in U.S. currency. This strip can only be seen when it is held up to the light or when placed under an ultraviolet light. When you make the strip visible, it shows the letters USA followed by a number. The number is the value of the bill. For example a one dollar bill will have &quot;USA 1&quot; printed on the security thread.  This feature makes currency hard to duplicate but not impossible. Some counterfeits have been known to have a thin grey line printed on the end of the thread or a varnish at the end.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Employee Monitoring refers to companies recording or observing the actions of employees while on the job. It is very easy to perform, and much of it can be done through the use of computers. Common employee monitoring activities include screening telephone calls, reviewing e-mail, and tracking computer and internet usage. With the growing inclusion of video cameras in computers and monitors, employee monitoring via PC may become more prominent in the near future. Although many employees find it is an invasion of privacy, it is legal and very common in the U.S. For monitoring physical locations of employees, video cameras can be used, but another possibility is the use of smart or RFID- enabled ID cards (sometimes called proximity cards).

When you think about employee monitoring I think that most employees would agree that they are not a fan of this.  Unfortunately in our society today, employee monitoring, has become a necessary action for employers to take.  Because of all of the things that are available when accessing the internet, computer monitoring is a must.  Monitoring an employee’s use of the internet on a company owned computer is done by the majority of employers, because an employee can pay bills, shop, read all types of media and also use all of the social networking sites while in the workplace.  An employer could block the internet from an employee’s computer, but that is not always possible, as the internet might be needed to accomplish their job

Employee monitoring is very common in today’s business world. Employee monitoring reduces risk of theft, injury, and other problems that occur daily in the workplace. Employee monitoring is not illegal, it is actually recommended. Telephones, computer terminals, voice mail, or any Internet accessible device can be monitored. This is because every Internet activity leaves a '''digital footprint''' that can be traced. However, limitations have been placed on accessing personal accounts. According to Stengart v. LovingCare Agency, Inc. an agency cannot access an employee’s personal password protected account. Even if deleted from the terminal, messages still remain in memory “backed up” on magnetic tape. Encryption is the safest way to achieve legitimate privacy.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Rights and Bibliographic Data ==

Defining rights to bibliographic data is a complicated matter. The rights to a particular record vary according to the originating institution, their description level, and other factors. Records created by employees of the Library of Congress as part of their official duties, for instance, are in the public domain. Other libraries, however, retain rights to certain bibliographic data. Several libraries, including a number of national European libraries, have opted to explicitly waive their rights to catalog data using the Creative Commons Public Domain Dedication (CC0). These libraries include the [http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies/British_Library British Library] (2011), [http://de.creativecommons.org/2012/01/27/normdaten-deutsche-nationalbibliothek-kundigt-umstellung-auf-cc0-an/ Deutsche Nationalbibliothek] (2012), and the [http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies/National_Library_of_Spain National Library of Spain] (2012); as well as [http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/24/harvard-releases-big-data-for-books/ Harvard University] (2012), the [http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies/University_of_Florida_Library University of Florida George A. Smathers Libraries], and [http://wiki.creativecommons.org/Case_Studies/CERN CERN European Organization for Nuclear Research Library] (both 2011).

At the core of any bibliographic record is purely descriptive metadata: a document's title, author, place of publication, physical dimensions, etc. In 1991, the U.S. Supreme Court established that information alone, without some minimum of original creativity, cannot be protected by copyright (Feist Publications, Inc. v. Rural Telephone Service Co., 499 U.S. 340). Therefore, purely descriptive catalog records, like minimal vendor records and many fiction records, are likely not protected by copyright, no matter what which institution created them. Bibliographic records denoting the aboutness of a particular document -- those including subject headings, notes, and the like -- are eligible for copyright, but few libraries opt to explicitly claim copyright. Finally, as more OPACs are allowing library users to add tags, reviews, and other metadata to catalog records, things get even trickier. While Web 2.0 social cataloging websites, such as LibraryThing and Goodreads, have clearly defined terms and guidelines explaining the rights of both parties to user-submitted bibliographic data, most library catalogs have not explicitly identified such rights.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Employee Monitoring==
Some or most employers are using monitoring software to see what their employees are doing throughout the day or week. Some companies state in their company handout that they may choose to monitor the activity of employees of theirs. They do own the equipment. This practice has been going on for quite some time. They can listen to your phones calls, private or business. They can check to see where you have been on the internet. Some companies block certain websites such as: gaming, social networks, porn and personal e-mailing. This to me seems that they want to eleviate too much socializing on computers during our work day. They also have software that can tell you how many keystrokes a person is using, people who do a lot of data entry or preforming a high amount of keystrokes. They could also tell how long your computer has been idle; meaning you may be away from your desk for long periods of time. They will just keep monitoring you and say nothing until it is time for your performance review. We all know the we shouldn't be using computers at work for our own enjoyment but how many people do it? Is anyone monitoring the monitors. I think if you don't use it to the extreme it should be ok, but that is company time unless you are on lunch.
People that work for the government or company that provides cell phones have a right to monitor the usage of those devices. These devices are given to workers to help them perform your duties. There are also tracking devices which some employees use to keep up with their drivers. I bet you didn't know that companies can also monitor and even open your mail even if it's against the law. We are constantly being monitored in some way, either at work or outside. Survelliance and monitoring are used intensively in retail and marketing stores to deter theft. Currently there are few laws regulating employee monitoring. There are several groups that are actively involved in workplace monitoring issues and that advocate stronger government regulation of employee monitoring activities.
Computer monitoring software that can record an individual’s computer use is viewed as a privacy violation by some, as is the increased use of video surveillancein public locations. Although it is allowed by law, some employees view employee monitoring(such as monitoring computer use, telephone calls, and an individual’s location using a smart ID card or video surveillance) as an invasion of their privacy. Presence technology—  the ability of one computer on a network to know the status of another computer on that network—allows users of computers, mobile phones, and other communications devices to determine the availability of other individuals before contacting them.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==== Green Computing ====
Green computing refers to making computers and their production more environmentally friendly. The U.S. Department of Energy and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) developed the ENERGY STAR program; if hardware is ENERGY STAR compliant it displays the ENERGY STAR label. ENERGY STAR focuses on efficiency while devices are being used; as well as power management features that can put the device into sleep or hibernation mode after a set amount of time of not being used. &lt;ref&gt;Morley, Deborah, and Charles S. Parker. &quot;Chapter 16.&quot; Understanding Computers: Today and Tomorrow. 13th ed. Boston, MA: Course Technology, Cengage Learning, 2011. 666. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Energy Consumption and Conservation ===
Today, because our computers are faster and more powerful than computers of old, the energy consumption and heat generation associated are higher than ever. Coupled with the high cost of energy, businesses are trying to find ways to reduce costs and energy consumption. A common energy saving tactic is the consolidation of servers. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is also in the process of developing an energy performance rating system for data centers. Hardware manufacturers are developing energy efficient computers and components and energy-saving features. Because computers can consume a fair amount of energy despite in standby and sleep mode, businesses and schools are progressively using software to automatically shut down computers when not in use. Devices that draw power when turned off, (referred to as energy vampires) include computers, home electronics, and home appliances. It is estimated that the average U.S. household can save an average of $100 just by unplugging devices when you are not using them.&lt;br /&gt;

* Remember to conduct any editing experiments in the [[Wikibooks:Sandbox|sandbox]] (global to the system) or in a page on your own userspace.
* Remember to use [[Commons:Main Page|Commons]] project for image uploading.
* You can tell the community something about yourself in your userpage.
** You can get to this page by clicking the tab at the top of the page labeled with your registered username.
* Wikibooks are open-source textbooks. ([[WB:WIW|What is Wikibooks]]).
* If you are a '''Wikipedian''', see [[Wikibooks:Wikibooks for Wikipedians]] for a primer since things work a little different here.
** If you want to base your work here on materials from Wikipedia, please use [[WB:RFI]].
* If you're an '''instructor''' and plan on using Wikibooks for a class project, see [[Wikibooks:Guidelines for class projects]]
* Please say hello at the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]] with any questions or ideas.
* Eventually, you might want to read the [[Wikibooks:Manual of Style|Manual of Style]] and [[Wikibooks:Policies and guidelines|Policies and Guidelines]].
** Help us by participating in policy and guideline creation.
** Please take a look at [[Wikibooks:Naming policy]] before starting a new book.
* Remember to keep a [[Wikibooks:Neutral point of view|Neutral point of view]].
* Explore, [[Wikibooks:Be bold in updating pages|be bold in editing pages]], and have fun!

You will find more resources in [[Wikibooks:Community Portal|Community Portal]]. If you have questions, visit the [[Wikibooks:Study help desk|Study help desk]], the [[Wikibooks:Reading room|Reading Room]], [[Wikibooks:IRC channels|IRC channel]] or [[User_talk:Panic2k4|ask me personally on my talk page]]. For site news, see the [[WB:BB|Bulletin board]]. It might be a good idea to add that page to your &quot;[[Special:Watchlist|watchlist]]&quot; so that you can see when any new information is posted there. You can do that by clicking the tab labeled &quot;watch&quot; at the top of the page.

&lt;small&gt;&lt;small&gt;(This is not an automated message, I'll be watching during a time for any reply you make to it...)&lt;/small&gt;&lt;/small&gt;

      <comment>/* The online Demo Database */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">= The Demo Database =
GNU Health default installation comes with no data. It's interesting, for academic and training purposes to have some demo data that exemplifies concepts and improves the learning curve.&lt;br /&gt;
The demo database is an ongoing project and it will be adapting to the each new GNU Health version. The clinical history will also grow with time.

For consistency sake, it's important to have the main characters information constant (family members name, birth dates and place, health centers, family doctors ... ). The information and characters are fictitious and we should try to make it valid for different cultures.

== The Zenon-Betz Family ==

The story goes around the Betz family, and the main character, &quot;Ana Betz&quot;, a primary school teacher. 

* Health Center : GNU Solidario Hospital in Las Palmas, Spain 
* Family Doctor : Cameron Cordara. ID : 765870 . Speciality : Family Medicine . Insitution : GNU Solidario Hospital

* Family : Zenon-Betz family : John Zenon (SSN : 40556644 ),  Ana Betz and their son, Matt (SSN : 97234436 ).
* Ana : The main character. Born October 4th, 1985 .&lt;br /&gt;


'''Demographics Information'''
* Social Security Number : 55567890 
* Sex : Female. 
* Marital Status : Married
* Profession : School teacher.
* Education Level : University

* Domiciliary Unit  
** Housing Conditions :Comfortable and good sanitary conditions


'''Patient Information'''

* Socio-Economic Status :Middle class
* Allergies : β-lactam hypersensitivity
* Diseases : Type 1 Diabetes diagnosed on November 10th 1993 .
* Medication : Insulin since November 10th 1993
* Genetic Information
** Family history  
*** Maternal Grandfather : Marfan's Syndrome ( Q87.4 )
*** Father : Essential (primary) hypertension ( I10 )
** Disease Genes 
*** BRCA1:breast cancer 1, early onset

* Obstetric Information : G1P1A0
** Newborn : Matt. DoB : March 15th 2010 . Epidural, vaginal birth. 

* Lifestyle  
** Ex-smoker
** Addictions : No recreational drugs 
** Sexuality : Heterosexual; Monogamous and practices safe sex. 
** Safety : Motorcycle rider. Uses helmet
&lt;br /&gt;

'''Other Information'''

* Family information (Family functionality level, members, operational sectors... )
* Imaging ( X-rays, CTs, MRIs.. )
* Genetic info / risks
* Surgeries
* Lab orders and results
* Clinical history of the family
&lt;br /&gt;

== The online Demo Database ==

We have a community server available in the Internet so you can connect and try the latest GNU Health .
&lt;/br&gt; 
&lt;/br&gt;
First, you need to download and install the Tryton client application, according to your operating system&lt;/br&gt; 
[http://downloads2.tryton.org/3.2/tryton-3.2.3.tar.gz GNU/Linux, FreeBSD or other *NIX]&lt;/br&gt;
[http://downloads2.tryton.org/3.2/tryton-setup-3.2.2.exe Windows]&lt;/br&gt;
[http://downloads.tryton.org/3.2/tryton-last.dmg MacOS X]
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
Then you have to set the correct tabs position:
[[GNU_Health/Installation#Setting_the_Tryton_client_Tabs_position_for_GNU_Health|Setting the Tryton client Tabs position for GNU Health]]
&lt;/br&gt;
&lt;/br&gt;
Finally you can login using the following information:&lt;/br&gt;

'''Server''': health.gnusolidario.org:8000&lt;/br&gt; 
'''Database''': health26&lt;/br&gt; 
'''User name''': admin&lt;/br&gt; 
'''Password''': gnusolidario

== Installing a local Demo Database ==

'''Manually'''

This method should give the most up-to-date demo database with the fewer issues in the future.

First, as gnuhealth user, we download the newest demo database (2.6.2) and unzip it

 $ wget http://health.gnu.org/downloads/postgres_dumps/gnuhealth-2.6.2-demo.sql.gz
 $ gunzip gnuhealth-2.6.2-demo.sql.gz

Second, we create an empty database to import the demo database into

 $ psql -d template1 -c &quot;create database gnuhealth_demo&quot;

Third, we import the database

 $ psql gnuhealth_demo &lt; gnuhealth-2.6.2-demo.sql &lt;ref&gt;Optionally &quot;1&gt;/tmp/log 2&gt;/tmp/err&quot; may be added at the end of the line. For large databases and not so large computers, it could accelerate the load, while providing some clues just in case.&lt;/ref&gt;

Now enter the database through Tryton client (as non-gnuhealth user)

Database: gnuhealth_demo&lt;br/&gt;
Username: admin&lt;br/&gt;
Password: gnusolidario&lt;br/&gt;

There is a user &quot;admin_es&quot; that uses the Spanish language.

'''Using proteus demo script'''

{{message box|image=stop_hand.png|alt=stop sign|backgroundcolor=yellow|heading=Deprecation Warning.|message=The Proteus demo script is deprecated and won't be used in version 2.8 . Please use the demo database postgres dump }}

We use the '''proteus''' engine to install the demo database.

First we need to install proteus in your local environment

 $ pip install --user proteus

'''Alternatively''', and if you're using any Debian GNU/Linux system, you can also install proteus from a repository. 

 $ apt-get install tryton-proteus

'''Warning''', do not install proteus using pip and then apt-get as well. Most likely difference version of proteus will be installed and the demo database installation will fail.

Now, look for the demo directory. You can run the script from anywhere, but make sure your tryton libraries are in the python search  path. This is important, specially if you use the manual installation. 

 $ export PYTHONPATH=&quot;&lt;PLACE_OF_YOUR_TRYTON_SERVER_DIRECTORY&gt;&quot;

So, for example, if you installed the GNU Health sever with the standard method, then your variable declaration for PYTHONPATH for Tryton 3.0.3 would be something like :

 $ export PYTHONPATH=&quot;/home/gnuhealth/gnuhealth/tryton/server/trytond-3.0.3/&quot;

Next, run the script :

 $ cd &lt;demo_directory&gt;
 $ python health_demo_server.py

So, for example, if you installed the GNU Health sever with the standard method, the demo directory would ~/gnuhealth-2.4.1/scripts/demo (or whatever version number yours is) and you use:

 $ cd ~/gnuhealth-2.4.1/scripts/demo
 $ python health_demo_server.py

This script will create a new database called '''gnuhealth_demo''' with the demo information. Be patient, it can take some time.

User name: admin&lt;/br&gt; 
Password: admin

Sen dudaga gidecek, kara üzüm.
Yalnizca benim dudaklarimda ol
Ellerim ellerini tutmak
Gözlerim gözlerine bakmak.
Kalbim seni ister.
Ben neyleyim bir garip hamal
Sevenleri tasirim.

==External rays ==
===Parameter rays===
'''The Wolf Jung test''' : 
The external parameter rays for angles  (in turns)
* 1/7 (period 3) 
* 321685687669320/2251799813685247 (period 51)
* 321685687669322/2251799813685247 ( period 51 )
Angles differ by about &lt;math&gt;10^{-15}&lt;/math&gt;, but the landing points of the corresponding parameter rays are about 0.035 apart. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mndynamics.com/indexp.html Wolf Jung's test for precision of drawing parameter rays]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dynamic rays===
====number type====

====angle precision====
For rotational number ( internal angle) 1/34 ray for external angle : 

&lt;math&gt;t_a =\frac{2^{33}}{2^{34}-1} =\frac{8589934592}{17179869183} = 0.5000000000291038 &lt;/math&gt;

lands on the alfa fixed point :

&lt;math&gt;z_a = 0.491486549841951  +0.091874758908285i &lt;/math&gt;

It is not a ray for angle :

&lt;math&gt;t_b =\frac{1}{2} = 0.5 &lt;/math&gt;

which land on the point :&lt;ref&gt;One can find it using program Mandel by Wolf Jung using Ray to point menu position ( or Y key) &lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;z_b = -0.508513450158049  +0.091874758908285i&lt;/math&gt;


Difference between external angles of the rays is :

&lt;math&gt;dt = t_b - t_a =-0.0000000000291038  &lt;/math&gt;

and between landing points of the rays points is :
&lt;pre&gt;

==Escaping test==

This test was introduced by by John Milnor &lt;ref&gt;[http://arxiv.org/abs/math.DS/9201272 Dynamics in one complex variable: introductory lectures version of 9-5-91  Appendix G by John W. Milnor]&lt;/ref&gt;. See also analysis by Mark Braverman &lt;ref&gt;[http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0505036 Parabolic Julia Sets are Polynomial Time Computable Mark Braverman]&lt;/ref&gt; and roundoff error by Robert P. Munafo&lt;ref&gt;[http://mrob.com/pub/muency/roundofferror.html Roundoff Error  by Robert P. Munafo,  1996 Dec 3. ]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Julia set z+z^5.png|thumbnail|right|Julia set z+z^5. Image and src code]]
Comment by  Mark McClure : &lt;ref&gt;[http://math.stackexchange.com/questions/361205/what-is-the-shape-of-parabolic-critical-orbit math.stackexchange  questions : what-is-the-shape-of-parabolic-critical-orbit]&lt;/ref&gt;
&quot; an escape time algorithm would take forever to generate that type of image, since the dynamics are so slow there. If you want resolution of 1/100, it would take roughly 2108 iterates to move the point z0=0.01 to z=2 by iterating f(z)=z+z5 &quot;
===Cases ===
====Nonparabolic case====

Lets take simple hyperbolic case where parameter c is : 

 &lt;math&gt;c= 0&lt;/math&gt;

Here repelling fixed point z_f is :
 &lt;math&gt;z_f = 1 &lt;/math&gt;


====Parabolic case====

Lets take simple [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/parabolic|parabolic case]] where parameter c is : &lt;ref&gt;[http://arxiv.org/abs/math/0505036 Parabolic Julia Sets are Polynomial Time Computable by Mark Braverman]&lt;/ref&gt;

 &lt;math&gt;c= \frac{1}{4}&lt;/math&gt;

Here parabolic fixed point z_f is :
 &lt;math&gt;z_f = \frac{1}{2} &lt;/math&gt;

===Test ===

Lets take point z of exterior of Julia set but lying near fixed point :

 &lt;math&gt;distance = 2^{-n}&lt;/math&gt;
 
 &lt;math&gt;z = z_f + distance&lt;/math&gt;

where n is a positive integer 
 

Check how many iterates i needs point z to reach target set ( = escape)  :

 &lt;math&gt;|z_i| &gt; ER&lt;/math&gt;

where ER is [[Fractals/Iterations_in_the_complex_plane/def_cqp#Escape_radius_.28_ER.29|Escape Radius]]


Show relationship between :
*  n
* Last Iteration
* type of numbers used for computations ( float, double, long double, extended, arbitrary precision )

===Analysis ===

'''Maximal n''' in hyperbolic case &lt;math&gt;n =  n_h &lt;/math&gt; is allmost the same as the precision of the significand &lt;ref&gt;[[:w:Floating_point#IEEE_754:_floating_point_in_modern_computers|wikipedia :Floating point , EEE_754]]&lt;/ref&gt;

 &lt;math&gt; n_h = precision - 1 &lt;/math&gt;

In parabolic case maximal  &lt;math&gt;n =  n_p &lt;/math&gt; is

 &lt;math&gt; n_p = \frac{precision}{2}  &lt;/math&gt;

'''Last Iteration''' ( escape time = iteration fro which abs(zn) &gt; ER ) is : 
in hyperbolic case equal to n :
 
 &lt;math&gt; LI_h = n &lt;/math&gt;

in parabolic case equal to 2^n : 

 &lt;math&gt; LI _p = 2^n &lt;/math&gt;

'''Time of computations''' is proportional to number of iterations. In hyperbolic case is is short. In parabolic case grows quickly as number of iterations. 

 &lt;math&gt; time [seconds] = 6 * 2^{n-24} &lt;/math&gt;

Checking one point if escapes in parabolic case : 
* for n = 34 take about one hour ( 5 595 seconds )
* for n = 40 take about one day 
* for n = 45 take about one month
* for n = 50 take about one year

===Q&amp;A===

==== Why programs fails ? ====

Cancellation of significant digits&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Significant figures|wikipedia : Significant figures]]&lt;/ref&gt; and loss of significance (LOS).&lt;ref&gt;[[w:Loss of significance|wikipedia  : Loss of significance]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://docs.oracle.com/cd/E19957-01/806-3568/ncg_math.html IEEE Arithmetic from Numerical Computation Guide by Oracle]&lt;/ref&gt;

The program fails because of limited precision of used number types. Addition of big (zp) and small number (distance) gives number which has more decimal digits then can be saved  ( floating point type has only 7 decimal digits). Some of the most right digits are cancelled and iteration goes into an infinite loop. 

For example : when using floating point in parabolic case lets take 

 float cx = 0.25;
 float Zpx = 0.5;
 float Zx ;
 float distance;
 float Zx2;
 float n = 13;

so 
 
 distance = pow(2.0,-n); // = 1.2207031250e-04 = 0,00012207

It is greater then machine epsilon&lt;ref&gt;[[:w:Machine_epsilon|Machine epsilon]]&lt;/ref&gt; :

 distance &gt; FLT_EPSILON // = pow(2, -24) = 5.96e-08 = 0,00000006

so this addition still works :

 Zx = Zpx + distance; // adding big and small number gives 0,50012207

After multiplication it gives :

 Zx2 = Zx*Zx; // = 0,250122

next step is addition. Because floating point format saves only 7 decimal digits it is truncated to :

 Zx = Zx2 + cx; // = 0,500122 = Zp + (distance/2)
 
Here relative error is to big and 
 d2= 0.0000000149 // distance*distance
is smaller then FLT_EPSILON/2.0 = 0.0000000596; 

Solution : increase precision !

      <text xml:space="preserve">Hello guys!&lt;br /&gt;

I want to become a professional Software Engineer(SE) or a Computer  Programmer(CP). Some one can lead me in this regard. I mean I want to know which programming languages I must learn to become a good SE or a CP.
Here are some questions if some one would like to answer:&lt;br /&gt;


# What is an ''Object'' in object oriented languages?
# Does C++ can be used in a way like visual basic is used. ( I mean can we provide any GUI like using VB in C++?)</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
The common law provides for a defence of necessity for &quot;emergency situations where normal human instincts, whether self-preservation or of altruism, overwhelmingly impels disobedience.&quot;&lt;Ref&gt;
R v Perka, [1984] 2 S.C.R. 232&lt;/ref&gt; The defence provides a legal excuse (as opposed to a justification) for conduct making out the offence.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Perka, [1984] 2 SCR 232&lt;/ref&gt;

The defence is to be &quot;strictly controlled and scrupulously limited&quot; to situations of true involuntariness.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Perka, [1984] 2 SCR 232&lt;br&gt;
R. v. Latimer, 2001 SCC 1, [2001] 1 S.C.R. 3, at paras. 26 to 34
&lt;/ref&gt; 

The elements to make out the defence of necessity:
# the accused  must be in imminent peril or danger&lt;ref&gt; See Morgentaler v. The Queen, 1975 CanLII 8, [1976] 1 S.C.R. 616, at p. 678&lt;/ref&gt;
# the accused  must have had no reasonable legal alternative to the course of action he  or she undertook
# the harm inflicted by the accused must be  proportional to the harm avoided by the accused

The peril or danger must be more than just foreseeable or likely. It must be near and unavoidable. At the least, &quot;the  situation must be so emergent and the peril must be so pressing that  normal human instincts cry out for action and make a counsel of patience  unreasonable.&quot;&lt;Ref&gt;R v Perka, [1984] 2 SCR 232&lt;/ref&gt;

To be proportional, the harm avoided must be at least comparable to the  harm inflicted.

The elements of imminent peril and no alternative is determined on a modified objective standard taking into account the situation and characteristics of the accused.&lt;Ref&gt;R. v. Latimer, [http://canlii.ca/t/523c 2001 SCC 1], [2001] 1 SCR 3 at 32 to 34&lt;/ref&gt; The element of proportionality is measured on an objective standard.

The defences first set out in R v Latimer, however, had previously been considered as potentially available in the case of Morgentaler v. The Queen, [1976] 2 S.C.R. 616.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==General Principles==
The defence of &quot;non-insane automatism&quot; is a defence available at common law. 

Automatism is the &quot;involuntary behaviour, the state of a person who, though capable of action is not conscious of what he is doing. It means an unconscious involuntary act where the mind does not go with what is being done.&quot;
&lt;ref&gt;
R. v. Rabey (1977) 37 C.C.C. 2d 461 at 155 &lt;/ref&gt; It is a state of consciousness where the persons is capable of action, but has not voluntary control over the action.&lt;ref&gt;Rabey at 156&lt;/ref&gt;

The burden is on the accused to prove involuntariness on a balance of probabilities.&lt;Ref&gt;R v Stone at 179 (“The foregoing leads me to the conclusion that the legal burden in cases involving claims of automatism must be on the defence to prove involuntariness on a balance of probabilities to the trier of fact.”)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{TOC right}}

Most locations off the Earth do not have automatic recycling of waste products, and a space project will have a finite amount of materials that have been processed beyond the raw state.  We define '''Recycling''' as the application of energy and processes to convert materials from a non-useful state back to a useful state.  It shares some technology with production from raw materials, except using materials that have already been processed previously and are not in their raw state. In fact some recycling methods will involve feeding waste products back into a production process.

===Waste Recycling=== 

A goal for recycling is to achieve '''Closure''', where all waste products are converted back to useful states and the only external input is energy.  We expect this to be a theoretical limit similar to conversion efficiency in electrical transformers and motors.  Those devices can reach 98% efficiency but not 100%.  Similarly, practical recycling is expected to reach a high percentage, but not 100%.  To the extent your percent closure CL% approaches 100, the amount of new raw materials required is reduced to 100-CL% of an open system with no recycling. So a high percent closure can have a dramatic effect on the need for new raw material processing or replacement items brought from elsewhere.

Some items by their nature are not amenable to recycling.  A prominent example is reaction mass expelled outside a gravity well by a propulsion method.  You are deliberately throwing that mass away in order to get thrust, and outside a gravity well there is no practical way to recover it to use it again.  Within a gravity well, such as launching from Earth using a chemical rocket, all the reaction mass is sub-orbital - ranging from about -1/2 orbital velocity to +1/2 orbital velocity depending on the vehicle velocity.  Therefore it all ends up back on Earth and can be used again.  While some reaction mass cannot be recovered, you can deliberately choose high efficiency methods that lose less mass this way, and use methods such as gravity assist that do not lose propellant mass.

===Closed Loop Life Support===

Humans are biological organisms with certain requirements to continue living, including clean air, water, and sufficient food.  They also produce waste products from the human standpoint, such as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, urine, and feces.  On Earth those wastes from the human standpoint are necessary inputs to plants and other organisms, and solar powered evaporation produces clean water in the form of rain.  The natural cycles form closed loops.  For space projects we have to replicate the function of those closed loops with artificial systems, or supply air, water, and food from external sources.  The more time and the higher the number of humans the greater the outside supply mass becomes, and so the more desirable a closed loop system becomes.

Besides inputs such as air, food, and water, humans additionally need controlled lighting, temperature, pressure, radiation levels, and acceleration. Prepared food and feces are complex from a chemical standpoint, there are secondary volatiles and shed skin produced by humans, and body and clothing cleaning are desirable.  Therefore a full life support system for humans is complex.  We apply the Systems Engineering approach of dividing it into simpler sub-systems that each perform part of the total functions required, and then optimize the full system as a whole.  In addition to the direct functions that provide life support, such as growing plants producing food, there are also indirect functions caused by meeting the requirements of the plants, such as water, illumination, gravity, and C0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration.  The methods listed below include meeting both direct and indirect functions.

====Artificial Gravity====

Humans and plants are evolved in a 1 g environment.  Without gravity, human bones deteriorate and some plants may not grow properly.  With gravity, water circulation and dust settling operate by familiar methods.  If local gravity from a large satellite or planet is not sufficient, artificial acceleration can be generated by rotation.

====Illumination====

Photosynthetic plants need sufficient illumination of the right wavelengths to grow, and humans need sufficient light to see and navigate.  Having both evolved on Earth with the Sun as the main source of illumination, both use the wavelength band that the Sun emits the most power at, known as '''Visible Light'''. There are slight differences in intensity, day cycle, and wavelengths for various plants, and for what humans need to see properly. Natural sunlight is easily obtained at many locations in space, so it certainly should be considered if available.  Artificial lighting is available for circumstances where natural sunlight is not sufficient, but that usually requires a power source to operate.  For a large area of plants that amounts to a lot of power, so natural sources are usually preferred, even if it needs to be concentrated.

====Soil====

Plants on Earth often grow in soil, which is broken down rock plus microorganisms, water, nutrients, and organic matter.  Hydroponics dispenses with the inert rock component, which can save mass for space projects. If radiation shielding is required, though, the inert rock component can serve a dual function.  While fully developed soils are only known from Earth, there are many sources in space of small rock particles, water, and carbon which make up a large part of soil mass.

====Food====

Human food requirements can be measured in terms of total energy, commonly measured in '''Food Calories''' which are equivalent to 4184 Joules of available energy. The requirements are also measured by a wide variety of specific nutrients in specific amounts. It may not be efficient to supply all the low mass nutrients in a given situation, while supplying the main ones by mass. Whatever nutrients are not obtained from the closed loop system would have to be supplemented from outside, or simply done without for short missions. Human requirements can be translated to specific growing areas per person using known data on agricultural productivity.  This data can be modified by designs of space systems.  For example, if a plant needs 12 hours of sunlight per day, you can grow twice as much in the same area by using trays that are swapped every 12 hours, and storing the other tray under the illuminated one.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Every character must belong to one (or more) character classes. These are &lt;u&gt;Archetypes&lt;/u&gt; that describe what role the character performs in the fantasy world. For instance, a Wizard would be heavily focussed on magic, A Fighter on weapons, a Monk on open hand combat etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve">Using Gold and Silver coins the players decide what their characters need (or can afford) to buy, in order to outfit them for the coming adventures. Weapons, Armour, Lanterns, Rope, Provisions and many other things are available to the Adventurer with ready money chinking in their purse! The DM should decide what is available, how much it costs and who is selling it. A short adventure can revolve around a shopping expedition for unusual kit or having special items fabricated by a master craftsmen. Some Equipment will be found on the players adventures, some is very common and some extremely rare and difficult to obtain, making it very desirable!

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Making the Transition==
Not all high school students are ready for college once they graduate.  Many high schools today have &quot;[[w:Tracking_(education)|tracks]]&quot;, which are programs designed to prepare students for their future career plans.  For example, &quot;college prep&quot; is a common track that is slightly more challenging for high school students as they are prepared for additional education in college.  Additional tracking programs include &quot;tech prep&quot; and &quot;dual enrollment.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey2002&quot;&gt;Bailey, Thomas R., Katherine L. Hughes, and Melinda Mechur Karp. 2002. “What Role Can Dual Enrollment Programs Play in Easing the Transition between High School and Postsecondary Education?” For full text: http://www.ed.gov/offices/OVAE/HS/bailey.doc. Retrieved January 19, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  Both of these tracks are geared toward smoothing the transition into college for high school students.  Tech prep can be a helpful approach, but it has a major drawback - not all universities recognize this program and some refuse to transfer the credits toward an undergraduate degree.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey2002&quot;/&gt;  Dual enrollment is also a beneficial program and it overcomes the major drawback of the tech prep track - universities are much more likely to recognize the transfer credit.  The only concern with dual enrollment is that the courses are typically taught by high school teachers and not college professors, which may not give students a good feel for the different teaching styles students will experience in college.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey2002&quot;/&gt;

In the preliminary chapter we discussed equivalence classes on sets. If the reader has not yet mastered this notion, he/she is advised to do so before starting this section.

== Normal Subgroups ==

Recall the definition of kernel in the previous section. We will exhibit an interesting feature it possesses. Namely, let &lt;math&gt;ak\,,\,k\in\ker\,\phi\leq G&lt;/math&gt; be in the coset &lt;math&gt;a\ker\,\phi&lt;/math&gt;. Then there exists a &lt;math&gt;k^\prime\in\ker\,\phi&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;k^\prime a=ak&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a\in G&lt;/math&gt;. This is easy to see because a coset of the kernel includes all elements in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; that are mapped to a paticular element. The kernel inspires us to look for what are called ''normal subgroups''.


'''Definition 1:''' A subgroup &lt;math&gt;N\leq G&lt;/math&gt; is called ''normal'' if &lt;math&gt;gNg^{-1}=N&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt;. We may sometimes write &lt;math&gt;N\trianglelefteq G&lt;/math&gt; to emphasize that &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; is normal in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Theorem 2:''' A subgroup &lt;math&gt;N\leq G&lt;/math&gt; is normal if and only if &lt;math&gt;gN=Ng&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': By the definition, a subgroup is normal if and only if &lt;math&gt;gNg^{-1}=N&lt;/math&gt; since conjugation is a bijection. The theorem follows by multiplying on the right by &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


We stated that the kernel is a normal subgroup in the introduction, so we had better well prove it!


'''Theorem 3:''' Let &lt;math&gt;\phi\,:\,G\rightarrow G^\prime&lt;/math&gt; be any homomorphism. Then &lt;math&gt;\ker\phi\leq G&lt;/math&gt; is normal.

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;k\in\ker\,\phi&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\phi(gkg^{-1})=\phi(g)e^\prime\phi(g)^{-1}=e^\prime&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;gkg^{-1}\in\ker\phi&lt;/math&gt;, proving the theorem. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 4:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G,G^\prime&lt;/math&gt; be groups and &lt;math&gt;\phi\,:\, G\rightarrow G^\prime&lt;/math&gt; a group homomorphism. Then if &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{im}\,\phi&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\phi^{-1}(H)&lt;/math&gt; is normal in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h\in \phi^{-1}(H)&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\phi(ghg^{-1})=\phi(g)\phi(h)\phi(g)^{-1}\in H&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is normal in &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{im}\,\phi&lt;/math&gt;, and so &lt;math&gt;ghg^{-1}\in \phi^{-1}(H)&lt;/math&gt;, proving the theorem. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 5:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G,G^\prime&lt;/math&gt; be groups and &lt;math&gt;\phi\,:\, G\rightarrow G^\prime&lt;/math&gt; a group homomorphism. Then if &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\phi(H)&lt;/math&gt; is normal in &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{im}\,\phi&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;g^\prime \in \mathrm{im}\,\phi&lt;/math&gt; And &lt;math&gt;h\in H&lt;/math&gt;. Then if &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\phi(g)=g^\prime&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;g^\prime \phi(h) {g^\prime}^{-1}=\phi(g)\phi(h)\phi(g)^{-1}=\phi(ghg^{-1})=\phi(h^\prime)\in\phi(H)&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;h^\prime\in H&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is normal. Thus &lt;math&gt;g^\prime \phi(H){g^\prime}^{-1}=\phi(H)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;g^\prime\in\mathrm{im}\,\phi&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is normal in &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{im}\,\phi&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Corollary 6:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G,G^\prime&lt;/math&gt; be groups and &lt;math&gt;\phi\,:\, G\rightarrow G^\prime&lt;/math&gt; a surjective group homomorphism. Then if &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\phi(H)&lt;/math&gt; is normal in &lt;math&gt;G^\prime&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Replace &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{im}\,\phi&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;G^\prime&lt;/math&gt; in the proof of Theorem 5. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Remark 7:''' If &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, it does '''not''' necessarily imply that &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is a normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. The reader is invited to display a counterexample of this.


'''Theorem 8:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group and &lt;math&gt;H,K&lt;/math&gt; be subgroups. Then

:i) If &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is normal, then &lt;math&gt;HK=KH&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

:ii) If both &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; are normal, then &lt;math&gt;HK=KH&lt;/math&gt; is a normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

:iii) If &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; are normal, then &lt;math&gt;H\cap K&lt;/math&gt; is a normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': i) Let &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be normal. First, since for each &lt;math&gt;k\in K&lt;/math&gt;, there exists &lt;math&gt;h,h^\prime\in H&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;kh=h^\prime k&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;KH=HK&lt;/math&gt;. To show &lt;math&gt;HK&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup, let &lt;math&gt;hk,h^\prime k^\prime\in HK&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;h^\prime k^\prime (hk)^{-1}=h^\prime k^\prime k^{-1} h^{-1}=h^\prime h^{\prime\prime}k^\prime k^{-1}\in HK&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;h^{\prime\prime}\in H&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is normal, and so &lt;math&gt;HK&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup.

ii) Let &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;hk\in HK&lt;/math&gt;. Then since both &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; are normal, there exists &lt;math&gt;h^\prime\in H\, ,\,k^\prime\in K&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;ghkg^{-1}=ghg^{-1}k^\prime=gg^{-1}h^\prime k^\prime =h^\prime k^\prime\in HK&lt;/math&gt;. It follows that &lt;math&gt;gHKg^{-1}=HK&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;HK&lt;/math&gt; is normal.

iii) Let &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;h\in H\cap K&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;ghg^{-1}\in H&lt;/math&gt; since H is normal, and similarly &lt;math&gt;ghg^{-1}\in K&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;ghg^{-1}\in H\cap K&lt;/math&gt; and it follows that &lt;math&gt;H\cap K&lt;/math&gt; is normal. {{Unicode|∎}}


=== Examples of Normal Subgroups ===

In the following, let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be any group. Then &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; has associated with it the following normal subgroups.

:i) The ''center'' of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;Z(G)&lt;/math&gt;, is the subgroup of elements which commute with all others. &lt;math&gt;Z(G)=\{z\in G\mid (\forall g\in G) zg=gz\}&lt;/math&gt;. That &lt;math&gt;Z(G)&lt;/math&gt; is a normal subgroup is easy to verify and is left to the reader.

:ii) The ''commutator subgroup'' of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;G^{(1)}&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;[G,G]&lt;/math&gt;, is the subgroup generated by the subset &lt;math&gt;\{[g,h]\mid g,h\in G\}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;[g,h]=g^{-1}h^{-1}gh&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;g,h\in G&lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt;s\in G&lt;/math&gt;, we introduce the shorthand &lt;math&gt;sgs^{-1}=g^s&lt;/math&gt;. Then we have &lt;math&gt;s[g,h]s^{-1}=[g^s,h^s]&lt;/math&gt;, such that for any product of commutators &lt;math&gt;[g_1,h_1][g_2,h_2]...[g_n,h_n]&lt;/math&gt; where all elements are in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;s[g_1,h_1][g_2,h_2]...[g_n,h_n]s^{-1}=[g_1^s,h_1^s][g_2^s,h_2^s]...[g_n^s,h_n^s]&lt;/math&gt;, and so &lt;math&gt;G^{(1)}&lt;/math&gt; is normal.


'''Remark 9:''' We can iterate the commutator subgroup construction and define &lt;math&gt;G^{(0)}=G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;G^{(n)}=[G^{(n-1)},G^{(n-1)}]&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n\in \mathbb{N}&lt;/math&gt;. We will not use the commutator subgroup in future results in this book, so for us it is merely a curiosity.

== Equivalence Relations on Groups ==

Why are normal subgroups important? In the preliminary chapter we discussed equialence relations and the associated set of equivalence classes. If &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is a group and &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; is an equivalence relation, when does &lt;math&gt;G/\sim&lt;/math&gt; admit a group structure? Of course we have to specify the multiplication on &lt;math&gt;G/\sim&lt;/math&gt;. We will do so now.


'''Definition 10:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group and &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; is an equivalence relation on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, we define multiplication on the equivalence classes in &lt;math&gt;G/\sim&lt;/math&gt; such that for all &lt;math&gt;a,b\in G&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;[a][b]=[ab]&lt;/math&gt;


This is indeed the only natural way to do it. Take the two equivalence classes, choose representatives, compute their product and take its equivalence class. The alert reader will have only one thing on his/her mind: is this well defined? For a general equivalence relation, the answer is no. The reader is invited to come up with an example. What is more interesting is ''when'' is it well defined? By the definition above, we obviously need the projection map &lt;math&gt;\pi\,:\, G\rightarrow G/\sim&lt;/math&gt; defined by &lt;math&gt;a\mapsto [a]&lt;/math&gt; to be a homomorphism. We can in fact condense the requirements down to two, both having to do with cancellation laws.


'''Theorem 11:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group and &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; an equivalence relation on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;G/\sim&lt;/math&gt; is a group under the natural multiplication if and only if for all &lt;math&gt;a,b,g\in G&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;a\sim b\,\Leftrightarrow ag\sim bg \wedge ga\sim gb&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Assume &lt;math&gt;G/\sim&lt;/math&gt; is a group. Since &lt;math&gt;a\sim b \,\Leftrightarrow [a]=[b]&lt;/math&gt;, the property follows from the cancellation laws in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Assume now that the property holds. Then its multiplication rule is well defined, and must verify that &lt;math&gt;G/\sim&lt;/math&gt; is a group. Let &lt;math&gt;a,b,c\in G&lt;/math&gt;, then associativity is inherited from &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;([a][b])[c]=[ab][c]=[(ab)c]=[a(bc)]=[a][bc]=[a]([b][c])&lt;/math&gt;.

The identity in &lt;math&gt;G/\sim&lt;/math&gt; is the equivalence class of &lt;math&gt;e\in G&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;[e]&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;[e][a]=[ea]=[a]=[ae]=[a][e]&lt;/math&gt;.

Finally, the inverse of &lt;math&gt;[a]&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;[a^{-1}]&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;[g][g^{-1}]=[gg^{-1}]=[e]=[g^{-1}g]=[g^{-1}][g]&lt;/math&gt;.

So &lt;math&gt;G/\sim&lt;/math&gt; really defines a group structure, proving the theorem. {{Unicode|∎}}


We will call an equivalence relation &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; ''compatible'' with &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;G/\sim&lt;/math&gt; is a group. Then, &lt;math&gt;G/\sim&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''quotient group'' of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt;. Also, as an immediate consequence, this makes &lt;math&gt;\pi\,:\, G\rightarrow G/\sim&lt;/math&gt; into a homomorphism, but not just any homomorphism! It satisfies a universal property!


[[File:Diagramquotient.png|thumb|Commutative diagram showing the universal property satisfied by the projection homomorphism.]]
'''Theorem 12:''' Let &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; be en equivalence relation compatible with &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\phi\,:\, G\rightarrow H&lt;/math&gt; a group homomorphism such that &lt;math&gt;a\sim b \,\Rightarrow\, \phi(a)=\phi(b)&lt;/math&gt;. Then there exists a unique homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\phi}\,:\, G/\sim\rightarrow H&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\phi=\tilde{\phi}\circ\pi&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': In the preliminary chapter on set theory, we showed the corresponding statement for sets, so we know that &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\phi}&lt;/math&gt; exists as a function between sets. We have to show that it is a homomorphism. This follows immediately: since &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\phi}([a])=\phi(a)&lt;/math&gt; by commutativity, we have &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\phi}([a])\tilde{\phi}([b])=\phi(a)\phi(b)=\phi(ab)=\tilde{\phi}([ab])=\tilde{\phi}([a][b])&lt;/math&gt;. As stated already, &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\phi}([a])=\phi(a)&lt;/math&gt; shows uniqueness, proving the theorem. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Lemma 13:''' Let &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; be an equivalence relation on a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a\sim b \,\Leftrightarrow ga=gb&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;H=[e]&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a\sim b \,\Leftrightarrow\, a^{-1}b\in H\,\Leftrightarrow \, aH=bH&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': First off, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is nonempty since &lt;math&gt;e\in H&lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt;a,b\in H&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;b\sim e \,\Leftrightarrow\, e\sim b^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; by multiplying on the left by &lt;math&gt;b^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. Then since &lt;math&gt;e\sim a&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;a^{-1}\sim e&lt;/math&gt; by the same argument. Applying transitivity gives &lt;math&gt;a^{-1}\sim b^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, multiplying on the left by &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; gives &lt;math&gt;e\sim ab^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;, giving &lt;math&gt;ab^{-1}\in H&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;H=[e]&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup.

Assume &lt;math&gt;a\sim b&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;a,b\in G&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;[a]=[b]&lt;/math&gt; implying &lt;math&gt;[a^{-1}b]=[e]&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;a^{-1}b\in [e]&lt;/math&gt;. Now assume &lt;math&gt;a^{-1}b\in [e]&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;[a^{-1}b]=[e]&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;[a]=[b]&lt;/math&gt; and finally &lt;math&gt;a\sim b&lt;/math&gt;.

Assume &lt;math&gt;a^{-1}b\in H&lt;/math&gt;. Then since &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup, we have &lt;math&gt;a^{-1}bH=H&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;aH=bH&lt;/math&gt;. Finally, assume &lt;math&gt;aH=bH&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;a^{-1}bH=H&lt;/math&gt;. Since in paticular &lt;math&gt;e\in H&lt;/math&gt;, this implies &lt;math&gt;a^{-1}b\in H&lt;/math&gt;, completing the proof. {{Unicode|∎}}


The mirror version using right cosets and the equivalence relation &lt;math&gt;a\sim b \,\Leftrightarrow ag=bg&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a\sim b \,\Leftrightarrow\, ab^{-1}\in H\,\Leftrightarrow \, Ha=Hb&lt;/math&gt; is completely analogous. Stating the theorem and writing out the proof is left to the reader as an exercise.


We have showed how an equialence relation defines a subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. In fact the equivalence classes are all cosets of this subgroup. We will now go the other way, and show how a subgroup defines an equivalence relation on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Lemma 14:''' Let &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be a subgroup of a group &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Then,

:i) &lt;math&gt;a\sim_L b\,\Leftrightarrow\,a^{-1}b\in H\,\Leftrightarrow\,aH=bH&lt;/math&gt; is an equivalence relation such that &lt;math&gt;a\sim_L b\,\Leftrightarrow\,ga\sim_L gb&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt;.

:ii) &lt;math&gt;a\sim_R b\,\Leftrightarrow\,ab^{-1}\in H\,\Leftrightarrow\,Ha=Hb&lt;/math&gt; is an equivalence relation such that &lt;math&gt;a\sim_R b\,\Leftrightarrow\,ag\sim_R bg&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': We will prove i). The proof for ii) is similar and is left as an exercise for the reader.

The fact that &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; is an equivalence relation and that &lt;math&gt;a^{-1}b\in H\,\Leftrightarrow\,aH=bH&lt;/math&gt; was proven in the section on subgroups. Assume &lt;math&gt;a\sim_L b&lt;/math&gt;. Then for all &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;(ga)^{-1}(gb)=a^{-1}g^{-1}gb=a^{-1}b\in H&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;ga\sim_L gb&lt;/math&gt;. Now assume &lt;math&gt;ga\sim_L gb&lt;/math&gt;, Then &lt;math&gt;a^{-1}b=a^{-1}g^{-1}gb=(ga)^{-1}(gb)\in H&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;a\sim_L b&lt;/math&gt;, completing the proof. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 15:''' For every equivalence relation &lt;math&gt;\sim_L&lt;/math&gt; on G such that &lt;math&gt;a\sim_L b\,\Leftrightarrow ga\sim_L gb&lt;/math&gt;, there exists a unique subgroup &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;G/\sim&lt;/math&gt; are precisely the left cosets of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': This follows from Lemma 13 and Lemma 14.


Again, the mirror statement is completely analogous. Stating the theorem is left to the reader as an exercise.

== Quotients with respect to Normal Subgroups ==

'''Lemma 16:''' An equivalence relation &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; is compatible with &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;[e]=H&lt;/math&gt; is a normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Assume &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; is compatible, &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;a\in H&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;a\sim e&lt;/math&gt;, and compatibility gives us &lt;math&gt;gag^{-1}\sim gg^{-1}=e&lt;/math&gt;, and so &lt;math&gt;gag^{-1}\in H&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is arbitrary, we obtain &lt;math&gt;gHg^{-1}=H&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is normal. Assume now that &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is normal. Then &lt;math&gt;aH=bH\,\Leftrightarrow a^{-1}b\in H&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Ha=Hb\,\Leftrightarrow ab^{-1} \in H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;aH=Ha&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a,b\in G&lt;/math&gt;. Using this, we obtain &lt;math&gt;a\sim b\,\Leftrightarrow ab^{-1}=ab^{-1}bg(bg)^{-1}\sim e \,\Leftrightarrow ab^{-1}bg=ag\sim bg&lt;/math&gt; and similarily for the right hand case, so &lt;math&gt;\sim&lt;/math&gt; is compatible with &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Definition 17:''' When an equivalence relation is given by specifying a normal subgroup &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, the quotient group with respect to this equivalence relation is denoted &lt;math&gt;G/H&lt;/math&gt;. We then refer to &lt;math&gt;G/H&lt;/math&gt; as the quotient of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; with respect to &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, or &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; modulo &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;. Note that this complies with previous definitions of this notation.

Multiplication in &lt;math&gt;G/H&lt;/math&gt; is given as before as &lt;math&gt;(aH)(bH)=(ab)H&lt;/math&gt;, with identity &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;(aH)^{-1}=a^{-1}H&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a,b\in G&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Definition 18:''' Let &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; be a normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Then we define the ''projection homomorphism'' &lt;math&gt;\pi\,:\, G\rightarrow G/H&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\pi(a)=aH&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;a\in G&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Theorem 19:''' A subgroup is normal if and only if it is the kernel of some homomorphism.

''Proof'': We have already covered the left implication. For the right implication, assume &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is normal. Then &lt;math&gt;G/H&lt;/math&gt; is a group and we have the projection homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\pi\,:\,G\rightarrow G/H&lt;/math&gt; as defined above. Since for all &lt;math&gt;h\in H&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;\pi(h)=hH=H&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\ker\,\pi=H&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is the kernel of a homomorphism. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 20:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G,G^\prime&lt;/math&gt; be groups, &lt;math&gt;\phi\,:\, G\rightarrow G^\prime&lt;/math&gt; a homomorphism and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; a normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;H\subseteq \ker\,\phi&lt;/math&gt;. Then there exists a unique homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\phi}\,:\,G/H\rightarrow G^\prime&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\phi}\circ\pi=\phi&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': This follows from Theorem 12 by letting &lt;math&gt;a\sim b\,\Leftrightarrow aH=bH&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}

== The Isomorphism Theorems ==

[[File:FirstIsoThm.png|thumb|Commutative diagram showing the first isomorphism theorem. &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\phi}&lt;/math&gt; is an isomorphism.]]
'''Theorem 21 (First Isomorphism Theorem):''' Let &lt;math&gt;G,G^\prime&lt;/math&gt; be groups and &lt;math&gt;\phi\,:\, G\rightarrow G^\prime&lt;/math&gt; a homomorphism. Then &lt;math&gt;G/\ker\,\phi \approx \mathrm{im}\, \phi&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': From Theorem 20 we have that there exists a unique homomorphism &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\phi}\,:\, G/\ker\,\phi \rightarrow G^\prime&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\phi=\tilde{\phi}\circ\pi&lt;/math&gt;. We have to show that &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\phi}&lt;/math&gt; is an isomorphism when we corestrict to &lt;math&gt;\mathrm{im}\,\phi&lt;/math&gt;. This is immediate, since &lt;math&gt;\phi(a)=\phi(b)\,\Leftrightarrow a\ker\phi=b\ker\phi&lt;/math&gt; by Lemma 13, so that &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\phi}&lt;/math&gt; is injective, and for any &lt;math&gt;g^\prime\in\mathrm{im}\,\phi&lt;/math&gt; there is a &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\phi(g)=\tilde{\phi}(g\ker\,\phi)=g^\prime&lt;/math&gt; so that it is surjective and therefore an isomorphism. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Lemma 22:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; a subgroup and &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; a normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;H\cap K&lt;/math&gt; is a normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;h\in H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k\in H\cap K&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;hkh^{-1}\in H&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;h,k\in H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a subgroup and &lt;math&gt;hkh^{-1}\in K&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;k\in K&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;h\in G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is normal in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Thus &lt;math&gt;hkh^{-1}\in H\cap K&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;H\cap K&lt;/math&gt; is normal in &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 23 (Second Isomorphism Theorem):''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; a subgroup and &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; a normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;HK/K\approx \frac{H}{H\cap K}&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Define &lt;math&gt;\phi\,:\, H\rightarrow HK/K&lt;/math&gt; by &lt;math&gt;\phi(h)=hK&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;h\in H&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is surjective since any element in &lt;math&gt;HK&lt;/math&gt; can be written as &lt;math&gt;hk&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;h\in H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;k\in K&lt;/math&gt;, so &lt;math&gt;\phi(h)=\pi(hk)=hkK=hK&lt;/math&gt;. We also have that &lt;math&gt;\ker\,\phi=\{h\in H\mid hK=K\}=\{h\in H\mid h\in K\}=H\cap K&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;HK/K\approx \frac{H}{H\cap K}&lt;/math&gt; by the first isomorphism theorem. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Lemma 24:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group, and let &lt;math&gt;H,K&lt;/math&gt; be normal subgroups of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;K\subseteq H\subseteq G&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;H/K&lt;/math&gt; is a normal subgroup of &lt;math&gt;G/K&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;h\in H&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;ghg^{-1}=h^\prime&lt;/math&gt; for some &lt;math&gt;h^\prime\in H&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is normal. Thus &lt;math&gt;(gK)(hK)(gK)^{-1}=(ghg^{-1})K=h^\prime K&lt;/math&gt;, showing that &lt;math&gt;H/K&lt;/math&gt; is normal in &lt;math&gt;G/K&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 25 (Third Isomorphism Theorem)''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group, and let &lt;math&gt;H,K&lt;/math&gt; be normal subgroups of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;K\subseteq H\subseteq G&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\frac{G/K}{H/K}\approx G/H&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Let &lt;math&gt;\phi\,:\, G/K\rightarrow G/H&lt;/math&gt; be given by &lt;math&gt;\phi(gK)=gH&lt;/math&gt;. This is well defined and surjective since &lt;math&gt;K\subseteq H&lt;/math&gt;, and is a homomorphism. Its kernel is given by &lt;math&gt;\ker\,\phi=\{gK\in G/K\mid gH=H\}=\{gK\in G/K\mid g\in H\}=H/K&lt;/math&gt;, so by the first isomorphism theorem, &lt;math&gt;\frac{G/K}{H/K}\approx G/H&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Theorem 26 (The Correspondence Theorem):''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group and &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; be a normal subgroup. Now let &lt;math&gt;A=\{H\leq G\mid K\leq H\}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B=\{H^\prime\mid H^\prime \leq G/K\}&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\pi\,:\, H\mapsto \pi(H)&lt;/math&gt; is an order-preserving bijection from &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;B&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': We must show injectivity and surjectivity. For injectivity, note that if &lt;math&gt;K\leq H&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;\pi^{-1}(\pi(H))=HK=H&lt;/math&gt;, so if &lt;math&gt;H_1,H_2\in A&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;\pi(H_1)=\pi(H_2)&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;H_1=\pi^{-1}(\pi(H_1))=\pi^{-1}(\pi(H_2))=H_2&lt;/math&gt;, proving injectivity. For surjectivity, let &lt;math&gt;H^\prime\in B&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;K\leq \pi^{-1}(H^\prime)\leq G&lt;/math&gt;, so that &lt;math&gt;\pi^{-1}(H^\prime)\in A&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\pi(\pi^{-1}(H^\prime))=H^\prime&lt;/math&gt;, proving surjectivity. Lastly, since &lt;math&gt;H_1\subseteq H_2&lt;/math&gt; implies that &lt;math&gt;\pi(H_1)\subseteq\pi(H_2)&lt;/math&gt;, the bijection is order-preserving. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Note 27:''' The correspondence Theorem is sometimes called ''The Forth Isomorphism Theorem''.


'''Theorem 28:''' Let &lt;math&gt;H\in A&lt;/math&gt; from Theorem 26. Then &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is normal if and only if &lt;math&gt;\pi(H)&lt;/math&gt; is normal in &lt;math&gt;G/K&lt;/math&gt;, and then &lt;math&gt;G/H\approx \frac{G/K}{\pi(H)}&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': Since &lt;math&gt;\pi&lt;/math&gt; is surjective, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; normal implies &lt;math&gt;\pi(H)&lt;/math&gt; normal. Assume that &lt;math&gt;\pi(H)&lt;/math&gt; is normal. Then &lt;math&gt;\pi^{-1}(\pi(H))=H&lt;/math&gt; and so &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is normal since it is the preimage of a normal subgroup. To show the isomorphism, let &lt;math&gt;\phi\,:\,G\rightarrow \frac{G/K}{\pi(H)}&lt;/math&gt; be given by a composition of projections: &lt;math&gt;\phi\,:\,\pi_{\pi(H)}\circ\pi_K&lt;/math&gt;. Then &lt;math&gt;\ker\,\phi=\{g\in G\mid \phi(g)=\pi(H)\}=\{g\in G\mid \pi(g)\in \pi(H)\}=\pi^{-1}(\pi(H))=H&lt;/math&gt;, so by the first isomorphism teorem, &lt;math&gt;G/H\approx\frac{G/K}{\pi(H)}&lt;/math&gt;. {{Unicode|∎}}


'''Corollary 29:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; a normal subgroup. Then for any &lt;math&gt;K^\prime\leq G/H&lt;/math&gt; there exists a unique subgroup &lt;math&gt;K\leq G&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;H\leq K\leq G&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K=K^\prime H&lt;/math&gt;. Also, &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; is normal in &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;K^\prime&lt;/math&gt; is normal in &lt;math&gt;G/H&lt;/math&gt;.

''Proof'': From Theorem 26 we have that the projection &lt;math&gt;K\mapsto \pi(K)=K^\prime&lt;/math&gt; is a bijection, and since &lt;math&gt;\pi(g)=gH&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;g\in G&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;K=K^\prime H&lt;/math&gt;. The second part follows from Theorem 28. {{Unicode|∎}}

== Simple Groups ==

'''Definition 30:''' A group is called ''simple'' is it has no non-trivial proper normal subgroups.


'''Example 31:''' Every cyclic group &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Z}_p&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is prime, is simple.


'''Definition 32:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; a normal subgroup. &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''maximal normal subgroup'' if for any normal subgroup &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt;, we have &lt;math&gt;K\subseteq H&lt;/math&gt;.


'''Theorem 33:''' Let &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; be a group and &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; a normal subgroup. Then &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is a maximal normal subgroup if and only if the quotient &lt;math&gt;G/H&lt;/math&gt; is simple.

''Proof'': By Theorem 26 and Theorem 28, &lt;math&gt;G/H&lt;/math&gt; has a nontrivial normal subgroup if and only if there exists a proper normal subgroup &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;G&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;H\leq K\leq G&lt;/math&gt;. That is, &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt; is not maximal if ans only if &lt;math&gt;G/H&lt;/math&gt; is not simple. The theorem follows. {{Unicode|∎}}

== Problems ==

'''Problem 1:''' Recall the unitary and special unitary groups from the section about subgroups. Define the ''projective unitary group of order ''&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; as the group &lt;math&gt;PU(n)=U(n)/Z(U(n))&lt;/math&gt;. Similarily, define the ''projective special unitary group of order ''&lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;PSU(n)=SU(n)/Z(SU(n))&lt;/math&gt;.

:i) Show that &lt;math&gt;Z(SU(n))=SU(n)\cap Z(U(n)\approx \mathbb{Z}_n&lt;/math&gt;

:ii) Using the second isomorphism theorem, show that &lt;math&gt;PSU(n)\approx PU(n)&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Networking==
A very effective way to obtain a job after college is to utilize networking - i.e., people you know.  Some research indicates that students who utilize their fraternity and sorority networks, including other members and alumni, are more likely to obtain high paying jobs than individuals who do not have these resources.&lt;ref name=&quot;Marmaros2002&quot;&gt;Marmaros, D., &amp; Sacerdote, B. (2002). Peer and social networks in job search. European Economic Review, 46(4–5), 870–879. doi:10.1016/S0014-2921(01)00221-5&lt;/ref&gt; Former college students, when asked, reported that networking through their fraternity or sorority was a very helpful way to find a good job. Students receiving help and advice from their fraternity or sorority members are more likely to not only find a job, but to find a job they like.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pike2003&quot;&gt;Pike, G. R. (2003). Membership in a Fraternity or Sorority, Student Engagement, and Educational Outcomes at AAU Public Research Universities. Journal of College Student Development, 44(3), 369–382. doi:10.1353/csd.2003.0031&lt;/ref&gt; Finding a job through fraternity and sorority networks often results in a greater mean salary than those who find jobs through other networks or through other references, like: professors, alumni, career services, relatives, or alone.

Fraternity and sorority members are also often more involved than students not in fraternities or sororities in activities relating to student learning and intellectual development. Some fraternities and sororities also have a GPA requirement that must be maintained, which leads to greater student success in college. Furthermore, students in fraternities and sororities reported having significantly higher levels of active and collaborative learning, as well as greater interaction with their professors, other faculty members, and peers. This resulted in advantages in both academic and personal development.&lt;ref name=&quot;Pike2003&quot;/&gt;

== Fraternity and Sorority Membership and Drinking Alcohol ==
Seven out of eight college students (or 87.5%) drink and 44% engage in binge drinking.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sher2001&quot;&gt;Sher, K J, B D Bartholow, and S Nanda. 2001. “Short- and long-term effects of fraternity and sorority membership on heavy drinking: a social norms perspective.” Psychology of Addictive Behaviors: Journal of the Society of Psychologists in Addictive Behaviors 15(1):42-51.&lt;/ref&gt; College is a period of time associated with heavy levels of drinking. It is also associated with elevated risk for acute health problems, including serious injury and psychological distress. Membership in a [[w:fraternity|fraternity]] or [[w:sorority|sorority]] leads to drinking more heavily and frequently.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sher2001&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Park2008&quot;&gt;Park, Aesoon, Kenneth J. Sher, and Jennifer L. Krull. 2008. “Risky Drinking in College Changes as Fraternity/Sorority Affiliation Changes: A Person–Environment Perspective.” Psychology of addictive behaviors : journal of the Society of Psychologists in Addictive Behaviors 22(2):219-229.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, membership in a fraternity or sorority increases the odds of developing dependence symptoms, initiating or continuing abusive alcohol use patterns, and experiencing alcohol related problems.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sher2001&quot;/&gt; Those who join fraternities later in their college careers experience an increase in abusive alcohol consumption while those who leave fraternities and sororities experience a decrease in such activities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Park2008&quot;/&gt;

The reasons why members of fraternities and sororities are more likely to consume alcohol are not perfectly clear, but it appears as though social norms play a prominent role.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sher2001&quot;/&gt; Members of these groups view drinking as more of a social norm.  However, many members of these groups enter college with these beliefs, which may indicate that it is not exclusively the environments of the fraternities and sororities that lead to these attitudes and behaviors but prior views of the members.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sher2001&quot;/&gt;  Heavy drinkers and partiers in high school may intentionally seek out fraternity and sorority membership because they are aware of the reputation these organizations have for drinking and partying.&lt;ref name=&quot;Park2008&quot;/&gt;  Other factors that may contribute to alcohol use among members of these groups could be the characteristics of the members.  Members of these groups tend to score high on extraversion and also tend to be impulsive.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sher2001&quot;/&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;Park2008&quot;/&gt; 

Despite the differences in drinking during college, three years after college the levels of drinking of members of fraternities and sororities does not appear to be significantly different from that of college graduates who were not in these types of organizations.  This is suggestive of a pro-drinking environment in fraternities and sororities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Sher2001&quot;/&gt;

A wedding is one of life’s most important ceremonies that celebrate the union of two people in marriage, with friends and family coming together to attend the special event. What better way to save those happy and touching memories during the celebration than capturing them with a digital camera.

=== Usage ===

This template is a trivial wrapper around [[Help:Editing#Interlanguage links|interlanguage links]]. It is meant as a way to prevent interlanguage links from appearing in print versions of books such as PDF files generated by [[:de:Benutzer:Dirk_Huenniger/wb2pdf|wb2pdf]]. There are two unnamed arguments: the first is the language code; the second, the name of the destination page in the sister wiki. Therefore,
 &lt;nowiki&gt;{{Haskell/Interlanguage|nl|Analyse}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;
becomes:
 &lt;nowiki&gt;[[nl:Analyse]]&lt;/nowiki&gt;

::Indeed some of the content could be used for that work and probably other psychiatry books but not as a simple merge. Someone would have to carefully select the usable content and take in consideration that some of the ideas expressed on the work are now outdated. Since the work is now Wikisource I see no value in keeping this apparent duplication.  --[[User:Panic2k4|Panic]] ([[User talk:Panic2k4|discuss]] • [[Special:Contributions/Panic2k4|contribs]]) 02:29, 17 March 2012 (UTC)

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Is It Possible to Finish College in Four Years?==
While just half of incoming freshmen at public universities in the US finish their college degree in four years, it is possible.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowen2009&quot;&gt;Bowen, William G., Matthew M. Chingos, and Michael S. McPherson. 2009. Helping Students Finish the 4-Year Run. The Chronicle of Higher Education. September 8, 2009. http://chronicle.com/article/Helping-Students-Finishthe/48329/&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it requires careful planning and diligence. 

If you want to finish your degree in four years, take the following steps:
#Work out a four-year plan that includes every course you'll need to take to complete your major and when you'll take each course.
#Sit down with your advisor and make sure your plan is accurate and reasonable.
#Stick to your plan.

Some things that can impede your progress include: losing motivation, taking on a job, and changing your major.  Also, make sure you complete any paperwork you need for graduation well in advance of the deadline. If the noted steps are followed, you should have no trouble getting your degree on-time. In-fact, it is even possible to finish college early if a student takes advantage of online and summer courses.

Unfortunately, there are also some factors that can impede college completion that may not be within a student's control.  Things like limited family income or attending a community college increase the odds of not completing one's degree or not completing it in four years.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bowen2009&quot;/&gt;

[[File:Zyprexa.jpg|thumb|Zyprexa (olanzapine) 10 mg tablets]]
[[w: Olanzapine | Zyprexa]] (olanzapine), a product of the pharmaceutical giant [[w: Eli_Lilly_and_Company | Eli Lilly &amp; Co]], was introduced in 1996 as an atypical [[w: Antipsychotic | antipsychotic]] &lt;ref name=&quot;Berenson&quot;&gt;Berenson, Alex (2007). Lily Settles with 18,000 over Zyprexa. The New York Times http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9f00e5db1430f936a35752c0a9619c8b63 &lt;/ref&gt;. Approved by the [[w: Food_and_Drug_Administration | FDA]] for the treatment of Schizophrenia and Bipolar Mania, Zyprexa accounted for almost one-third of annual revenue for Eli Lilly since the drug's introduction, with global sales exceeding $4 billion dollars in 2006 &lt;ref name=&quot;Berenson&quot;/&gt;. Zyprexa has been prescribed to nearly 26 million people since 1996 &lt;ref&gt; Lilly Resolves Investigations of Past Zyprexa Marketing and Promotional Practices (2009). Eli Lilly and Company. http://newsroom.lilly.com/releasedetail.cfm?ReleaseID=359242 &lt;/ref&gt;.

===Marketing Strategy===
Eli Lilly is widely criticized for employing irresponsible marketing strategies that down-played the risks and promoted &quot;off-label&quot; usage of Zyprexa. 

====''&lt;small&gt;Off-label Marketing&lt;/small&gt;''====
:While only approved for schizophrenia and bipolar mania, the drug was marketed to doctors and patients for a wide range of unapproved and questionable treatments. For example, Eli Lilly established a &quot;Viva Zyprexa&quot; campaign that promoted the use of Zyprexa for symptoms including agitation, hostility, aggression, depression, and sleep or mood disturbances &lt;ref name=&quot;Settlement&quot;&gt; Eli Lilly Zyprexa Settlement: Drug Maker to Pay Record $1.42 Billion (2009). Find Law. http://commonlaw.findlaw.com/2009/01/eli-lilly-zyprexa-settlement-drug-maker-to-pay-record-142-billion.html &lt;/ref&gt;. No specific clinical studies had been performed to examine Zyprexa's effect on these symptoms.

:Eli Lilly also specifically targeted the elderly suffering from dementia and Alzheimer's &lt;ref name=&quot;generics&quot;&gt; Eli Lilly profit drops sharply on Zyprexa generics (2012). Reuters. http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/31/us-elililly-idUSTRE80U0R020120131 &lt;/ref&gt;. Leaked documents show that Eli Lilly instructed pharmaceutical salespeople to make dementia the first message for primary care physicians, since Schizophrenic patients were typically reported to specialists &lt;ref name=&quot;Berenson&quot;/&gt;. Similarly, other documents show Eli Lilly claiming that Zyprexa is a safe choice for treating agitation and confusion. The sales slogan &quot;5 at 5&quot; was allegedly used by salespeople to promote 5mg of Zyprexa at 5pm to help the elderly sleep. However, Zyprexa had not been approved for any such treatments and, in fact, suggested harmful side effects during clinical trials &lt;ref name=&quot;Settlement&quot;/&gt;.

====''&lt;small&gt;Down-played Risks&lt;/small&gt;''====
:Concerned that sales of the drug might suffer if they were more forthright, Eli Lilly instructed sales representatives to down-play the risks of Zyprexa. Clinical trial documents showed that 16% of patients gained more than 66 pounds within a year of use. Moreover, the effects of the drug on diabetes risk were extreme &lt;ref name=&quot;Settlement&quot;/&gt;.  In 2001, the American Medical Association published a study reporting that patients taking Zyprexa had a ten times higher risk of developing diabetes. Similar cases have been identified for Ketoacidosis and Pancreatitis &lt;ref&gt; Zyprexa: hyperglycemia and diabetes (2011). 1 Boring Old Man. http://1boringoldman.com/index.php/2011/03/26/zyprexa-hyperglycemia-and-diabetes/ &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Zyprexa side effects (2005). Van Der Ginst Law, P.C. http://www.zyprexa-lawsuit.net/zyprexa-side-effects.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;. Researchers also discovered that the elderly were twice as likely to suffer stroke or fatal injury while on Zyprexa. Although the FDA and regulatory agencies in the UK and Japan all warned that Zyprexa might lead to diabetes, Eli Lilly failed to disclose this information &lt;ref name=&quot;generics&quot;/&gt;.

===Legal Consequences===
Through 2008, Eli Lilly had paid out over $1 billion to settle more than 32,000 Zyprexa lawsuits. In 2009, Eli Lilly entered a guilty plea with federal prosecutors of the Pennsylyvania Federal court for illegally marketing Zyprexa &lt;ref name=&quot;Settlement&quot;/&gt;. While doctors hold the authority to prescribe drugs for conditions that they haven't been approved for, it is strictly illegal for pharmaceutical companies to promote off-label usage of their drugs. Eli Lilly, guilty of these actions, was forced to pay $1.42 billion for its misdemeanor violation of the Federal Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act in addition to other state level lawsuits &lt;ref name=&quot;Settlement&quot;/&gt;.

The terms of the plea agreement also include compulsory compliance in a corporate integrity agreement with the Office of the Inspector General (a division of the U.S. department of Health and Human Services) &lt;ref name=&quot;generics&quot;/&gt;. This includes an external compliance program that will be in effect for five years, Although very similar in protocol to the internal compliance policies existing at Eli Lilly, this program includes third-party review for all systems, processes, policies, procedures, and practices.

==General Pharmaceutical Misconduct==

Such actions are widespread in the pharmaceutical industry. Of the top 10 pharmaceutical manufacturers in the world, all 10 have been involved in similar deceitful behaviors. Pfizer, the largest pharmaceutical manufacturer in the world, has been found guilty of falsely advertising and deceiving doctors about its prized possession, Lipitor. Lipitor is the best-selling prescription substance in the world &lt;ref&gt; Edwards, Jim (2010). Lawsuit Claims Pfizer Deceived Doctors Into Prescribing Its Cholesterol Drug Lipitor. CBS. http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505123_162-42844207/lawsuit-claims-pfizer-deceived-doctors-into-prescribing-its-cholesterol-drug-lipitor/ &lt;/ref&gt;. Novartis, the second largest pharmaceutical manufacturer in the world, in 2010, paid over $200 million for off-label marketing &lt;ref name=&quot;Lucy&quot;&gt; Lucy, C (2010). Big Pharma Lawsuits – Who Got Hit with the Biggest Settlement?. Lawyers and Settlements. http://www.lawyersandsettlements.com/blog/big-pharma-lawsuits-who-got-hit-with-the-biggest-settlement-05310.html &lt;/ref&gt;. Sonafi, the next largest manufacturer, paid $100 million for similar activities in 2009 &lt;ref name=&quot;Lucy&quot;/&gt;. Similarly, Merck, the manufacturer of Vioxx, faced billions of dollars in lawsuits for falsely advertising its blockbuster drug &lt;ref&gt; Wilson, Duff (2011). Merck to Pay $950 Million Over Vioxx. The New York Times. http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/23/business/merck-agrees-to-pay-950-million-in-vioxx-case.html &lt;/ref&gt;.

===Economics of the Pharmaceutical industry===
To fully understand the ethical misconduct at hand, it is important to first examine why these major pharmaceutical companies behave in such a manner. Similar to any other business, large pharmaceutical companies are driven by profit incentives. [[w: Pharmaceutical_Research_and_Manufacturers_of_America | PhRMA]] and the [[w: IFPMA | IFPMA]], two major lobby groups for the pharmaceutical industry, state that the main objectives of the pharmaceutical industry are to deliver safe and effective pharmaceuticals to patients while also maintaining profitability for its investors &lt;ref name=&quot;phrma&quot;&gt; Pharmaceutical research and manufacturers of America (2011). http://www.phrma.org/sites/default/files/159/phrma_2011_annual_report.pdf &lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name=&quot;ifpma&quot;&gt; International federation of pharmaceutical manufacturers &amp; associations: corporate brochure (2010). http://www.ifpma.org/fileadmin/content/About us/1 Welcome/IFPMA_Corporate_Brochure_LowRes[1].pdf &lt;/ref&gt;
. It is this latter part of this agenda that is often responsible for pharmaceutical misconduct.

[[File:PofesionalismWikibookZyprexa1.png|right|500px| |thumb]]
====''&lt;small&gt;The Drug Development Process&lt;/small&gt;''====
:In the United States alone, $300 billion dollars is spent annually on prescription drugs &lt;ref&gt; Huges J, Moore M, Snyder E (2002). Napsterizing Pharmaceuticals: Access, innovation, and consumer welfare. 2002 NBER Working paper &lt;/ref&gt;. With the promise of such a large market, pharmaceutical companies actively attempt to establish a larger market presence. Over the past 20 years, nearly 1900 new pharmaceuticals have been granted approval by the FDA&lt;ref name=&quot;phrma&quot;/&gt;. With a very low chance of success, the development of each one of these medicines involves significant monetary and time commitments by pharmaceutical manufacturers. Pharmaceutical companies begin with a pool of over 10,000 compounds of interest. After approximately 10 years of product testing and clinical trials, a handful are selected for in vivo evaluation. Of these handful, one or two are tested on human volunteers, with a single compound from the initial 10,000+ moving into end stage studies before being submitted for regulatory review and approval. This process requires exorbitant financial investments. Nearly $800 million is spent on average on R&amp;D alone to bring a single new drug to market&lt;ref name=&quot;phrma&quot;/&gt;. In 2009, PhRMA estimated that nearly $65.3 billion on R&amp;D by the research-based pharmaceutical industry&lt;ref name=&quot;phrma&quot;/&gt;.

====''&lt;small&gt;Questionable Practices&lt;/small&gt;''====
:To recoup the R&amp;D costs and generate profits from their discoveries, pharmaceutical manufacturers rely on patents. Currently, manufacturers of pharmaceuticals like Zyprexa have approximately 8-10 years of effective market exclusivity due to patent expirations and competition from generics &lt;ref name=&quot;ifpma&quot;/&gt;. Due to this limited period of exclusivity, pharmaceutical companies have adopted many questionable strategies to maximize profits. These strategies include competitive practices with generic manufacturers, finding loopholes in the patent system, and [[w: Ghostwriter#Medical | ghostwriting]]. However, the practice that raises the greatest ethical issues is advertising to medical professionals and consumers. Over $11 billion is spent annually by pharmaceutical companies to promote and market their products &lt;ref&gt; Wazana A (2000). Physicians and the pharmaceutical industry. Is a gift ever just a gift? JAMA, 283, pp. 373–380 &lt;/ref&gt;. In 2009, the top 20 proprietary pharmaceutical companies spent around 30% of their total revenues on marketing &lt;ref&gt; Glasgow, L J. (2001). Stretching the Limits of Intellectual Property Rights: Has the Pharmaceutical Industry Gone Too Far?, 41 IDEA 227, 250-251 &lt;/ref&gt;. A majority of this expenditure is in the form of gifts and sponsored events for physicians. Physicians often use these company sponsored events, such as the Continuing Medical Education (CME) programs to learn about new medicines &lt;ref&gt; Gagnon MA., Lexchin J. (2008). The Cost of Pushing Pills: A New Estimate of Pharmaceutical Promotion Expenditures in the United States. PLoS Med 5(1):e1.doi:10.1371/journal.pmed.0050001 &lt;/ref&gt;. As these events are sponsored and conducted by the pharmaceutical manufacturers, they provide an opportunity for these companies to falsely advertise their products. With large investments at stake and investors demanding returns, the pharmaceutical industry often exaggerates the scope and safety of their products. These false claims frequently lead to improper prescribing practices by medical practitioners and, as has been the case for Zyprexa and many other blockbuster pharmaceuticals, hundreds of thousands of injuries and deaths to patients.

==Similar Cases==
Professional ethical misconduct is not limited to pharmaceutical companies. Such examples are present in every field where a professional's actions resulted in untold damages to those who depended on them. [[Professionalism/Frederic Whitehurst and the FBI | Frederic Whitehurst and the FBI]] and the [[Professionalism/Sherron Watkins and Enron | Enron scandal]] are two such examples. In the first case, Frederic Whitehurst was an FBI agent who discovered and exposed illegal evidence manipulation in the FBI crime lab.  Likewise, Enron was an energy company that duped its investors out of billions of dollars by falsely reporting its finances.  The consequence for the professionals in these instances is the loss of trust and, accordingly, the loss of autonomy not only for themselves but also for other professionals in their field. In the case of Eli Lilly this was demonstrated by a drop in sales of Zyprexa after the scandal broke &lt;ref&gt;Brickates, Val (2007). Lily CEO: Zyprexa Sales Flat. MarketWatch http://articles.marketwatch.com/2007-03-14/news/30734464_1_zyprexa-eli-lilly-lilly-ceo &lt;/ref&gt;. Not only do these decreased sales show a lack of trust in Lilly, but also in the doctors prescribing this drug and the FDA, who approves it for general market sale. Similarly, Eli Lilly is now subject to supervision by the Office of the Inspector General as they were no longer deemed trustworthy to ethically regulate their actions. For the FBI, the loss of autonomy played out in the form of investigation and accreditation by the American Society of Crime Laboratory Directors while the consequences for Enron and Arthur Andersen were far more severe. Both companies were virtually run out of business. Moreover, their actions led to the enactment of many laws regulating auditing practices nationwide. Companies that had no part in this scandal felt the backlash.

==Diminishing Professional Trust==
All of these examples are from situations that, on the surface, are vastly different from each other, yet share a common theme. In each, there existed a group of professionals, organizations like Lilly, the FBI, and Enron, trusted by the public and, subsequently, given a certain autonomy. In each situation, these professionals failed in their duties to serve the public, resulting in deaths, wrongful convictions, or loss of billions of dollars. However, these consequences extend beyond these casualties. Such actions lead to a complete loss of trust and, therefore, autonomy for these companies and the associated professionals. From these cases it is evident that autonomy is an important, perhaps even fundamental, element of being a professional. But if this power is abused it will quickly be revoked. To keep this autonomy, professionals must be trusted. Therefore, maintaining trust is an essential part of being a true professional.

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Off Campus Housing==
Although it depends on where you desire to live, students can save money by choosing to live off campus. Colleges make money from campus housing.&lt;ref name=&quot;crystal2011&quot;&gt;“Save Money with Off Campus Housing.” Accessed February 14, 2013. http://www.budgetinginthefunstuff.com/save-money-with-off-campus-housing/.&lt;/ref&gt;  By moving off campus but continuing to share expenses with roommates, it is possible to save money. While it depends on where you choose to live and how many roommates you have, the financial savings from moving off campus can be substantial. In a calculation prepared for a college course, two students at the University of Tampa estimated that they could save almost $2,000 per year living off campus ($8,518 per year on campus with no kitchen; $6,910 per year on campus with a kitchen). Even if you have to pay rent over the summer, this can still be cheaper than on campus housing. Other estimates concur that it can be substantially cheaper to live off campus.&lt;ref name=&quot;collegeaid2013&quot;&gt;“Change of Living Situation | The University of Chicago College Admissions.” Accessed February 14, 2013. http://collegeaid.uchicago.edu/costs/livingchange.shtml.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Studying==
It may be difficult to study in your dorm room if you share a room.  This may be the case if you and your roommate(s) do not share a schedule or have different views toward studying and academic success.  If you find it difficult to study in your dorm, a good alternative is the library, where patrons are required to be quiet.

      <text xml:space="preserve">== Sexual Health Statistics ==
As of 2008, 98% of women and 97% of men between the ages of 25-44 reported having had vaginal intercourse, 89% of women and 90% of men reported having had oral sex with an opposite sex partner, and 36% of women and 44% of men reported having had anal sex with an opposite sex partner. Onset of sexual activity begins after age 15, and by age 24 most people have had sex.  Attending college slightly reduces the odds of having had any form of sex compared to those with no high school diploma, but not substantially.&lt;ref name=&quot;NHSR2008&quot;&gt;Sexual behavior, sexual attraction, and sexual identity in the United States: data from the 2006- 2008 National Survey of Family Growth.” National Health Statistics Reports (36):1-36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Women are twice as likely as men to have had any type of sex with the same sex. For women aged 18 – 19 years old, 90% identified themselves as heterosexual, 1.9% homosexual, and 5.8% bisexual. For males of the same age, 96% said they were heterosexual, 1.6% homosexual, and 1.1% bisexual.

==Sexual Dangers ==
Individuals who engaged in riskier sex - sex with a non-intimate person, sex without a condom, and casual sex - in high school are likely to continue to engage in riskier sex in college, as most social behavior does not change in this transition.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey2008&quot;&gt;Bailey, Jennifer A., Charles B. Fleming, Jessica N. Henson, Richard F. Catalano, and Kevin P.  Haggerty. 2008. “Sexual Risk Behavior 6 Months Post-High School: Associations with College Attendance, Living with a Parent, and Prior Risk Behavior.” Journal of Adolescent Health 42(6):573-579 Web. 13 Mar. 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  These behaviors are riskier because they increase the odds of both sexually transmitted infections and sexual violence.  According to one recent survey, about 64% of college students engage in these types of risky behaviors.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bailey2008&quot;/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Acceptance Rates==
Acceptance rates for universities vary substantially depending on a number of factors. To begin with, there are some characteristics of universities that influence acceptance rates, including the number of applicants the university receives for admission, as well as the university's size, location, and reputation.  On the other side, there are a number of characteristics of students that influence their odds of being accepted at a university, including: [[w:Grade (education)|GPA]], [[w:Standardized test|standardized test scores]], and involvement in extracurricular activities. In the United States, acceptance rates range from 4% to 100%. At a mid-sized urban university in Florida, the University of Tampa, the acceptance rate is approximately 57.3%.&lt;ref name=&quot;USNews&quot;&gt;US News and World Report http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/university-of-tampa-1538&lt;/ref&gt; Just because colleges need students, doesn’t mean that getting in is easy. There is some evidence to suggest that enrollment in colleges is becoming more difficult and competitive as more people are choosing to go to college.&lt;ref name=&quot;Petersons&quot;&gt;http://www.petersons.com/college-search/college-admission-requirements-competitive.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Competition===
One reason why it is becoming increasingly difficult to gain admittance to universities, particularly the most elite universities, is because of international competition.  For instance, there are some elite high schools in South Korea that are geared toward preparing their students to gain admission to [[w:Ivy League|Ivy League]] universities in the US.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dillon2008&quot;&gt;Dillon, Sam. 2008. Elite Korean Schools, Forging Ivy League Skills. New York Times. http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/27/world/asia/27seoul.html&lt;/ref&gt; The appeal of an Ivy League education in South Korea is quite high. Students attending these school study fifteen hours a day and take extremely challenging classes.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dillon2008&quot;/&gt; On top of the heavy academic workload, students still find time to squeeze in extracurriculars and clubs in order to boost their extracurricular transcripts.  One of these schools, [[w:Daewon Foreign Language High School|Daewon Foreign Language High School]], is known for being particularly grueling. All but a few of the graduates go on to Ivy League colleges. Over 100,000 Korean students are currently studying at American Universities.&lt;ref name=&quot;Dillon2008&quot;/&gt; Because of the Korean obsession with Ivy League schools, Korean applications to American schools have significantly increased over the years, increasing the competition for admission to these schools for students from the US.

      <text xml:space="preserve">At many colleges and universities across the US, safety is a prominent concern. In 1990, the Clery Act was passed to make it a requirement for schools to release all information regarding crime in the surrounding area. This act made it easy for people to see the safety of schools before committing to a university with high crime rates in the area. The act has encouraged universities to be more open about criminal activity in the surrounding area. Many universities now send emails to all students, faculty, and staff whenever a criminal act occurs in the immediate vicinity of the university. Despite the increased efforts of colleges and universities to make this information available, there is some evidence that students either do not pay attention to it or do not take it all that seriously.  Forty percent of students report receiving a crime report in an admissions packet, but 81% weren't sure if incoming students looked at the report when deciding on a school and only 6% said they thought students use it.&lt;ref name=&quot;Steven2005&quot;&gt;Steven, M. J., &amp; Plummer, E. (2005). The clery act, campus safety and the views of assault victim advocates. College Student Affairs Journal, 25(1), 116-130. &lt;/ref&gt;

To facilitate campus safety and security, many schools have a fully-functional police force, as well as victim advocate programs, criminal activity alerts, and sensor activated and restricted access dorms. As much effort as schools put towards safety, some of the responsibility does fall on the student. Many students are taking personal steps to insure their safety, including: traveling with another person around campus, not staying out late, and staying in safer parts of the surrounding town or city. 

==Sexual Assault==
While college campuses are generally quite safe, a concern female students, in particular, face is sexual assault.  There are a variety of situations that increase the risks of sexual assault, and women should be aware of these (though of course victims are never responsible when such an assault takes place).  For instance, accepting a ride with a male acquaintance, leaving a drink unattended at a bar or party, or allowing someone else to pour or buy you a drink can be risky situations as someone could take advantage of those situations to assault or drug someone.  Some research suggests that female students do not perceive these as being risky.&lt;ref name=&quot;Crawford2008&quot;&gt;Crawford, Emily, Margaret O’Dougherty Wright, and Zachary Birchmeier. 2008. “Drug-Facilitated Sexual Assault: College Women’s Risk Perception and Behavioral Choices.” Journal of American College Health 57(3):261-272.&lt;/ref&gt;  While most women recognized the risks associated with having someone else pour them a drink, many did not recognize the risk of leaving a drink unattended.  Additional education on college campuses about behaviors that may leave women open to these risks is warranted.  While the perpetrators are at fault, until women are no longer at risk of victimization they should consider taking precautions.

      <comment>/* Effective Studying Methods */</comment>
      <text xml:space="preserve">A notable difference between college and high school is that college professors don't simply provide answers and they seldom provide study guides. All the information needed for success in college is available to students, but one of a student's many responsibilities is to utilize all available resources to learn the information. That means studying.  If you didn't have to study to do well in high school, you are likely in for a surprise in college.

==Effective Studying Methods==
A growing body of research examines effective study methods.  Two common approaches are practicing retrieval and concept mapping.  In [[w:retrieval practice|retrieval practice]], students read the study material and then recall the information. This is an active cue driven form of studying.  [[w:Concept mapping|Concept mapping]], which is an elaborative study method, involves students enriching material they are studying by creating associations between the concepts within an organized structure.  At least one study suggests that retrieval practice results in better long-term retention, an improvement of over 50% over concept mapping.&lt;ref name=&quot;Karpicke2011&quot;&gt;Karpicke, Jeffrey D., and Janell R. Blunt. 2011. “Retrieval Practice Produces More Learning than Elaborative Studying with Concept Mapping.” Science 331(6018):772 -775.&lt;/ref&gt;  Interestingly, students were under the impression that they would retain more through concept mapping. This research supports the idea that retrieval practice promotes meaningful learning of complex concepts commonly seen in the sciences. Concept maps could be made in the absence of learning materials, making it a function of retrieval rather than elaborative studying, and the nature of an activity determines the extent of the learning; this needs to be taken into consideration when educational activities are devised. According to the article, “During elaboration, subjects attain detailed representations of encoded knowledge by enriching or increasing the number of encoded features. But during retrieval, subjects use retrieval cues to reconstruct what happened… in free recall, subjects must establish an organizational retrieval structure and then discriminate and recover individual concepts within that structure… the act of reconstructing knowledge itself enhances learning.”

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Undergraduate vs. Graduate school==
Choosing your undergraduate university based on whether or not it has a graduate program in an area you are considering pursuing may not be the best choice. Whether or not you get accepted into graduate school is not really based on where you receive your undergraduate degree, but what you do to set yourself apart from other students applying for the same graduate degree program. Also, undergraduate students often change their majors.  Thus, if you choose a program because it has graduate program X and you end up switching to major Y, your decision to attend that university based on the graduate program could become a problem.  Finally, universities with graduate programs often have faculty who are more focused on teaching graduate students and doing research than on teaching undergraduates, so you may not get many opportunities to work with those professors, even if they are well-known scholars.

== Why consider graduate school? ==
You should only consider graduate school if you are very dedicated to a chosen career path and realize that it is going to take a very long time and a lot of hard work to pursue that career.  Graduate school is extremely challenging.

If you're considering graduate school based on any of the following reasons, you may want to reconsider:&lt;ref name=&quot;agre1996&quot;&gt;http://polaris.gseis.ucla.edu/pagre/grad-school.html&lt;/ref&gt;
*you don't know what else to do with your life
*you &quot;kind of&quot; like a topic
*you think it would be cool to have a PhD
*you don't want to disappoint your parents
*you did well as an undergraduate

== Increasing the odds of getting in ==
If you're still interested in graduate school, take some time to talk to professors who work in the field you are interested in. Try to find a general understanding of what it would be like to work in that field and see if you are truly interested in pursuing that career choice. Be sure to ask the advice of various people so you aren’t given biased information, and really think about whether graduate school is the right course of action for you. It is a long, hard, five to seven year process that is not suited for everyone. 

There are also some things you can do to increase the odds of getting in:&lt;ref name=&quot;jmu&quot;&gt;http://www.jmu.edu/socanth/anth/wm_library/So_you_want_to_go_to_grad_school.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*gain valuable experience in your field by working directly with a professor
*maintain a competitive GPA
*network with people in the field
*make connections with your professors, as you'll need letters of recommendation

      <text xml:space="preserve">==Financial Aid and Persistence==
Many students receiving financial aid are underfunded.  One study found that students in Ohio had uncovered needs of $1,400 or more per year, making it difficult to complete their education.&lt;ref name=&quot;Bettinger2004&quot;&gt;Bettinger, Eric. 2004. “How Financial Aid Affects Persistence.” National Bureau of Economic Research Working Paper Series No. 10242. Retrieved (http://www.nber.org/papers/w10242).&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that financial aid, particularly more comprehensive financial aid, reduces dropping out and increases persistence and retention in college.  

==Financial Aid==
One of the biggest factors inhibiting college attendance is the price tag, both of credit hours and all the extras, like textbooks. Some donors make it possible for people coming from less affluent families to attend college but sometimes even with this financial aid, college is still impossible. The US Government, through the Free Application for Federal Student Aid, or FAFSA, offers financial aid through grants and loans. The FAFSA can be challenging to complete, but many high school counselors are now learning how to complete it, and more often than not, the counselor at the college you are interested in would be more than happy to help you. 66% of all undergraduates going to college received some sort of financial aid from the government.&lt;ref name=&quot;UT2012&quot;&gt;&quot;Financial Aid.&quot; UT by the NUMBERS. The University of Tampa. Web. 13 Mar. 2012. &lt;http://www.ut.edu/financialaid/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Education noted that for the year 2007-2008, “For those who received any aid, the total average amount received was $9,100.”&lt;ref name=&quot;USDofE&quot;&gt;U.S. Department of Education, National Center for Education Statistics. (2009). 2007-08 National Postsecondary Student Aid Study (NPSAS: 08) Student Financial Aid Estimates for 2007- 08, Selected Findings.&lt;/ref&gt; This number only reflects what was awarded through the FAFSA. Many high school and college students fail to apply for any outside scholarships, or those awarded to students that meet qualifications, like good leaders, excellent grades, or minority status. 

==Student Loans and Debt==
Recent studies have shown that the amount of student debt accumulated by college students has gone up in recent years. According to The Project on Student Debt at the Institute for College Access and Success, students who graduated from college in 2010 with student loans owed an average of $25,250, up 5 percent from the previous year. &lt;ref name=StudentDebt2010&gt;&quot;Student Debt and the Class of 2010.&quot; Institute for College Access and Success: Project on Student Debt. n.d. Web. 5 Feb. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;  About two-thirds of the class of 2010 graduated with student debt, though the debt examined in the report does not include loans taken out by parents. The report is based on data from more than 1,000 colleges, representing half of all public and private nonprofit four-year schools. The average amount of debt would be even higher if the report included profit-making schools, where almost all students take out loans and, according to federal data, borrow about 45 percent more than students at nonprofits.&lt;ref name=&quot;StudentDebt2010&quot;/&gt; In a survey of more than 1,000 colleges, 98 colleges said their 2010 graduating class owed an average of more than $35,000, and 73 colleges reported that more than 90% of students graduated with some amount of debt. It’s estimated that two-thirds of college seniors who graduated in 2010 had student loan debt.&lt;ref name=Blake2011&gt;Ellis, Blake. &quot;Average Student Loan Debt Tops $25,000.&quot; CNNMoney. CNN. 3 Nov. 2011. Web. 5 Feb. 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; High-debt states are concentrated in the Northeast and Midwest, while low-debt states are mainly in the West.
